(https://bit.ly/3lLi8wY)Facebook said the hacking group used fake Facebook accounts to pose as fictitious journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the Uighur community to build trust with their targets and trick them into clicking malicious links.It said hackers both set up malicious websites using look-alike domains for popular Uighur and Turkish news sites and compromised legitimate websites visited by the targets. Facebook also found websites created by the group to mimic third-party Android app stores with Uighur-themed apps, like a prayer app and dictionary app, containing malware.Facebook said its investigation found two Chinese companies, Beijing Best United Technology Co Ltd (Best Lh) and Dalian 9Rush Technology Co Ltd (9Rush) had developed the Android tooling deployed by the group.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Facebook's report. Beijing routinely denies allegations of cyber espionage.Reuters was not immediately able to locate contact information for Dalian 9Rush Technology Co Ltd. A man who answered the number listed for Beijing Best United Technology Co Ltd hung up.Facebook said it had removed the group's accounts, which numbered less than 100, and had blocked the sharing of the malicious domains and was notifying people it believed were targets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-hackers-used-facebook-to-target-uighurs-abroad-101616609605379.html
24-03-2021||World||US states ask Facebook, Twitter to do more to stop Covid-19 anti-vaxxers||Attorneys general for 12 US states on Wednesday accused Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc of doing too little to stop people from using their platforms to spread false information that coronavirus vaccines are unsafe.In a letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the Democratic attorneys general said "anti-vaxxers" lacking medical expertise and often motivated by financial gain have used the platforms to downplay the danger of Covid-19 and exaggerate the risks of vaccination.They called on both companies to enforce their own community guidelines by removing or flagging vaccine misinformation.The letter said anti-vaxxers control 65% of public anti-vaccine content on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and have more than 59 million followers on those platforms and Google's YouTube.It also said some misinformation targets Blacks and other communities of color where vaccination rates are lagging."Given anti-vaxxers' reliance on your platforms, you are uniquely positioned to prevent the spread of misinformation about coronavirus vaccines that poses a direct threat to the health and safety of millions of Americans in our states and that will prolong our road to recovery," the letter said.Facebook spokeswoman Dani Lever said the company has removed millions of pieces of Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation, and tries to combat "vaccine hesitancy" by regularly directing users to reliable information from health authorities.Twitter said it has removed more than 22,400 tweets in connection with its policy toward Covid-19 posts, and prioritizes removing content that could cause "real-world" harm.Wednesday's letter was signed by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia.Zuckerman, Dorsey and Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google parent Alphabet Inc, are scheduled to testify on Thursday before two House of Representatives subcommittees about combating online disinformation.The coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 124 million people worldwide, and caused more than 2.7 million deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-ask-facebook-twitter-to-do-more-to-stop-covid-19-antivaxxers-101616609583321.html
24-03-2021||World||Following talks, India, Canada set roadmap for engagement||In a sign of thaw in bilateral ties, foreign office consultations were held on Wednesday, more than three months after they were cancelled following remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on protests over three farm laws in India.India’s vaccine diplomacy too has played a key role in achieving this breakthrough as Serum Institute of India has supplied Canada with 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccine.The consultations, held virtually, were chaired by secretary (east) in India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA) Riva Ganguly Das and Canada’s deputy minister of foreign affairs Marta Morgan.In a tweet following the discussions, India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria, said they “reviewed the breadth and depth of ties, aligned visions and set roadmap for engagement”.MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi also tweeted that they “reviewed cooperation across sectors and discussed steps to strengthen bilateral collaboration further”.The consultations were scheduled for December 15 last year but were cancelled after Trudeau’s comments, with the official reason given that the timing was inconvenient. During a Facebook Live event on November 30 for a virtual celebration of Gurpurab, the 551th birth anniversary of the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev, Trudeau said, “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the news coming out of India about the protests by farmers. The situation is concerning.”He added, “Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.” That attracted a strong reaction from the MEA and Canadian high commissioner to New Delhi Nadir Patel was summoned to the ministry and a demarche, a formal diplomatic protest over Trudeau’s remarks conveyed to him.Ties, however, improved after Trudeau called Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February with a request for India-made Covid-19 vaccines. The Indian PM then took to Twitter saying he “was happy to receive a call from my friend, @JustinTrudeau” and added, “assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of Covid vaccines sought by Canada”.Since then, an agreement was reached to supply 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield. The first tranche of the vaccine, 500,000 doses, arrived in Canada on March 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/following-talks-india-canada-set-roadmap-for-engagement-101616609358202.html
24-03-2021||World||US, Europe, NATO close ranks to counter 'aggressive' China||The United States and countries around Europe are closing ranks to respond to “aggressive and coercive” behavior by China, days after the US and its allies launched coordinated sanctions against Chinese officials accused of rights abuses in the far-western Xinjiang region.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that he wants to work with the US's partners on “how to advance our shared economic interests and to counter some of China's aggressive and coercive actions, as well as its failures, at least in the past, to uphold its international commitments.”Blinken spoke after talks in Brussels with NATO foreign ministers. He will also raise the tense state of relations with China in talks later Wednesday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.“When we are acting together, we are much stronger and much more effective than if any single one of us is doing it alone,” Blinken said. He noted that alone the US accounts for about 25% of global GDP, but up to 60% with its allies in Europe and Asia. “That's a lot harder for Beijing to ignore,” he said.On Monday, the US, EU, Britain and Canada imposed asset freezes and travel bans on a group of officials in Xinjiang. China retaliated by slapping sanctions on 10 Europeans, including lawmakers and academics, and four institutions. Beijing said they had damaged China's interests and “maliciously spread lies and disinformation.”Initially, China denied the existence of camps detaining Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang but has since described them as centers to provide job training and to re-educate those exposed to extremists. Chinese officials deny all charges of human rights abuses there.Blinken said in a speech at NATO that Beijing's retaliatory sanctions “make it all the more important that we stand firm and stand together, or risk sending the message that bullying works.”But views on the way that business and trade should play out differ across the Atlantic.The EU is China's biggest trading partner but they are also economic competitors. As Beijing has become more assertive in recent years, the 27-nation bloc has struggled to balance its commercial interests with a country that it sees as “a systemic rival” and has human rights concerns about.The two sealed a major investment agreement in December giving European businesses about the same level of market access in China as those from the United States. It was announced just weeks before President Joe Biden took office and raised some concerns that the Europeans were undercutting Biden's leverage as he looked to take a tougher line on China.But Blinken said “the United States won't force our allies into an us-or-them' choice with China." He warned of Beijing's threatening behavior, but said “that doesn't mean countries can't work with China where possible, for example on challenges like climate change and health security.”In terms of China's military aggressiveness, Blinken noted its "efforts to threaten freedom of navigation, to militarize the South China Sea, to target countries throughout the Indo-Pacific with increasingly sophisticated military capabilities. Beijing's military ambitions are growing by the year.”NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance does not “regard China as an adversary, but of course the rise of China has direct consequences for our security.” He noted that China is investing heavily in military equipment, including nuclear-capable missiles.“More importantly, China is a country that doesn't share our values. We see that in the way they deal with democratic protests in Hong Kong, how they suppress minorities in their own country, the Uyghurs, and also how they actually try to undermine the international rules-based order,” Stoltenberg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-nato-close-ranks-to-counter-aggressive-china-101616607540373.html
24-03-2021||World||EU sharpens Covid vaccine export rules as third wave of infections rises||The European Union refined its rules on the export of Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday, giving it a clearer right to block shipments to countries such as Britain with higher inoculation rates and to those not exporting their own vaccine doses.The move risks stoking post-Brexit tensions with London, which has warned Brussels against "vaccine nationalism".EU trade chief Dombrovskis told a news conference the export authorisation mechanism was not targeting any specific country.The European Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 27 EU members, set out a proposal expanding existing measures that seek to ensure planned exports by drugmakers do not threaten already reduced EU supply.The granting of export licences will be based on reciprocity and "proportionality" - the epidemiological situation, vaccination rate and access to vaccines in the destination country.EU officials say export restrictions could also kick in if companies do respect quarterly contracts but backload supplies at the end of the period.Dombrovskis said the new rules did not create a detailed algorithm on authorisations and requests would be considered on a case-by-case basis.The scheme will also widen the net to include 17 neighbouring countries, including Israel, Norway and Switzerland. Previously exempted, exports to these countries will also need authorisation.ALARMING THIRD WAVEThe proposal is set to be a topic of discussion on Thursday at an online summit of EU leaders, whose countries are struggling with a third wave of infections that has prompted harder lockdowns amid a slow rollout of vaccines.EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the situation in many EU countries was "alarming", with increasing cases in 19 EU members and rising fatalities in eight.While France, Germany and Italy broadly support tighter export curbs on those who do not reciprocate, countries including the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland are more cautious about cutting off Britain.A French presidential adviser said the EU should be not be a sort of "useful idiot" in the battle against the virus.Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said any EU restrictions on vaccine exports would be a "retrograde step".A UK government spokesperson said all countries were fighting the same pandemic and that Britain would continue to work with European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout.The Commission insists it is not an export ban and says priority systems set up for vaccinating citizens in other countries are de facto bans even if they are not called that.The bloc said it had exported 43 million doses to 33 countries since the end of January, including 10.9 million to Britain. Some 380 export requests were granted and only one was blocked - from Italy to Australia.The EU has so far authorised four Covid-19 vaccines. AstraZeneca doses were supposed to be the vaccination for the masses, but deliveries have and will be far lower than initially indicated.EU countries have given dose to about 10% of their adult populations and have watched Britain provide at least one vaccination to over half of all adults, suffering almost no delivery problems, despite the same plants officially supplying both.The Commission proposal will come into force unless a "qualified majority" of EU members oppose it, which is very unlikely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sharpens-covid-vaccine-export-rules-as-third-wave-of-infections-rises-101616607009859.html

He was arrested as he returned to Russia from Germany in January where he had been recovering from what doctors said was a nerve agent poisoning.Navalny began experiencing serious back pain last week, felt a numbness in his leg and was unable to stand on it, according to close ally Leonid Volkov, who said that Navalny had only been given two pills of Ibuprofen in response.Volkov said that Navalny's lawyers Olga Mikhailova and Vadim Kobzev had tried to visit him for a meeting scheduled at 1000 GMT on Wednesday, but had not been allowed in all day.Kobzev, one of the lawyers, confirmed he had been denied access which he said was unacceptable.Navalny is being held in a prison camp in the Vladimir region around 100 km (62 miles) east of Moscow.Speaking by phone from outside the camp, Kobzev told Reuters that Navalny's lawyers had visited him on a daily basis while he was in custody in the Vladimir region and that Wednesday was the first time they had not been allowed to see him.The federal prison service and the regional one in Vladimir did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Navalny's lawyers said prison officials had told them it was not possible to visit their client due to unspecified security measures.Volkov said it was possible Navalny had been moved to the prison hospital and that the facility's administration was trying to hide that fact."Given all of the circumstances known to us, the sharp deterioration of his health can only cause extreme concern," said Volkov.Navalny's allies have held protests calling for his release and on Tuesday announced plans to stage what they hope will be the biggest anti-Kremlin street protest in modern Russian history this spring, in a new push to win his freedom.The authorities say such protests are illegal.The West has demanded Russia release Navalny, something Moscow has called unacceptable interference in its internal affairs.Russian authorities say they have seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned and have suggested he is a Western puppet sent back to try to destabilise the political situation in Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/allies-of-kremlin-critic-navalny-raise-alarm-over-his-health-after-lawyers-denied-prison-access-101616606562290.html

Authorities say they found a gun where the shooting happened, at a gas station on the east side of the city.Frankie Jennings, 32, who is Black, was pronounced dead at the scene. No law enforcement members were hurt.The police department said none of its officers were involved in the attempted arrest but that its detectives are investigating what happened.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Thomas W. Hildebrand, a spokesman, referred questions about the deputy marshal who shot Jennings and the charges Jennings faced to the Marshals Service. Marshals Service officials did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.Mourners later gathered at the scene for a candlelight vigil. News footage showed several dozen people attending. Mourners brought flowers and balloons, and noted that Jennings was shot on his birthday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deputy-us-marshal-shoots-kills-man-while-attempting-arrest-101616606341981.html

"That would probably require, as we would presume, further studies of the team, maybe travel to China or further discussions."The probe was plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington, which under former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak.Some team members have said China was reluctant to share vital data that could show the virus was circulating months earlier than first recognised in late 2019.Ben Embarek, a WHO official leading the mission, said at a press briefing marking the end of the visit that the virus probably originated in bats, although it was not certain how it reached humans. He also effectively ruled out a lab leak.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later said that "all hypotheses remain open" and pledged full transparency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-who-report-on-virus-origins-based-on-science-us-101616606376372.html
24-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca says 29 million Covid-19 doses in Italy for EU, poorer countries||AstraZeneca said on Wednesday that some 29 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines found in an inspection at a plant in Italy were destined for the EU and for donations to poorer countries via the COVAX scheme co-led by the World Health Organization.At the request of the European Commission, Italian security forces inspected a Catalent factory in Anagni, near Rome, at the weekend and found the store of vaccine doses, according to Italian newspaper La Stampa. An Italian official later confirmed the report of the inspection and said the doses were to be sent to Belgium.A flurry of reactions to the report reflected the level of mistrust in the EU towards the Anglo-Swedish firm, which slashed its supply target to the EU by the end of June to 100 million from 300 million envisaged in its contract with the 27-nation bloc. The 29 million doses found would be enough to vaccinate 14.5 million people."A stock of almost 30 million doses has been identified near Rome during an inspection we put in place. It has now been seized," French government spokesman Gabriel Attal told reporters after a cabinet meeting. "The EU won't be the fall guy of vaccinations."EU lawmaker Peter Liese, from the same party as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said the report left him speechless, and he urged AstraZeneca to clarify the situation.Later on Wednesday, AstraZeneca said that most of the doses in the Catalent plant were for the EU, and the rest were for poorer countries supplied by the COVAX scheme co-led by the World Health Organization."There are no exports currently planned other than to COVAX countries. There are 13 million doses of vaccine waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to COVAX," the company said.The remaining 16 million will be shipped to Europe this month and in April, it said.Mario Gargiulo, Regional Biologics President for Europe at Catalent, told Reuters that having 29 million doses in the Anagni factory was in line with normal procedure and that the company often had more there.The European Commission declined to comment on the doses at the Anagni factory.Earlier on Wednesday, UNICEF said on behalf of the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility that the projected deliveries of vaccines to all countries, including Vietnam, had to be delayed due to production delays.HALIXAn EU official said some of the doses at the Catalent plant might come from a vaccine factory in the Netherlands run by AstraZeneca's subcontractor Halix.The Anagni plant is in charge of bottling AstraZeneca vaccines produced at the Halix factory and also at a plant in Belgium run by subcontractor Thermo Fisher Scientific.AstraZeneca said that the factory also bottles doses received from outside the EU and to be shipped to COVAX countries.Both vaccine-making factories in Belgium and the Netherlands are listed in the contract AstraZeneca signed with the EU in August as suppliers to the EU.However, the Halix factory has not yet been approved in the EU, as AstraZeneca did not submit sufficient data to the EU drugs regulator. It has also not been approved in Britain.Vaccines produced there cannot be used in the EU until that approval is received, which AstraZeneca and EU officials said they expected in the coming days.It is unclear why AstraZeneca did not seek earlier approval for the factory. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker declined to comment on that point.Halix is also listed as a supplier for Britain, which is urging the EU to allow the shipment of doses produced there. Britain has so far exported no AstraZeneca vaccines to the EU, despite two UK plants being listed in the EU contract as suppliers for the bloc.Halix said it started producing vaccines for the EU in December and has a capacity to produce about 5 million doses per month. The company declined to comment on how many vaccines it had already produced or on their destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-says-29-million-covid-19-doses-in-italy-for-eu-poorer-countries-101616605953044.html

The chief executives of Google and Twitter will also testify at the hearing.Google's Sundar Pichai will make suggestions to reform the law but, unlike Zuckerberg, will not advocate for adoption of a set of best practices, according to his testimony. Twitter's Jack Dorsey will lay out steps the platform has taken to tackle misinformation.Zuckerberg and Pichai will also urge caution as Congress considers reforming the law."Platforms should not be held liable if a particular piece of content evades its detection -- that would be impractical for platforms with billions of posts per day," Zuckerberg wrote in his testimony.Google's Pichai also struck a similar note saying "without Section 230, platforms would either over-filter content or not be able to filter content at all."Pichai instead proposed solutions such as developing content policies that are clear and accessible, notifying people when their content is removed and giving them ways to appeal content decisions.There are several pieces of legislation from Democrats to reform Section 230 that are doing the rounds in Congress. Several Republican lawmakers have also been pushing separately to scrap the law entirely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sundar-pichai-mark-zuckerberg-suggest-ways-to-reform-key-internet-law-101616605798078.html
24-03-2021||World||Serum CEO Adar Poonawalla rents London mansion for $69,000 a week: Report||The head of the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer agreed to rent a property in Mayfair for about 50,000 pounds ($69,000) a week, a record for the exclusive London neighborhood, according to two people with knowledge of the transaction.Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer at the Serum Institute of India Ltd., is leasing the home on one of the district’s best roads from Polish billionaire Dominika Kulczyk, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deal is confidential.The mansion is one of the largest residences in the neighborhood and measures about 25,000 square feet (2,322 square meters), the equivalent of about 24 average English homes. The property also comes with an adjoining guest house and backs onto one of Mayfair’s “secret gardens,” which are only accessible to residents.A spokesperson for the Serum Institute declined to comment on behalf of Poonawalla. A spokesperson for Kulczyk declined to comment.The deal will be a boost for the luxury homes market in central London, which has been hit by a combination of Brexit and the pandemic. Rents have fallen by 9.2% in the past five years in Mayfair, according to LonRes, a property data company.There’s been a “massive increase” in demand for staffing from wealthy clients renting properties in London and the English countryside because they are upscaling or want a home with a bigger garden, according to Elaine Braid, chief executive officer at Poppy Lane Placements, a boutique agency supplying staff to luxury private homes.Poonawalla, who is currently spearheading the production of millions of doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine, has long had links to the UK and studied at London’s University of Westminster. The businessman previously failed in a bid to buy the Grosvenor Hotel in Mayfair and turn part of it into a home.Britain is “definitely a place I would want a second home,” he told Bloomberg News in a 2016 interview.Poonawalla is part of one of the world’s richest families, which has a $15 billion fortune, the bulk of it derived from the vaccine maker, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The stamp duty sales tax, which is higher for overseas purchasers and owners of multiple homes, may be deterring wealthy people from buying London properties, said Fred Scarlett, a director at luxury homes developer Clivedale London. An additional levy on buyers based abroad is being introduced next month.“If you are buying a house on a two- to 10-year play, then a lot of overseas buyers will scratch their heads and think why am I paying all this tax, why not just rent?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/serum-ceo-adar-poonawalla-rents-london-mansion-for-69-000-a-week-report-101616604403939.html

The only Nordic member of the euro zone made the decision just one day after the European Medicines Agency declared the drug safe and effective.Finland, with a population of 5.5 million, is expecting to receive 3.7 million doses of Astra’s vaccine, equal to roughly a quarter of the approved vaccines it has ordered through the European Union’s procurement process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-to-resume-astrazeneca-doses-for-people-over-65-from-next-week-101616602527419.html
24-03-2021||World||Congress questions Texas officials about power grid failure||Congress is looking into last month’s massive and deadly power outages across Texas and questioning officials who oversee the state’s energy industry and electric grid.A House Energy Committee was scheduled Wednesday to hear from Bill Magness, the outgoing CEO of the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and Christi Craddick, chair of the Texas Railroad Commission.In written testimony submitted before the hearing, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said the Texas grid was designed for peak summer heat, and policymakers wrongly believed that a 2011 severe winter storm that caused outages was an anomaly.Turner said state leaders assumed that a pricing system that rewards power companies for generating when electricity is in high demand would compel those companies to be prepared for the next big winter storm.“It did not happen,” he said. “The magnitude of the damages was foreseeable and preventable.”For nearly a week in mid-February, most of the state suffered through subfreezing temperatures. Millions lost power and heat. When pipes burst and water systems shut down, Texans were told to boil water for drinking — if they still had a way to boil water.An early count by state officials puts the death toll from the week at 57, but that is likely a wide undercount. Some of the largest counties, including Bexar, where San Antonio is located, and Travis, home to Austin, have not reported figures yet.Power from natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind and solar sources all dropped during the storm. Grid officials said critical gas-fired plants shut down for lack of fuel.In his written testimony, Magness repeated what he has already told the Texas Legislature: At its peak the storm took out nearly half the grid’s power-generating capacity, and ERCOT had no choice but to order rolling outages to prevent long-lasting damage to electric infrastructure. That kind of blackout might have taken weeks to repair, he said.Christi Craddick of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state’s energy industry, defended her agency and the natural gas operators it oversees.Craddick said gas wells shut down simply because they didn’t have power, and she called gas producers heroes who were critical in restoring power. In her written testimony, Craddick did not mention any need for protecting wells from extreme winter weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-questions-texas-officials-about-power-grid-failure-101616601767711.html
24-03-2021||World||Republicans plan Senate floor 'fireworks' over surge at US-Mexico border||Republicans plan to take their opposition to President Joe Biden's border policies to the US Senate floor on Wednesday, attempting to move legislation that promises to tie up the chamber for hours, a source familiar with the matter said.At least five Senate Republicans are expected to seek unanimous consent for a series of measures targeting Biden's decision to reverse the border policies of former President Donald Trump, including a resolution labeling the current border situation a "crisis."The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the actions could lead to some rhetorical "fireworks" on the Senate floor if Democrats block the measures, as expected. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office was not immediately available to comment on Democratic plans.The anticipated actions are part of a mounting effort by Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives to pressure Biden and his fellow Democrats over a new flood of migrants, including unaccompanied children, to the US-Mexico border. Republicans see an opportunity to retaliate against Democrats, who sharply criticized Trump's border policies, ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.A sharp rise in the number of migrants fleeing violence, natural disasters and economic hardship in Central America is testing Biden's commitment to a more humane immigration policy than his predecessor's.Republicans say Biden's decision to reverse Trump's policies has given migrants an incentive to take the journey north and contend it poses health and security risks for American citizens.Republicans are moving to capitalize on what Reuters/Ipsos polling shows to be an increasingly hostile attitude toward illegal immigrants among party voters. A Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday also showed that 48% of Democrats believe the United States is facing a "problem" with illegal immigration.Details about the Republican measures to be offered on Wednesday were not immediately available.

He will appear in county court in Boulder at 8:15 a.m. (1415 GMT), according to court records.The massacre was the country's second mass shooting in a week, after another gunman shot eight people to death at three Atlanta-area day spas on March 16.The twin attacks prompted President Joe Biden to call on Congress to strengthen gun restrictions. Legislation to bolster background checks and ban certain semi-automatic rifles has stalled amid Republican opposition.Police have not yet publicly identified a motive for the killings. Alissa's 34-year-old brother described him as antisocial and paranoid in an interview with the Daily Beast.The suspect's sister-in-law told police on Monday evening that he had been "playing with" a firearm she described as resembling a "machine gun" two days earlier, upsetting family members, according to an arrest affidavit filed by police in the case.The gunman arrived at the King Soopers store armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle and a handgun and wearing a tactical vest, according to the affidavit.The affidavit also said law enforcement databases show that six days earlier Alissa purchased a Ruger AR-556 pistol, a weapon that resembles a semi-automatic rifle.Alissa, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Syria who graduated from Arvada West High School in 2018, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault for punching a classmate in late 2017.The classmate said the attack was unprovoked, an account supported by interviews with several witnesses, according to an Arvada Police Department incident report. Alissa told an officer the classmate had called him a "terrorist" and racist names.Alissa was sentenced to probation and community service.The 10 victims on Monday included Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder police force who was among the first officers on the scene. Talley, 51, was a father of seven who had been looking for less dangerous work, according to his father.Also killed were Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Teri Leiker, 51; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65. Stong, Olds and Leiker worked at the store.Witnesses told police the assailant killed one man in his vehicle and then gunned down another in the parking lot. The shooter stood over him, firing multiple times, before entering the store to continue the rampage.When apprehended, Alissa did not answer questions but asked to speak with his mother, according to the affidavit.Makeshift memorials of flowers, votive candles and condolence messages sprang up this week outside the supermarket and at police headquarters.Colorado has seen some of the most shocking episodes of gun violence in US history, including the 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora and the 1999 rampage at Columbine High School, near Littleton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-mass-shooting-suspect-to-make-initial-court-appearance-on-thursday-101616600320854.html
24-03-2021||World||Chinese threat to Taiwan 'closer than most think': top US admiral||China is quickly amassing weapons and systems to militarily overwhelm Taiwan, an action it could be "poised to take" within the next six years, the admiral chosen to be the next commander of US forces in the Pacific warned on Tuesday."My opinion is this problem is much closer to us than most think," Admiral John Aquilino said before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which was reviewing his nomination to lead the US military's Indo-Pacific Command, as reported by CNN.China considers establishing full control over Taiwan to be its "number one priority," added Aquilino.CNN further reported that the current head of the command, Admiral Philip Davidson, told a hearing earlier this month that China could be prepared to take Taiwan, the self-governed democratic island that Beijing claims as its sovereign territory, by force within the next six years.But Aquilino said Beijing is establishing a track record of using force to achieve Communist Party goals sooner than US planners forecast."We've seen aggressive actions earlier than we anticipated, whether it be on the Indian border or whether it be in Hong Kong or whether it be against the Uyghurs. We've seen things that I don't think we expected, and that's why I continue to talk about a sense of urgency. We ought to be prepared today," Aquilino said.According to the news outlet, Davidson, in his Senate testimony two weeks ago, said the Chinese military has built a force intended for offensive operations."I cannot for the life of me understand some of the capabilities that they're putting in the field unless it is an aggressive posture... I see them developing systems, capabilities and a posture that would indicate that they're interested in aggression," he told the Senate Armed Services Committee.Aquilino warned on Tuesday the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is sharply focused on having all it needs to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control."The military threat to Taiwan is increasing. The PLA continues to field a broad array of advanced weapons and systems as part of ongoing force modernization specifically intended to achieve decisive overmatch against Taiwan," the US admiral said in written testimony.He also said that Washington's credibility as an ally to places like Japan and the Philippines is at stake if the island were to fall to Beijing when asked by Lawmakers why the US should defend Taiwan."It would negatively impact our standing in the region if that were to happen and it would challenge the rest of our allies and partners and the US, negatively impacting our ability to operate freely in the area," he said.Aquilino also told the senators that a Chinese military presence on Taiwan would give Beijing sway over two thirds of global trade, which passes through the sea lanes near the island. "I do believe that sends a strong message that the entirety of government in the United States is focused on the challenge that we've identified as it applies to the western Pacific," Aquilino said.In a development that might irk China, United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has referred to Taiwan as "country", the term so far avoided by US officials.He made the remark during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on earlier this month on the Biden administration's foreign policy agenda. Blinken was responding to California Republican Representative Young Kim, who called on the US to include Taiwan in the upcoming Democracy Summit.The State Department used to have an unwritten policy to avoid using the word "country" when referring to the self-ruled island as part of the US commitment to Beijing's so-called "One China Policy", according to Sputnik.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing.In recent months, China has increased its military activities around Taiwan. According to China, it is responding to what it calls "collusion" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's main international backer and weapons supplier, according to CNN.In November, the US and Taiwan signed a blueprint for closer economic ties in Washington. In February, Senator Rick Scott reintroduced the Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act, sponsored by Congressman Guy Reschenthaler in the US House of Representatives, to protect Taiwan from China's growing aggression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-threat-to-taiwan-closer-than-most-think-top-us-admiral-101616595609642.html
24-03-2021||World||Myanmar citizens find ways around crackdown on internet||Sidestepping a crackdown on internet use since the military seized power almost two months ago, hundreds of thousands of protesters and citizens in Myanmar are finding different ways to communicate online, downloading tools to bypass censorship restrictions and turning to alternative media sources and underground networks, according to new research.They have moved to a mirror site of Facebook on the dark web, used apps that rely on Bluetooth technology to continue messaging each other and turned to lesser known social media platforms to stay connected, according to Recorded Future Inc., a closely held cybersecurity firm based near Boston.Myanmar citizens are following the lead of protesters in Hong Kong, Belarus and elsewhere who have found creative ways around government internet restrictions. Protesters from some of those countries are now providing guidance and support to Myanmar, and online forums are offering tips on how its citizens can stay connected.“In the history of Myanmar and all the coups they’ve experienced and all this political upheaval, it looks to be the first time the people really had this type of access to alternative platforms, and have used it to reach out to international organizations and other countries for help,” said Charity Wright, cyber threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, who has been studying the impact of the crackdown on the internet for the past month and a half.The situation in Myanmar is evolving, as the government seeks to block different types of communication and citizens try new methods. That means what’s working now to evade government restrictions may not work in the coming weeks, said Anissa Wozencraft, a Recorded Future analyst who worked with Wright on the research.Brigadier-General Zaw Min Tun, a spokesman for the military junta, told reporters in the capital, Naypyidaw, on Monday that the military had “no plan to restore mobile data at this point because some people are using the mobile internet to instigate destructive acts.”The search for alternate ways to communicate online followed a Feb. 1 military coup and arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her civilian government. The internet was temporarily shut down entirely, and now coup leaders are cutting it off from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m., according to Recorded Future and news reports from the country.The youth-led protest movement is demanding the release of civilian leaders including Suu Kyi, recognition of the 2020 election results that her party won in a landslide and the military’s removal from politics.“The junta continues its attempts to overturn the results of a democratic election by brutally repressing peaceful protesters and killing individuals who are simply demanding a say in their country’s future,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Monday.By Feb. 13, almost two weeks after the coup, internet use in Myanmar dropped to 15% of its normal traffic, according to Recorded Future. During that time, the messaging app Bridgefy was downloaded about 600,000 times, the company said, adding that the app was widely used during the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Bridgefy allows users to send offline messages to others within a certain range by using a phone’s Bluetooth.Coup leaders banned Facebook on Feb. 4, prompting a 7,200% increase in the use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, in the country that day, said Wright. Since then, only those with access to VPNs -- which encrypt internet traffic and disguise identities -- have been able to use Facebook, said a 26-year-old student, speaking to Bloomberg from Yangon. She requested anonymity for fear of being tracked and detained by the authorities.Myanmar citizens also switched to the Tor browser, which enables access to the underground internet or dark web. They scoured forums for information on how to avoid detection, Recorded Future found. When various forums indicated that the military was searching for anyone with Tor installed on their device, its usage dropped, according to the report.“Normally we don’t talk about VPN, we don’t talk about Tor, but since the coup we’ve been using them,” the student said. “I think it is partly our generation, also partly because a lot of Burmese have been to foreign countries to get educated and they were exposed to such technology.”Myanmar citizens are also getting help from beyond their own borders.Protest movements in countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong coalesced under the umbrella of the Milk Tea Alliance to show their support and to share documents and tips, including how to set up anonymous web chats, Wright said. Hacktivist organizations from around the world recommended applications that bypassed censorship restrictions, including Signal, Briar, Tails operating system and the Brave Browser, according to Recorded Future.Pro-democracy conversations about Myanmar have sprung up on Reddit and other online forums, Wright said. Among the items shared online are tips and techniques about protesting, such as how to deal with tear gas, promote events, administer first aid and stay safe.Wright and Wozencraft shared images and links in their report, but hid the identities of the protesters they studied to prevent the military from being able to track them down.The movement in Myanmar “seems like the protesters are consolidated and are one voice reaching out to everyone saying: ‘We need someone to step in on our behalf because we have no control here,’” said Wright. “They were very creative in their ways of skirting around the restrictions in a way, to find the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-citizens-find-ways-around-crackdown-on-internet-101616598698651.html
24-03-2021||World||India delays big exports of AstraZeneca vaccine as Covid-19 cases surge: Report||India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of the AstraZeneca coronavirus shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine-maker, to meet domestic demand as infections rise, two sources told Reuters.The move will also affect supplies to the GAVI/WHO-backed COVAX vaccine-sharing facility through which more than 180 countries are expected to get doses, one of the sources said.COVAX has so far received 17.7 million AstraZeneca doses from the SII, of the 60.5 million doses India has shipped in total, and many countries are relying on the programme to immunise their citizens.There have been no vaccine exports from India since Thursday, the foreign ministry's website shows, as the country expands its own immunisation effort."Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least," said one of the sources. Both sources had direct knowledge of the matter, but declined to be named as the discussions are not public."No exports, nothing till the time the India situation stabilises. The government won't take such a big chance at the moment when so many need to be vaccinated in India."India's foreign ministry and the SII did not immediately reply to requests for comment.SOME DELAYS ALREADY The SII has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca drug to Brazil, Britain, Morocco and Saudi Arabia.UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency that is procuring and distributing vaccines for COVAX, had no comment.COVAX has a deal to buy 1.1 billion doses of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots that the SII is making in bulk, mainly for low- and middle-income countries.UNICEF in Vietnam said in a statement on Wednesday that vaccine production issues had led to delays in deliveries to all countries that were due to receive vaccines through COVAX.It did not specify the origin of those delays, although Vietnam was not expected to receive doses from the SII.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet decided this week to widen its inoculation drive by including everyone above 45 from April 1, and many states battling a surge in infections have demanded that all adults be covered.With 11.7 million cases, India has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections after the United States and Brazil.Currently, only the elderly and those over 45 with other health conditions are eligible for vaccinations in India. Health and frontline workers were first in line when India began its drive in mid-January.India has so far administered more than 51 million doses, of which 47 million are the SII's locally-made version of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The rest is the COVAXIN vaccine developed in India by Bharat Biotech.The government has so far asked the SII to supply around 141 million doses. The company has also accounted for nearly all of India's vaccine exports.The SII plans to boost monthly production to 100 million doses from April/May, from up to 70 million now, Reuters reported earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-delays-big-exports-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-as-covid-19-cases-surge-report-101616599643709.html
24-03-2021||World||7 in 10 hospitalised Covid patients didn’t fully recover 5 months after discharge: Study | 10 common symptoms||The majority of individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) did not fully recover even five months after they were discharged, according to a new UK study. The researchers found that the patients continued to experience the negative impacts of the infection on their physical and mental health as well as their ability to work.The UK-wide study, led by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), analysed 1,077 Covid-19 patients who were discharged from hospitals between March and November 2020. Among the participants, 69% were white, 36% were women, with a mean age of 58, and 50% had at least two co-morbidities.According to the study, only 29% of the participants felt fully recovered at follow-up after five months and 20% reported a new disability. Those who have the most severe prolonged symptoms were middle-aged white women with two or more co-morbidities, such as asthma or diabetes. As per the study, over 25% of participants displayed clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression while 12% showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).“Our results show a large burden of symptoms, mental and physical health problems and evidence of organ damage five months after discharge with Covid-19,” Dr Rachael Evans, a respiratory consultant at Leicester’s Hospitals, said in a statement.“It is also clear that those who required mechanical ventilation and were admitted to intensive care take longer to recover,” she added.The researchers classified the types of recovery into four different groups based on the participants’ mental and physical health impairments. One of the groups showed impaired cognitive function, which has colloquially been called ‘brain fog’, the study said. The researchers suggested a different underlying mechanism for the ‘brain fog’ compared to other symptoms as the cognitive impairment, according to them, was “striking even when taking education levels into account.” Researchers also found that each participant had an average of nine persistent symptoms.Here’s the list of the 10 most common symptoms reported in the study:1. Muscle pain2. Fatigue3. Physical slowing down4. Impaired sleep quality5. Joint pain or swelling6. Limb weakness7. Breathlessness8. Pain9. Short-term memory loss10.

24-03-2021||World||After Israel's tight election, who matters and what happens next||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's prospects for another term looked uncertain on Wednesday after partial results from Israel's fourth national election in two years projected no clear path to victory.The right-wing bloc led by Netanyahu's Likud party had a slight edge but was in a tight race with a grouping of centre, left and right-wing parties looking to unseat him.WHO ARE THE MAIN PLAYERS?Netanyahu, 71, campaigned on Israel's world-beating Covid-19 vaccine rollout, but such is the polarisation in Israeli politics that even this could not break the stalemate.Critics accuse him of mismanaging pandemic lockdowns that have hit Israel's economy hard and also point to corruption allegations. He denies any wrongdoing.His party looks set to lose around six seats - falling to around 30 in Israel's 120-seat parliament - making him more reliant on right-wing rivals.They will demand concessions during coalition horse-trading, and will ultimately be looking to replace him as standard-bearer of the right.Yair Lapid, 57, a former finance minister and TV host who leads the centre-left party Yesh Atid - “There is a Future”.His party is predicted to come second, with around 18 seats.Lapid campaigned to "bring sanity" back to Israel with clean government and moderate leadership.But he faces an even harder task - uniting disparate parties from across the political spectrum. They all want to see Netanyahu removed, but are not obvious bedfellows.Naftali Bennett, 48, a former Netanyahu aide, defence minister and high-tech millionaire who heads the ultra-hawkish Yamina party and is vying to be the next leader of the Israeli right.Though his party is predicted to grow slightly to seven seats, Bennett has positioned himself as a king-maker, refusing to commit to Netanyahu or against him.Gideon Saar, 54, a former cabinet minister who quit Likud to set up the New Hope party, vowing to end Netanyahu’s reign.Like Likud his party opposes Palestinian statehood. Saar’s campaign centred on clean government and jump-starting the economy but is expected to land only six seats.He could help unite factions from left and right. But Netanyahu will probably urge disappointed New Hope members to defect back 'home' to Likud.Bezalel Smotrich, 41, heads the far-right Religious Zionism party, which is projected to win around six seats.It includes Itamar Ben-Gvir, a former activist with the now-outlawed Kach movement, which advocated that Israel expel Arabs. It also includes a member of the Noam movement, which opposes LGBT rights and recognition of non-Orthodox Judaism in Israel.The party includes hardline Jewish settlers among its base, and rejects any territorial concessions to the Palestinians.Mansour Abbas, 46, an Islamist forecast to win six seats, has shaken the Arab political establishment by floating the idea of working with Netanyahu's right-wing government to address violence and other social issues in Arab towns.No Arab party has ever joined a ruling Israeli coalition, and Abbas's proposal is rejected by most Arab voters, many of whom identify with their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza.Although Netanyahu dropped past scaremongering about Arabs to reach out to them in this election, it remains an unlikely alliance of opposites.The divisions within Israel's 21% Arab minority look set to push overall Arab representation down.WHEN ARE THE RESULTS?The final tally is expected by Friday. A party must pass a threshold of 3.25% of the votes to enter parliament. Around 12 parties have a realistic chance of qualifying.WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE RESULTS ARE PUBLISHED?Israel’s president will consult with party leaders about who they want as prime minister. By April 7 he is expected to choose the legislator with the best chance.That nominee has up to 42 days to form a government. Then the president asks others to try.If nobody succeeds, Israel goes to a fifth election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-israel-s-tight-election-who-matters-and-what-happens-next-101616590972371.html
24-03-2021||World||Angela Merkel calls proposed Easter shutdown a ‘mistake’, asks 'citizens for forgiveness'||Chancellor Angela Merkel asked the German people for forgiveness after making a rare public apology for sparking massive criticism with plans for a five-day Easter shutdown.Merkel dropped the proposal, calling it a “mistake,” after a hastily-arranged video conference with the heads of Germany’s 16 states around 33 hours after announcing the move. She defended one of Germany’s toughest steps since the start of the pandemic but said there wasn’t enough time to implement properly.“To be absolutely clear, this mistake is solely and alone my mistake as in the end I am the one who carries the final responsibility,” she said on Wednesday. “I deeply regret this and ask all citizens for forgiveness.”Wednesday’s meeting followed marathon talks between the chancellor and state leaders earlier this week, which produced no new policies to contain the disease as a third wave of infections grips Europe’s largest economy.The Easter lockdown was the only fresh initiative after more than 11 hours of tense discussions that ended early Tuesday. The plan spurred widespread criticism, caught officials off guard and created confusion over the implementation.Germany has struggled to lay out a clear plan in the face of a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases and amid a sluggish vaccination campaign. That’s causing public frustration over the government’s handling of the crisis to grow just six months before a national election.Germany earlier this week extended a lockdown until April 18, which has effectively been in place for four months. The measures are relatively mild compared to other countries and include the partial closing of non-essential stores and the shutdown of hotels, restaurants, gyms and cultural venues.Merkel is appearing before German parliament Wednesday afternoon to defend her policies.Merkel’s conservative bloc -- also struggling with a scandal over lawmakers profiting off the pandemic -- has tumbled in the polls. Its lead over the second-placed Greens narrowed to 8 percentage points this week, according to a polling average calculated by Bloomberg.Opposition lawmakers from the Free Democrats and the Left party, said that Merkel should call for a vote of confidence.Armin Laschet, the head of Merkel’s Christian Democratic party and a leading contender to be the bloc’s chancellor candidate, said backing off the Easter lockdown was the right thing to do.“You can’t just introduce a public holiday within ten days,” he told lawmakers in North Rhine-Westphalia, where he is also state premier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-calls-proposed-easter-shutdown-a-mistake-asks-citizens-for-forgiveness-101616590375803.html

24-03-2021||World||Pope taps Chilean sex abuse whistleblower for Vatican panel||Pope Francis on Wednesday named a Chilean man who helped uncover a clerical sex abuse scandal to a Vatican commission that advises the pontiff on how to protect children from pedophile clergy.The Vatican said Juan Carlos Cruz is the latest member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. Other members of the panel include a bishop, priest, nuns and laypersons.Cruz and other survivors of a prominent Chilean predator priest were invited by the pope in 2018 to discuss their cases with him.Decades of sex abuse scandals in many countries, including many involving church hierarchy who covered up for pedophile priests, have eroded the Catholic church’s credibility among the faithful.Cruz was the main whistleblower on clerical abuse and coverup in his homeland, one of the more high-profile sex abuse scandals to stain the Catholic church's reputation.A gay man, Cruz has said he recounted to Francis how Chile's bishops used his sexual orientation to try to discredit him. He said he has spoken to the pontiff of the pain those personal attacks caused him.Whether the Vatican can convince the faithful it is sincerely committed to stopping pedophile priests and a widespread culture of coverups by high-ranking clergy is crucial to shoring up flagging trust by ordinary Catholics.In 2017, frustrated by what she described as Vatican stonewalling, an Irish woman, Marie Collins, who was sexually abused by a priest when she was an adolescent, quit her post on the commission.Collins was damning in her criticism of Vatican offices, saying some officials were refusing the pope's instructions to reply to all correspondence from abuse survivors.Last year, a long-awaited Vatican report about Theodore McCarrick, an influential US cardinal defrocked by Francis after sex abuse reports, made it plain that the Holy See needs to re-think how the church protects the faithful from bishops and other hierarchy who wield authority with often scarce accountability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-taps-chilean-sex-abuse-whistleblower-for-vatican-panel-101616589808850.html

Sri Lanka had by Tuesday administered the vaccines to over 840,000 people, officials said.According to Johns Hopkins University coronavirus data, Sri Lanka has reported 90,765 COVID-19 cases and 552 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-to-order-7-million-doses-of-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-101616589112298.html
24-03-2021||World||Biden readies for first news conference, White House tradition||He'd led allied armies in the defeat of Nazi Germany only to find himself, a decade later, a tad intimidated before the cameras in an echoey room of the Old Executive Office Building, ready to make history again.“Well, I see we’re trying a new experiment this morning,” President Dwight Eisenhower told the press corps. “I hope that doesn’t prove to be a disturbing influence.” It was the first presidential news conference captured for broadcast by television. In the scratchy black and white of 1955 TV sets, Americans saw those trademark Ike grins and heard him beef about being asked a “loaded question.”With that, an enlightening, contentious and often showboating tradition came into the modern age, one President Joe Biden carries on Thursday with his first White House news conference. Stay tuned for any disturbing influences.Depending how you count, Biden is a little or a lot behind his recent predecessors in opening himself to questions in what historian Martha Joynt Kumar calls the “high-risk, high-reward” enterprise of presidential news conferences.The last four presidents, back to Bill Clinton, each held one solo White House news conference in their first 60 days, picking up the pace to varying degrees later.Adding in the joint, often very brief news conferences with visiting foreign leaders, Donald Trump held at least five news conferences by that point, Clinton at least four, and Barack Obama two. The pandemic has kept foreign leaders away from the White House this year.The Biden White House is a notably tight ship, fully aware of his history of flubs, as is Biden himself, a self-described “gaffe machine.”He went through the 2020 campaign with infrequent news conferences and often hunkered down in the pandemic. Yet he debated fellow Democrats a dozen times and Trump three times without apparent harm to his prospects or the country.In one of the president's few extended and open-ended sessions with the media before Thursday, an interview with ABC News, Americans gained insight into his thinking about Russian President Vladimir Putin — Biden called him a killer who “will pay a price” for US election interference — as well as the surge of young migrants at the border, a possibly delayed troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and more.Eisenhower's news conference Jan. 19, 1955, was one benchmark among several in the history of presidential news conferences tracked by Kumar, an authority on White House practices.Until his administration, the news conferences were off the record, meaning presidents gave the public information about the country's affairs and the workings of government without necessarily letting their name be used.Woodrow Wilson gave the first presidential news conference in 1913. Calvin Coolidge made a habit of them, holding nearly 73 a year on average, explaining “the people should have a fairly accurate report of what the president is trying to do.”Franklin Roosevelt, a radio pioneer who mastered communications on all fronts and nearly matched Coolidge's unrivaled pace of news conferences, regularly summoned his favored reporters to his office, consigning the ones he didn't like to his “dunce club.”Off the record often meant giving the president a chance to clean up his remarks, unheard of today. At a March 1950 news conference, Harry Truman declared that Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the audacious canceler of communists real and imagined in U.S. government and society, was the Kremlin's "best asset."“When one of the reporters commented that the president’s observation would ‘hit page one tomorrow,’ Truman realized he had better soften the statement,” Kumar writes. “He ‘worked’ with reporters and allowed the following as a direct quotation: ‘The greatest asset that the Kremlin has is the partisan attempt in the Senate to sabotage the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States.’”Such manipulation became untenable when Eisenhower put the news conferences on the record and let broadcasters record them. Even so, segments were only televised later.Although wanting to take advantage of the nascent medium of TV, Eisenhower did so with a partial step. Press secretary James C. Hagerty told AP at the time that live telecasts would not be allowed.It was John F. Kennedy who ushered in the age of live, televised news conferences, and he thrived in the practice.Smooth talking, authoritative and funny, Kennedy reached living rooms about twice a month with his news conferences.But for all of JFK's charms and smarts, he encountered a more aggressive White House press corps, Kumar says. In part that was because the previous administration had been caught in a lie, at first telling Americans the Soviets had shot down a U.S. weather plane when it was a spy plane. Even so, open secrets about Kennedy's behavior with women and his health problems stayed off limits in the coverage.Through the cascade of lies about Vietnam and Watergate, the adversarial relationship between the press and power took deeper root. So did the performative nature of the exercise, with the cameras watching.Richard Nixon, like Trump after him, called the press an “enemy.” Yet Nixon was the first to hold White House news conferences in prime time. (Nixon's famous cry of grievance in 1973, “I'm not a crook,” came in a question-and-answer session with newspaper editors at an Associated Press meeting in Florida, not in a White House news conference.)Ronald Reagan also favored the big audiences and cachet of prime time, using the glamorous East Room as the backdrop just as Nixon did.Through these years news conferences became as much about watching a president think on his feet as about the policy substance, if not more.There's been preening — think Trump. Think, for example, of the haranguing, hourlong or longer theatrical, stream-of-consciousness monologues as that president searched openly for friendly questions, ridiculed tough ones and peddled theories based on things he saw on TV.There's been squirming, as when Gerald Ford was asked whether his pardon of Nixon should be taken to mean the disgraced president was guilty. “Uh, the acceptance of a pardon,” Ford said very slowly, “uh, I think can be construed by many if not all as an admission of guilt.”There have been plenty of flashes of anger.Obama in 2015 didn't take kindly to being asked why he was “content” to trumpet the newly achieved nuclear deal with Iran when that country was still holding four Americans on fabricated grounds. His face wore a smile that wasn't a smile.“The notion that I'm content, as I celebrate with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails,” he said, “that's nonsense and you should know better.”The long-ago question that Eisenhower found “loaded” in the Indian Treaty Room of the sprawling executive office building that now bears his name was innocuous by today's standards. He was merely asked if he might appraise his first two years in office and “tell us something of your hopes for the next two or maybe even the next six.”Contrast that with a Feb. 6, 1998, Clinton news conference the month after he lied in a televised speech that “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky," as the evidence built for his impeachment that fall.He was asked in that news conference at what point he might decide the crisis was too much to put his family through anymore and resign.“Never," he said, stone-faced.Clinton was flanked by the British prime minister, Tony Blair, who smiled the smile of a man who wanted to be somewhere — anywhere — else in that moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-readies-for-first-news-conference-white-house-tradition-101616589159475.html

In both instances, Ramaphosa served as deputy under Zuma's leadership.Ramaphosa has repeatedly spoken out on the need to respect the constitution and rule of law.Zuma faces possible arrest after refusing to obey a court order to appear at the same inquiry.Zuma, who denies any wrongdoing, failed to have Zondo recuse himself from the corruption inquiry and chose not to recognise its authority, saying Zondo is biased against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-president-ramaphosa-to-testify-at-corruption-inquiry-101616586537195.html

Beijing hit back with punitive measures against the EU.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Wednesday that "China is a country that doesn't share our values," referring to NATO as a club of democracies favouring free speech and freedom of association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-won-t-force-allies-into-us-or-them-choice-on-china-blinken-to-tell-nato-101616585627997.html

The communities of Bristol have made too many sacrifices and worked so hard to defeat this virus, it’s unacceptable for people to insult their efforts in this way,” Armes added.The force said that highly trained public order officers from Avon and Somerset, British Transport Police, Devon and Cornwall, Dorset, Dyfed Powys, Gloucestershire, Gwent and Wiltshire were deployed to move protestors on in the night.Specialist police dog units, horses, the National Police Air Service and a police drone unit were also involved in the operation. While many left the area, a significant number gathered on Deanery Road nearby and refused to disperse.One of those arrested was in connection with the disorder in Bristol on Sunday, the force said.The so-called "Kill the Bill" protesters have been demonstrating against the government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which will see the police handed new powers to tackle demonstrations.Over the weekend, the protests turned into violent clashes and saw a police station attacked, 21 officers injured and vehicles set alight.UK Home Secretary Priti Patel had accused protesters of "criminality and thuggish behaviour".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-arrests-in-anti-lockdown-protest-in-uk-city-of-bristol-101616577730767.html
24-03-2021||World||Japan policymakers step up calls for higher minimum wage to boost demand||Japanese policymakers are stepping up calls to raise the country's minimum wage as part of a strategy to ensure households can boost consumption and revitalise the economy when Covid-19 curbs are removed and vaccines are rolled out.Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Wednesday it was hard to re-energize the economy with monetary easing alone, calling on companies to help out by raising salaries for employees."We have to prod companies to transfer more of their profits to households by raising salaries. Otherwise we won't see consumption fire up," Aso told parliament."We must seek to raise Japan's minimum wage to around 1,000 yen ($9/hour) from the current average of about 900 yen," he said.The remarks echo those of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who said on Monday the government will aim to raise the average minimum wage to 1,000 yen "swiftly" to help improve living conditions for temporary workers hit hardest by the pandemic."With a pledge of higher wages, the administration may be trying to appeal to voters," said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.The call comes as major Japanese firms are set to offer the lowest wage increases in eight years, a sign the pandemic is putting an end to the benefits brought on by former premier Shinzo Abe's stimulus policies.Raising the minimum wage, particularly those for regional areas where wages are lower than bigger cities, will likely be among key topics of debate at the government's top economic council. The council will come up with an outline of its long-term economic strategy around the middle of this year.Japan's economy rebounded from the pandemic's initial hit thanks to robust exports. But it is likely to have shrunk in the current quarter due to softer consumption, even though new state of emergency curbs imposed in January have been lifted.Many policymakers expect the post-pandemic recovery to be modest in Japan, with some analysts warning of the risk of a return to deflation if the weakness in domestic demand persists.Some firms are doing fairly well. Sony will pay record bonus payments this year, reflecting brisk sales of its game consoles as the pandemic kept people home, according to Kyodo news agency. But such cases are rare.Raising the minimum wage could be controversial. While it will give wage-earners more money to spend, it will hit small, regional firms barely staying afloat from the pandemic's hit."It's tricky because raising the minimum wage could force small companies to cut jobs to make ends meet," said Miyamae of SMBC Nikko Securities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-policymakers-step-up-calls-for-higher-minimum-wage-to-boost-demand-101616584164560.html
24-03-2021||World||White headmaster ordered Black US student to kneel, apologise 'the African way’, suspended||The White headmaster of a Catholic school in New York was suspended after he allegedly told a Black student to kneel and apologise “the African way”. The student’s parent, Trisha Paul, told New York Daily News about the February 25 incident when her son, Trayson, was reprimanded by his English literature teacher for working on a wrong assignment.Paul said that the teacher ripped up the paper and marched him to the office of John Holian, the headmaster of St. Martin de Porres Marianist school on Long Island, where the sixth-grader was ordered to get on his knees and apologise, reported the local daily. Trayson’s mom called the school on March 1 and asked the headmaster whether forcing students to kneel was standard disciplinary practice.According to Paul, Holian accepted that it was not a standard practice but added that he had learned it from a Nigerian father who called it an “African way” of apologising. “Once he started mentioning this African family, that’s when it just clicked... I felt there was no relevance at all. Is he generalizing that everyone who is Black is African?” Paul, who is Haitian American, was quoted by the newspaper as saying.The school’s acting headmaster, Brother James Conway, released a statement on Tuesday, saying St. Martin neither condones nor accepts the actions of Holian. Conway added that the incident doesn’t reflect the school’s “ long, established values or the established protocols” regarding student-related issues.“We have launched an internal review of the incident and restated in the clearest terms what is the established and approved practice for student-faculty interaction. Our most important mission here at St. Martin’s is to provide our children with the spiritual and educational foundation that will allow them to lead exemplary lives,” the statement read.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-headmaster-ordered-black-student-to-apologise-the-african-way-suspended-101616583436013.html

We are considering whether to do it regionally or nationally," Niedzielski told the Wirtualna Polska network.Poland earlier this month re-imposed a series of restrictions to combat the wave of infections, including shutting schools, shopping malls and theatres.dt/amj/jxb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poland-adds-29-978-new-cases-highest-single-day-spike-since-start-of-pandemic-101616583606911.html
24-03-2021||World||Myanmar: 7-year-old girl killed after security forces open fire in Mandalay||A 7-year-old girl died of bullet wounds in Myanmar’s second city Mandalay on Tuesday, after security forces opened fire in the Chan Mya Thazi township, one of the city's several suburbs.The girl, who had been shot inside her home, succumbed to her injuries yesterday, people working for a funeral service told news agency Reuters. She became the country's youngest victim so far in a crackdown by the junta against opposition to last month's military coup.The ruling junta has accused pro-democracy protesters of arson and violence during the weeks of unrest and said it would use the least force possible to quell the daily demonstrations. Although the military has said that 164 protesters in total have so far died in the resultant clashes, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group says at least 275 people have been killed in the security forces' crackdown.Soldiers shot at her father but hit the girl who was sitting on his lap inside their home, the deceased girl's sister told Myanmar Now media outlet. Two other men were also killed in the township, according to the network. The military had no immediate comment on the incident.As night fell, candle-lit vigils were held in the country's commercial capital Yangon and other cities. At least 20 children aged under 18 have reportedly been killed since the junta took charge last month, according to AAPP and aid group 'Save the Children'. Human rights organisations have also expressed concern over the "hundreds of young people" being held in detention."We are horrified that children continue to be among the targets of these fatal attacks on peaceful protestors," read a statement issued by Save the Children.The Myanmar office of the United Nations children's agency said "the continuing use of force against children, including the use of live ammunition, by security forces is taking a devastating toll on children in Myanmar." UNICEF added that since the crisis started at least 23 children had been killed and at least 11 others seriously injured.Last month, twenty people were injured and two killed in Mandalay when security forces tried to disperse protesting opponents, according to the Parahita Darhi volunteer emergency service agency.The junta has faced international condemnation for staging the coup that halted Myanmar's slow transition to democracy and for its lethal suppression of the protests that followed. It has tried to justify the takeover by saying a November 8 election won by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was fraudulent - an accusation the electoral commission has rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency.Many businesses in Yangon remained shut today and streets were deserted after anti-coup activists called for a silent strike, even as Myanmar's junta freed hundreds of detained demonstrators on Wednesday. Around 2,000 people have been arrested till now in the military crackdown on the protests against the February 1 coup, AAPP activists said.The demonstrators are demanding the restoration of the elected government, the release of Suu Kyi and others and the scrapping of a 2008 constitution, drawn up under military supervision, that gives the army a major role in politics.The military is pressing charges on Suu Kyi faces for allegedly violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios.The Myanmar leader, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, has been in detention since the coup and faces the charges that her lawyer says have been cooked up to discredit her. The ousted leader was due to appear for another court hearing via video conferencing on Wednesday, but the head of her legal team Khin Maung Zaw said it had been postponed until April 1, marking the second successive delay due to internet issues.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-7-year-old-girl-killed-after-security-forces-open-fire-in-mandalay-101616579766957.html

Or, if you buy Chinese vaccines, then you cannot use our Taiwanese money," he added.China has already begun offering its vaccines to mostly developing countries.On Monday, Paraguay's Foreign Ministry said the government had been approached by people "whose legitimacy or links with the government of the People's Republic of China has not been proven" about vaccines.It said these unidentified people had suggested the precondition for getting the vaccines would be to ditch Taiwan, and denounced the "distressing humanitarian scenario" that anyone should try and use the pandemic for political or economic gains.Wu said he was confident in Taiwan's ties with Paraguay, who he said "abhorred" China."The Paraguayan government knows that there is China's shadow, Chinese funds and Chinese channels behind the turmoil there, and they abhor China," he said.In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said it was "fake news" to suggest linking vaccine supplies to a demand for Paraguay to break ties with Taiwan."We sternly warn these people in Taiwan not to engage in political manipulation, smears and rumour mongering, because it will all be futile," she said.Beijing considers democratic Taiwan merely a Chinese province with no right to state-to-state ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-to-help-allies-buy-vaccines-but-not-from-china-101616582379299.html

The leaders had met for hours on Monday and into early Tuesday to discuss new measures on the pandemic as infection rates in the country are going up again.Among the most important measures decided on was a five-day lockdown on Easter to get the numbers down again. However, that decision was met with lots of criticism and many questions on how extra holidays are legally possible.Infection numbers in Germany have been rising again as the more contagious variant of the virus that was first detected in Britain has been spreading in the country.Germany has registered more than 75,000 deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic a year ago.

24-03-2021||World||China bashes US over racism, inequality, pandemic response||China lashed out Wednesday at the US over racism, financial inequality and the federal government’s response to the coronavirus in an annual report that seeks to counter US accusations of human rights abuses by China’s ruling Communist Party.The report issued by China’s Cabinet said the US in 2020 “saw its own epidemic situation go out of control, accompanied by political disorder, inter-ethnic conflicts, and social division.”The document released by the State Council Information Office also highlighted the Jan. 6 insurrectionist attack on the Capitol as well as gun violence and health disparities.China issues the report each year in response to US criticism of its record on issues such as abuses against minority groups in the western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet and a crackdown on opposition voices in Hong Kong."To defeat the epidemic requires mutual help, solidarity and cooperation among all countries. However, the United States, which has always considered itself an exception and superior, saw its own epidemic situation go out of control, accompanied by political disorder, inter-ethnic conflicts, and social division," the report said.“Vulnerable groups became the biggest victims of the government’s reckless response to the epidemic," it said.The Chinese report is based on open-source material, as opposed to the US document, which is largely drawn from work by diplomats, journalists and human rights activists who cannot always reveal their information because of threats of retaliation from the ruling Communist Party.The report comes after the European Union joined the US, Britain and Canada in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials over accusations they abused ethnic minorities. Beijing retaliated by announcing it would penalize four European legislators, a German researcher and European-based rights organization with bans on travelling to Chinese territories or having financial interactions with Chinese institutions.China has taken an increasingly hard line against any criticism of its domestic politics or what it sees as attempts to impede its rise as a global leader. In recent days it has placed two Canadian citizens on trial in apparent retaliation for Canada's detention of an executive of the telecoms giant Huawei, who is wanted in the US on fraud charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bashes-us-over-racism-inequality-pandemic-response-101616580778746.html

Fans backed them up, shouting "equal pay" during the World Cup final match.The coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout has exacerbated disparities, triggering what Vice President Kamala Harris has called a "national emergency" for women.Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package includes provisions aimed at getting the 2 million women who left the labor force during the Covid-19 pandemic back to work. His next legislative push, valued at some $3 trillion, will also expand child care infrastructure and create jobs, administration officials say.Rapinoe and teammate Margaret Purce will join Biden at the White House. Rapinoe is also due to testify to a US House Committee hearing on the issue."They are heroines because they champion this issue for all women," said Jennifer Klein, co-chair of the newly established White House Gender Policy Council. "This is really true in literally every country in the world – women are paid less."The team reached a settlement in December with US Soccer on certain working conditions, including team travel and accommodations, but is still fighting in the courts to achieve equal pay to the men's soccer team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-mark-equal-pay-day-as-women-hit-worse-than-men-by-pandemic-101616580640735.html
24-03-2021||World||Lawsuit filed against delay in processing of EADs for H-1B spouses and L1 visas||A top American association of immigration lawyers has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for extraordinary delays in processing employment authorisation documents (EADs) of spouses of foreign workers in the country on H-1B and L1 visas, a significantly large number of whom are technology professionals from India."The delays that H-4 and L-2 non-immigrants are facing needlessly place families in financial limbo," said Jennifer Minear, president of American Immigration Lawyers Association or AILA, which has filed the class-action lawsuit against the DHS along with Wasden Banias.The DHS has the legal tools and authority to grant work authorisation to impacted individuals whose financial security is hanging in the balance, and it should immediately begin to use those tools to provide solutions, Minear said.The DHS can and must revoke the unnecessary biometric requirements for H-4 and L-2 non-immigrants, provide automatic work authorisation while it processes EAD renewal requests, and allow EAD applicants to file their renewal applications sooner than 180 days prior to expiration to prevent gaps in work authorisation, she demanded.Jesse Bless, AILA's director of Federal Litigation said that in 2019, the Trump administration implemented a new biometric requirement for H-4 and L-2 and other dependents seeking to extend their stay in the US.These new requirements added to the already extraordinary processing delays, which were further exacerbated by Covid-19 restrictions. The process to attain work authorisation should not put families at the risk of immense loss of income and instability, he said."There are reasonable and immediate steps that the DHS can take to make certain that visa holders meet requirements without imposing needless suffering. We hope to work with the government on immediate solutions to get these individuals back to work," Bless said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawsuit-filed-against-delay-in-processing-of-eads-for-h-1b-spouses-and-l1-visas-101616575496859.html
24-03-2021||World||Australian mom convicted of killing 4 children loses appeal in Sydney court||A woman convicted of smothering her four children over a decade lost an appeal in a Sydney court on Wednesday against an inquiry’s conclusion that her victims had not died of natural causes.A growing number of scientists say Kathleen Folbigg is the victim of a miscarriage of justice, though many others consider the series of deaths too tragic to be bad luck alone.The New South Wales state Court of Appeal dismissed her application for a review of a judge’s ruling that “makes her guilt of these offenses even more certain.”Her last hope of early release now lies with a petition for a pardon lodged this month with the state governor. Folbigg’s convictions would still stand, but she would be released.The petition carried the signatures of 91 scientists, medical practitioners and related professionals including two Nobel laureates.Folbigg, now 53, was convicted in 2003 of murdering three of her children and the manslaughter of a fourth. She has consistently denied guilt. She was sentenced to 30 years in prison with a minimum of 25 years to be served before she could be considered for parole.She raised her eyes toward the ceiling on Wednesday as she watched the three judges hand down their decision via video from prison.“Today’s decision and the pardon petition have got many more people looking at this important case than ever before, and many people are starting to ask valuable questions about how we got here,” Tracy Chapman said in a statement written in consultation with Folbigg, her friend.“Many international eyes are now on this case and there’re many more Australians rightly asking why Kath’s still in prison after 18 years when there’s mounting scientific evidence relating to her innocence,” the statement added.Her lawyers said in a statement the court loss should not impact the pardon application.None of Folbigg’s children survived to a second birthday.Her first child Caleb was born in 1989 and died 19 days later in what a court determined to be the lesser crime of manslaughter. Her second child Patrick was 8 months old when he died in 1991. Two years later, Sarah died aged 10 months. In 1999, Folbigg’s fourth child Laura died at 19 months old. Folbigg was the first on the scene of each tragedy.An autopsy found Laura had myocarditis, an inflammation of heart muscle that can be fatal. But given the deaths of her three siblings, a pathologist listed the cause of her death as “undetermined.”Patrick suffered epilepsy and his death had been attributed to an airway obstruction due to a seizure. The other two were recorded as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS.At her trial, Folbigg’s lawyers told the jury there were medical explanations for each death. Caleb had a floppy larynx and Sarah had a congested uvula that could have obstructed their airways.Folbigg did not testify at her trial, but she testified for almost three days at the 2019 judicial review of her convictions based on a pathologist’s findings that the children likely died of natural causes with no sign of smothering.The judge hearing the review also heard expert testimony that both girls had an inherited genetic mutation linked to abnormal heartbeats and sudden death in children and suggesting their deaths may have been triggered by infections they had at the time.Last year, the findings of 27 scientists describing the genetic mutation in the Folbigg girls and its functional validation were published by Oxford University Press in the peer-reviewed cardiology journal Europace.The case against Folbigg was circumstantial and relied on interpretations of vague entries she had made in personal diaries, one of which her estranged husband Craig Folbigg reported to police.The entries included: “Obviously, I am my father’s daughter,” a reference to her father stabbing her mother to death in 1968 when Folbigg was 18 months old.The three appeal court judges found there was ample evidence for the 2019 inquiry to conclude Folbigg was guilty.“This was not a case in which the ... conclusion was at odds with scientific evidence,” the judges wrote of the 2019 findings.But signatories of the petition for a pardon disagreed.“It is deeply concerning that there is not a mechanism to appropriately weigh up all medical and scientific evidence in a case of this nature,” Australian Academy of Science president John Shine said.“There is now an alternative explanation for the death of the Folbigg children that does not rely on circumstantial evidence,” Shine added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-mom-convicted-of-killing-4-children-loses-appeal-101616580004908.html

24-03-2021||World||Germany's Merkel calls 'unexpected' meeting after agreeing to extend lockdown||German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called an unexpected meeting with leaders of the federal states for Wednesday morning to discuss the coronavirus pandemic after they agreed on Tuesday to extend the lockdown to April 18.At talks on Monday with the leaders of Germany's 16 states, Merkel had pushed for a tougher stance to fight the pandemic, reversing plans for a gradual re-opening of the economy agreed earlier this month after a sharp rise in the infection rate.But state premiers pushed back at the talks that ran into the early hours of Tuesday, only agreeing to call on citizens to stay at home for five days over the the Easter holidays to try to break a third wave of the pandemic.The move drew criticism from all sides, with businesses lamenting the extended lockdown and medical experts saying the new measures were not tough enough to prevent the exponential spread of more infectious variants of the virus.Armin Laschet, the leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats and the premier of Germany's most populous state, told the regional parliament he expected a very critical discussion about what had happened during the talks earlier this week.Merkel's CDU has come under increasing fire for its handling of the pandemic due to the slow pace of vaccinations and a corruption scandal over the procurement of face masks, hurting its poll ratings ahead of a national election in September.Germany reported another 15,813 infections on Wednesday, bringing the total to 2,690,523, while the death toll rose by 248 to 75,212.The number of cases per 100,000 in the last seven days, which the government has used as a key metric to decide on lockdown steps, was stable at 108.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-merkel-calls-unexpected-meeting-after-agreeing-to-extend-lockdown-101616579013322.html

"When we start to reopen, more and more people are going to want to return to work and want to be around other folks."But Silicon Valley companies that committed last year to allowing workers to stay home until this summer or indefinitely said that they stood by their timelines.They cited their own analyses of public health data, other safety considerations and workers' preferences. Adoption of vaccines, which in California are accessible to only the most vulnerable populations, is also a factor but a smaller one.Networking gear maker Cisco Systems Inc and file-storage service Dropbox Inc said their mandatory work from home policies would remain effect until June, while Box Inc said its reopening is still scheduled for September.Pinterest Inc is not eyeing a significant reopening until at least August, Alphabet Inc's Google until September and DocuSign Inc not before October.Twitter, Adobe Inc, PayPal Holdings Inc, Twilio Inc, Yelp Inc and Zoom Video Communications Inc also will stay closed despite what Breed and other local government officials described as a move to the "orange tier" from the "red tier" of California lockdown restrictions.Breed's spokesman Jeff Cretan said San Francisco officials expect smaller and mid-sized companies to be the first to return.'HIRING ADVANTAGE'Among the few companies aiming to take advantage of the easing were SAP SE, which said it is strongly considering partially reopening its Bay Area offices within weeks, and Slack Technologies, which is weighing a date to invite back some workers.San Francisco ecommerce software startup Fast will open its doors - and windows for safety - to up to 25% of its 56 Bay Area employees on Wednesday, spokesman Jason Alderman said.

24-03-2021||World||Myanmar junta frees hundreds held for anti-coup protests||Hundreds of people imprisoned for protesting last month’s coup were released Wednesday in the first apparent gesture by the military to try to placate the protest movement.Witnesses outside Insein Prison in Yangon saw busloads of mostly young people, looking happy with some flashing the three-finger gesture of defiance adopted by the protest movement. State-run TV said a total of 628 were freed.The prisoners appear to be the hundreds of students detained in early March while demonstrating against the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.One lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity because she doesn’t want attention from the authorities, said all those released were arrested on March 3. She said only 55 people detained in connection with the protests remained in the prison, and it is likely they will all face charges under Section 505(A) of the Penal Code, which carries a penalty of up to three years in prison.Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says it has confirmed the killings of 275 people in connection with the post-coup crackdown, with additional deaths still unverified. It also says that as of Tuesday, it had verified arrest or charges against 2,812 people, of whom 2,418 remain in custody or with outstanding charges.Demonstrators on Wednesday tried a new tactic that they dubbed a silence strike, calling on people to stay home and businesses to close for the day.The extent of the strike was difficult to gauge, but social media users posted photos from cities and towns showing streets empty of activity save for the occasional stray dog.The online meme posted to publicize the action called silence “the loudest scream” and explained its purpose was to honor the movement’s fallen heroes, to recharge protesters’ energy and to contradict the junta’s claims that “everything is back to normal.”The new tactic was employed after an extended onslaught of violence from security forces.Local media reported that a 7-year-old girl in Mandalay, the country’s second-biggest city, was among the latest victims on Tuesday. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners included her in its list of fatalities.“Khin Myo Chit was shot in the abdomen by a soldier while she sat in her father’s lap inside her home in Aung Pin Le ward,” the online news service Myanmar Now reported, quoting her sister, Aye Chan San.The report said the shooting took place when soldiers were raiding homes in her family’s neighborhood. The sister said a soldier shot at their father when he denied that any people were hiding in their home, and hit the girl.Aye Chan San said the soldiers then beat her 19-year-old brother with their rifle butts and took him away.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners recorded three killings in Mandalay on Tuesday, though some other reports said there were five.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-frees-hundreds-held-for-anti-coup-protests-101616568984573.html

Bangladesh said at least 11 people were killed."Most people scattered to other camps to stay with friends or relatives," said Snigdha Chakraborty, country manager for the Catholic Relief Services aid group."We must ensure that any children who were separated from their families during the evacuation are reunited quickly."She did not provide any estimate of how many children had been left on their own.The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, also said children were looking for their parents, in another trauma for families that fled from their homes in western Myanmar when the military there launched an offensive against Muslim insurgents in 2017."This is a very difficult situation and our heart goes out to the thousands of refugees who have yet met another disaster," UNHCR official Ita Schuette said in a video message posted on Twitter from Cox's Bazar.Some 1 million Rohingya refugees live in camps in Cox's Bazar with little hope of returning to their homes in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where most have been refused citizenship and face persecution.Some witnesses said that barbed wire fencing put up around the camp had trapped many people during the fire.International humanitarian agencies have called for the removal of the wire but the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of the refugees, Mohammad Shamsud Douza, said the fencing was not a major issue."It spread so quickly that some people who could not come out instantly died," he said. "It was not the barbed wire fencing that prevented them from escaping."Citing overcrowding in the camps, Bangladesh has been trying to move 100,000 Rohingya to a remote Bay of Bengal island.Aid groups say the flood-prone, low-lying Bhasan Char island, which only emerged from the see about 20 years ago, risks being overwhelmed by storms and refugees should not be housed there.Despite that, and the reluctance of many Rohingya to move, Bangladesh has transferred more than 13,000 refugees to the island since December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aid-workers-struggle-to-reunite-rohingya-children-separated-by-deadly-fire-101616568479229.html
24-03-2021||World||Australia prepares for flood recovery as wild weather eases||Australian authorities issued fresh flood evacuation orders for parts of the east coast on Wednesday, and warned that water levels would keep rising in some areas, even as Sydney woke up to clear skies for the first time in several days.Wild weather systems have drenched the country's east, prompting tens of thousands of evacuations, especially in the hardest hit state of New South Wales (NSW) where dams continue to overflow and rivers bulge.NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said 6,000 more people were evacuated in the last 24 hours and that new evacuation orders had been issued for residents in Sydney's western regions to move to safe zones."What we still have to be aware of is the fact that thousands and thousands of people are still on evacuation warnings, that the rivers will continue to swell, that catchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years," Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.The Insurance Council of Australia, the peak industry body, said about 17,000 damages claims worth around A$254.2 million had been lodged by Wednesday morning across NSW and Queensland.No deaths linked to the floods have been reported but the destruction is far-reaching and more than 40,000 people in the state have been evacuated so far.Homes have been submerged, livestock swept away and crops drowned on a large scale. There have also been many animal rescues, with water craft used to move dogs, cattle, and even an emu, away from the flood waters.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday that heavy-load helicopters would be prepared to transport food to supermarkets where supplies were running short.Officials told Reuters that the Warragamba Dam, the major water supply for Sydney, would continue to spill over the next several days, although at a slowing rate."We are seeing a reduction and given the fact that rains have passed and inflows declining we anticipate that spill should cease in the coming days," Water NSW spokesman Tony Webber told Reuters.Forecasters said the weather system will shift to the island state of Tasmania on Wednesday, bringing heavy rains and localised flooding.Though conditions have eased, the weather bureau said water levels in rivers would not recede for several days."We have had phenomenal amounts of rainfall right across the state over the last week and with that rain, it's got to drain into the rivers," bureau official Victoria Dodds said in a televised news briefing.Several hundred Australian Defence Force personnel will be sent to flood-affected areas in the country's east over the next few days to help in the recovery, Australia's Emergency Management minister David Littleproud said on Wednesday."Their job will be out there cleaning up, making sure that we get rid of the debris, having boots on the ground," Littleproud said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-prepares-for-flood-recovery-as-wild-weather-eases-101616556711780.html
24-03-2021||World||Hong Kong halts Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines, cites defective packaging||Hong Kong authorities halted the use of a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Germany's BioNTech on Wednesday, citing defective packaging, in a move that triggered scenes of confusion in inoculation centres across the city.The suspension comes as the Asian financial hub has faced a sluggish take-up of vaccines due to dwindling confidence in China's Sinovac vaccine and fears of adverse reactions.Inoculation centre staff turned away people booked to take the BioNTech vaccine, with many Hong Kong-ers unsure as to the reason and asking for explanations. Adding to the confusion, local media reports said one doctor was reprimanded for promoting the BioNTech vaccine over Sinovac's."As a precautionary measure BioNTech requested the suspension" for its vaccines in Hong Kong until an investigation is complete, the city's Director of Health, Constance Chan, told a news conference.The city started vaccinating residents with doses from Sinovac in February and began offering the one developed by BioNTech, in March.The BioNTech vaccine is distributed in Hong Kong and Macau via a partnership with China's Fosun Pharma, while BioNTech partners with Pfizer in markets outside greater China.The BioNTech vaccine has shown greater take-up since its launch. Over the past week, more than double the number of people have booked the BioNTech shot compared to Sinovac, according to government figures.Chan said the government had initially contacted Fosun Industrial (Hong Kong), the distributor after it found some cases of cracks in vaccine containers and stains on some bottles.She said Fosun replied on Wednesday morning stating that it needed to further investigate and would suspend vaccination until further notice."BioNTech and Fosun have not found any reason to believe that product safety is at risk," she said.Fosun's parent company, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, said in a filing on Wednesday it was investigating with BioNTech.BioNTech said in a statement that no other batches to other regions were affected and it was investigating the root cause.Macau said on Wednesday it was also suspending the BioNTech vaccine due to the packaging flaw.Officials said Sinovac vaccinations would continue to take place as scheduled.In a separate incident, Hong Kong's government said it shut a private clinic that administered Covid-19 vaccines after a physician, named Dr Lau, "violated an agreement" under the city's inoculation programme.Broadcaster RTHK reported that Lau recommended people take the BioNTech shot, rather than Sinovac's, due to its better international reputation.Lau did not immediately respond to requests for comment. His clinic had been providing Sinovac vaccines and not the BioNTech ones, which are only available at larger public-sector facilities.Distrust of the mainland has intensified among residents in recent years with months of anti-government and anti-China protests driven by a perception that Beijing is pushing the semi-autonomous city onto a more authoritarian path.Media reports of several deaths after vaccinations have also kept some people jittery even though the government has said there was no direct link.With low levels of infection in the city, many people are opting to wait and see before getting a shot.Only about 5% of Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents have been vaccinated, and more than one-third of them received the BioNTech shot.For one 67-year-old resident, who gave his surname as Lau, there was no question as to which vaccine he was going for on Tuesday - the BioNTech one."It has better data, there are more people getting it internationally," he said. "The other one, the data is not clear."City leader Carrie Lam has repeated called for people to get vaccinated."When many places all over the world are scrambling for vaccines, we have a pretty assured supply," she said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-halts-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-cites-defective-packaging-101616578008486.html
24-03-2021||World||EU to extend Covid-19 vaccine export curbs to cover Britain, backloading: Report||The European Commission on Wednesday will extend EU powers to potentially block COVID-19 vaccine exports to Britain and other areas with much higher vaccination rates, and to cover instances of companies backloading contracted supplies, EU officials said.The regulation is aimed at making vaccine trade reciprocal and proportional so that other vaccine-making countries sell to Europe and the EU does not export much more than it imports, one EU official said.With no numerical targets, the change is unlikely to trigger mass export bans of EU-made vaccines, the official with insight into the announcement said on Wednesday."I just really, really don't see that happening because we have our international obligations and we want to keep supply chains going and the global system moving and flowing," the official said.The regulation will be the basis for the EU's 27 governments to decide whether to block vaccine exports or not."In practice, all this is, is a piece of paper that says please take this stuff into consideration when you're looking at approving export authorisations," the official said.The move, which EU officials said could hit AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, are designed to avoid even limited delivery shortfalls to a region whose inoculation programme has been beset by delays and supply issues.Shipments abroad could also be withheld if vaccine-producing countries, such as Britain and the United States, disallow exports to the EU, officials said, confirming comments by commission head Ursula von der Leyen last week.As London-Brussels tensions rose on Monday over a possible export ban, Britain demanded that EU authorities allow the delivery of vaccines it has ordered.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain did not believe in imposing vaccine blockades. "I'm encouraged by some of the things I've heard from the continent in the same sense," he told a news briefing.Johnson & Johnson has announced delays in its second-quarter supplies to the EU, which a second EU official said could lead to consequences under the Commission amendment covering companies backloading contracted quarterly deliveries.All vaccine makers could be affected, added the second official, with direct knowledge of the Commission decision. Some on the EU's list of countries exempt from any vaccine export monitoring, like Israel, are likely to be removed, because of their very high inoculation rates, the first official said."It doesn't mean they won't get vaccines. It just means they're not automatically exempted anymore," the first EU official said.'WE DON'T WANT THE SAME DELAYS IN Q2'The EU this month used an export control mechanism, set up at the end of January, to block an AstraZeneca vaccine shipment to Australia.That mechanism can be activated only if companies do not meet contracted quarterly delivery targets. The block followed AstraZeneca's announcement of steep cuts in first-quarter deliveries to the EU.With the amendments to be adopted on Wednesday, the EU will be able to block exports to cover companies that respect their quarterly contracts but backload supplies to the end of the period, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous.Johnson & Johnson, which has committed to delivering 55 million doses to the EU between April and June, plans to start deliveries in the second half of April.The company told EU officials production issues might make it difficult to meet its second quarter target, but it was striving to do so.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech also had delays in vaccine deliveries to the EU, though they are set to meet their overall first-quarter targets. "We don't want the same delays to happen in the second quarter," said the second official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-extend-covid-19-vaccine-export-curbs-to-cover-britain-backloading-report-101616576956321.html

24-03-2021||World||Indian national deleted 1,200 Microsoft user accounts, jailed in US for 2 years||An Indian national has been sentenced by a US court in California to two years in prison, who after being fired by his company accessed its server and deleted over 1,200 Microsoft user accounts, according to a statement.Deepanshu Kher was arrested when he flew from India to the United States on January 11, 2021, unaware of the outstanding warrant for his arrest.“This act of sabotage was destructive for this company,” said Acting US Attorney Randy Grossman on Tuesday.In pronouncing the sentence, US District Court Judge Marilyn Huff noted that Kher perpetrated a significant and sophisticated attack on the company, an attack which was planned and clearly intended as revenge.In addition to the two years in custody, Judge Huff sentenced Kher to three years’ supervised release and restitution to the Company of USD 567,084, the amount that the Company paid to fix the problems which Kher caused.According to court documents, Kher was employed by an information technology consulting firm from 2017 through May 2018. In 2017, the consulting firm was hired by the Carlsbad Company to assist with its migration to a Microsoft Office 365 (MS O365) environment. In response, the consulting firm sent its employee, Kher, to the company’s Carlsbad headquarters to assist with the migration.The company was dissatisfied with Kher's work and relayed their dissatisfaction to the consulting firm soon after Kher’s arrival. In January 2018, the consulting firm pulled Kher from the company’s headquarters.A few months later, on May 4, 2018, the firm fired Kher, and a month after that, in June 2018, Kher returned to Delhi, India.On August 8, 2018, two months after his return to India, Kher hacked into the Carlsbad Company’s server and deleted over 1,200 of its 1,500 MS O365 user accounts.Federal prosecutors alleged that the attack affected the bulk of the company’s employees and completely shut down the company for two days.As the company’s Vice President of Information Technology (IT) explained, the impact was felt inside and outside the company.Employees’ accounts were deleted – they could not access their email, their contacts lists, their meeting calendars, their documents, corporate directories, video and audio conferences, and Virtual Teams environment necessary for them to perform their jobs, prosecutors said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-national-deleted-1-200-microsoft-user-accounts-jailed-in-us-for-2-years-101616575509582.html
24-03-2021||World||World Tuberculosis Day 2021: Theme, history and significance of the day||World Tuberculosis (TB) Day is observed each year on March 24 to raise awareness amongst the public about the debilitating health, social as well as economic consequences of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that affects the lungs and spreads to people when an infected person sneezes or coughs which is the reason why timely diagnosis and medical attention is the key to fighting the disease.The day aims to increase efforts to end the global epidemic of TB, one of the world’s deadliest infectious killers which according to data by World Health Organisation (WHO) has claimed the lives of around 1,400,000 people in the year 2019. WHO also said that around 63 million lives have been saved since 2000 because of the global efforts against tuberculosis. "TB remains one of the world’s deadliest infectious killers. Each day, nearly 4000 lose their lives to TB and close to 28,000 people fall ill with this preventable and curable disease,” WHO added.History of World Tuberculosis DayMarch 24 also marks the day on which Dr Robert Koch announced in 1881 that he had made the discovery of the bacterium which causes TB. This “opened the way towards diagnosing and curing this disease,” said WHO in an official statement on their website. Other than TB, Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch, who was a German physician and microbiologist who identified the causative agents of cholera and anthrax as well. For his research work on TB, Koch received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905.Theme of World Tuberculosis Day 2021The theme of World Tuberculosis Day 2021 is ‘The Clock is Ticking’. The theme has been chosen as it “conveys the sense that the world is running out of time to act on the commitments to end TB made by global leaders,” WHO said in its statement.

24-03-2021||World||Oil gets Suez blockage bounce following demand-driven sell-off||Oil climbed as investors assessed the impact on global crude flows after a ship ran aground and blocked the Suez Canal, following a sell-off that’s driven prices to the lowest level since early February.Futures in New York added 1% after news of the grounding, giving the market a reprieve amid mounting signs of weakness. Oil prices slumped below $60 a barrel on Tuesday and have tumbled more than 12% in less than two weeks on a series of factors including softening physical demand and the unwinding of long positions. The prompt timespread for global Brent crude has also flipped into a bearish structure for the first time since January.Adding to negative sentiment are indications US crude inventories continue to swell. The American Petroleum Institute reported stockpiles rose by almost 3 million barrels last week, according to people familiar with the data.The recent plunge in oil may put pressure on OPEC+ to do more to try and stem the slide, with the group meeting next week to decide on its production policy for May. Despite the decline, crude is still up almost 20% this year, and as Covid-19 vaccinations accelerate worldwide, there is confidence greater mobility will boost fuel consumption in the longer term.“Oil’s had a deep correction because of near-term demand, but the outlook that consumption will improve remains valid in the longer term,” said Will Sungchil Yun, a senior commodities analyst at VI Investment Corp. in Seoul. Price gains due to the Suez Canal blockage will be temporary, he added.The prompt timespread for global benchmark Brent crude flipped to a bearish contango structure on Tuesday -- where near-dated contracts are cheaper than later-dated ones. It was 3 cents in contango on Wednesday, compared with a bullish backwardation of 67 cents at the start of the month.The Suez Canal is frequently used by tankers transporting crude from the world’s top exporters in the Middle East to customers across Europe and the U.S., and also by ships moving cargoes from the North Sea to Asia. The 400-meter long container ship Ever Given’s hull became wedged length-ways across the canal on Tuesday, causing a gridlock of at least 100 vessels.“It could be having a bit of an impact when you consider about 10% of total seaborne oil trade goes through the Suez Canal, but I imagine any disruption would be very temporary,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy for ING Group in Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-gets-suez-blockage-bounce-following-demand-driven-selloff-101616570384198.html
24-03-2021||World||Canada considering warning labels for AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccines||Canadian health authorities are considering adding a warning label on vials of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, cautioning their users in the country about the rare possibility of the jab causing blood clots.During a media interaction on Tuesday, Health Canada’s chief medical adviser Dr Supriya Sharma said the agency is looking at “changes” to the “information that goes with the vaccine to say there have been reports of this type of rare clot”. She, however, said the vaccine is still considered “appropriate” for those above 18 years of age and the recommendation that it should be administered won’t change.Two iterations of the AZ vaccine were given emergency-use authorisation in Canada on February 26. Canada recently received its first batches of the AZ vaccine under the brand name Covishield, manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).Sharma said that “even the most effective vaccine only works if people trust it and agree to receive it”. She added, “At this point in time, we, of course, believe that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine continue to outweigh the risks.”Canadian health authorities have warned that the race between Covid-19 vaccines and newly-detected variants of the coronavirus is close, especially with the mutations spreading quickly and affecting younger people.Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr Theresa Tam, pointed to the B117 variant, which appears to have originated in the UK, saying it could increase hospitalisations and provoke severe outcomes within younger demographics.In a statement released by the Public Health Agency of Canada, Tam noted the country has recorded nearly 5,500 Covid-19 cases caused by variants, with over 90% attributable to the B117 strain. “As the number of new variant cases continues to increase, they account for a greater proportion of Covid-19 cases across Canada, reminding us of how tight the vaccines-versus-variants race continues to be,” Tam said.Tam also said these variants spread more rapidly with a higher reproduction rate. Of the infections reported in Canada caused by new strains, 5,117 were caused by the B117 variant, 244 by the South African-origin B1351 one, and 124 by the P1 strain from Brazil.Over 3,600 new cases related to the pandemic were reported on Tuesday in Canada, an increase of nearly 25% over the daily figure a fortnight back. Canada has so far recorded 942,325 confirmed cases and 22,735 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-considering-warning-labels-for-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccines-101616570582615.html
24-03-2021||World||Netanyahu urges rival parties to join Likud-led coalition govt||After claiming a 'giant victory' in the parliamentary election, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pleaded with members of rival parties to put aside personal differences and partner with him to create a coalition government, warning of a fifth rapid-free election otherwise.Netanyahu may have recognised that he may fall short of the votes he needs to build a viable coalition after a fourth indecisive election, according to The Times of Israel."A clear majority" of the newly-elected 120 Members of Knesset (MK) share his overall policies and thus he intended to spend the next few days talking with all MKs who might be willing to help build a stable government, said the Prime Minister.The only alternative to a coalition under his leadership would be another national vote, he reiterated.As ballots were being counted through the night, updated exit polls suggested neither Netanyahu nor any of his rivals had a clear path to a Knesset majority.In the fourth election in two years, over 63 per cent votes have been counted as of Wednesday, but no clear winner has emerged so far, according to The Times of Israel.Netanyahu's right-wing religious bloc has a slim majority together with Yamina, but the results are expected to shift as more votes are counted.Due to a similar deadlock in elections held a year ago, Netanyahu had persuaded his main challenger at the time, Blue and White leader Benny Gantz, to join him in an "emergency unity government."However, Netanyahu's coalition deal with Gantz last December, when he failed to pass a state budget and the Knesset automatically dissolved for these elections. Since then, Gantz had vowed to never again partner with Netanyahu, reported The Times of Israel.After an exhausting campaign, the 71-year-old premier, hailed his Likud party's "extraordinary achievement" in winning a projected 30-plus seats in Tuesday's vote. He then highlighted his outgoing government's achievements -- notably including a world-leading C-19 vaccination campaign, a series of peace agreements, and a firm stance against Iran's aggression and nuclear weapons goals."With this majority, we have to build a stable Israeli government. I stretch out my hand to all MKs who believe in this path; I don't rule anybody out. I expect all who believe in our principles to act in a similar fashion," he said.Netanyahu, who has held power since 2009, and also served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999, is also on trial in three corruption cases, with the evidentiary stage set to start on April 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-urges-rival-parties-to-join-likud-led-coalition-govt-101616566118892.html

24-03-2021||World||Explained: Calls for gun controls in US and the politics over them||The shooting in Boulder, Colorado on Monday which left 10 people dead has started the conversation on federal action on gun control in the United States of America. The shooting was the second deadly shooting in the US in a week and has put pressure on President Joe Biden who said during his presidential campaign that he would take strict action on gun control if voted to power. “I don’t need to wait another minute – let alone an hour – to take common sense steps that will save lives in the future, and I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act,” President Biden said on Tuesday after the shooting.The politics over gun controls in AmericaThe second amendment of the United States constitution says, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." This gives rights to US citizens to bear arms but the debate around gun controls is defined by two primary ideologies: Most Republicans advocate for decreasing regulations with respect to gun ownership while most Democrats advocate for regulation over gun ownership. The former promote the idea of use of firearms for self-defense as well as for sporting activities while the latter believe that gun control would lead to safer communities.What is the history of gun control laws in America?The history of gun control laws in America began with the Gun Control Act of 1968 which established minimum age for firearms purchases. This law was amended in 1986, easing restrictions on firearm sellers by allowing the sale by licensed deals away from the location shown on their license. In 1993, through the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, a five-day waiting period was imposed on the purchase of handguns thereby giving time for background checks which was later replaced by an instant check system, which could be extended by three days. In 1994, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban was enacted which prohibited the manufacture, transfer and possession of semi-automatic assault weapons and the transfer and possession of large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. The law expired in 2004.In the wake of the December 2012 Connecticut school shooting, a bipartisan gun control bill was introduced in 2013 but failed in the Senate. After the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, then President Barack Obama signed executive orders designed to strengthen background checks in 2016. In February 2017, then President Donald Trump signed a measure rolling back an Obama order that made it harder for the mentally ill to buy guns and then in December 2018, the administration banned the type of high-powered gun attachments used in the Las Vegas massacre. In February 2019, another bill to expand background checks died in the Senate.What are the new bills that are being considered this time?Earlier this month, the House of Representatives passed two bills aimed at increasing background checks of gun owners and these bills will face the Senate where Republican votes will be needed for them to pass. Other than background checks, the bills also focus on closing loopholes which allow some licensed gun sales to go through before a required background check is done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-calls-for-gun-controls-in-us-and-the-politics-over-them-101616562904574.html

Officials said the man had yet to be identified and no other details were available.Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales (NSW), the worst-hit state, warned that water levels would keep rising in some areas as major dams continued to overflow and rivers bulged."What we still have to be aware of is the fact that thousands and thousands of people are still on evacuation warnings, that the rivers will continue to swell, that catchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years," Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.The Insurance Council of Australia, the peak industry body, said about 17,000 damages claims worth around A$254.2 million ($193.32 million) had been lodged by Wednesday morning across NSW and Queensland.Homes have been submerged, livestock swept away and crops drowned on a large scale. There have also been many animal rescues, with water craft used to move dogs, cattle, and even an emu, away from the flood waters. In the country's arid centre, water cascaded down Uluru, a rare phenomenon described by the national park on social media as "unique and extraordinary."RECOVERY BEGINSAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday that heavy-load helicopters would be prepared to transport food to supermarkets where supplies were running short."The expanse of water that went right across that region was quite devastating to see," Morrison said in parliament after he toured flood-affected areas by helicopter.Several hundred Australian Defence Force personnel will be sent to flood-affected areas in the country's east over the next few days to help in the recovery, Australia's Emergency Management minister David Littleproud said on Wednesday."Their job will be out there cleaning up, making sure that we get rid of the debris, having boots on the ground," Littleproud said.Australian Rail Track Corp (ARTC) partially reopened Hunter Valley coal rail lines to Newcastle, the world's biggest coal export port, on Wednesday.The Hunter Valley rail network serves mines run by BHP Group, Glencore Plc, New Hope Corp, Whitehaven Coal and Yancoal Australia, among others.The Port of Newcastle, which last year shipped 158 million tonnes of coal, slowed ship movements earlier in the week but said on Wednesday it was continuing to operate.Forecasters said the weather system will shift to the island state of Tasmania on Wednesday, bringing heavy rains and localised flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-floods-claim-first-fatality-more-evacuations-as-clean-up-begins-101616563101945.html
24-03-2021||World||North Korea test-fired short-range missiles, says US||North Korea tested several short-range missiles during the weekend, senior US officials said on Tuesday, in a first such military activity by Pyongyang after US President Joe Biden took office.The officials, however, played down the tests, saying they were in the “low end” of the spectrum of provocative actions Pyongyang is known to undertake to send a message to the United States. The systems used in the weekend tests were not covered by UN missile testing bans.South Korea’s defence ministry said two missiles were fired from South Pyongan province on Sunday morning and flew over the sea between the peninsula and China, according to a Bloomberg report.The Biden administration remains open to a dialogue with North Korea, the US officials said. Its North Korea policy review is in the “final stages” and a draft will be discussed next week at a meeting US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is hosting with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea.Asked about the missile tests, Biden told reporters, “We have learned that… nothing much has changed.”The weekend tests followed warnings last week from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo-jong to the Biden administration in view of its North Korea policy review, and upcoming visits of US secretary of state Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin to South Korea and Japan for their respective 2+2 bilateral dialogues.“A word of advice to the new administration of the United States that is struggling to spread the smell of gunpowder on our land from across the ocean,” she was quoted as saying in official media. “If it wants to sleep in peace for (the) coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.”Former US president Donald Trump’s two summit meetings with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un in Singapore in 2018 and in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2019 had raised hopes of an agreement over nuclear disarmament and sanctions.But, as one of the officials told reporters on Tuesday, “It’s over a year ago now - there has been actually very little dialogue or interaction between the United States and North Korea (since).”The official added, “We are on our forward foot, in terms of wanting to clearly signal that we are prepared for continuing engagement in northeast Asia with key partners and indeed with North Korea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-test-fired-short-range-missiles-says-us-101616562542131.html
24-03-2021||World||North Korea fires cruise missiles in first such test since July||North Korea fired off a pair of cruise missiles on the heels of an Asian trip by top US officials, putting a fresh spotlight on Biden administration deliberations over how to resolve a key security dilemma.The two missiles were fired from South Pyongan province Sunday morning and flew over the sea between the peninsula and China, the South Korean Defense Ministry said Wednesday. Earlier, US officials in Washington had confirmed the test of a “short-range system,” adding that the incident didn’t appear to violate a United Nations ban on ballistic missile launches by the country.While launching cruise missiles isn’t prohibited by UN resolutions, Kim Jong Un had refrained from such provocations since testing an anti-ship weapons system in July. The move came days after US officials led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken huddled with South Korean counterparts in Seoul as part of President Joe Biden’s effort to craft a strategy for rolling back North Korea’s nuclear program.The decision to withhold news of the launch until after the Washington Post reported it Tuesday was consistent with efforts under former President Donald Trump to avoid being drawn into another crisis with North Korea. Trump had often sought to play down such launches, including tests of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles that violate UN resolutions and pose a more serious threat to American troops and U.S. allies in Japan and South Korea.Asked about the launch during a trip to Ohio, Biden said only that he had learned that “nothing much has changed,” without elaborating. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will host his counterparts from Japan and South Korea next week to discuss North Korea as part of broader administration efforts to craft a coordinated strategy toward North Korea.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato declined to comment on the incident Wednesday. “We will continue to cooperate closely with the U.S. and South Korea to gather and analyze information on North Korea’s military activities, while doing all we can to stay on the alert,” Kato said in Tokyo.The Biden administration’s policy review has included talks with former Trump officials. Those discussions included an acknowledgment that following Trump’s second summit with Kim in February 2019, there had been very little communication with the North Korean regime, the current U.S. officials said Tuesday.Kim has continued to expand and upgrade his nuclear weapons program, despite agreeing to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” during his unprecedented first meeting with Trump in 2018. Since talks broke down, he has engaged in a sporadic series of provocations, blowing up a liaison office build by South Korea last year and parading a new intercontinental ballistic missile through Pyongyang in October.Pyongyang has recently stepped up its criticism of Washington, with Kim reiterating that U.S. was his “biggest main enemy” in January and a top diplomat last week calling Biden’s outreach for talks a “time-delaying trick.” Kim and Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent days reaffirmed the need to improve ties, as both neighbors face the prospect of a renewed push by American allies.North Korea needs to resume talks with the US to get out from under crushing UN sanctions that have helped push its economy toward what outside observers believe is the worst downturn in two decades. Kim appears to seeking a way to draw concessions from the administration without provoking more penalties from the international community.Blinken shrugged off North Korean criticism during his visit to Seoul last week, saying the US was focused on consulting partners to draft policy plans.“There are different kinds of pressure points that might convince North Korea to make progress,” Blinken said after meeting South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-young and Defense Minister Suh Wook. “The goal is to really figure out how we have the best chance in resolving the challenges posed by North Korea to us and unfortunately to its own people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-cruise-missiles-in-first-such-test-since-july-101616561160880.html
24-03-2021||World||Exit polls indicate no clear winner in Israeli elections, Netanyahu claims 'great victory'||Israeli parliamentary elections on Tuesday resulted in a virtual deadlock for a fourth time in the past two years, exit polls indicated, leaving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with an uncertain future and the country facing the prospect of continued political gridlock.The exit polls on Israel’s three main TV stations indicated that both Netanyahu and his religious and nationalist allies, along with an anti-Netanyahu group of parties, both fell short of the parliamentary majority required to form a new government. That raised the possibility of an unprecedented fifth consecutive election later this year.The election was seen as a referendum on Netanyahu’s polarizing leadership style, and the initial results showed that the country remains as deeply divided as ever, with an array of small sectarian parties dominating the parliament.The results also signaled a continuing shift of the Israeli electorate toward the right wing, which supports West Bank settlements and opposes concessions in peace talks with the Palestinians. That trend was highlighted by the strong showing of an ultranationalist anti-Arab religious party.After three previous inconclusive elections, Netanyahu is hoping to form a government with his traditional ultra-Orthodox and hard-line nationalist allies that will grant him immunity from corruption charges. Despite the inconclusive results, Netanyahu claimed his Likud party had claimed a “great victory” with fellow right-wing parties.“It is clear that a clear majority of Israeli citizens are right wing, and they want a strong and stable right wing government that will protect the economy of Israel, security of Israel and land of Israel. This is what we will do,” he said on Facebook.By early Wednesday, updated exit polls on two channels were forecasting an evenly divided parliament. The third station gave Netanyahu's opponents a one-seat advantage.Exit polls have often been imprecise in the past, meaning the final results, expected in the coming days, could still shift the balance of power. If the final results are in line with the exit polls, there is no guarantee that Netanyahu or his opponents will succeed in putting together a coalition.“All three options are on the table: a Netanyahu-led government, a change coalition that will leave Netanyahu in the opposition, and an interim government leading to a fifth election,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.Several right-wing parties have vowed never to sit in a government with Netanyahu. And Naftali Bennett, a former Netanyahu ally turned harsh critic, refused to endorse either side during the campaign.Bennett shares Netanyahu's hard-line nationalist ideology and would seem to be more likely to ultimately join the prime minister. But Bennett has not ruled out joining forces with Netanyahu’s opponents.In a speech to his supporters, Bennett declined to take sides. He vowed to promote right-wing values but also took several veiled swipes at the prime minister's leadership style.“Now is the time for healing,” he said. “The norms of the past will no longer be acceptable.” He said he would move the country “from leadership that is interested in itself to a professional leadership that cares.”Bennett has indicated he will drive a hard bargain with Netanyahu, demanding senior Cabinet ministries and perhaps even a power-sharing arrangement that includes a stint as prime minister.In addition, their partners would also include a pair of ultra-Orthodox religious parties and the “Religious Zionists,” a party whose leaders are openly racist and homophobic. One of its leaders, Itamir Ben-Gvir, is a disciple of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose Kach party was branded a terrorist group by the U.S. for its anti-Arab racism before Kahane was assassinated in New York in 1990.Relying on the party could be deeply embarrassing for Netanyahu on the international stage, particularly as he tries to court the new Biden administration.The election campaign was largely devoid of substance and was seen instead as a referendum on Netanyahu’s divisive rule.During the campaign, Netanyahu emphasized Israel’s highly successful coronavirus vaccination campaign. He moved aggressively to secure enough vaccines for Israel’s 9.3 million people, and in three months the country has inoculated some 80% of its adult population. That has enabled the government to open restaurants, stores and the airport just in time for election day.He also tried to portray himself as a global statesman, pointing to the four diplomatic accords he reached with Arab countries last year. Those agreements were brokered by his close ally, then-President Donald Trump.Netanyahu’s opponents say the prime minister bungled many other aspects of the pandemic, particularly by allowing his ultra-Orthodox allies to ignore lockdown rules and fuel a high infection rate for much of the year.Over 6,000 Israelis have died from Covid-19, and the economy continues to struggle with double-digit unemployment.They also point to Netanyahu’s corruption trial, saying someone who is under indictment for serious crimes is not fit to lead the country. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals that he dismisses as a witch hunt by a hostile media and legal system.Even Netanyahu’s reputation as a statesman has suffered in recent days. The United Arab Emirates, the most important of the four Arab nations to establish official diplomatic ties with Israel, last week made clear that it did not want to be used as part of Netanyahu’s re-election bid after he was forced to call off a visit to the country. The Biden administration also has kept its distance, a contrast to the support he received in past elections from Trump.Netanyahu’s Likud party was projected to emerge as the largest individual party, with just over 30 seats in the 120-seat parliament, followed by the centrist opposition party Yesh Atid, with some 17 seats.The remainder of the parliament would be divided between some 10 other small parties. These range from an Arab party to left-wing secular parties to a pair of secular, right-wing parties that oppose Netanyahu.Altogether, Netanyahu and his allies were projected to control 53 to 54 seats, while his opponents are expected to control some 60 or 61, with Bennett controlling the remainder.Netanyahu’s opponents included a diverse array of parties that had little in common beyond their shared animosity toward him. Even if his opponents end up controlling a majority of seats, it will be difficult for them to bridge their ideological differences on such lightning rod issues as Palestinian statehood and the role of religion in the country.They also were hurt by the disintegration of the main Arab party in parliament. A renegade member ran separately but appeared not to win enough seats to enter parliament, robbing the alliance of key votes.Tuesday’s election was sparked by the disintegration of an emergency government formed last May between Netanyahu and his chief rival at the time. The alliance was plagued by infighting, and elections were forced after they failed to agree on a budget in December.Netanyahu’s opponents have accused him of fomenting deadlock in hopes of bringing about a friendlier parliament that will grant him immunity from prosecution.After the results come in, attention will turn to the country’s figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin.He will hold a series of meetings with party leaders and then choose the one he believes has the best chance of forming a government as his prime minister-designate. That could set off weeks of horse-trading.Voting in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Rivlin said the deadlock has had a price.“Four elections in two years erode public trust in the democratic process,” he said, even as he urged Israelis to vote again. “There is no other way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exit-polls-indicate-no-clear-winner-in-israeli-elections-netanyahu-claims-great-victory-101616560904433.html
24-03-2021||World||Senators back off vow to withhold support of Biden nominees||Two Democratic senators who said they would not support President Joe Biden's nominations to fill administration posts until the White House better promoted diversity reversed their stances Tuesday after the White House said it would add an Asian American Pacific Islander liaison to its staff.Sens. Tammy of Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii had lashed out earlier in the day at the lack of Asian American and Pacific Islander representation in Biden's Cabinet. The only senators of Asian American heritage, they said they would withhold their support for his nominees until the diversity issue was addressed.With the announcement of the liaison Tuesday night, Duckworth's spokesman said the senator would not stand in the way of “qualified nominees — which will include more AAPI leaders.”“Senator Duckworth appreciates the Biden Administration’s assurances that it will do much more to elevate AAPI voices and perspectives at the highest levels of government, including appointing an AAPI senior White House official to represent the community, secure the confirmation of AAPI appointments and advance policy proposals that are relevant and important to the community,” spokesman Ben Garmisa said in a statement.Duckworth had said earlier that she raised the issue with top Biden advisers on Tuesday and afterward called the situation “not acceptable."“I’ve been talking to them for months and they’re still not aggressive, so I’m not going to be voting for any nominee from the White House other than diversity nominees,” Duckworth told reporters. “I’ll be a no on everyone until they figure this out.”That had prompted Hirono to join her. But Hirono later said in a statement of her own that she too welcomed the appointment of an AAPI White House liaison and was dropping her objections.“Based on the private conversation we had, I will continue voting to confirm the historic and highly qualified nominees President Biden has appointed to serve in his administration,” Hirono said.The threats to withhold support could have complicated matters for Biden as he moves forward with other high-level administration and judicial appointments that require confirmation in an evenly divided Senate where Vice President Kamala Harris holds a tie-breaking vote.Katherine Tai, who is Taiwanese American, is in the Cabinet as Biden's top trade envoy. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the son of Indian parents, was confirmed Tuesday as surgeon general, a sub-Cabinet position.“The President has made it clear that his Administration will reflect the diversity of the country," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. “That has always been, and remains our goal.”Biden had defended the makeup of his Cabinet to reporters Tuesday evening, saying, “We have the most diverse Cabinet in history.” He added, “We have a lot of Asian Americans that are in the Cabinet and in sub-Cabinet levels."Asian American and Pacific Islander elected officials and activists are hoping that last week's shootings at spas around Atlanta that killed eight people, six of them women of Asian descent, will prompt the community to demand greater representation in government."We’re not just calling for API’s. This is not about pitting one diversity group against them. So I’m happy to vote for a Hispanic or Black person and LGBTQ person and AAPI person," Hirono said in joining Duckworth. "I just like to see more diversity representation.”Duckworth is of Thai descent and was mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for Biden before he settled on Harris, the first Black and Indian American woman to hold the vice presidency. Duckworth, who had also been under consideration for a Cabinet role, noted that presidents over the last 20 years have included AAPI people in their Cabinets.Tai, who was confirmed last week, is the first Asian American and first woman of color to serve as U.S. trade representative.Biden also nominated Neera Tanden to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget, but she withdrew her nomination after it became clear she would have difficulty winning confirmation. Tanden faced opposition from Republicans and Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, over insulting tweets aimed at Republican lawmakers that she posted prior to her nomination.Duckworth said administration officials in her initial conversation Tuesday noted the selections of Tai and Tanden, who are both high-level picks but not part of the president’s Cabinet, when she raised her concerns.That didn’t sit well with her.“To be told that, well, you have Kamala Harris, we’re very proud of her, you don’t need anybody else, is insulting,” Duckworth said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senators-back-off-vow-to-withhold-support-of-biden-nominees-101616560562507.html
24-03-2021||World||US, Mexico discuss immigration in high level meetings||A US delegation discussed immigration and regional development in a series of meetings in Mexico Tuesday at a time when the rising number of migrants arriving at their shared border has raised concerns in both countries.The administration of President Joe Biden is worried about the number of migrant families and unaccompanied children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months.Former U.S. ambassador Roberta Jacobson, the White House’s lead adviser on the border, and Juan González, the National Security Council’s senior director for the Western Hemisphere, were accompanied by Ricardo Zúñiga, the newly named Special Envoy for the Northern Triangle.The new U.S. administration has started to dismantle Trump-era policies that made it more difficult for asylum seekers, but have maintained some like the pandemic-related policy invoked by Trump that allowed it to continue to return the majority of border crossers to Mexico.In a meeting with Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, the two delegations discussed “humanitarian actions to spur, in the short term, an inclusive economic development in northern Central America,” according to a statement released by the Mexican government.Ebrard later emphasized the shared goal of development in the region to address migration.“If we persevere and act together ... we can achieve that these countries and southern Mexico have a different future, have other possibilities,” he said. “That no one has to migrate due to poverty, insecurity, desperation.”The so-called Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have been the largest source of migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border in recent years. Plagued by endemic corruption and violence, and more recently devastated by two major hurricanes in November and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, migrants continue to stream out of those countries.Confusion and misinformation over Biden’s seemingly more humane approach to immigrants and asylum seekers has been a contributing factor. Many migrants sensing a change in attitude from the heavy-handed Trump policies set out during the first months of the year to try their luck.Jacobson took the opportunity to again try to send a clear message to those thinking about migrating to the U.S. “Don’t come to the border. The border is closed,” Jacobson said in Spanish in a message released by the U.S. embassy in Mexico.She noted the danger of migrant smugglers and of traveling during the pandemic. “Stay at home, stay safe and wait for more information about the asylum process.”Mexico finds itself once again under pressure to slow the movement of migrants across its territory. Last week, the government announced it was imposing new measures at its southern border that would permit only essential crossings due to pandemic concerns. But coming a year after the start of the pandemic many observers saw it only as a cover for more immigration enforcement.At the same time, Mexico deployed more immigration agents to the south and said it would focus on intercepting unaccompanied children and families with children trying to reach the northern border. That announcement was criticized for coming on the same day that the U.S. agreed to send COVID-19 vaccine to Mexico.In 2019, Mexico deployed its newly created National Guard to bolster immigration enforcement under pressure from the Trump administration, which had threatened crippling tariffs on all Mexican imports.The Biden administration is taking a more diplomatic approach, but similarly needs Mexico’s cooperation. Mexico has faced criticism for essentially extending U.S. immigration policy to its own southern border. In return, Mexico has pushed the U.S. government to support more development projects in the region. Biden has spoken of sending $4 billion in development aid.Both sides they were focused on protecting the human rights of migrants, but ensuring a safe and orderly migration. Ultimately, they want to reduce the push factors driving migrants from their countries. The focus has been on economic factors, but yet to be seen is how the new U.S. administration will address touchier subjects like corruption in the region.Gladys McCormick, an associate professor in history at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, said that while the Biden administration was employing a more diplomatic approach than Trump did, the U.S. delegation came in wanting “to have the Mexicans do some of their dirty work, which is yet again to stop the flow of people coming in on the southern border.”The situation is also an opportunity for Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to extract more from the United States, she said. More help in facing the pandemic is one thing López Obrador already said he asked of Biden. Additional resources to help Mexico deal with the migrants gathering at their shared border could be another, McCormick said.It is also a welcome distraction for López Obrador, McCormick said, noting that organized crime and the economic havoc caused by the pandemic weren’t mentioned in Mexico’s statement.“(López Obrador) needs this as a way sort of to deflect attention from what’s going on in Mexico now, especially in the lead up to the mid-term elections this summer,” she said.Part of the U.S. delegation was scheduled to hold meetings in Guatemala Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mexico-discuss-immigration-in-high-level-meetings-101616549925601.html
24-03-2021||World||Myanmar set for silent strike after violence claims youngest victim||Myanmar activists plan more anti-coup protests on Wednesday, including a silent strike with many businesses due to close and calls for people to stay home, a day after a seven-year-old girl was killed in her home when security forces opened fire during a crackdown in Mandalay.Pro-democracy protesters also held more candle-lit vigils overnight including in a district of the commercial capital Yangon and in Thahton in Mon State.The vigils came after staff at a funeral service in Mandalay told Reuters on Tuesday that a seven-year-old girl had died of bullet wounds in the city - the youngest victim so far in a bloody crackdown of opposition to the Feb. 1 coup.Soldiers shot at her father but hit the girl who was sitting on his lap inside their home, her sister told the Myanmar Now media outlet. Two men were also killed in the district, it said.The military had no immediate comment on the incident.In what has now often become a deadly game of cat and mouse with security forces during street protests, pro-democracy activists switched tactics and planned to hold a silent strike on Wednesday."No going out, no shops, no working. All shut down. Just for one day," Nobel Aung, an illustrator and activist told Reuters.Social media posts and media indicated a range of businesses from ride hailers to pharmacies planned to close.The junta has faced international condemnation for staging the coup that halted Myanmar's slow transition to democracy and for its lethal suppression of the protests that followed.It has tried to justify the takeover by saying a Nov. 8 election won by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was fraudulent - an accusation the electoral commission has rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency.SUU KYI COURT HEARINGJunta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said on Tuesday 164 protesters had been killed and expressed sadness at the deaths, a day after the European Union and the United States imposed more sanctions on groups or individuals linked to the coup.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group says at least 275 people have been killed in the security forces' crackdown.Zaw Min Tun blamed the bloodshed on the protesters and said nine members of the security forces had been also killed.He said strikes and hospitals not fully operating had caused deaths, including from COVID-19, calling them "undutiful and unethical".Opponents of military rule have regularly called for strikes and also a civil disobedience campaign, including among civil servants, that has paralysed parts of the economy.The junta spokesman also accused media of "fake news" and fanning unrest and said reporters could be prosecuted if they were in contact with the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), as the remnants of Suu Kyi's government is known. The military has declared the CRPH an illegal organisation and said membership is punishable by death.He also gave details that he said showed how the NLD had created hundreds or even thousands of extra ballots by inventing voters, including in Suu Kyi's own constituency.The NLD has denied making any attempt to rig the election.Also shown at the junta news conference was video testimony of former Yangon chief minister Phyo Min Thein saying he visited Suu Kyi multiple times and gave her money "whenever needed".Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, has been in detention since the coup and faces charges that her lawyer says have been cooked up to discredit her.The ousted leader is due to appear for another court hearing via video conferencing on Wednesday after a previous hearing had to be adjourned due to internet problems.(Reporting by Reuters Staff; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Michael Perry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-set-for-silent-strike-after-violence-claims-youngest-victim-101616552559617.html

The South American country has reported more than 2.3 million coronavirus infections and 62,274 deaths. It has administered more than 1.23 million vaccine doses so far.From Friday to Monday and then from March 31 to April 5, people will be restricted as to when they can enter supermarkets, banks and shopping centers, depending on their national identity card numbers in all municipalities where ICU occupancy exceeds 70%."This measure is preventive and necessary so that we don't experience a severe third peak (of coronavirus) in the next few weeks, or in April or May," Duque said in his nightly broadcast on the pandemic.Restrictions on mobility will also be imposed from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. over those dates in municipalities where ICU occupancy tops 70%, Duque said.In municipalities where ICU occupancy rates exceed 50%, curfews will be imposed from midnight until 5 a.m., he added.Colombia's capital, Bogota, which has 8 million inhabitants, has an ICU occupancy rate of 61.3%, while the next two largest cities, Medellin and Cali, have occupancy rates of 84.5% and 78.8%, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombia-imposes-new-restrictions-to-avoid-severe-third-covid-19-wave-101616549936510.html
24-03-2021||World||News media seeing 'post-Trump slump' as passions cool||Tensions have cooled between the news media and the White House after four tumultuous years -- potentially bad news for outlets struggling with a long downtrend in the industry.The so-called "Trump bump" which boosted viewers and subscriptions at outlets such as CNN and the New York Times now appears to have turned into a slump following the departure of Donald Trump from the presidency.At CNN -- which was at loggerheads with Trump for much of his tenure -- viewership in prime time has slid some 50 percent in March 2021 compared with a year ago, with smaller declines for cable news rivals Fox News Channel and MSNBC, according to Nielsen data.Online visits to the New York Times fell 30 percent from November to February and 27 percent at the Washington Post, according to the research firm ComScore.Some of the declines can be attributed to a falloff from the contentious election season, but they also underline the harsh economic realities facing the news media which predate the Trump era."This is not a new economic reality, we've seen this downtrend for years," said Adam Chiara, a communications professor at the University of Hartford.Chiara said the Trump years gave a "temporary bump" to news organizations like the New York Times, which has seen sharp gains in digital subscribers, and CNN, which had a strong following.But the long-term trend, Chiara said, is people moving away from traditional cable bundles and newspaper subscriptions, relying instead on online platforms."Almost all my students are getting their news from social media," he said.The Trump era was one of solid growth for key news outlets, especially those that served as a watchdog on the US leader. The number of CNN viewers doubled since 2014, while MSNBC's tripled.The New York Times has boosted the number of subscribers to more than seven million, but analysts warn that future growth may be limited.- Fewer eyeballs -Boston University political communications professor Tobe Berkovitz said many legacy outlets are facing a reckoning now in the on-demand digital economy after the intensity of the Trump era."Trump was the goose that laid the golden egg and that was especially true for the cable networks and dominant newspapers," Berkovitz said.The lack of drama in Washington, Berkovitz said, means "fewer eyeballs" for media outlets, which translates into declining ad revenues and subscriptions, deepening their economic woes.Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of the Hofstra University school of communications, said Americans may be ready for a break from the intense period of news over the past few years during which Trump attacked the media as scandals were unearthed about his administration."I think people were exhausted by the drama and the tension, and probably quite understandably, are turning back to some other interests in their lives, to their families, to their kids, to their work, to their lives and away from the news," Lukasiewicz said."I don't think it's simply the departure of Donald Trump. I'm sure Donald Trump would like to think that his presence alone controls the success of news media. In the United States, I just don't think that's true."Berkovitz maintained however that President Joe Biden is "a boring guy" who doesn't generate much drama, making it more difficult to attract readers and viewers.After a period in which the news was equated to drama, "viewers are saying they need a time out," Berkovitz said. "They will watch Netflix, Amazon or Apple (shows) as a break from the hysteria."New York Times chief executive Meredith Kopit Levien said in February the media group has proven its value through a variety of major news events."The news cycle will change and audience will fluctuate," she said but added that "we are well positioned to deliver continuous growth" in 2021 and beyond.Analysts said the Trump years demonstrated to many Americans the value of an independent media serving as a watchdog on political leaders, but that it is unclear if the impact will last."Their challenge is to show they have premium content whether it is analysis, reporting or investigative reporting that is worth paying the price," Berkovitz said.Chiara said more people are seeing the value of news, "but the question will be whether it translates into more subscriptions. So far there's no evidence to show that's the case."tu-rl/bgs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/news-media-seeing-post-trump-slump-as-passions-cool-101616549975560.html
24-03-2021||World||Rejecting US peace plan, Afghan president to offer election in 6 months||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will propose a new presidential election within six months, under a peace plan he will put forward as a counter-offer to a U.S. proposal that he rejects, two senior government officials told Reuters.Ghani will unveil his proposal at an international gathering in Turkey next month, signalling his refusal to accept Washington's plan for his elected government to be replaced by an interim administration, the officials said.Washington, which agreed last year to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by May 1 after nearly two decades, is pressing for a peace deal to end war between the government and the Taliban. Talks between the Afghan sides in Qatar have stalled.U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been circulating a proposal which would replace the Kabul government with an interim administration. But Ghani has voiced vehement opposition to any solution that requires his government to step aside for unelected successors."The counterproposal which we are going to present at the Istanbul meeting would be to call for early presidential elections if the Taliban agree on a ceasefire," one senior government official said on condition of anonymity.Another Afghan government official said: "The president would never agree to step aside and any future government should be formed through democratic process, not a political deal."A third senior official also said Ghani's proposal would include possible early elections, although he did not specify the exact time frame for the vote. The third official said Ghani had already shared his road map with Khalilzad.US SEEKING SUPPORTWith just weeks left before a deadline it agreed with Taliban last year to end the longest war in U.S. history, Washington is seeking regional backing for its approach to push the Kabul government and insurgents to share power.But diplomats and foreign officials have said it will be difficult to move forward with the U.S. plans without Ghani's support.During a visit to the region, which included stops in Doha and Islamabad, Khalilzad pushed for a conference to be hosted by Turkey with involvement from the United Nations next month.The Afghan officials said that as part of Ghani's counter-proposal, his government would ask the U.N. to closely observe the new election to ensure it is accepted by all sides.A presidential palace spokesman declined to comment.Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban in Qatar's capital Doha have made little progress, while violence has increased.The Taliban -- fighting the foreign-backed government since being ousted from power by Afghan opponents and U.S. air strikes in late 2001 -- have so far rejected a ceasefire and said they would not directly join an interim government.Ghani was sworn in as president for a second five-year term in March last year after a disputed presidential election.The new U.S. administration led by President Joe Biden is reviewing its plans before May 1, the deadline agreed last year under the Donald Trump administration for the last 2,500 U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan. Biden told broadcaster ABC last week that it would be "tough" to meet the deadline.The Taliban say there will be consequences if the United States does not meet the deadline to pull out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rejecting-us-peace-plan-afghan-president-to-offer-election-in-6-months-101616552726090.html

24-03-2021||World||Russian President Putin gets a jab of Covid vaccine||Russian President Vladimir Putin was vaccinated against Covid-19 Tuesday out of sight of the cameras, his spokesman said, prompting questions about whether the gesture will boost comparatively low immunisation rates in Russia.Dmitry Peskov said Putin is feeling fine after getting the shot and is planning a regular workday Wednesday.He explained earlier Tuesday that the president would get the vaccine out of the public eye because “when it comes to getting vaccinated on camera, he has never supported that, he doesn't like that”.Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePeskov wouldn't reveal whether Putin would go to a vaccination facility or the shot would be brought to him in his office or residence, saying only that “it will done in a way that would the least affect” Putin's working schedule.Putin announced that he would get vaccinated at a government meeting the day before. The statement came several months after widespread immunisation against COVID-19 kicked off in Russia. Kremlin critics have argued that Putin's reluctance to get vaccinated was contributing to the already existing public hesitancy about the vaccine.Only 6.3 million people, or 4.3% of Russia's 146-million population, have received at least one dose of a vaccine. It lags behind a number of other countries in terms of the vaccination rate.Surveys by Russia's top independent pollster, Levada Centre, have shown that the number of Russians reluctant to get vaccinated with the domestically developed Sputnik V shot has grown in recent months — to 62% in February from 58% in December.Pressed by reporters over whether Putin should get vaccinated on camera in order to boost slow vaccination rates, Peskov argued that Russians “will hear” about the president's vaccination and that Putin is already doing “a lot" for promoting the vaccination campaign.“The president ... dedicates a rather significant time in his working hours to events, discussions, meetings related to vaccination, production of vaccines and so on. So the president does a lot for propaganda of the vaccines,” Peskov said.The Kremlin spokesman refused to reveal which of the three vaccines authorised for use in Russia Putin will receive, saying only that all three are “absolutely good, reliable, effective.”Russian authorities have given regulatory approval to three domestically developed shots — Sputnik V, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac. All three received the authorisation before completing advanced trials experts say are necessary to ensure their safety and effectiveness in line with established scientific protocol.However, a recent study in the British medical journal the Lancet showed that Sputnik V is 91% effective and appears to prevent inoculated individuals from becoming severely ill with COVID-19, although it's still unclear whether the vaccine can prevent the spread of the disease. No data on efficacy of the two other vaccines have been released.Russia has been actively marketing Sputnik V abroad, despite the slow rollout at home and limited production capacities. Dozens of countries have approved the use of Sputnik V, and many signed deals with the Russian Direct Investment Fund that bankrolled the vaccine to get shipments of the shot.The fund said Tuesday it has submitted a request for Sputnik V to be part of the global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX. The shot first needs to be endorsed by the World Health Organisation, which is still in the process of reviewing data provided by Russia.Exporting the vaccines has not been without delays and some questioned whether Moscow had the capacity to deliver on its promises. In Russia, state media and government officials boasted about the international success of the shot that came despite initial criticism of Sputnik V's hasty introduction.Peskov said Tuesday that Sputnik V was “so sought-after" that Russia's production "can't cope with the demand from abroad”.To boost production, the Russian Direct Investment Fund has signed agreements with manufacturers in a number of countries including India, Brazil, South Korea and most recently Italy. Putin said on Monday such agreements amounted to a total of 700 million vaccines a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-putin-gets-a-jab-of-covid-vaccine-101616546621547.html
24-03-2021||World||Newly confirmed surgeon general Vivek M Murthy to focus on Covid-19, opioids||The Senate confirmed a soft-spoken physician as President Joe Biden's surgeon general Tuesday. While Dr. Vivek Murthy says ending the coronavirus pandemic is his top priority, he's also raised concerns over a relapsing opioid overdose crisis.The vote on Murthy was 57-43, giving him bipartisan support. Biden's coronavirus response can already count on plenty of star players, but Murthy has a particular niche. As a successful author he's addressed issues of loneliness and isolation that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.For Murthy, this will be his second tour as America's doctor, having previously served under former President Barack Obama.Covid-19 has taken the lives of several members of Murthy's extended family. He told senators during his confirmation hearing that he wants to help individuals and families protect themselves by conveying “clear, science-based guidance” to the general public. Persuading Americans to keep up such protective measures as wearing masks could well be his toughest challenge.Murthy served as co-chair of the Biden transition team’s coronavirus advisory board, and is said to enjoy a close personal relationship with the president.Murthy's family roots are in India, but as a youngster he lived in Miami. His father had a medical clinic, where both parents worked. The son spent weekends helping out and says that’s where he discovered the art of healing.“As a child, I watched them make house calls in the middle of the night and wake up early to visit patients in the hospital before heading to their office,” he told senators. “I have tried to live by the lessons they embodied: that we have an obligation to help each other whenever we can, to alleviate suffering wherever we find it, and to give back to this country that made their lives, and my life, and the lives of my children possible. ”Murthy’s style evokes the bedside manner of an empathetic physician. He “effectively conveys compassion and credibility at a time of great need for just that,” said Chris Jennings, a longtime health policy adviser to Democrats.From his previous stint as surgeon general, Murthy says he is most proud of his efforts to call attention to the opioid epidemic, the consequences of which were not fully understood at the time.After dipping slightly, opioid deaths have again risen, driven by street formulations laced with the powerful painkiller fentanyl.“We cannot neglect the other public health crises that have been exacerbated by this pandemic, particularly the opioid epidemic, mental illness and racial and geographic health inequities," Murthy told senators.Murthy has drawn opposition from gun rights advocates because of his longstanding assessment that mass shootings amount to a public health problem. But he told senators that while he supports the government studying gun violence as a problem, “my focus is not on this issue, and if I’m confirmed it will be on Covid, on mental health and substance use disorder.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/newly-confirmed-surgeon-general-vivek-m-murthy-to-focus-on-covid-19-opioids-101616544227477.html
24-03-2021||World||NASA will attempt first off-world flight in early April||NASA is targeting early April for the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter to make the first attempt at powered, controlled flight on another planet, the space agency said Tuesday.Right now, the ultra-light aircraft remains fixed to the belly of the Perseverance rover, which touched down on the Red Planet on February 18.On Sunday, Perseverance dropped the debris shield that had protected Ingenuity during landing, and is currently making its way to the "airfield" where Ingenuity will attempt its flights.Once there, it will have 30 Martian sols -- equal to 31 Earth days -- to carry out its mission."The best guess we have right now is April 8," for the first flight, said Bob Balaram, Mars Helicopter chief engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, though he added it could be sooner or later by a few days.Balaram revealed for the first time that Ingenuity is carrying a small piece of cloth that covered one of the wings of the Wright brothers' first aircraft that achieved the first powered flight on Earth at Kitty Hawk in 1903, to pay tribute to the milestone.Ingenuity will be attempting to fly in an atmosphere that is one percent the density of Earth's, which makes achieving lift harder -- but will be assisted by a gravity that is one-third our planet's.The first flight will involve climbing at a rate of about three feet (one meter) per second to a height of 10 feet (three meters), hovering there for 30 seconds, then descending back to the surface.Ingenuity will be taking high resolution photography as it flies.Before any of this happens, however, Ingenuity needs to be placed at its launching site, and set upright, a process that will take a few more days.Once Perseverance drops off the helicopter, it needs to drive away about five meters within 25 hours so it doesn't cast a shadow on Ingenuity.That's the amount of time Ingenuity's batteries will be able to run a heater without needing to recharge via its solar panels.This part is critical to surviving the night time temperatures which can plunge as low as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius).If left unheated, the helicopter's unshielded electrical components will freeze and crack, killing the mission before it even begins.If things however go to plan, Perseverance will take up a position at a distance to record Ingenuity's exploits with its own cameras.Up to five flights of gradual difficulty are planned over the course of the month.The four-pound (1.8-kilogram) rotorcraft cost NASA around $85 million to develop, and is considered a proof of concept that could revolutionize space exploration.Future aircraft could cover ground much more quickly than rovers, and explore more rugged terrain.The next one planned is Dragonfly, a rotorcraft-lander that will launch in 2026 and arrive at Saturn's icy moon Titan in 2034.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-will-attempt-first-off-world-flight-in-early-april-101616534936334.html
24-03-2021||World||Colorado shooting victims included store workers, officer||Three were gunned down while putting in a day's work at a Colorado supermarket. Another was a police officer who raced in to try to rescue them and others from the attack that left 10 dead.A picture of the victims of Monday's shooting began to emerge as the suspect in the killings remained hospitalized Tuesday but was expected to be booked into jail on murder charges.Those who lost their lives at the King Soopers store in Boulder ranged from 20 years old to 65.They were identified as Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; police Officer Eric Talley, 51; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Teri Leiker, 51; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jodi Waters, 65.Leiker, Olds and Stong worked at the supermarket, said former co-worker Jordan Sailas, who never got the chance to bring his baby son into the store to meet them.Olds' grandmother choked up on the phone as she described the young woman she played a large role in raising.“She was just a very kind and loving, bubbly person who lit up the room when she walked in,” said Jeanette Olds, 71, of Lafayette, Colorado.Talley joined the police force in Boulder in 2010 with a background that included a master’s degree in computer communications, his father said.“At age 40, he decided he wanted to serve his community,” Homer “Shay" Talley, 74, told The Associated Press from his ranch in central Texas. “He left his desk job. He just wanted to serve, and that’s what he did. He just enjoyed the police family.”Officer Talley was the first to arrive after a call about shots being fired and someone carrying a rifle, Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said.Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Talley was “by all accounts, one of the outstanding officers" in the department.With seven children, ages 7 to 20, Talley was a devoted father who “knew the Lord,” his father said.“When everyone else in the parking lot was running away, he ran toward it,” Shay Talley said.“We know where he is,” he added. “He loved his family more than anything. He wasn’t afraid of dying. He was afraid of putting them through it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-shooting-victims-included-store-workers-officer-101616534926280.html
24-03-2021||World||US, Iraq to hold talks over American troop presence next month||The Biden administration is set to resume strategic talks with Iraqi officials next month on the withdrawal of remaining US combat forces in the country and other matters related to the bilateral relationship.The talks, which began in June under the Trump administration, would be the first under Biden, who assumed office in January. The discussions are meant to shape the future of the US-Iraq relationship and will touch security, trade, climate and more, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The official added that the US intended to use the meetings to clarify that coalition forces remain in the country “at the invitation of the Iraqi government and solely for the purpose of training and advising Iraqi forces" and to ensure that the terror group ISIS "cannot reconstitute."Iraqi officials confirmed they had sent a formal request to President Joe Biden’s administration for a date to resume strategic talks on bilateral relations and the withdrawal of remaining US combat forces, Iraqi officials said Tuesday.Relations between the two countries have been fraught with tension, particularly following the US airstrike in January 2020 that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis just outside the Baghdad airport.Outraged, Iraqi lawmakers, spurred by Shiite political factions, passed a non-binding resolution to oust US-led coalition forces from the country following the attack.Relations have improved since Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took over the helm of Iraq’s government in May. But some parties, notably parliament’s Iran-backed Fatah bloc, continue to call for the withdrawal of US forces.So far, two sessions of strategic talks have been held — in June and August. Among the issues on the agenda laid out ahead of the talks were the presence of US troops in the country, militia groups acting outside of state authority and Iraq’s dire economic crisis. The US blames Iran-backed Shiite Iraqi militias for numerous attacks targeting US personnel and interests in Iraq.According to three government officials, Iraq had recently sent an official memo to the US requesting a date for a new round of discussions on bilateral relations and specifically, the withdrawal of remaining combat forces.The memo was given to US Ambassador to Iraq Mathew Tueller earlier this month, they said, adding the Iraqis hope to have the discussion in April. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.Iraqi and US officials have said they support a scheduled withdrawal of forces from Iraq, but questions remain over time-frames and the scope of the threat posed by the Islamic State group.According to the Pentagon, the number of US troops in Iraq has dropped to about 2,500 over the past months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-iraq-to-hold-talks-over-american-troop-presence-next-month-101616534408452.html

The absence of the caps makes it easier for Biden to propose spending increases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-outline-2022-budget-priorities-next-week-101616534421324.html
24-03-2021||World||India abstains from key UNHRC vote on Sri Lanka||India on Tuesday abstained from a crucial vote at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Sri Lanka’s rights record, though New Delhi called on Colombo to carry forward the reconciliation process and address the aspirations of the Tamil minority.The 47-member UNHRC adopted a resolution – sponsored by a group of countries that includes the UK, Germany and Canada – which gives UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet the mandate to collect and preserve evidence of crimes related to Sri Lanka’s civil war that ended in 2009 with the defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels.Watch: India abstains from vote on Sri Lanka at UNHRC over civil war crimesA total of 22 countries voted for the resolution that was very critical of Sri Lanka’s failure to address human rights violations that occurred during the civil war. The resolution also contended the human rights situation has deteriorated under the Rajapaksa administration and that rights defenders and ethnic and religious minorities are facing problems.Eleven countries, including Bangladesh, China and Pakistan, voted against the resolution, while 14 countries, including India, Indonesia, Japan and Nepal, abstained.In a statement before the voting on the resolution on “Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka”, Pawankumar Badhe, first secretary at India’s permanent mission in Geneva, said New Delhi believes states have the primary responsibility for protecting human rights.“We would urge the government of Sri Lanka to carry forward the process of reconciliation, address the aspirations of the Tamil community and continue to engage constructively with the international community to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected,” Badhe said.India’s approach to human rights in Sri Lanka, he said, was guided by “two fundamental considerations” – support to the Tamil minority for equality, justice, dignity and peace, and ensuring the unity, stability and territorial integrity of the island nation.“We have always believed that these two goals are mutually supportive and Sri Lanka’s progress is best assured by simultaneously addressing both objectives,” he added.India also supports the world community’s call for Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitments on devolution of political authority to the Tamils, including through early holding of elections to provincial councils and ensuring that these councils are able to operate effectively in line with the 13th amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution, Badhe said.India has traditionally shied away from backing direct UN intervention on human rights issues because of its sensitivities related to the Kashmir issue. At the same time, the Modi government has repeatedly pressed Sri Lanka to take steps to devolve powers to the Tamil minority and address their aspirations.The Tamil Nadu assembly election, to be held during April-May, is also believed to have been a factor behind India’s decision to abstain. The status of Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority is often a factor in Tamil Nadu’s politics.Though the Sri Lankan government reached out to India to vote against the resolution at the UNHRC, New Delhi has been irked with Colombo for reneging on a 2019 tripartite India-Japan-Sri Lanka agreement for developing the East Container Terminal at Colombo port.The Sri Lankan government scrapped the deal last month following pressure from labour unions and instead offered to develop the West Container Terminal with Indian and Japanese investors.Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena made a distinction while thanking countries that voted against the resolution or abstained. In a tweet, he appreciated “the support shown at Geneva” by countries such as India and Japan that abstained, and in another tweet, he extended a “very warm Thank You for solid support” shown by countries that voted against the resolution.While presenting the resolution at the UNHRC, British ambassador Julian Braithwaite said: “Impunity has become more entrenched, progress in emblematic cases has stalled.” But Sri Lankan ambassador MCA Chandraprema rejected the document as “unhelpful and divisive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-abstains-from-key-unhrc-vote-on-sri-lanka-101616530203136.html
24-03-2021||World||Looking at greater role for India in peace process, says Afghan foreign minister||Afghanistan envisages a greater role for India in building regional and international consensus for the country’s fraught peace process, though a decision on engaging the Taliban is entirely up to New Delhi, Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar said on Tuesday. Atmar is on a three-day visit to New Delhi, during which he held talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on security and economic cooperation and collaboration on efforts to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. The two sides also reviewed latest developments in the peace process between the Afghan government and the Taliban. During an interaction with the media, Atmar responded to a question on the role envisaged by the Afghan government for India in the peace process by saying that New Delhi has legitimate interests in the peace and stability of the region. “There are those out there that threaten not just Afghanistan but also India. So, India is a legitimate partner in peace-making and we are seeking a greater role for India in the process,” he said. Lasting peace in Afghanistan depends on national, regional and international consensus, irrespective of the venue where talks are held by the Afghan government and the Taliban, he said. India has a key role in the process of “regional and international consensus-building”, Atmar said. The Afghan foreign minister said he had not discussed India’s approach to the Taliban with his interlocutors. “We leave it entirely to India to make that decision. We’ve asked for a greater role by India in regional and international consensus-building and the mature policies pursued by the Indian government will always place emphasis on any kind of contact with the Taliban on condition that would serve the peace process – that they will be part of a legitimate government of Afghanistan,” he said. Both Afghanistan and India as well as the region have been affected by terrorism and the two countries have the responsibility to work together to defeat such threats, he said. The Afghan government is negotiating with the Taliban to make sure that the country doesn’t become a safe haven for international terrorists who could target India or the West, he said. “The best strategy to secure the world is to separate the Taliban from the regional and international terrorists, [and] make peace on the condition that Afghanistan remains a sovereign, peaceful, unified and independent country,” he said. Responding to a question about the targeting of Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh minorities by terrorists, he said: “The violence against Afghans didn’t spare our minorities either. So, it’s not a kind of persecution against [a] specific minority, it’s the general violence against the entire nation, in which this part of our population has been disproportionately affected.” He added it was the responsibility of the Afghan government to provide protection and security to the Hindu and Sikh minorities. Atmar also said the upcoming meeting between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Turkey on April 1 will focus on three issues – a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, a political settlement consistent with a vision acceptable to the Afghan people, and regional and international guarantees for the settlement. “And in that political settlement, the key will be both sides agreeing to accept the free will of the Afghan people through elections,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/looking-at-greater-role-for-india-in-peace-process-says-afghan-foreign-minister-101616526718159.html
24-03-2021||World||The battle against AIDS has slowed down. And UN’s new strategy won’t be enough||A new UNAIDS document, End inequalities, end AIDS: Global AIDS Strategy 2021-26, to be presented to its Board of Management on March 25, has come at a critical juncture of failing global response to AIDS. The strategy attempts to identify “where, why and for whom the HIV response is not working” and to “build back better, supporting systems for health to be more resilient and place people at the centre”.It bases rest of the strategy on ending inequalities, identified as the most important reason for failed AIDS response. It tries to identify inequalities in every setting that prevent access to services. Inequalities exacerbate the spread of not just HIV but many communicable diseases, with Covid-19 being the latest example. But basing the entire strategy on correcting inequalities as a precondition for ending AIDS runs the risk of non-performance by countries who are indifferent to addressing such imbalances and where the programmes are failing and infections are on the rise.The missing piece in the document was a bold, honest and impartial assessment of why the response has not been working. The roles played by country leadership, the joint United Nations (UN) programme, donors and civil society should have been critically analysed and lessons learnt identified to lay the foundation for a new well thought out strategy for the next five years.Also Read | IIT Madras researchers working on effective drugs against HIV/AIDSThe paper has not adequately addressed the role leadership and political commitment play in a global programme such as AIDS. The single most important reason for the response going off the track was the declining political support for AIDS programmes for various reasons. The joint UN programme should be accountable for rejuvenating this commitment, country by country.A critical requirement for successful implementation of AIDS programmes is the functioning of efficient governance structures to deliver services. Global AIDS programme was the first to advocate for dedicated structures under the “Three Ones” principle for AIDS governance. Much of the success achieved earlier was due to strong country level buy-in of the Three Ones structures — one national level coordinating authority, one national AIDS control programmes and a single monitoring and evaluation system. These served as effective platforms for a truly multisectoral response for AIDS by bringing the non-health state actors, the UN system and the civil society into a unique partnership, not seen earlier in any national programme.In the last few years, the multisectoral nature of AIDS response has all but evaporated and AIDS has been relegated to the narrow confines of the health ministries at the country level. This, in a large measure, is responsible for the lack of visibility and failed response in the last few years.Also Read | Study: Drugs that trigger alarm could lead to new HIV therapiesThe strategy paper gives a strong push for full integration of HIV services under Universal Health Coverage (UHC). It does not recognise that the health system itself has a stigmatising impact on the key marginalised populations who do not feel encouraged to access services from the heath system. While bio medical interventions like antiretroviral treatment (ART) and elimination of mother to child transmission (eMTCT) services can be progressively integrated into UHC, prevention of HIV among key populations needs to stay strongly rooted in communities.While it is essential to bring the inequality lens to evaluate the scenario, the strategy paper should have advocated for a strong public health approach to put the response back on track by re-establishing strong political commitment followed by resources, improving the governance structures, focused primary prevention among key populations, maximising treatment access through community based test and treat programmes and introduction of new technologies such as Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PreP) and HIV self testing.The joint UN programme should assume the role of being a strong and fearless advocate and activist for re-establishing AIDS response into national priorities to regain their lost importance at policy and implementation level.(JVR Prasada Rao is a former health secretary government of India and a former UN special envoy on AIDS.
