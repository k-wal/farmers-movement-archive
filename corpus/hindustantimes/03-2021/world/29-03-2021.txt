The effort also would help avoid 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, a key step in the administration's fight to slow global warming.President Joe Biden “believes we have an enormous opportunity in front of us to not only address the threats of climate change but use it as a chance to create millions of good-paying, union jobs that will fuel America’s economic recovery,'' said White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy. “Nowhere is the scale of that opportunity clearer than for offshore wind.''The administration's commitment to the still untapped industry “will create pathways to the middle class for people from all backgrounds and communities,” she added.Specifically, the administration said Monday it intends to prepare a formal environmental analysis for the Ocean Wind project off New Jersey, putting it in line to become the third commercial-scale offshore wind project in the U.S.Ocean Wind, 15 miles off the coast of southern New Jersey, is projected to produce about 1,100 megawatts a year, enough to power 500,000 homes.The Interior Department has previously announced environmental reviews for Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts and South Fork wind farm about 35 miles east of Montauk Point in Long Island, N.Y. Vineyard Wind is expected to produce about 800 megawatts of power and South Fork about 132 megawatts.Biden has vowed to double offshore wind production by 2030 as part of his effort to slow climate change. The likely approval of the Atlantic Coast projects — the leading edge of at least 16 offshore wind projects along the East Coast — marks a sharp turnaround from the Trump administration, which stymied wind power both onshore and in the ocean.As president, Donald Trump frequently derided wind power as an expensive, bird-slaughtering way to make electricity, and his administration resisted or opposed wind projects nationwide, including Vineyard Wind. The developer of the Massachusetts project temporarily withdraws its application late last year in a bid to stave off possible rejection by the Trump administration. Biden provided a fresh opening for the project soon after taking office in January.“For generations, we’ve put off the transition to clean energy and now we’re facing a climate crisis,'' said Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, whose department oversees offshore wind.“As our country faces the interlocking challenges of a global pandemic, economic downturn, racial injustice and the climate crisis, we have to transition to a brighter future for everyone,'' Haaland said.Vineyard Wind is slated to become operational in 2023, with Ocean Wind following a year later.The Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Monday it is establishing a new priority area for wind energy in shallow waters between Long Island and the New Jersey coast. A recent study shows the area can support up to 25,000 development and construction jobs by 2030, Interior said.The ocean energy bureau said it will publish a proposed sale notice for the area, followed by a formal public comment period and a lease sale in late 2021 or early 2022.Despite the enthusiasm, offshore wind development is still in its infancy in the U.S., far behind progress made in Europe. A small wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island, and another small wind farm operates off the coast of Virginia.The three major projects under development are all owned by European companies or subsidiaries. Vineyard Wind is a joint project of a Danish company and a U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish energy giant, Iberdrola. Ocean Wind and South Fork are led by the Danish company, Orsted.Wind developers are poised to create tens of thousands of jobs and generate more than $100 billion in new investment by 2030, “but the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management must first open the door to new leasing,″ said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association.Not everyone is cheering the rise of offshore wind. Fishing groups from Maine to Florida have expressed fear that large offshore wind projects could render huge swaths of the ocean off-limits to their catch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-biden-boosts-wind-energy-efforts-aims-to-power-10-million-homes-by-2030-101617038550870.html

The vaccine rollout is continuing to that end. We don't currently have a surplus of vaccines but we will consider how they are best allocated as they become available," the spokesperson told reporters during a press briefing at number 10 Downing Street.The official reaffirmed that the government's plan is to ensure that all people over 50 years of age in the UK are offered their first dose by April 15, and to all adults above 18 -- accounting for 52.7 million of the country's 66.7 million population -- by the end of July.According to official figures, as for Sunday, 30.1 million people -- 57 percent of all adults -- had received at least one dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines since the immunization campaign started in December 2020, and a total of 3.5 million of them have been given their second dose.The UK has ordered over 400 million vaccine doses and charity organizations such as Save the Children and the Wellcome Trust have been urging the government to start donating its vaccine surplus to poorer countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-inoculate-adults-first-before-sharing-vaccine-doses-with-other-countries-101617038070467.html

Novavax is expected to apply for U.K. approval of its vaccine in the second quarter, with production at the Glaxo plant starting as early as May.The drug substance for the shot is also being manufactured in the northeast of England by Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies U.K. Ltd. The deal was put together by the U.K. government’s Vaccine Taskforce, which agreed to purchase 60 million doses from Novavax last year.The agreement has the potential to reduce the U.K.’s reliance on overseas vaccine supplies amid a spat with the EU over exports. The bloc has fallen behind peers in vaccination rates, inoculating about 10% of its population, compared with 45% in the U.K. and about 28% in the U.S., according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. EU leaders gave their guarded support to plans to restrict vaccine exports last week after it emerged the bloc had sent more shots to the rest of the world than to its own residents.Vaccinated Britain Is About to Face Its Biggest Covid Test YetGlaxo’s investment “shows the strength of U.K. manufacturing and will further boost our vaccine rollout,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. “We remain on track to offer a first jab to all over 50s by April 15, and all adults by the end of July.”Novavax’s shot was found to be 96.4% effective against mild, moderate and severe symptoms of the disease in a final analysis of its late-stage U.K. trial released earlier this month. The company also released final results from a mid-stage trial in South Africa that showed the vaccine was 55.4% effective against a variant circulating there that’s been shown to partially elude the protection of some shots.The Glaxo-Novavax partnership is the latest effort to pair vaccine front-runners with big pharmaceutical companies to help boost production capacity. Glaxo also announced last month that it was supporting the manufacture of up to 100 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine from Germany’s CureVac NV.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/glaxosmith-set-to-manufacture-60-million-doses-of-novavax-covid-19-for-uk-101617036421146.html
29-03-2021||World||Pfizer, Moderna Covid-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions: US CDC||The Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines provide highly effective protection under real-world conditions, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.CNN reported that at full vaccination, the vaccines were 90 per cent effective at preventing infections, including infections that had no symptoms. At a single dose, they were 80 percent protective, according to the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published Monday.The study looked at how the vaccines protected nearly 4,000 healthcare workers and first responders. The volunteers in the study worked in eight locations around the country and had been observed from mid-December to mid-March.The US disease agency tested volunteers routinely regardless of symptoms. The CDC also monitored the volunteers through text messages, e-mails and direct medical reports. The volunteers also did a nasal swab once a week.Most of the volunteers, more than 62 per cent, had received both doses of either a Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. More than 12 per cent had received just a single dose.Among the 2,961 people vaccinated with one or more doses and the 989 unvaccinated participants, a total of 205 had a positive PCR test for Covid-19, more than 87 per cent of those cases had symptoms. Nearly 23 per cent of the cases sought help from a doctor. There were two hospitalisations, but no deaths were reported.CNN further reported that the results of this study are similar to what scientists saw in clinical trials for the vaccines, but studies like this are important to show how effective the vaccines are, particularly in a population that, through their work, can encounter a large number of people who have Covid-19."Reducing the risk for transmissible infection, which can occur among persons with asymptomatic infection or among persons several days before symptoms onset, is especially important among health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers, given their potential to transmit the virus through frequent close contact with patients and the public," the report read."This study shows that our national vaccination efforts are working. The authorised mRNA Covid-19 vaccines provided early, substantial real-world protection against infection for our nation's health care personnel, first responders, and other frontline essential workers," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement, The Hill.She added that these findings should offer hope to the millions of Americans receiving Covid-19 vaccines each day and to "those who will have the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated in the weeks ahead. The authorised vaccines are the key tool that will help bring an end to this devastating pandemic."The CDC acknowledged that the findings were consistent with other recent studies of partial vaccination following the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine among health care providers.The studies conducted in the United Kingdom and Israel showed that one dose was about 70 per cent and 60 per cent effective, respectively, against infection with the virus that causes the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-work-in-real-world-conditions-us-cdc-101617036527073.html

It also revised higher its growth rate for the current fiscal year.The South Asian nation recorded 8.7% CPI Y/Y in February.Sheikh had lost a parliamentary election earlier this month that was mandatory for him to keep the office of the finance minister constitutionally. However he could have stayed in office until June 10, and it is not clear whether the decision to remove him was also a move to cover for the consequences of that election loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-replaces-finance-minister-appoints-industry-minister-to-post-101617036615154.html

The victims are the Myanmar people," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said.Russia on Monday acknowledged it was developing ties with Myanmar after deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin and other officials joined the weekend parade, but said that did not mean it approved of the "tragic events" unfolding."We are very concerned by the growing number of civilian casualties," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.So far, weeks of repeated pleas for restraint and even international sanctions have not persuaded the generals to ease off.The brutality continued on Monday in Yangon, with three people killed, including a 20-year-old shot dead, rescue workers told AFP.One person was also killed in the city of Bago, state media said, adding that a police officer also died in Mandalay after being set alight by protesters.Air strikes in Karen state An estimated 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand Sunday following targeted aerial assaults in eastern Myanmar's Karen state, the Karen Women's Organisation civil society group said.However, around 2,000 people were pushed back as they approached the Thai border, local media said Monday. A spokesman for the Thai ministry of foreign affairs denied this.According to Hsa Moo, an ethnic Karen and human rights activist, the weekend airstrikes -- the first in the state in 20 years -- killed four people and left nine injured.The airstrikes targeted the Karen National Union (KNU), one of the country's largest non-state armed groups.There are fears that the Myanmar military may launch a major operation against Karen rebels, which could force more people to flee their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-suspends-myanmar-trade-pact-after-bloodiest-weekend-101617034145075.html
29-03-2021||World||'Ever Given' finally set adrift. Here's a timeline of the Suez blockage crisis||A massive container ship, the 'Ever Given was on Monday dislodged from the banks of the Suez Canal after nearly a week-long effort to free it. The vessel's release comes as a breath of relief for the shipping industry as a whole, which has had a tumultuous year since the Covid-19 pandemic began roiling global trade in 2020.From being grounded at one of the most important waterways in the world to being finally set adrift, here's a complete timeline of the events:March 23: Cargo ship gets stuck in Suez CanalThe 'Ever Given', a 200,000-tonne Panama-flagged ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, ran aground at 7:40 am (05:40 GMT) on Tuesday, March 23, 2021, in the southernly mouth of the Suez Canal, a narrow, man-made canal dividing continental Africa from the Sinai Peninsula.As a result, it blocked other vessels from transiting the waterway, one of the world's most important maritime trade routes. The Ever Given's bow was touching the canal's eastern wall, while its stern looked lodged against its western wall, according to satellite data from MarineTraffic. Several tug boats surrounded the ship.March 24: Dozens of ships wait for the canal to clear, causing a traffic jamOn Wednesday, cargo ships and oil tankers appeared to be lining up at the southern end of the Suez Canal, waiting to be able to pass through the waterway to the Mediterranean Sea. Bloomberg reported, citing shipbrokers and mapping data, that at least 100 vessels seeking to transit between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean had piled up. The Taiwan-based Evergreen Line, the time charterer of the vessel, said in an emailed response to the news agency's questions that the ship “was grounded accidentally after deviating from its course due to suspected sudden strong wind”.In the evening, salvage operations saw a silver lining when the ship was partially refloated alongside the canal bank. GAC, which is the provider of port-agent services, said that the ship was expected to be refloated shortly. However, despite efforts to release the ship with tugs and excavators, the Suez Canal stayed blocked, with dozens of vessels gridlocked in a lengthy halt behind it. As many as 10 tug boats struggled to free the 400-metre, 224,000-tonne 'Ever Given'.March 25: Egypt suspends all traffic in Suez CanalJapanese ship-leasing firm Shoei Kisen Kaisha, which owns the ship, said that it was facing "extreme difficulty" trying to refloat it. In a statement on its website, the firm apologised "for causing a great deal of worry to ships in the Suez Canal and those planning to go through the canal."As the bid to refloat the ship faced fresh trouble, Egypt suspended all traffic through Suez Canal, keeping one of the world's busiest shipping lanes in a chokehold. At least 150 other vessels needing to pass through the crucial waterway idled waiting for the obstruction to clear, authorities said.Dredgers tried to clear silt around the massive ship. Tug boats nudged the vessel alongside it, trying to gain momentum. The head of a Dutch salvage firm that sent experts to help said that the recovery could take "days or weeks". It was around this time that other container carriers and vessels start taking the costly and time-consuming voyage around Africa instead.March 26: Maritime traffic jam grows; White House raises alarmIt was reported that the US government offered Egypt assistance removing the grounded ship, after sensing potential impacts on energy markets. Almost 300 vessels were reported by Bloomberg to have queued up, compared to the 238 on Thursday.Several ships in the Indian Ocean, initially bound for the Suez Canal, changed course and took a detour. The ship's Japanese owner said that it aimed to refloat the ship on Saturday night Tokyo time.March 27: Authorities plan to use tidal movement to free shipWith erstwhile attempts failing to produce any substantial result, a plan is made to refloat the vessel by taking advantage of tidal movements late on Saturday. At a news conference, Shoei Kisen President Yukito Higaki said 10 tugboats were deployed and workers were dredging the banks and seafloor near the vessel’s bow to try to get it afloat again as the high tide starts to go out.Plans were also in the works to pump water from the interior spaces of the vessel. Nevertheless, the ship remained wedged in the waterway on Saturday, as well, while around 320 vessels still lay waiting for the channel to clear up, according to the head of the waterway authority, Osama Rabie. Now new timeline for extracting the wedged ship from the Suez Canal was given, however.March 28: Additional tugboats deployed, excavators dig into the canal's eastern wallTwo additional tugboats — the Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magno — sped to the Suez Canal to aid the salvage efforts. Excavators dug the eastern wall of the Suez Canal, hoping to free the bulbous bow of the Ever Given that ploughed into the embankment, satellite photos showed. Workers planned to make two attempts to free the vessel coinciding with high tides helped by a full moon on Sunday night.Monday, March 29: 'Ever Given' finally set adrift after moving over 30,000 cubic meters of sandThe massive container ship was finally pulled free from the bank of the Suez Canal, allowing for the long tailback of ships to start navigating once again through one of the world’s most important trade routes. The manager of the Ever Given container ship confirmed it had been refloated in the Suez Canal at 3 pm local time on Monday and was heading to the Great Bitter Lake where it would undergo a full inspection.Salvage teams pulled the ship free from the sandy bank with tugs. Horns sounded in celebration as she made her way up the canal after an operation that involved moving 30,000 cubic meters of sand.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ever-given-finally-set-adrift-here-s-a-timeline-of-the-suez-blockage-crisis-101617025758296.html

He said Chauvin pointed Mace at her.“She wanted to check on his pulse, check on Mr. Floyd’s well-being,” Blackwell said. “She did her best to intervene. When she approached Mr. Chauvin …. Mr. Chauvin reached for his Mace and pointed it in her direction. She couldn’t help.”Widely seen bystander video of the encounter sparked outrage across the U.S. and led to widespread protests and scattered violence.A jury of 14 people will hear the case — eight who are white and six who are Black or multiracial, according to the court. Two of the 14 will be alternates. The judge has not said which ones will be alternates and which ones will deliberate the case.Legal experts said they expected prosecutors to play the video to the jury early on.“If you’re a prosecutor you want to start off strong. You want to frame the argument -- and nothing frames the argument in this case as much as that video,” said Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor and managing director of Berkeley Research Group in Chicago.Floyd, 46, was declared dead after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck as he lay handcuffed on his belly on the pavement, crying “I can't breathe."Chauvin, 45, is charged with unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.Almost all of the jurors selected during more than two weeks of questioning said they had seen at least parts of the video, and several acknowledged it gave them at least a somewhat negative view of Chauvin. But they said they could set that aside.About dozen people chanted and carried signs in the middle of the street outside the courthouse entrance as Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, the Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the Floyd family passed by on their way inside. The group also carried a makeshift coffin, on top of which they placed flowers.Crump said the trial would be a test of “whether America is going to live up to the Declaration of Independence.” And he blasted the idea that it would be a tough test for jurors.“For all those people that continue to say that this is such a difficult trial, that this is a hard trial, we refute that," he said. "We know that if George Floyd was a white American citizen, and he suffered this painful, tortuous death with a police officer’s knee on his neck, nobody, nobody, would be saying this is a hard case.”The trial is expected to last about four weeks at the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis, which has been fortified with concrete barriers, fencing, and barbed and razor wire. City and state leaders are determined to prevent a repeat of damaging riots that followed Floyd’s death, and National Guard troops have already been mobilized.The key questions at trial will be whether Chauvin caused Floyd’s death and whether his actions were reasonable.For the unintentional second-degree murder charge, prosecutors have to prove Chauvin’s conduct was a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd’s death, and that Chauvin was committing felony assault at the time. For third-degree murder, they must prove that Chauvin’s actions caused Floyd’s death, and were reckless and without regard for human life.The manslaughter charge requires proof that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through negligence that created an unreasonable risk.Unintentional second-degree murder is punishable by up to 40 years in prison in Minnesota, with up to 25 years for third-degree murder, but sentencing guidelines suggest that Chauvin would face 12 1/2 years in prison if convicted on either charge. Manslaughter has a maximum 10-year sentence.Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, was expected to use his opening statement to tell jurors that medical testimony and use of force experts will show a different view. Nelson has made clear that the defense will make an issue of Floyd swallowing drugs before his arrest, seeking to convince the jury that he was at least partially responsible for his death.The county medical examiner's autopsy noted fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's system, but listed his cause of death as “cardiopulmonary arrest, complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.”“This case to us is a slam dunk, because we know the video is the proof, it's all you need,” Floyd's brother Philonise said Monday on NBC's “Today” show. “The guy was kneeling on my brother’s neck ... a guy who was sworn in to protect. He killed my brother in broad daylight. That was a modern-day lynching.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-officer-s-trial-in-george-floyd-s-death-gets-underway-101617031186853.html

Cinemas and theme parks would be able to increase capacity to 75% from 50%."We want to keep containing the epidemic and not undo the efforts we have made. We must continue to enforce stringent measures," she said.Bars, karaoke parlours and bath houses would stay closed.Quarantine for arrivals from countries considered low-medium risk, such as Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, would be reduced to 14 days from 21 currently. High-risk destinations such as Brazil, Ireland, South Africa and the United Kingdom would need 21 days, she said.The city has seen zero locally transmitted cases for the last two days after an outbreak in early March led to a spike in cases across the city and thousands of residents forced into quarantine.Chan said the government was also aiming to bring back Hong Kong residents who have been stranded in Britain from late April after the government banned flights from the United Kingdom to Hong Kong in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-reopen-pools-beaches-as-covid-19-infections-ease-101617005483162.html

The site west of Melbourne is also its biggest globally in terms of producing, storing and dispensing hydrogen.It is the second such fuel station in Australia after ActewAGL last week began selling hydrogen produced by France's Neoen in a trial for 20 Hyundai Nexo sport utility vehicles owned by the Australian Capital Territory government.Fuel cell vehicles remain a niche segment globally amid concerns about a lack of fuelling stations, resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions.Toyota has sold some 10,000 Mirai vehicles, mostly in Japan and the United States."Here in Australia, refuelling infrastructure has been the biggest challenge, and still is, to introducing pioneering vehicles like the Mirai. So this is an important step forward to rectifying that," said Matthew MacLeod, Toyota Australia's manager of future technologies and mobility.Australia is seen as a laggard in the global drive to cut carbon emissions from the transport sector, with no targets or subsidies for cleaner vehicles - even for hybrid or battery electric vehicles, in stark contrast to most other rich nations.The government, however, projects that 26% of new vehicle sales will be electric vehicles in 2030, up from 1% in 2020.At the site, Toyota is using rooftop solar to power an electrolyser to split water, producing 80 kilograms a day of hydrogen for the fuel pump. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency provided almost half of the funds for the A$7.4 million ($5.7 million) project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toyota-presses-australia-to-promote-roll-out-of-hydrogen-fuel-stations-101616992643584.html
29-03-2021||World||Germany must improve pandemic management strategy, says Angela Merkel ally||The leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party said Germany must urgently improve its pandemic management and foster better cooperation between federal and regional authorities to help check a new “third wave” of infections.Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and chairman of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, was one of the 16 state leaders she criticized Sunday for not imposing tough enough restrictions. Merkel threatened to assert federal authority over measures to stem Covid-19, highlighting her struggle to maintain control in the face of intransigence from the powerful regional premiers -- who in some cases have opted not to enforce curbs agreed with her administration.Laschet, who wants to run as the conservative candidate to replace Merkel when she steps aside after September’s national election, defended his region against Merkel’s criticism, saying NRW has followed the rules laid out in Germany’s so-called “emergency brake.”He acknowledged that the situation is dire, and said state leaders are taking it seriously, while calling for a slimmed-down and more flexible negotiating group to decide the next steps.The most-recent meeting between the state leaders and Merkel’s government on March 22 lasted for more than 11 hours and ended well after midnight.“We can’t continue to have the state premiers and half the federal government sitting in front of screens for hours, that’s not suitable for this crisis,” Laschet said Monday at a news conference after a meeting of the CDU leadership.The next talks, currently scheduled for April 12, should be held in person and should involve only the 16 premiers, plus Merkel and her chief of staff, Helge Braun, and not federal officials including Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats, he added.“I am sure that if we get additional proposals the state leaders will follow them,” Laschet told reporters. “At the moment, I don’t know of any suggestions beyond what has already been agreed between the federal government and the regions.”Laschet appealed to citizens to “stay home and reduce contacts over Easter” to stop the disease spreading further. Germany’s seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people continued to climb on Monday, rising to 134.4 from 129.7 the previous day, according to the RKI public-health institute. It has more than doubled since falling to 56.8 on Feb. 19 from a peak of almost 200 in late December.“We have to get away from micro-management,” Laschet said. “The bureaucracy we have in Germany is a hindrance, especially for vaccination, where are not making progress quickly enough.”In an interview with ARD television late Sunday, Merkel expressed exasperation with what she described as broken commitments by the 16 state leaders, who have direct authority to deploy health and safety rules under the country’s federal system.She called on them to follow existing guidelines and impose curfews, contact curbs and work-from-home rules as warranted.“If that doesn’t happen in the very foreseeable future, you have to think about how that might be dealt with federally in a uniform way,” Merkel said. “We are bound by law to contain the infections. Right now, we don’t have containment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-must-improve-pandemic-management-strategy-says-angela-merkel-ally-101617019342693.html
29-03-2021||World||Paris court convicts, fines French pharmaceutical for deadly diabetes drug||A Paris court handed hundreds of millions of euros in damages and fines to a French pharmaceutical company on Monday for its role in one of the nation’s biggest modern health scandals, finding it guilty of manslaughter and other charges for selling a diabetes drug blamed for hundreds of deaths.The ruling capped a judicial marathon targeting Servier Laboratories and involving more than 6,500 plaintiffs. The Paris tribunal took nearly three hours to read out its verdict in full, because it was so long. The huge trial was spread over 10 months in 2019 and 2020, and nearly 400 lawyers worked on the case.It centered on the diabetes drug Mediator. Servier was accused of putting profits ahead of patients’ welfare by allowing the drug to be widely and irresponsibly prescribed as a diet pill — with deadly consequences. Servier argued that it didn’t know about the drug’s dangers.The court found Servier guilty of manslaughter, involuntary wounding and aggravated deception. The firm was acquitted of fraud.Judges handed Servier a fine of 2.7 million euros (nearly $3.2 million) and ordered it to pay hundreds of millions more in damages that will be shared out by plaintiffs. Damages for aggravated deception alone totaled nearly 159 million euros. And other hefty payments were being awarded for the manslaughter and wounding charges.The court also handed a suspended four-year prison sentence and fines to the only surviving Servier executive accused of involvement, Dr. Jean-Philippe Seta.A 2010 study said Mediator was suspected in up to 2,000 deaths, with doctors linking it to heart and lung problems, in the 33 years that it was on the market. Some survivors suffered severe health complications, requiring heart transplants and other medical procedures, after taking the drug as a hunger suppressant.One doctor flagged concerns as far back as 1998, and testified that he was bullied into retracting them. Facing questions about the drug’s side effects from medical authorities in Switzerland, Spain and Italy, Servier withdrew it from those markets between 1997 and 2004.Lawyers for Servier argued that the company wasn’t aware of the risks associated with Mediator before 2009, and said the company never claimed it was a diet pill. They had argued for acquittal.It took an independent investigation by another worried French doctor before the company suspended sales in its main market in France in 2009. It wasn’t sold in the US. The company’s CEO and founder, Jacques Servier, was indicted early in the legal process but died in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-court-convicts-fines-french-pharmaceutical-for-deadly-diabetes-drug-101617018238929.html

US army veteran shows battle scars to call out hate crimes against Asian Americans||A video clip of a US army veteran, also an elected official in Ohio, has been doing rounds of social media against the background of anti-Asian violence in the country. Lee Wong trended on Twitter after removing his shirt during a meeting of the board of trustees in West Chester Township, Ohio, to show scars he received when he was with the US military."I am 69 years old and I am gonna show you what the question about patriotism looks like. Here is my proof. This is sustained from my services to the US military," Wong says in the 59-second video referring to red scars on his chest."Now is this patriot enough?" Wong asked after showing the scars on his body. "People looked at me strange and they dare to question my loyalty to this country. I don't look American enough," he added, calling upon the people to remember the US constitution that he said states “we the people, we are all the same, we are all equal.”The video has gone viral with Twitter users using the hashtag StopAsianHate and WeAreThePeope.Lee Wong, an elected official in West Chester, Ohio & @USArmy veteran with 20-years of service, took his shirt off during a town hall meeting on Wednesday and revealed scars he received during his service. “Is this patriot enough?” he asked #StopAsianHate #WEARETHEPEOPLE pic.twitter.com/zmk1M1OnfnEarlier this month, Microsoft and its CEO Satya Nadella along with other US lawmakers condemned the acts of hate against Asians and the Asian American community. On Sunday, members of Congress asked the department of justice to take a leading role in the probe of the shooting in Georgia where a gunman killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, as they laid flowers at the three massage businesses where the crime took place. “We cannot allow the AAPI community to be gaslighted into thinking that this is not a hate crime,” Mark Takano, one of the representatives from California, said at the shooting site, reported AP.US Democratic senator Tammy Duckworth also expressed concern about FBI director Chris Wray’s initial assessment of the shooting not categorising it as a hate crime and had said it “looks racially motivated.” "From where I sit, I want to see a deeper investigation into whether or not these shootings and other similar crimes are racially motivated,” Reuters quoted Duckworth as saying.Also Read | A statement by Nike, H&M on Uighurs.

In one of the studies, researchers argue that Donald Trump’s campaign rallies for the 2016 election campaign heightened White identity as well as have increased the perceived threat the White Americans are facing. The study revealed that Trump's events had some correlations with the increase in domestic hate. As per the researchers, the counties hosting former president’s rallies witnessed a 226 per cent rise in hate-motivated crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-this-patriot-enough-us-army-veteran-shows-battle-scars-to-call-out-hate-crimes-against-asian-americans-101616997869986.html

Pertamina officials said there was lightning and heavy rain at the time the fire broke out.Satellite images from Planet Labs Inc. analyzed by The Associated Press showed a massive plume of black smoke rising from the refinery over the nearby village. The fire appeared localized at a set of four tanks in the middle of the refinery.The Balongan plant has a refining capacity of about 125,000 barrels of crude oil a day. It supplies fuel to Jakarta, Banten and some regions of West Java.The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said 912 residents were staying at three evacuation centers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-evacuated-after-fire-breaks-out-at-indonesian-oil-refinery-101617014585712.html

That is just short of the last high-point of 4,919 ICU cases on Nov. 16, when France was also gripped by a virus surge and was locked down in response.With ICU admissions continuing to increase by double digits on a daily basis, that November peak could be overtaken within days. Doctors are increasingly sounding the alarm that they may have to start turning patients away for ICU care, particularly in the Paris region.When the pandemic first hit France, hospitals ended up with more than 7,000 patients in intensive care, a high point reached in April 2020.But during that initial tidal wave of infections, hospitals stopped treating many non-Covid-19 patients to avoid becoming completely overwhelmed.This time, as was also the case last November, hospitals are not completely clearing their decks of non-virus cases. While some nonessential surgeries are again being postponed, hospitals are still treating Covid and non-Covid emergencies, putting some ICUs under intense and worsening pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/icu-cases-creep-toward-new-peak-in-french-coronavirus-surge-101617014002575.html
29-03-2021||World||A statement by Nike, H&M on Uighurs. One year later, a backlash by Beijing||Retail giants Nike and H&M have faced severe backlash in China over the past week after they expressed their concerns over human rights violations against Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region. At least 40 high profile Chinese celebrities cancelled their contracts with the two brands and they were removed from the listings on Chinese e-commerce platforms overnight. Several countries have imposed sanctions on China, accusing the country of ignoring the situation of the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang autonomous region, allegations which Beijing has continuously denied.Who are the Uighurs?China’s biggest autonomous region Xinjiang, which has been facing restrictions from Beijing in recent years, produces about one-fifth of the world’s cotton and is also home to the millions of Uighurs. Uighurs are a Muslim minority, who identify themselves closer to the nearby central Asian nations. Over the past recent years, the Xinjiang region has witnessed the mass migration of the Hans, Chinese ethnic majority, which has resulted in clashes between the two communities.Beijing has taken extreme measures, which included massive security crackdown and surveillance programmes, which are said to violate the human rights of Uighurs. They are reportedly detained at camps where they face torture, forced labour for the production of cotton and are even “re-educated” to make them more like the Han Chinese. China has denied all of these allegations and has said that it has just taken these measures to lift Uighurs out of poverty.Read more: China has breached all provisions of UN Genocide Convention in Xinjiang: ReportWhy are Nike and H&M facing backlash?Both the companies issued separate statements last year, saying that they were deeply concerned about the reports regarding the Uighurs. According to reports, the Muslim minority community was being forced to pick cotton in the Xinjiang region. The statements resurfaced on Wednesday after the Communist Youth League, a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) group, shared the screenshots of the H&M’s statement on social media platform Weibo. “Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!" it said.Read more: Secretary General Guterres says UN negotiating with China on unfettered access to XinjiangAfter the post, Chinese state media outlets launched campaigns criticising the brands and various celebrities including Wang Yibo, Huang Xuan and Victoria Song released statements saying that they were severing ties with the brands. The hashtag “I support Xinjiang cotton” was one of the top trending topics on Weibo with more than 1.8 billion views.What next for the companies?For H&M, China is one of the main sources of supply as well as a big market and the boycott may severely impact the company. The company’s stores were shut in China, according to a report in Bloomberg. A report in Global Times, which is the mouthpiece of the CCP, said that the companies had crossed a line by “politicising” the Uighur cotton and predicted that the growth prospects of the companies could be cumulatively reduced by 50 per cent in the next five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-statement-by-nike-h-m-on-uighurs-one-year-later-a-backlash-by-beijing-101617012404660.html

The group operates in 25 countries in Europe, Asia and North America with assets amounting to $52 billion (44 billion euros). PPF Group confirmed Kellner's death.Kellner and Larochaix “were loyal and frequent” guests at the lodge, Pruitt said in an email to the Associated Press.Harms was a pioneering heli-ski guide in Alaska and worked for many years at the lodge, Pruitt said. “Greg was one of the most experienced guides in the business,” she said. He also founded a heli-ski company that led trips across the world.McMannany had been a guide for over 10 years, and was with the lodge for the last five, she said. He was also an avalanche instructor and an experienced mountain guide on Denali, North America's tallest peak.Russel was a pilot for Soloy Helicopters, a Wasilla-based company that is contracted by the lodge to provide transportation, Pruitt said.“This news is devastating to our staff, the community in which we operate and the families of the deceased,” a statement released by the lodge said.The Eurocopter AS50 crashed under unknown circumstances about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Anchorage at 6:35 p.m. Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday. Authorities said the crash site was near Knik Glacier.The lodge is located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage, on Judd Lake. The company website bills itself as the longest operating heli-skiing lodge in Alaska, promising deep powder, pristine runs on some of the best mountain terrain in the world. “An unparalleled alpine adventure is only a helicopter ride away,” the website says. Packages start at $15,000 per person.The statement from lodge said this was the first time in its 17 years in business “we’ve had to face an event of this measure.”Soloy Helicopters has a fleet of 19 helicopters providing charter services primarily in Alaska.Its website says it provides support to government and industry, specializing in work for seismic oil drilling exploration programs. Soloy Helicopters did not immediately respond to an email to The Associated Press seeking comment Sunday.Alaska State Troopers said in a statement Sunday that they received a report of an overdue helicopter and the location of possible crash debris Saturday night.A rescue team from Alaska Rescue Coordination Center was dispatched to the crash site in the area of Knik Glacier just after 10 p.m., troopers wrote. The team arrived to find five occupants dead and a sole survivor, who was taken to a hospital.The Alaska Army National Guard and volunteers from the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group recovered the bodies from the crash site Sunday and turned them over to the state medical examiner.A temporary flight restriction placed over the glacier has been lifted, troopers said.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the case of the crash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-dead-in-helicopter-crash-in-alaska-czech-republic-s-richest-man-among-victims-101617013070060.html

People will be allowed at various sports facilities including tennis, basketball, swimming which will be reopened along with other sports as well, he said.The UK PM further said there is no need to stay at home any longer but many restrictions will still remain in place."People are advised to work from home if still possible and should avoid unnecessary travel.""In order to restrain the transmission of possible new Covid-19 variants, people of the country won't be allowed to go abroad, he further said.According to Johns Hopkins University, the country has so far registered 4,347,013 Covid-19 cases and 126,834 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-announces-ease-of-covid-19-restrictions-says-don-t-risk-all-progress-made-101617011479471.html
29-03-2021||World||Egypt's Sisi says Egyptians succeeded in ending the Suez Canal crisis||Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Monday that Egyptians had succeeded in ending the crisis of the container ship stranded in the Suez Canal."And by restoring matters to their normal course, with Egyptian hands, the whole world can be assured of the path of its goods and needs that are carried through this navigational artery," Sisi said on his official social media pages. The stranding of a container ship in the Suez Canal has created disruptions in the global shipping industry that could take weeks and possibly months to clear, top container shipping lines said.Around 30% of the world's shipping container volume - including goods like sofas, consumer electronics, apparel and shoes - moves through the 193 km (120 miles) Suez Canal daily. Empty containers, which Asian factories need to ship goods, are also caught up in the backlog."Even when the canal gets reopened, the ripple effects on global capacity and equipment are significant," the world's largest container shipping company Maersk said in a customer advisory on Monday.Maersk has three vessels stuck in the canal and another 29 waiting to enter, it said, adding that it had so far rerouted 15 vessels to sail south of Africa instead."Assessing the current backlog of vessels, it could take six days or more for the complete queue to pass," it said.Switzerland's MSC, the world's number 2 line, said separately on Saturday the situation was "going to result in one of the biggest disruptions to global trade in recent years"."Unfortunately, even when the canal re-opens for the huge backlog of ships waiting at anchorage this will lead to a surge in arrivals at certain ports and we may experience fresh congestion problems," Caroline Becquart, Senior Vice President with MSC said in a statement."We envisage the second quarter of 2021 being more disrupted than the first three months, and perhaps even more challenging than it was at the end of last year."Container shipping companies have been struggling for months with disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in demand for retail goods that led to wider logistical bottlenecks around the world.The Suez backlog threatens to make it even more difficult for European and U.S. companies to keep products in stock.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations naval authority said separately that ships diverting around Africa could mean that more traffic passes through high risk areas where pirate gangs operate."Whilst the threat of Somalia-based piracy is currently suppressed through a combination of military operations, application of BMP 5 (ship protection measures) and the presence of armed guards, an increase in maritime traffic through the area may present opportunities for Somali pirate groups to attack shipping," UKMTO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypts-sisi-says-egyptians-succeeded-in-ending-the-suez-canal-crisis-101617009797238.html
29-03-2021||World||UK relaxes Covid-19 lockdown rules, allows limited outdoor gatherings||England entered the second phase of its lockdown easing on Monday thanks to a successful vaccination drive, but the government is urging vigilance as another wave of coronavirus sweeps Europe.After schools reopened on March 8, England's stay-at-home order has been relaxed to enable outdoor gatherings of up to six people, or two households, in what newspapers have dubbed "Happy Monday".While elite sports such as Premier League football have continued during the latest lockdown -- minus fans -- the new rules will allow amateur team sports to resume, along with tennis, golf, basketball and outdoor swimming.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped that Monday "will kick-start a Great British summer of sport -- with people of all ages reunited with teammates, and able to resume the activities they love".But in a video message posted on Twitter, he urged people to enjoy their new freedoms cautiously."It's vital that we don't overdo it and risk all the progress we've made," Johnson said, in a nod to Britain's much-reduced coronavirus infection, hospitalisation and death rates compared to earlier this year.As we cautiously exit lockdown in England, we should continue to observe the restrictions on social contact to keep people safe.➡️ https://t.co/wYsooCbPKP pic.twitter.com/Nny3GQWsca"Please follow the new rules carefully so that we can gradually get back to normal together."The entire list of lockdown relaxations in the UK can be found here.In the third phase of reopening from April 12, the government plans to allow outdoor drinking in pub gardens, while hairdressers and non-essential retail will open in England.Limited indoor mixing in hospitality premises will be allowed from mid-May, while many other remaining restrictions will be lifted on June 21, if the outlook remains positive.The devolved governments of the UK's other nations -- Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- are moving at their own pace.'Roadmap to freedom'With more than 126,000 deaths, Britain has one of the world's worst mortality rates from the pandemic.But the level of new infections has been falling since early January and is now averaging around 5,000 cases a day.Meanwhile, on Sunday the country passed the milestone of inoculating more than 30 million adults with a first coronavirus vaccine dose.Britain has so far been using two jabs, developed by Oxford University/AstraZeneca and BioNTech/Pfizer.The first batch of 17 million doses of US company Moderna's vaccine is set to be delivered next month, easing concerns about an imminent shortfall in supplies.The government has insisted it is on course to hit its target of offering the first jab to all adults by the end of July, and that follow-up second doses are also on target.While conceding that continental Europe's latest wave of Covid-19 could hit Britain within weeks, Johnson said at the weekend that the "key difference" was the country's vaccination drive."And as things stand, I can see absolutely nothing in the data to dissuade me from continuing along with our roadmap to freedom," he added.Johnson, whose own hair has grown increasingly unruly, said he was looking forward to going to the barbers, and to a pint of beer.Other lockdown-weary Britons were eager to enjoy other once-everyday activities such as outdoor sports -- as well as landmark moments like getting married in front of family.Jessica Warren-Basham and Johnny Cope, from Hampshire in southern England, were forced to postpone their wedding three times due to the pandemic.Their original 180-person guestlist has been cut to just six for their rearranged nuptials Monday lunchtime."It makes it a lot easier because it's just inviting the parents really," Cope told BBC radio hours ahead of the ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-relaxes-covid-19-lockdown-rules-allows-limited-outdoor-gatherings-101617010404299.html

"We need to immunize at least 60% of our population in order to get rid of the virus from our continent. The J&J agreement enables us to move towards achieving this target," said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.Earlier this month, Europe approved J&J single dose Covid-19 vaccine. The United States, Canada and Bahrain have also approved the shot.Late last year, J&J said it and the GAVI vaccine alliance expected to enter into a deal that would provide up to 500 million doses of the company's vaccine to COVAX, the programme backed by the World Health Organization, through 2022.Johnson & Johnson has established a global manufacturing and supply network for its Covid-19 vaccine, collaborating with nine partners across four continents, including Aspen Pharmacare in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-in-deal-to-supply-covid-19-vaccine-to-african-union-member-states-101617007675076.html

Most of Iran’s electricity is produced from natural gas.Russia has signed an agreement to build two more 1-gigawatt nuclear reactors on the site of the existing reactor in a deal Iran said is worth $10 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-sanctions-could-force-shutdown-of-nuclear-power-plant-101617005873986.html

The sandstorm resulted in the sky turning yellow and the sun reducing to a mere blue dot. The air quality index of the city hit the maximum reading of 500 on Sunday afternoon and the visibility in Beijing stood at less than 1,000 metres, reminding China of the pollution challenge that its capital city faces. The PM10, which shows the floating particles that can enter the lungs, surpassed 2,000 micrograms per cubic metre in some districts. Readings of smaller PM2.5 particles which can enter the bloodstream were above 300 micrograms per cubic metreParts of inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Tianjin, Liaoning and Jilin have also been affected by the storm which according to the meteorological department is expected to last for about 12 hours.The department also said that the sandstorm was caused by strong winds which were carrying dust from drought-hit Mongolia and other parts of northwest China because of warmer temperature in the spring and lack of rain which created the sandstorm.Concerns have grown as the storm was the second to hit Beijing in less than two weeks. Earlier in the month, Beijing faced the worst sandstorm in a decade when people woke up to orange skies as 12 provinces were blanketed in yellow sand and dust. The meteorological department has further said that Beijing might face more sandstorms in April, a prediction that has caused more worry for the city.Pollution levels in BeijingAccording to a 2020 report by Swiss monitoring group IQAir, residents in Beijing residents were subjected to “moderate” levels of pollution for only two months in 2019 which were August and September. The report added that for the remaining part of the year, residents experienced air quality which was “unhealthy for sensitive groups.” In 2019, the city had 42.1 µg/m³ of a PM2.5 average. In 2018 and 2017, 50.9 µg/m³ and 58.8 µg/m³ were the respective concentrations, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-second-sandstorm-in-2-weeks-china-reminded-of-pollution-challenge-101617005765320.html

She was at least 99 years old.Mama Sarah, as the step-grandmother of the former US president was fondly called, was a philanthropist who promoted education for girls and orphans. She passed away around 4 am local time while being treated at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral hospital in Kisumu, Kenya's third-largest city in the country's west, according to her daughter Marsat Onyango.“She died this morning. We are devastated,” Onyango told The Associated Press on a phone call.She will be remembered for her work to promote education to empower orphans, Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o said while offering his condolences to the people of Kogelo village for losing a matriarch.“She was a philanthropist who mobilized funds to pay school fees for the orphans,” he said.Sarah Obama, was the second wife of President Obama’s grandfather and helped raise his father, Barack Obama, Sr. The family is part of Kenya's Luo ethnic group.President Obama often showed affection toward her and referred to her as “Granny” in his memoir, “Dreams from My Father.” He described meeting her during his 1988 trip to his father’s homeland and their initial awkwardness as they struggled to communicate which developed into a warm bond. She attended his first inauguration as president in 2009. Later, Obama spoke about his grandmother again in his September 2014 speech to the U.N. General Assembly.For decades, Sarah Obama has helped orphans, raising some in her home. The Mama Sara Obama Foundation helped provide food and education to children who lost their parents — providing school supplies, uniforms, basic medical needs, and school fees.In a 2014 interview with AP, she said that even as an adult, letters would arrive but she couldn’t read them. She said she didn’t want her children to be illiterate, so she saw that all her family’s children went to school.She recalled pedaling the president’s father six miles (nine kilometers) to school on the back of her bicycle every day from the family’s home village of Kogelo to the bigger town of Ngiya to make sure he got the education that she never had.“I love education,” Sarah Obama said, because children “learn they can be self-sufficient,” especially girls who too often had no opportunity to go to school.“If a woman gets an education she will not only educate her family but educate the entire village,” she said.In recognition of her work to support education, she was honored by the United Nations in 2014, receiving the inaugural Women’s Entrepreneurship Day Education Pioneer Award.Details on preparations for her burial will be announced later, said her daughter. Sarah Obama was Muslim and it’s not clear whether she will be buried according to her faith’s practices that dictate she should be buried within 24 hours of death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-family-matriarch-dies-in-kenyan-hospital-at-99-101617005507178.html

"We hope the plant can be operational again soon after we put out the fire so there are no disruptions to supply."Pertamina expects operations can be restored in four to five days, Pertamina director Mulyono told the media briefing.The fire started just after midnight during bad weather, Pertamina said, although the cause was currently unknown.Five people were being treated in hospital for burns, a company spokesman said, adding that some were passing near the refinery when the fire broke out. No Pertamina staff were hurt.FUEL STOCK "SECURE"Pertamina's Mulyono said the company had "secure" levels of fuels stocks to supply Indonesia, including for the upcoming Islamic holidays of Eid Al-Fitr."There is no need for panic because stock is abundant. This is of course because demand conditions are not fully normal yet, so the stock is still very high," Mulyono said.Balongan, one of Pertamina's biggest refineries, processes crude oil from the Duri and Minas fields in Riau province and supplies fuel to Jakarta and the western regions of Java island.Pertamina will use fuel from its other refineries in Cilacap and Tuban to help provide supplies to Jakarta while Balongan is shut, Mulyono added.Nicke said efforts to put out the blaze were continuing, but the fire had been contained to a small area. Television footage earlier showed a massive column of black smoke rising from the site, which is about 225 km (140 miles) east of the capital Jakarta.West Java police will be involved in the investigation into the cause of the fire, police spokesman Erdi Chaniago told Reuters.A nearby resident told Metro TV she was awoken by a pungent smell of oil fumes and saw lightning strikes in the sky."We smelled a strong fuel scent first, so strong that my nose hurt, while we heard lightning strikes," said Susi, who gave only one name"Suddenly the sky was orange," she said.The refinery is expected to receive about 600,000 barrels of Rabi crude from Gabon onboard tanker Aristodimos on April 10, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-pertamina-aims-to-restarts-refinery-in-days-after-blaze-101616994522724.html
29-03-2021||World||Megaship blocks Suez Canal: All you need to know||A giant container ship, almost as long as New York's Empire State Building is high, became wedged during a sandstorm last Tuesday in Egypt's Suez Canal.Within days, it causes a traffic jam of over 300 cargo ships at the two ends of the crucial global shipping lane.On Monday, nearly a week later, tug boats helped turn the stern 80 percent in the right direction, canal authorities say, but the vessel is not yet afloat.Here is what we know so far:- What happened? -The 400-metre (1,300-foot) long, 200,000-tonne MV Ever Given, categorised as a "megaship", veers off course in the canal when a gale-force duststorm hits Egypt's Sinai Desert and much of the Middle East.The 59-metre (195-foot) wide Panama-flagged vessel becomes stuck at about 0540 GMT near the southern end of the canal and diagonally blocks the man-made waterway between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.The ship's operator, Evergreen Marine Corp of Taiwan, says the vessel -- en route from Yantian, China to the Dutch port of Rotterdam -- "ran aground after a suspected gust of wind hit it".But the head of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, tells reporters Saturday the accident may have been due to "technical or human errors", rather than 40-knot winds.The 25 crew are unhurt, the hull and cargo undamaged, and there is no oil leak, say Singapore-based Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), which provides management services for the megaship.- What's the impact? -The vessel blocks the shipping artery through which more than 10 percent of global maritime trade passes, much of it oil and grain.The Suez Canal, opened in 1869 and widened since, is a crucial shortcut between Asia and Europe that saves ships from having to navigate around Africa.As a result of the accident, more than 300 vessels are treading water at either end of the canal, says Rabie.Old sections of the canal are reopened to ease the congestion -- but this doesn't solve the fundamental problem, as there is only one lane on the southern end where the ship is stuck.The blockage of the global trade chokepoint hits world oil markets, as traders anticipate delays in deliveries.Crude futures surge six percent on Wednesday, but prices tumble Thursday due to nagging pandemic concerns and inflation fears, wiping out those gains."We've never seen anything like it before," says Ranjith Raja, Middle East oil and shipping researcher at international financial data firm Refinitiv."It is likely that the congestion... will take several days or weeks to sort out as it will have a knock-on effect on other convoys."Lloyd's List, a shipping data and news company, says firms are being forced to consider "taking the far longer route around the Cape of Good Hope to get to Europe or the east coast of North America", a diversion that can take an additional 12 days.Shipping expert Rose George tells AFP on Friday the blockage was certain to cause price increases for consumers around the world.In signs of the knock-on effects, Syrian authorities say Saturday they had been forced to ration already scarce fuel supplies, while Romania's animal health agency says 11 ships carrying livestock out of the country were affected by the traffic suspension.Egypt is losing some $12-14 million in revenue from the canal for each day it is closed, Rabie says, while Lloyd's List says the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6 billion worth of cargo each day between Asia and Europe.- What's next? -Egyptian authorities deploy 14 additional tugboats to free the stricken ship, says Rabie. On Saturday night, the ship moves "30 degrees," he says, calling it "a good sign".The Ever Given's owner, Japanese ship-leasing firm Shoei Kisen, says the work includes crushing and removing rocks to free the ship.The canal authority has said between 15,000 and 20,000 cubic metres of sand would have to be removed in order to reach a depth of 12-16 metres and refloat the ship.Early Monday, tugs had succeeded in shifting the front and back of the ship, to reorientate it "80 percent in the right direction," Rabie said.The SCA chief calls the start of the refloating process a "success", but an official from Ever Given's owners Shoei Kisen says that while the ship "has turned", it "is not afloat".Further efforts to refloat the vessel were due to get underway late morning local time on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/megaship-blocks-suez-canal-all-you-need-to-know-101617003965049.html

An official who is aware of the latest developments in salvage operations told AFP that the ship was stuck at an angle of 30 degrees towards the canal "but that has eased". "A total of 11 tug boats have been pulling Ever Given since this morning," he added. The giant container ship was stuck sideways in the Suez Canal for a week, thus blocking a vital global trade route. The blockage had a severe impact on businesses across the world and over 300 ships are said to be currently waiting to travel through the canal.Earlier on Monday, Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said that the container ship had been turned in the "right direction"."The position of the ship has been reorientated 80 percent in the right direction. The stern moved to 102 metres (335 feet) from the shore," SCA chief Osama Rabie said in a statement. He added that navigation would resume "after the completion of refloating operations of the ship, which will then be directed to the waiting area," to allow the canal to be cleared.Here’s a look at the efforts to free the Ever Given ship from the Suez Canal﻿||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-photos-efforts-to-free-stranded-ever-given-ship-from-egypt-s-suez-canal-101617001606773.html
29-03-2021||World||Covid origin study found lab leak ‘extremely unlikely': Report||The coronavirus probably spread from bats to humans via another animal, with the likelihood it was leaked from a lab in China “extremely unlikely,” according to the long-awaited results of a joint World Health Organization-China study into the origins of Covid-19 reported by the Associated Press.The findings align with what researchers said last month, at the end of their mission to Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the first Covid cases emerged at the end of 2019, and in their subsequent public comments, including to Bloomberg News. The scientists proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis, the AP reported Monday, citing a draft copy of the report, which it said left many questions unanswered.The AP received what it said appeared to be a near-final version of the report from a Geneva-based diplomat. It wasn’t clear whether the report might still be changed prior to its release, the AP said.The hunt for the virus’s origin has been shrouded in controversy since the start of the pandemic, with China criticized for delaying access to scientists and both Beijing and Washington pushing alternate theories about how Covid began. The report’s release has been repeatedly delayed, raising questions about whether the Chinese side was trying to skew the conclusions to divert blame for the pandemic, according to the AP. The WHO has said the results of the mission to Wuhan, which concluded more than six weeks ago, would be ready in a few days.Pandemic PreventionWhile the search has become highly politicized, governments and scientists agree that deciphering the virus’s creation story is key to reducing the risk of future pandemics. The research -- conducted by a team made up of both international and Chinese experts -- was aimed at galvanizing efforts to trace the origin of the virus that touched off the worst pandemic in more than a century, as well as its route of transmission to humans and the possible role of an intermediate animal host.The draft report as detailed by the AP provides more evidence for why the researchers consider a spillover from bats via another animal a more likely cause of the pandemic than two other controversial hypotheses explored: that the global contagion resulted from a laboratory accident or was introduced by contaminated food or its packaging, according to the AP.Read more: Where Are We in Hunting for the Coronavirus’s Origin?The U.S. government has questioned whether the WHO-convened experts were given enough access to reach a reliable conclusion. Top Biden administration officials on Sunday expressed concern about the way the WHO-China report was crafted, including the possibility that the Chinese government had a hand in writing it.The US has “real concerns about the methodology and the process” of the report, including that the Chinese government “apparently helped to write it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CNN.China has been trying to deflect criticism of its handling of the pandemic amid growing scrutiny over the pathogen’s origins, including speculation promoted by the former Trump administration that the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab.Beijing has suggested the virus may have arrived in China through refrigerated goods and has urged the WHO to carry out investigations in other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-origin-study-found-lab-leak-extremely-unlikely-report-101617001103562.html
29-03-2021||World||H&M stores shut by China landlords as Xinjiang fallout grows||Hennes & Mauritz AB stores in some parts of China are being closed by their landlords, threatening to disrupt the clothing giant’s growth in its fourth-biggest market as Beijing’s growing sensitivity toward criticism of the human-rights situation in Xinjiang ensnares western companies.At least six stores in the lower-tier cities of Urumqi, Yinchuan, Changchun and Lianyungang have been shut down by the owners of the properties, according to mall operators in those areas who were contacted by Bloomberg. Local media have reported more closures, with pictures showing H&M’s brand billboards being removed.The closures are the latest escalation in the backlash against an undated H&M statement on its website that expressed concern about reports of forced labor in the far west Xinjiang region, a major producer of cotton used in the global apparel supply chain.Some of the mall operators said the decision to shutter was made by the landlords because of disrespect shown by H&M toward China. It’s unclear how long the closures will last for.China’s response to H&M is markedly stronger than its previous pushback when foreign brands crossed political lines and the Swedish retailer is at risk of becoming a corporate casualty of Bejing’s heightened sensitivity toward criticism from Western governments and entities. China accounted for 5.2% of H&M’s total sales in 2020, the fourth-biggest country market after Germany, the US, and the UK.Other Western brands like Nike Inc. and Adidas AG have also drawn consumer ire for their pledges not to use Xinjiang cotton, but H&M appears to have suffered the brunt of the fallout after the statement was called out by the Communist Youth League and the People’s Liberation Army. Its outlets have also vanished on Apple Maps and Baidu Maps searches, making it hard for Chinese consumers to locate stores, and it’s been removed from Chinese e-commerce platforms.A representative at H&M China didn’t immediately respond to requests sent by Bloomberg, while a spokesperson in Europe said the retailer has no comment to make currently. The company has 505 stores in China as of Nov. 30.China-West TensionsThe corporate reprisal comes as the US, the UK. and others highlight human rights abuses of Muslim-minority Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and tensions between China and the West simmer. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and their Chinese counterparts traded criticism on human rights and national security issues during a two-day face-to-face meeting earlier this month in Alaska.While the H&M statement appeared to have been removed from the website of the Swedish multinational as of Friday, a separate link on its homepage expressing the same stance on Xinjiang cotton was still active.H&M had said in the statement that it’s “deeply concerned by reports from civil society organizations and media that include accusations of forced labor and discrimination of ethnoreligious minorities.”Global brands are facing a dilemma over whether to embrace cotton from the Xinjiang region or risk being boycotted in the world’s second-biggest economy. German brand Hugo Boss AG’s actions reflect the growing pressure on both sides of the issue: it initially appeared to appease Chinese concerns, posting on its Weibo account last week that it would “continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton.” That comment was unauthorized and has now been deleted, a spokeswoman from Hugo Boss said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.In a separate statement currently posted to its website, Hugo Boss said the company does not tolerate forced labor and insists that its global suppliers follow suit. The company “has not procured any goods originating in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers,” the company said in the statement.The US on Friday accused China of a state-run “corporate and consumer boycott” against companies that refuse to use cotton from Xinjiang. China has targeted American, European and Japanese businesses that are avoiding Xinjiang cotton, State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter told reporters on Friday.Companies operating in China should avoid getting involved in politics like H&M did, Xu Guixiang, a publicity official in the Xinjiang region’s government, said in a press briefing Monday in Beijing.“What’s the result? Can you hold up in the Chinese market? Can you still make money from the Chinese people?

BioNTech responded by saying it did plan on providing the vaccine.Speaking at parliament, Chen was downbeat on the chances for finalising the agreement."At present there has been no further progress, and the opportunity for both to complete the contract is getting less and less," he added.Taiwan has a contract for five million of Moderna Inc's Covid-19 shot, a messenger RNA vaccine that relies on similar technology as that used by the Pfizer-BioNTech one.Chen said that with the Moderna ones coming, as well as domestically made vaccines in development, there was less urgency to obtain the BioNTech one, though Taiwan would still like them if possible."We are still in communication with them," he added.BioNTech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BioNTech signed a deal with Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd to exclusively develop and commercialise Covid-19 vaccine products developed using BioNTech's mRNA technology in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.In return it agreed to pay up to $85 million in licensing fees and invest $50 million for a stake in the German firm.BioNTech's development and distribution partner for the rest of the world is US firm Pfizer Inc.Taiwan began its vaccination programme this month with AstraZeneca shots.There are only 34 active cases being treated in hospital in Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-progress-in-biontech-vaccine-talks-says-taiwan-101617000132502.html

But I think what we are announcing today has gone further than that," Morrison told reporters in Canberra."I have very capable women operating in very important portfolios."While promoting several female lawmakers, Morrison also moved two MPs who have been the subject of allegations. Both, however, remain in his Cabinet.Linda Reynolds would leave the role of defence minister and would be replaced by Peter Dutton, previously home affairs minister.Reynolds has been criticised for her handling of an allegation of rape by a member of her staff two years ago.Christian Porter will be replaced as attorney general and minister for industrial relations by Michaelia Cash, who was promoted from the role of minister for employment, skills and small business.Porter is the subject of a historical rape allegation which he denies and is currently on mental health leave.Police said on March 2 there was insufficient evidence to investigate the alleged rape as the accuser was no longer alive.A Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper on Monday showed Morrison's public support dropped seven points in two weeks to 55%, the lowest level in a year.Morrison's government also trails opposition Labor on a two-party preferred basis, where votes for minor parties are distributed, by 52-48. If the poll result was replicated at an election, Labor would win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-promotes-women-in-cabinet-reshuffle-amid-poll-slump-101616995911701.html

That production line has an initial capacity of 2 million doses per month.The UAE, through G42, hosted Phase III clinical trials of the Sinopharm vaccine from July, which later expanded to other countries in the region including Bahrain. The UAE approved the vaccine for frontline workers in September before making it available to the general public in December.G42 has previously said it has distribution and manufacturing agreements with Sinopharm and hopes to provide the UAE and other states in the region with the vaccine.The deal was launched during a two-day visit to the UAE by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi which ended on Sunday.The joint venture also includes a purpose-built research and development hub for life sciences, biotechnology and vaccine production in KIZAD."Our joint venture is also actively looking to bring our capabilities to new markets around the world," G42 CEO Peng Xiao said.The UAE has said its trials showed the vaccine has 86% efficacy, while Sinopharm reports 79.34% efficacy based on interim results.Some people in the UAE failed to develop sufficient antibodies after a second dose of the Sinopharm vaccine and were given a third dose, the UAE health ministry said this month. It said the number was "minimal" compared to the number of vaccines administered.On Sunday, a Sinopharm executive said the company will need to assess results from overseas Phase III clinical trials to decide whether its two-shot vaccine should be followed by a booster shot."Thanks to the close collaboration with the UAE, Sinopharm's vaccine has been now administered to millions of people in the country, the region, and the world," Sinopharm Chairman Liu Jingzhen said at a virtual launch also attended by UAE Foreign Affairs Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uae-plant-to-make-covid-19-vaccine-from-china-s-sinopharm-101616999732065.html
29-03-2021||World||Once part of Trump’s Covid-19 team, Birx recalls ‘uncomfortable’ experience||Former Trump White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said during a CNN interview on Sunday that most of the deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic were avoidable. The interview was part of a documentary "Covid War: The Pandemic Doctors Speak Out." She said that while many deaths in the first phase of the pandemic were bound to happen, the deaths in the later surges could have been reduced if there was greater focus on social distancing and shutdown measures by the Trump administration."I look at it this way. The first time, we have an excuse. There were about 100,000 deaths that came from that original surge. All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially," Birx said.Talking about former President Trump, Birx said, "Well, I think you've heard other conversations that people have posted with the president. I would say it was even more direct than what people have heard. It was very uncomfortable, very direct and very difficult to hear."Birx, who retired from her position as the White House coordinator in December, is not part of Biden's Covid-19 team. Although Dr. Anthony Fauci who is the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases is a part of the Biden administration. Both Birx and Fauci had warned in March 2020 that nearly 240,000 people would die from Covid-19 but their warning was not heeded by the Trump administration.In earlier interviews as well, the former White House coordinator has criticised the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Birx told ABC news, "I can't tell you how many discussions we had on, how do we get the message out realizing what's happening at the most senior levels of the White House." In a CBS interview in January, Birx said, “There were people who definitely believed that (the coronavirus) was a hoax" in the White House.Although, Democrats have not been very fond of Birx which is one of the major reasons why she was not given a place in the Biden administration. In March 2020, Birx had praised Trump for being "so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data" about the outbreak. Such comments made by Birx made Democrat Ted Lieu call her “enabler of Trump” after her interview with CNN."The malicious incompetence that resulted in hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths starts at the top, with the former president and his enablers. And who was one of his enablers? Dr. Birx, who was afraid to challenge his unscientific rhetoric and wrongfully praised him," Lieu said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/once-part-of-trump-s-covid-19-team-birx-recalls-uncomfortable-experience-101616996588057.html

The stern... moved to 102 metres (335 feet) from the shore," compared to its position four metres from the shore previously, Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chief Osama Rabie in a statement.Efforts to refloat it will resume on the next high tide.The SCA statement said that the refloating process "will resume when water flow increases again from 11:30 local time... in order to completely refloat the vessel, so as to reposition it in the middle of the waterway."According to the Vesselfinder and myshiptracking sites, the stern could be seen to have shifted from the canal's western bank.'Not afloat'An official from the 200,000-tonne ship's owners, Shoei Kisen, said while the Ever Given "has turned", it "is not afloat."The ship had been "stuck at an angle of 30 degrees towards the canal, but that has eased," said the official."A total of 11 tug boats have been pulling Ever Given since this morning," they added, saying that while there was damage sustained by the ship on its bow when it got stuck, "but no new damage has been reported."It is not yet clear when traffic along the canal will resume.A canal official, who requested anonymity, said that the team on the ground had started technical checks, and were reassured that the ship's motor was working.Salvage crews have been working around the clock.They had focussed on efforts to remove sand around the ship, with 27,000 cubic metres (over 950,000 cubic feet) cleared at a depth of 18 metres (59 feet), SCA spokesman George Safwat said Sunday.On Sunday evening a shipping company, Leth agencies, had said Egyptian authorities had decided more tugboats were needed to shift the vessel and had postponed the refloating attempt around Sunday's high tide.The Dutch-flagged Alp Guard arrived to join the mission on Sunday evening.The crisis has forced companies to choose between waiting or rerouting vessels around Africa, which adds a huge fuel bill, 9,000 kilometres (5,500 miles) and over a week of travel to the trip between Asia and Europe.Each day of the blockade could be costing global trade some $6-10 billion, according to a study published Friday by German insurer Allianz.That translates to some 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points of annual trade each week.Authorities said 369 ships are currently stalled as they wait for the canal to reopen.Russia offered assistance Sunday, following other countries including the United States that have made similar offers.In a sign of the knock-on effects, authorities in war-wracked Syria said the crisis had hit its fuel imports from Iran and forced it to ration already scarce supplies.Romania's animal health agency said 11 ships carrying livestock out of the country were also impacted, while the charity Animals International warned of a potential "tragedy" affecting some 130,000 animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ever-given-container-ship-stuck-in-suez-canal-has-turned-but-not-afloat-owner-101616996727905.html

The team proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis.The report's release has been repeatedly delayed, raising questions about whether the Chinese side was trying to skew the conclusions to prevent blame for the coronavirus pandemic falling on China.A World Health Organisation official said late last week that he expected it would be ready for release “in the next few days”.The AP received what appeared to be a near-final version on Monday from a Geneva-based diplomat from a WHO-member country. It wasn't clear whether the report might still be changed prior to its release. The diplomat did not want to be identified because they were not authorised to release it ahead of publication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-report-says-animals-likely-source-of-covid19-101616995644548.html

There is less fighting, but no peace dividend." .The previous donor conference in June last year raised pledges of 5.5 billion dollars for 2002, according to the United Nations.The European Commission, virtual host of Monday's new round, counted a total of 7.7 billion dollars, with just under a third carried forward to 2021The EU and its 27 member states -- which worry that failure to help refugees in the Middle East could see them come to Europe -- provided two thirds of the funds.Various platforms for discussion will be held online on Monday and the main donors' round will take place on Tuesday, with the final sum known at the end of the day.The civil war in Syria has killed more than 388,000 people and displaced millions since the regime's brutal repression of anti-government protests in 2011.In addition to fighting between Russian and Iranian-backed government forces and rebels, jihadist factions like the Islamic State group have taken advantage of the chaos.This in turn has drawn in US and allied western forces, which carried out air strikes and worked with Kurdish fighters against the IS group.mad/dc/bp/har||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/24-million-threatened-world-urged-to-donate-to-syria-after-decade-of-war-101616990586831.html

The firm said it was awaiting confirmation of the refloating from the Suez Canal Authority.Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, said workers continued “pulling maneuvers” to refloat the vessel early Monday.Satellite data from MarineTraffic.com showed the ship in the same position, surrounded by a squadron of tugboats with its bow stuck in the canal's eastern bank.The skyscraper-sized Ever Given became stuck in the Suez Canal last Tuesday and has held up $9 billion in global trade each day, bringing disruption to the vital waterway. Already, hundreds vessels remained trapped in the canal waiting to pass, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle. Over two dozen vessels have opted for the alternative route between Asia and Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, adding some two weeks to journeys and threatening delivery delays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-container-ship-mv-ever-given-stuck-in-suez-canal-partially-refloated-101616990851665.html
29-03-2021||World||Overseas Tokyo ticket holders may get only partial refunds||Many fans living outside Japan who bought Tokyo Olympic tickets from brokers — so-called Authorized Ticket Resellers — will not get full refunds. And they may have a long wait to get any refunds at all.The question of refunds came into play a week ago when local organizers and the Japanese government decided to bar most fans from abroad because of the Covid-19 pandemic.There are dozen of Authorized Tickets Resellers. They are typically appointed by national Olympic committees and are allowed to charge a 20% handling fee on tickets. For $2,000 worth of tickets, for instance, the reseller can charge $2,400.CoSport, the ATR for the United States and other territories and countries, said in a letter over the weekend to ticket holders that it would not refund the handling fee. It said it would refund the face value of the ticket and the shipping fees.The letter, signed by CoSport president Robert F. Long, said: “CoSport and other Olympic entities encouraged the Japanese government and organizers to refund all cost incurred by international spectators.”Tokyo organizers have said they would refund the face value of the tickets, but are not responsible for other added charges. They have said they will not cover the extra fees imposed by ATRs, or cancellation fees for hotels or flights.The New Jersey-based CoSport added that it would not receive refunds from the organizers until "the third quarter of this year” and could not start paying refunds until then.It has also asked purchasers to apply for refunds almost immediately. It set a deadline of April 9 to submit the required document.“Failure to meet this deadline will jeopardize your refund," the letter said.“We realize this is a quick turnaround, however, it is based on the deadline we must meet to apply for a refund on your behalf.”In addition, by applying for a refund customers may in effect be releasing CoSport from any further claims. This would keep ticket holders from taking further legal action.Brandon Nagata, who lives in Honolulu, said he has spent almost $4,000 on tickets. He said he applied for some refunds from CoSport more than six months ago. He said he's received $209 but is still waiting for $420 to be refunded.He said he held on to about $3,000 worth of tickets, hoping he'd able to attend.“I don't like that they are making us fill out a form with information they already have,” he wrote in an email to Associated Press.“It's another thing to delay the refund or to disqualify customers from getting the refunds.”Records show CoSport, which also operates as JET Set Sports, received a $784,900 loan just under a year ago in a Coronavirus-related loan program run by the Small Business Administration.The future of CoSport and all resellers is in question with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba slated to take over ticket sales starting with the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.Andrew Pham, who lives in Spokane, Washington, spent about $2,500 on tickets and faulted the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee for repeatedly appointing CoSport as the ticket agent. He questioned the level of customer service provided.Cartan Tours, which is the reseller for most of the Caribbean and Latin America, did not indicate on its website how it would handle refunds, or when. It said it would work “to obtain all eligible and applicable refunds.”Team GB, which is handling sales in Britain, indicated on its website it would give full refunds.“If you have bought a travel package(s) through us, they are protected by our Covid-19 guarantee, offering a 100% refund.”Tokyo organizers said about 600,000 Olympic tickets have been sold to people outside Japan. Japanese residents bought 4.45 million. Organizers said several years ago there would be a total of 7.8 million tickets for the Olympics.Shutting out fans from abroad will be a large blow to the local operating committee budget. It had expected to receive $800 million from ticket sales and any shortfall will have to be made up by Japanese government entities.The official cost of the Olympics is $15.4 billion. However, several government audits suggest it might be twice that much, and all but $6.7 billion is public money. A study by the University of Oxford says these are the most expensive Olympics on record.No information about tickets has been forthcoming from organizers of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, which open in just 10 months — Feb. 4, 2022. It is possible that fans from abroad will also be banned from these games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/overseas-tokyo-ticket-holders-may-get-only-partial-refunds-101616990818241.html
29-03-2021||World||China warns companies against politicising actions regarding Xinjiang||Sweden's H&M and other foreign companies facing a backlash in China after raising concerns about forced labour in Xinjiang should look into the issue seriously and not politicise their economic behaviour, Chinese officials said on Monday.H&M, Burberry, Nike and Adidas and other western brands have been hit by consumer boycotts in China since last week over comments about their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang. The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human rights abuses in the western region.Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights' groups reported the use of forced labour in Xinjiang - a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied.Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the regional government of Xinjiang, told reporters that a company should not politicise its economic behaviour and said H&M won't be able to make money anymore in the Chinese market because of its statement.Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang's cotton. He invited companies to take trips to the region's cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening.WESTERN SANCTIONSWashington on Friday condemned what it called a "state-led" social media campaign in China against U.S. and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang.The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. The U.S. government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uighur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region.Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilise China with the sanctions.The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims.Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-companies-against-politicising-actions-regarding-xinjiang-101616988865361.html

It’s absolutely outrageous. And based on the reporting I’ve gotten, an awful lot of people have been killed totally unnecessarily,” Biden said on Sunday.He was responding to questions about the recent deaths of innocent people in a protest against the military coup in Myanmar.Over a 100 people lost their lives on Saturday, Myanmar’s National Armed Forces Day, and shots were fired at the American Center of Yangon, in an incident that is being investigated, Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said.“The Burmese military marked the country’s National Armed Forces Day with a senseless and brutal crackdown that claimed the lives of over one hundred Burmese citizens. This is the bloodiest day that we have witnessed since the junta’s illegal and illegitimate coup,” he said.“The reported attack on the American Center in Yangon suggests that this situation is untenable and increasingly spiraling out of control,” Meeks said condemning the military’s actions in Myanmar.“I call on the Tatmadaw to ensure the safety of American personnel and refrain from violence against the people who are protesting its continuing undemocratic actions. I welcome the Biden administration’s sanctions on MEC and MEHL earlier this week and urge the administration to work with our partners to place additional pressure on the junta until it respects the will of the people,” Meeks said.On Saturday, Chiefs of Defense of Australia, Canada, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America in a joint statement condemned the use of lethal force against unarmed people by the Myanmar armed forces and associated security services.“A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting – not harming – the people it serves. We urge the Myanmar Armed Forces to cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions,” the joint statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrible-absolutely-outrageous-joe-biden-on-civilian-killings-in-myanmar-101616987444571.html
29-03-2021||World||North Korea accuses UN of double standard over missile firings||North Korea on Monday accused the United Nations of a “double standard” over its reaction to the North’s recent missile launches, warning it of a serious consequence.Last week, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a defiance of UN resolutions that ban such launches by North Korea. The UN Security Council subsequently adopted a resolution to renew the mandate of UN experts monitoring sanctions against North Korea.Some experts say North Korea's missile launches, the first of their kind in a year, were aimed at applying pressure on the new US government of President Joe Biden.“It constitutes a denial of sovereignty and an apparent double standard that the UNSC takes issue, on the basis of the UN ‘resolutions’ — direct products of the US hostile policy toward (North Korea),” senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official Jo Chol Su said in a statement carried by state media.Jo said it “doesn’t make any sense” for the UN council to take issue with only North Korea’s missile launches, while not doing anything on similar weapons tests by other countries. He said such a “double standard will invite more serious consequence” but didn’t elaborate.Observers say North Korea could test-fire longer-range missiles in coming weeks.At Friday’s meeting of the committee monitoring sanctions and North Korea, where all 15 Security Council members are represented, UN diplomats said a significant majority expressed concern at Pyongyang’s latest violations of council resolutions banning ballistic missile launches. They said the Security Council is likely to hold a closed discussion on the missile launches this week.Past short-range missile launches by North Korea typically drew UN Security Council condemnations, but not fresh sanctions on the country. North Korea was slapped with toughened UN sanctions in 2016-17 following its provocative run of missile and nuclear tests aimed at acquiring the capability of launching nuclear strikes on the US mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-accuses-un-of-double-standard-over-missile-firings-101616981154666.html

The first case in the new cluster was reported on Friday.Palaszczuk pointed to the success of a snap three-day lockdown in Brisbane in early January after the discovery of a single case of the UK variant."That worked very well when we did that last time," she said.Snap lockdowns, social distancing rules and speedy contact tracing systems have helped Australia to contain fresh clusters in recent months. It has reported just over 29,200 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.The Brisbane lockdown is currently scheduled to finish just before the Easter long weekend and school term break in Australia, usually a popular time for people to travel.Schools in the city will be closed from Tuesday, funerals capped at 20 people and weddings limited to 10 people. The number of international travellers - largely returning citizens and permanent residents - allowed into Brisbane has been halved.Virgin Australia said all its domestic flights into the city were operating as normal on Monday but schedules could be changed in response to demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brisbane-australia-s-third-largest-city-to-enter-three-day-covid-19-lockdown-101616980326632.html
29-03-2021||World||Paris doctors warn of catastrophic overload of coronavirus cases||Critical care doctors in Paris say surging coronavirus infections could soon overwhelm their ability to care for the sick in the French capital's hospitals, possibly forcing them to choose which patients they have the resources to save.The sobering warnings were delivered Sunday in newspaper opinions signed by dozens of Paris-region doctors. They came as French President Emmanuel Macron has been vigorously defending his decision not to completely lockdown France again as he did last year.Since January, Macron's government has instead imposed a nationwide overnight curfew and followed that with a grab-bag of other restrictions.But with infections soaring and hospitals increasingly running short of intensive-care beds, doctors have been stepping up the pressure for a full French lockdown.Writing in Le Journal du Dimanche, 41 Paris-region hospital doctors said: “We have never known such a situation, even during the worst (terror) attacks” that targeted the French capital, notably assaults by Islamic State extremists in 2015 that killed 130 people and filled Paris emergency wards with the wounded.The doctors predicted that softer new restrictions imposed this month on Paris and some other regions won't quickly bring the resurgent epidemic under control. They warned that hospital resources won't be able to keep pace with needs, forcing them to practice “catastrophe medicine" in the coming weeks as cases peak.“We already know that our capacity to offer care will be overwhelmed," they wrote.“We will be obliged to triage patients in order to save as many lives as possible. This triage will concern all patients, with and without COVID, in particular for adult patients' access to critical care.”Another group of nine critical-care doctors writing in the newspaper Le Monde also warned that intensive care units in Paris may have to refuse patients.“The current situation is tending toward prioritisation, also called triage,'” they wrote.“When just one ICU bed is available but two patients could benefit from it, it consists of deciding which of them will be admitted (and will perhaps survive) and which will not be admitted (and will quite probably die). This is where we are heading.”They also accused Macron's government of hypocrisy “by compelling health care workers to decide which patient should live and which should die, without stating so clearly.”Macron remains adamant that not locking France down again this year, like some other European countries, was sound government policy, even as more than 2,000 deaths per week push the country ever closer to the milestone of 100,000 people lost to the pandemic. The country now counts more than 94,600 virus-related deaths.“We were right not to implement a lockdown in France at the end of January because we didn't have the explosion of cases that every model predicted,” Macron said last week.“There won't be a mea culpa from me. I don't have remorse and won't acknowledge failure.”Macron's administration has been hoping to outrace the resurgent outbreak with its vaccination campaign, an ambition that appears increasingly unrealistic as hospitals struggle.After a sluggish start in December, France's inoculation drive stepped up this weekend with the start of injections for healthy people aged 70 and above.More than 7.7 million people — close to 15% of all French adults — have had at least one jab of either the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines.The government says the pace will continue to pick up, with France expecting to get nearly 3 million additional Pfizer doses this week.The European Union's vaccine czar, Thierry Breton, told French radio RTL on Sunday that the bloc will deliver 420 million vaccine doses to its member countries by July 15.“The vaccines are coming,” he said.Breton also unveiled a mock-up of a proposed EU health certificate that could allow the bloc's residents to cross its internal borders more easily.The certificate shows if people have been vaccinated, tested negative for coronavirus or recovered from it. He said the certificate would be optional and could be available by mid-June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-doctors-warn-of-catastrophic-overload-of-coronavirus-cases-101616979962776.html

"Lynn Valley Library is a peaceful place. A place where our community comes to learn and our children come to explore."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspect-charged-after-vancouver-stabbings-that-killed-1-injured-6-101616978931006.html

If the poll result was replicated at an election, the conservative government would lose office to centre-left Labor.The Australian parliament has been engulfed by allegations of sexual abuse, discrimination against women and misconduct.The poll comes after historical rape allegations were aired against Attorney-General Christian Porter. Porter strongly denies the claim of the alleged 1988 rape.Separately, two female employees of Morrison's Liberal Party have said they were raped by a former employee, who has not been identified, in 2019 and 2020.There have also been reports of lewd acts by male staff in parliament, fueling outrage that the government has allowed a toxic and sexist workplace to fester.Morrison, who on Saturday reprimanded one of his lawmakers for bullying two women constituents, has ordered a probe into parliament's workplace culture but critics say he has failed to map out any new policy initiatives to address the broader issues of sexism and violence against women.After a surprise victory in the 2019 election which left the ruling coalition with a wafer-thin majority, Morrison's popularity waned over perceptions he mishandled the response to deadly bushfires in 2019-2020.His standing had recovered as Australia successfully contained the coronavirus pandemic, before the government's alleged mistreatment of women brought his poll ratings down again.Tens of thousands of women protested earlier this month outside parliament and around Australia calling for gender equality and justice for victims of sexual assault.The Newspoll was based on surveys of just over 1,500 voters across capital cities and regional areas from Wednesday to Saturday, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.(Reporting by Renju Jose; additional reporting by Jonathan Barrett; Editing by Stephen Coates)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-morrison-s-approval-rating-falls-to-lowest-in-a-year-amid-backlash-101616978322594.html
29-03-2021||World||US officials suspect China's hand in writing WHO Covid-19 origin report||Top Biden administration officials on Sunday expressed concern about the way a pivotal report examining the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic was crafted, including the possibility that the Chinese government had a hand in writing it.The Geneva-based World Health Organization has said the findings from its mission to Wuhan, China, in early 2021 will be ready in a few days. The report had been expected earlier in March.The US has “real concerns about the methodology and the process” of the report, including that the Chinese government “apparently helped to write it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CNN.While there needs to be “accountability for the past,” the focus should be on building a stronger system for the future, Blinken said on “State of the Union.”WhitewashAnthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases specialist, said he didn’t know if the report would be a “whitewash” when asked about it on CBS, and said he wouldn’t pre-judge the conclusions.“What I would like to do is first see the report,” said Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on “Face the Nation.” “You’re getting a lot of conjecture around about what they did and what they were allowed to do or not.”“If, in fact, obviously, there was a lot of restrictions on the ability of the people who went there to really take a look, then I’m going to have some considerable concern about that.”Pressuring ChinaThe Biden administration has maintained pressure on China and the WHO for weeks over what it has portrayed as a flawed investigation.“We do not believe that China has made available sufficient original data into how this pandemic began to spread both in China and then eventually around the world,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Feb. 21.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that the US was concerned about a lack of transparency and data in the preparation of that report.“We’ll have to take a look at it and make sure we have access to the underlying information,” Psaki said in a press briefing. She reiterated a call for an international investigation into the pandemic and “the lack of transparency from the Chinese.”Robert Redfield, who led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the first year of the pandemic, told CNN in a clip that aired Friday that he thinks the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan lab.That scenario is more likely than any alternative, including that the virus erupted after transferring from animals to humans or in a live-animal market, Redfield said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-suspect-china-s-hand-in-writing-who-covid-19-origin-report-101616978277626.html

29-03-2021||World||US President Joe Biden's economic plan to focus first on infrastructure this week||President Joe Biden will lay out the first part of his multitrillion-dollar economic recovery package this week, focusing on rebuilding roads, bridges and other infrastructure, followed by a separate plan later in April addressing child and health care.White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed on Sunday the administration's plans to split the package into two legislative proposals, part of an effort to get support from congressional Republicans. But she adds that “we'll work with the Senate and House to see how it should move forward.”Biden will release details in a speech Wednesday in Pittsburgh about his proposal for federal investments in physical infrastructure, an issue that has drawn Republican support despite wariness over a pricey package so soon after passage of the USD 1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan.Democrats, meanwhile, have been aiming for a broader package that could include policy changes on green energy, immigration and other issues — as well as make permanent some of the just-passed Covid-19 assistance such as child tax credits. Many are ready to bypass Republicans, if they have to.Psaki told “Fox News Sunday” the White House had yet to settle on its legislative strategy, “but I will say that I don't think Republicans in this country think we should be 13th in the world as it relates to infrastructure.””“Roads, railways, rebuilding them, that's not a partisan issue,” she said.A separate proposal later in April then “will address a lot of issues that American people are struggling with — child care, the cost of health care,” Psaki said.Plans are still in flux, with the White House recently discussing a combined USD 3 trillion in spending to boost the economy and improve quality of life, according to a person familiar with the options who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.“The total package we're still working out, but he's going to introduce some ways to pay for that, and he's eager to hear ideas from both parties as well,” Psaki said.Republicans support a narrow infrastructure bill focused on roads and bridges and balk at the size and scope of Biden's overall plan as well as his focus on the environment. During the presidential campaign, Biden pledged USD 2 trillion in “accelerated” investments to shift to cleaner energy, build half a million charging stations for electric vehicles, support public transit and repair roads and bridges.Democrats used a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation to approve Biden's Covid-19 relief plan without Republican support.But work on passing broad infrastructure legislation in a Senate split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris providing a tiebreaking vote could prove more difficult.Moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently said he will block infrastructure legislation if Republicans aren't included.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-s-economic-plan-to-focus-first-on-infrastructure-this-week-101616958857891.html
