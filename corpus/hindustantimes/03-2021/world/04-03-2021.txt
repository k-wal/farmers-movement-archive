Officials in Brussels and in Rome confirmed the news of the export ban of 250,000 doses of the shots, which was first reported by the Financial Times.The impact is likely to be largely symbolic given that the number of the vaccines blocked is relatively small compared to the company’s expected deliveries in the EU and elsewhere. But the move highlights Draghi’s intention to be tougher on pharmaceuticals that do not respect their commitments to the EU, and could encourage retaliatory protectionist measures by other governments.In January, the European Commission introduced legislation which allows curbs on exports of coronavirus vaccines if drugmakers fail to meet delivery targets within the bloc. The rules came into force after AstraZeneca had informed the EU that it was unable to meet its commitments under an advance purchase agreement.Damaging ProtectionismUnder the so-called export transparency mechanism, countries have to inform the commission, the EU’s executive arm, of their decisions to block or allow exports of vaccines outside the bloc. The commission did not oppose Italy’s decision, an EU official said. The company declined to comment.Italy is the first country so far to block the export of vaccines outside the EU, while over 170 requests have so far been authorized, according to a separate EU diplomat.The decision could reignite concerns echoed by many including the World Health Organization that the EU is engaging in damaging protectionism, at a time when countries around the world race to immunize their populations amid growing concerns over fast-spreading coronavirus variants.The EU has so far administered doses equivalent to just over 8% of its population, compared to 32.3% and 24.3% in the U.K. and the U.S. respectively, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. The bloc’s target is to inoculate at least 70% of the region’s adult population by the end of the summer.The export controls may also prove to be a growing headache for drugmakers with so many manufacturing sites in the EU. Most companies at the forefront of the vaccine effort have production capacity in the bloc that is used to serve countries beyond it, or must be sent outside for completion before returning.Johnson & Johnson, which is expected to receive approval for its vaccine from Europe’s medicines regulator next week, explicitly agreed in its contract with the EU that it would be sending vaccines to the U.S. to be put in vials and packaged before returning them.Draghi asked leaders at the latest summit to adopt a more resolute and pragmatic approach to speed up vaccinations and told them the EU’s rollout has to move much faster. He wasn’t convinced by a slide shown to leaders indicating that available doses will be sufficient to vaccinate the bulk of the bloc’s population by the end of September. Draghi said deliveries in the second and third quarters couldn’t be predicted.The newly installed Italian premier is working on an overhaul of Italy’s slow and uneven vaccination campaign, focusing on logistics and recruiting the military to help, as new variants accelerate the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.He has signaled a strong break with the past by replacing two key officials who were in charge of countering the virus, and he wants to streamline and standardize inoculation procedures across the country, according to officials who asked not to be named discussing confidential preparations.Draghi is banking on an improved vaccination campaign to help kick-start an economy which shrunk almost 9% in 2020, crippled by the pandemic and both regional and nationwide lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-blocks-astra-covid-vaccine-export-risks-backlash-against-eu-101614879092725.html

Charles Spencer, has alleged that Bashir used false documents, including fake bank statements, and other dishonest tactics to convince Diana to agree to the interview.Police Commander Alex Murray said detectives had “carefully assessed” the allegations and sought advice from lawyers.“Following this detailed assessment and in view of the advice we received, we have determined that it is not appropriate to begin a criminal investigation into these allegations,” he said. “No further action will be taken.“In this matter, as in any other, should any significant new evidence come to light we will assess it," he added.The BBC has begun its own investigation, led by a retired judge, into the circumstances surrounding the program.The interview, in which Diana famously said “there were three of us in this marriage” — referring to Prince Charles’ relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles —was watched by millions of people and sent shockwaves through the monarchy.Diana divorced from Charles in 1996 and died in a Paris car crash in 1997 as she was pursued by paparazzi. Charles married Camilla, now the Duchess of Cornwall, in 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-won-t-probe-journalist-over-1995-princess-diana-interview-101614878581650.html
04-03-2021||World||World’s first space hotel expected to open in 2027. Check the inside of planned 'Voyager Station'||Space construction company Orbital Assembly Corporation recently unveiled new details about its ambitious project of building a hotel above Earth’s atmosphere. Gateway Foundation first came up with the concept in 2012 and the Californian company later established OAC to realise its dream of building the first commercial hotel in space. The company is planning to start building the hotel, Voyager Station, in the low Earth orbit in 2025 that could be operational as early as 2027, reported the Daily Mail.The space hotel will be different from the International Space Station (ISS) since the giant wheel with 24 modules, connected by elevator shafts, will rotate to generate artificial gravity of a level found on the Moon’s surface. It will also have 44 emergency return vehicles (ERVs) with automated flight controls for autonomous landing, according to the construction company.With over 11,600 square metres of habitable space, the commercial station will have many features expected in a cruise ship, including luxury villas, hotel suites, gym, restaurant and bar. “Simulated gravity will offer amenities like toilet facilities, showers, and beds that function similar to what you are used to on Earth,” the company’s website says.Read | Indian-origin Nasa scientist controlling Perseverance rover from his London flatExplaining the design, OAC said in a series of tweets that the Voyager Station will be assembled in orbit before spin-up using automation and telerobotics. The docking hub at the centre, where the Operation and Control Center (OCC) will be located, is expected to function as a stand-alone zero gravity station. The first OCC will be in place from the beginning that will allow the crew members to live on station to operate the pods and drones.The planned orbit and elevation for Voyager Station is 97 degree and 500-550 kilometres from Earth surface in a sun-synchronous orbit. This means the space hotel will be synchronised to always be in the same ‘fixed’ position relative to the Sun, helping reduce thermal stress and allow for almost continuous solar power generation. According to OAC, orbit degradation and space debris risk will also be nominal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-first-space-hotel-with-artificial-gravity-expected-to-open-in-2027-101614876652538.html
04-03-2021||World||Italy sees sharpest fall in energy demand since WWII due to pandemic: Report||Italy's energy demand fell last year at the fastest rate since World War Two as a sharp drop in road and air traffic during the pandemic undercut oil consumption, a study showed on Thursday.Italian energy and technology research centre ENEA said energy demand in the country slumped 10% last year, driven by a 60% fall in oil consumption."The fall in energy demand is the highest since 1943-44, when Italy was in the middle of World War Two," ENEA analyst Francesco Gracceva said.At the time of the financial crisis in 2009 energy consumption fell by "only" 5.7%, he added.ENEA gave no forecasts for whether the decline in demand would continue this year.Severe coronavirus restrictions to contain surging infection rates weighed on energy demand across Europe last year as travel slowed to a trickle and industry cut back production. Italy has been one of the worst hit countries in Europe, with 98,635 deaths from Covid-19.As energy demand fell, carbon emissions in Italy dropped by 12% last year to levels 40% below those of 2005, ENEA said, adding imports of low-carbon technology, especially electric and hybrid cars, jumped 27%.The sharp fall in oil demand pushed the share of fossil fuels in Italy's energy mix to their lowest level since 1961 while gas remained the main energy source.Electricity demand fell 5.3% for the year while power prices fell 15% for companies and 10% for consumers, ENEA said.Thanks to the fall in overall energy consumption, the share of renewable energy rose to 20%, "data that allows Italy to beat the EU target of 17% set for 2020," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-sees-sharpest-fall-in-energy-demand-since-wwii-due-to-pandemic-report-101614877610818.html
04-03-2021||World||Police request 60-day extension of Guard at US Capitol||The Capitol Police have requested that members of the National Guard continue to provide security at the U.S. Capitol for another two months, The Associated Press has learned. Defense officials say the new proposal is being reviewed by the Pentagon.The request underscores the continuing concerns about security and the potential for violence at the Capitol, two months after rioters breached the building in violence that left five people dead. And it comes as law enforcement was on high alert Thursday around the U.S. Capitol after intelligence uncovered a “possible plot” by a militia group to storm the building.The potential plot is tied to the far-right conspiracy theory promoted by QAnon supporters that former President Donald Trump will rise again to power on March 4, the original presidential inauguration day.U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said she learned that the request for a 60-day extension was made in the last 36 hours, and that the Guard is now seeking volunteers from states around the country to fill the need.Defense officials confirmed that the request is under review at the Pentagon, and that the Guard has started checking states for availability of their troops, in an effort to be prepared if final Defense Department approval is given. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.There are more than 5,000 Guard members currently in Washington, D.C., all slated to go home on March 12, ending the mission.Slotkin said some members of Congress have been concerned about whether there is a solid plan to provide security for members and staff going forward.“We want to understand what the plan is,” she said. “None of us like looking at the fencing, the gates, the uniformed presence around the Capitol. We can’t depend on the National Guard for our security.”She said there has to be a plan that provides the needed security for the buildings and personnel by the Capitol Police and local law enforcement. Slotkin said it was telling that House members hastened to complete major votes Wednesday so they wouldn't have to be in the building where many fled violent rioters in January. Lawmakers, she said, “don't feel totally secure” in the Capitol.U.S. Capitol Police officials have also told congressional leaders the razor-wire topped fencing around the Capitol should remain in place for several more months.Slotkin said, however, that she was going to her office to work on Thursday. “I'm not going to let these guys scare me away,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-request-60-day-extension-of-guard-at-us-capitol-101614877044590.html

People near the coast from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay were told to evacuate."Hope everyone is ok out there - especially on the East Coast who would have felt the full force of that earthquake," Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram.There was threat to the capital Wellington and other regions, but civil defence authorities asked residents across the country to stay away from beaches and marine areas as there could be strong and unusual currents.More than 60,000 people reported feeling the quake on GeoNet's website, with 282 describing the shaking as "severe" and 75 saying it was "extreme". Most others described it as light.Aftershocks were still being recorded in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-quake-shakes-new-zealand-but-no-damage-reported-and-tsunami-threat-eases-101614876308709.html
04-03-2021||World||White House says relief checks to go to most who got December payment||Roughly 98% of US households that received a Covid-19 relief check in December will also qualify for the next round of payments being championed by President Joe Biden, according to a White House official.Biden has said that Americans were promised $2,000 in direct checks, but only $600 was approved in December. The president views that promise as a cornerstone of his $1.9 trillion relief package pending in the Senate. His proposal offers $1,400 in additional payments that would quickly phase out based on income, so that money is better aimed at the middle class and poor.Under the current Senate bill, the Biden administration estimates that 158.5 million households will receive direct payments, according to the White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. The official stressed that almost everyone gets a check twice as large as in December, although 3.5 million households that received some payment from the $900 billion December package would no longer qualify.The decrease is due to tighter limits in the Senate bill on who can receive checks. The Biden administration has wanted to honor the promise made to voters, but it also does not want to be viewed as sending money to the affluent.Under the Senate bill, anyone earning up to $75,000 qualifies for the full $1,400 with the payment being cut off entirely at $80,000. Couples earning up to $150,000 also receive checks with the payments disappearing at an income of $160,000.Still, families that do not receive a direct check might still come out ahead in the massive $1.9 trillion package. The bill expands tax credits for children and childcare and those benefits will go to some of the households that received a check in December but no longer qualify for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-relief-checks-to-go-to-most-who-got-december-payment-101614874145156.html

Britain, Switzerland and the United States, which have strong domestic pharmaceutical industries, have opposed a waiver."Rich countries, the EU, the US, Canada and Switzerland ... are blocking that derogation. And they are doing so in the name of profit and business and status quo instead of putting human lives above profit," Cornish said.Globally, 265 million doses of vaccines have been administered, with 80% in just 10 countries, WHO's top emergency expert Mike Ryan said on social media on Wednesday night.He welcomed the first roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines this week through the COVAX facility that aims to provide doses to lower income countries, starting in Ivory Coast.Nearly 10 million doses have been delivered in more than 10 countries, he said, adding: "That's a huge step forward in terms of at least beginning the journey towards better vaccine equity around the world."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/waive-covid-vaccine-patents-to-benefit-poor-nations-activists-say-101614869269076.html
04-03-2021||World||Iraq beefs up security for pope amid rising violence, pandemic||Iraq is deploying thousands of additional security personnel to protect Pope Francis during his four-day visit, which comes after a spate of rocket and suicide bomb attacks raised fears for the Catholic leader's safety.A senior security official who has been briefed on the security plan said that forces involved had been trained to deal with worst-case scenarios, from street battles to bombings and rocket attacks.The hypothetical threats were part of large-scale exercises in preparation for the March 5-8 visit, the first ever by a pope to Iraq. As well as concerns over violence, the country has seen a spike in Covid-19 cases, further complicating preparations.Francis said he was making the trip to show solidarity with the country's devastated Christian community of around 300,000, just one fifth of the number before the US invasion in 2003 and the brutal Islamist militant violence that followed.Pope John Paul II came close to visiting, but had to cancel a planned trip in 2000 after talks with the government of then-leader Saddam Hussein broke down.Over the past two months, attacks on civilians and military targets have increased. In January, Baghdad suffered its first major suicide bombing for three years when two people detonated themselves in a crowded market, killing at least 32.On Wednesday morning, 10 rockets landed on an airbase that hosts US, coalition and Iraqi forces. Hours after that attack, the pope reaffirmed he would be going to Iraq.The 84-year-old will visit four cities, including the former Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, where churches and other buildings still bear the scars of conflict.Francis will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham who is revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews, and meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, 90-year-old Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.ARMOURED CARSInterior ministry special forces and the army will set up a security cordon around the pope wherever he goes, while the air force will operate drones around the clock to monitor the routes he will take.There will be an explosives team and counter-terrorism personnel on standby in case of any suspicious devices or street battles.Undercover intelligence and national security officers will also be deployed at gatherings attended by the pope, said the source, who declined to be named while discussing security matters.A technical team can also jam or cut off suspicious phone calls or radio communications, he added.Vatican officials and local Church leaders say they are satisfied that Iraqi forces will be able to provide adequate protection for the pope and his entourage.About 10,000 security personnel will be deployed to protect Francis, who may travel in armoured cars in what would be a departure from the norm for him."Clearly, we are now talking about a trip where security needs are different than other trips, so it is much more probable, possible that an armoured car will be used," Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Tuesday.SPRUCING UP THE STREETSPreparations for the pope's trip have been in high gear for weeks.Fresh asphalt has been laid on some roads he is expected to use, and dozens of workers have been applying fresh paint to sidewalks and planting flowers around churches he will visit.Billboards and posters depicting Francis have been erected, and pristine Iraqi and Vatican flags flutter side by side on buildings.Christians are generally excited about the historic trip, seeing it as a sign of solidarity after years of persecution, threats and exodus.But many ordinary Iraqis are less enthusiastic."We appreciate that he's coming, but I don't understand why there is so much attention given to this trip," said Nour Ahmed, 21, a university student in Baghdad.Security forces and armoured vehicles filled otherwise empty streets surrounding two cordoned-off churches the pope is scheduled to go to in central Baghdad."Our preparations from the security forces' standpoint are enough ... it's under the supervision of the Vatican delegation," said the joint operation's spokesman Tahseen al-Khafaji.Nearly two weeks ago, the Iraqi government banned most travel between provinces and imposed a nationwide curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. on weekdays and for 24 hours a day on Friday to Sunday, following a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections.A police official said the coronavirus precautions had made beefing up protection for the pope easier."The potential risk comes from people's movements. Limiting people's movement will help us a lot in our work," said Khaled al-Mohanna, interior ministry spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-beefs-up-security-for-pope-amid-rising-violence-pandemic-101614871661438.html
04-03-2021||World||New UK post-study graduate route to open for Indian students in July||The UK said on Thursday that applications will open on July 1 for the so-called “graduate route” that will allow international students who complete an undergraduate degree or above in Britain to work for at least two years.Britain had witnessed a decline in the number of students from countries such as India after it scrapped an earlier provision that allowed international candidates to work in the country after completing their studies. The UK government announced the new visa route last year.The UK said international students on the graduate route will be able to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years in the case of PhD students.“This will help allow the brightest and the best students from India to continue to contribute to the UK post-study,” the British high commission said in a statement.The graduate route will be unsponsored, meaning applicants won’t need a job offer to apply for it. There will be no minimum salary requirements or caps on numbers – graduates will be able to work flexibly, switch jobs and develop their career as they choose.Indian students are one of the largest international groups studying in Britain and make a “huge contribution to UK public life”, the statement said. According to the latest statistics, the number of student visas issued to Indians increased by 42%, compared to the previous year, and now number more than 53,000. This represents 23% of all British student visas issued, up from 13% in the previous year.The UK higher education sector had pressured the government to resume the practice of allowing international students to work after their studies as more and more students from countries such as India began moving away from Britain to other European countries such as Germany and France.The UK has also extended concessions for students unable to travel to the UK after getting admission to British educational institutions because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This was done due to the continuing disruption in international travel.Students who started their studies in autumn 2020 will now need to be in the UK by June 21 to be eligible to apply for the graduate route, while those starting their courses in January or February this year will now be required to be in the UK by September 27.UK’s immigration minister Kevin Foster said: “The launch of this new route will ensure those who graduate from our world leading institutions will easily be able to secure the status they deserve to continue living and working as they make our United Kingdom their home.”British high commissioner Alex Ellis added, “The flow of students between India and the UK makes the human connection between our countries – the ‘living bridge’ – ever stronger. I’m delighted that increasing numbers of talented Indian students are choosing the UK to study, and even more so that the graduate route will allow them to work in the UK after their studies.”The UK is committed to supporting thousands of Indian students to pursue their education in the UK and post-study employment opportunities, said Barbara Wickham, director in India for British Council. “Given the pandemic travel restrictions, these new timelines to reach the UK will help ensure international students are able to benefit from the graduate route and gain coveted international work experience,” she said.The new graduate route will help the UK government achieve its target in the International Education Strategy to increase the number of international students in higher education to 600,000 by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-post-study-graduate-route-to-open-for-indian-students-in-july-101614868351434.html
04-03-2021||World||Wider Image: The man who saves forgotten cats in Fukushima's nuclear zone||A decade ago, Sakae Kato stayed behind to rescue cats abandoned by neighbours who fled the radiation clouds belching from the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant. He won't leave."I want to make sure I am here to take care of the last one," he said from his home in the contaminated quarantine zone. "After that I want to die, whether that be a day or hour later."So far he has buried 23 cats in his garden, the most recent graves disturbed by wild boars that roam the depopulated community. He is looking after 41 others in his home and another empty building on his property.Kato leaves food for feral cats in a storage shed he heats with a paraffin stove. He has also rescued a dog, Pochi. With no running water, he has to fill bottles from a nearby mountain spring, and drive to public toilets.The 57-year-old, a small construction business owner in his former life, says his decision to stay as 160,000 other people evacuated the area was spurred in part by the shock of finding dead pets in abandoned houses he helped demolish.The cats also gave him a reason to stay on land that has been owned by his family for three generations."I don't want to leave, I like living in these mountains," he said standing in front of his house, which he is allowed to visit but, technically, not allowed to sleep in.The two-storey wooden structure is in poor condition.Rotten floorboards sag. It is peppered with holes where wall panels and roof tiles that kept the rain out were dislodged by a powerful earth tremor last month, stirring frightening memories of the devastating quake on March 11, 2011, that led to a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown."It might last another two or three years. The walls have started to lean," Kato said.Decontamination in fields near his house signal that other residents will soon be allowed to return.He estimates he spends $7,000 a month on his animals, part of it to buy dog food for wild boar that gather near his house at sunset. Farmers consider them pests, and also blame them for wrecking empty homes.On Feb. 25, Kato was arrested on suspicion of freeing wild boar caught in traps set up by Japan's government in November. At time this article was published, he was still being detained for questioning.Yumiko Konishi, a vet from Tokyo who helps Kato, said local volunteers were caring for the cats on his property, but at least one had died since he was detained.FEAR LINGERSAbout 30 km (19 miles) southeast, still in the restricted zone, Hisae Unuma is also surveying the state of her home, which withstood the earthquake a decade ago but is now close to collapsing after years of being battered by wind, rain and snow."I'm surprised it's still standing," the 67-year-old farmer said, a week after the tremor that damaged Kato's house."I could see my cattle in the field from there," she said pointing to the living room, a view now blocked by a tangle of bamboo.Unuma fled as the cooling system at Tokyo Electric Power Co's nuclear plant 2.5 km away failed and its reactors began to melt down.The government, which has adopted Fukushima as a symbol of national revival amid preparations for Tokyo Olympic Games, is encouraging residents to return to decontaminated land.Lingering fears about the nuclear plant, jobs and poor infrastructure are keeping many away, though.Unuma, now a vegetable farmer in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, where her husband died three years ago, won't return even if the government scrapes the radioactive soil off her fields.Radiation levels around her house are around 20 times the background level in Tokyo, according to a dosimeter reading carried out by Reuters.Only the removal of Fukushima's radioactive cores will make her feel safe, a task that will take decades to complete."Never mind the threat from earthquakes, those reactors could blow if someone dropped a tool in the wrong place," she said.Before making the four-hour drive back to her new home, Unuma visits the Ranch of Hope, a cattle farm owned by Masami Yoshizawa, who defied an order to cull his irradiated livestock in protest against the government and Tokyo Electric Power.Among the 233 bullocks still there is the last surviving bullock from the 50-strong herd Unuma used to tend, and one of her last living links to the life she had before the disaster.Her bullock ignores her when she tries to lure him over, so Yoshizawa gives her a handful of cabbage to try to tempt him."The thing about cattle, is that they really only think about food," Yoshizawa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wider-image-the-man-who-saves-forgotten-cats-in-fukushima-s-nuclear-zone-101614868289956.html
04-03-2021||World||French President Macron could still squeeze in a pension reform: Le Maire||French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is keeping pressure on President Emmanuel Macron to push on with contentious overhauls, despite the elections only a year from now.According to Le Maire, a pension reform to address the financial imbalances in the country’s system is still possible before voters head to the polls in April 2022.“When the time comes there will be a pension reform so that France catches up in terms of the amount of work people do throughout their lives,” Le Maire said at a conference organized by Politico in Paris. “It’s up to the president and him alone to decide. I think it’s perfectly possible in this five-year term to take measure to improve the financial situation of pensions.”Macron dropped a planned overhaul of pensions when the pandemic struck France last year, and after prolonged strikes and protests against his plans. Le Maire has repeatedly said changes to pensions will still be needed one day and France should not give up on structural reforms, even if he hasn’t set an exact time-line.The timing, however, is tricky. The French economy is not expected to pick up until the second half of this year, leaving a small window for more reforms before the presidential elections. Still, earlier this week, Macron went ahead with an overhaul of unemployment welfare, which also faces broad opposition from labor and business unions.Le Maire said it is necessary to address the deficits in France’s pension system in order to guarantee solidarity between generations and future living standards.“We need to be able to work longer, and we need to ensure people over 50 are encouraged to keep working and young people can get into the job market more easily,” Le Maire said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-sould-still-squeeze-in-a-pension-reform-le-maire-101614869522031.html

Those were personal accounts not related to ISOC," Thanathip said in a statement."ISOC also doesn't engage in operations as reported in the news. We act as a centre for coordination to provide relief and refuge to the people."The network used both fake accounts to pose as individuals from the area and authentic ones to manage groups and pages, including overt military pages and those that did not disclose their affiliations with the military, Facebook said.The company said it took action based on the network's deceptive behaviour, which violated its policy against government interference.It said the action was not based on the content, which included support for the military and the monarchy as well as allegations of violence and criticism of insurgent groups in southern Thailand.In October, Twitter took down 926 accounts it said were linked to the Thai army that promoted pro-army and pro-government content.The army at the time also denied links to the accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-military-denies-involvement-in-network-removed-by-facebook-101614865501798.html

Most goods vehicles and buses in the city-state run on diesel and won’t be affected by the new rule, announced Thursday by the government.Singapore plans to install 60,000 EV charging stations by 2030, two-thirds of which will be in public car parks and the remainder on private premises, the LTA said in a statement. A new government body is being established to spearhead EV-related policy and consultations will be held later in March over private sector participation.“These measures will support Singapore’s targets to cease new diesel car and taxi registrations from 2025, require all new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040,” the LTA said.New public housing developments will have capacity to support EV charging for 15% of their parking lots, it said. The government has announced a series of other measures to reduce carbon emissions, including greater emphasis on solar energy, planting 1 million more trees, expanding rail and cycling networks, and reducing waste sent to landfill by 20% over the next five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-won-t-allow-new-diesel-cars-and-cabs-from-2025-101614846525191.html

Meanwhile, rotting food in landfills releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."If we want to get serious about tackling climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, businesses, governments and citizens around the world have to do their part to reduce food waste," said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-report-says-17-of-food-wasted-at-consumer-level-101614870238210.html
04-03-2021||World||India calls on Canada to ensure safety of Indo-Canadians||India on Thursday has formally called on Canadian authorities to “take all possible measures to ensure the continued safety and security of Indian nationals” after several Indo-Canadians were reported to have received threats from extremist elements in the country. The Indian High Commission in Ottawa has raised this matter in an official communique that was sent to Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry. The communique acknowledges that while the incidents may be an internal matter for Canada, concern among people in India for their family and friends in Canada had pushed the high commission to request the relevant authorities “to immediately investigate these incidents”.“These graphic and disturbing images of assault have caused grave concern in India and people in India are concerned about the safety of their families and friends in Canada,” the communique said.“Such incidents, if left unchecked, can cause friction within the Indian community in Canada and create law and order issues while negatively impacting the warm and friendly relations between Canada and India,” it added.The high commission also asked the ministry to it “keep it apprised of the investigations and actions taken into the identification and prosecution of the extremist elements responsible for such assaults”.This communication comes in the wake of reports of threat and intimidation against Indo-Canadians by pro-Khalistani elements in Canada, a development which was first reported on February 8 by the Hindustan Times.The latest flashpoint came after a video of unprovoked assault of a participant in the Tiranga-Maple Car Rally, organised on Sunday by the Indian community to celebrate the imminent arrival of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines in Canada, went viral. In the video, the two men are seen arguing after which, the assailant violently pushes the victim to the ground. Neither the victim nor the assailants have been identified yet.“There must be zero tolerance for violence and threats at protests. I was disappointed this weekend to see a video circulating of violence at the Tiranga and Maple car rally,” Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton, where the incident occurred, told reporters on Wednesday.“The notion anyone would face violence or intimidation, or threats is abhorrent,” he said in a separate interaction with the media. Brown also connected with worried community members on social media to reassure them, including Brampton-based Dharma Jain. “Response looks positive, but action has to be prompt.” Jain told Hindustan Times after interacting with the mayor. Peel police is investigating the incident, a member of Brown’s office told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-on-canada-to-ensure-safety-of-indocanadians-101614870344242.html
04-03-2021||World||New Zealand police charge man after threat against mosques attacked in 2019||New Zealand police said on Thursday they had charged a 27-year-old man after he threatened to attack two mosques that were the scene of mass murder by a white supremacist two years ago.Police said an online threat was made this week on the 4chan website against the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre, which were targeted in 2019 in New Zealand's most deadly shooting.Police provided no details on the nature of the threat, but New Zealand media said the threats had included setting off a car bomb on March 15 - the anniversary of the 2019 attack.The unnamed man has been charged with threatening to kill and will appear in court on Friday, the police said."Any messages of hate or people wanting to cause harm in our community will not be tolerated - it's not the Kiwi way," said John Price, Canterbury District Commander Superintendent in an emailed statement.A second person arrested on Thursday remains in custody and police said they are considering further charges.New Zealand is on heightened alert ahead of the March 15 anniversary of the Christchurch attack.On that day in 2019, armed with high-capacity semi-automatic weapons, Australian Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people and injured dozens more after opening fire on worshippers at the two mosques, livestreaming the attacks on Facebook before being arrested.In August, Tarrant was sentenced to life in prison without parole, the first time New Zealand has confined anyone for the rest of their life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-police-charge-man-after-threat-against-mosques-attacked-in-2019-101614869703623.html
04-03-2021||World||EU wants employers to report pay levels to fix gender gap||The European Union executive wants to force employers to be much more open about how much their staff earn to make it easier for women to challenge wage imbalances and close the gender pay gap.Even though the gender pay gap across the 27-nation bloc has been reduced to 14% for people doing exactly the same work, the European Commission wants to eliminate the disparity by imposing specific rules to make pay levels public.“For equal pay, you need transparency. Women must know whether their employers treat them fairly," said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Since its inception in 1957, the European Union has sought to end such gender bias, but progress has been slow over the decades. When it comes to pension rights, reflecting working conditions of the past 30 to 40 years, the gender gap still stands at 30%.Wage conditions and scales in Europe have long been shrouded in secrecy, which has helped extend inequality and proved to be a big hurdle for those demanding pay justice.And companies have fallen far short in helping bridge the gap, said EU Vice President Vera Jourova. “We have sufficiently strong evidence that we need to have binding rules and not only to rely on social responsibility of the companies because we see that it doesn’t lead anywhere," she said.She said that over the past 7 years, the gap had closed only by little over 2 percentage points. “You can imagine if we continue like that, we will achieve pay fairness some time in several decades. So we cannot continue like that."Under the commission's proposals, employers would have to give information about initial pay levels in the vacancy announcement and ahead of the job interview, during which employers will not be allowed to ask about applicants' previous pay grades.Employees will be allowed to ask employers the average pay levels by gender for people doing the same work.And to put more pressure on big companies, the proposal forces firms with more than 250 employees to publish information about any gender pay gap.If women remain underpaid, the commission wants them to be able to get back pay and it wants the burden of proof to be on employers, not the women challenging them.The European Trade Union Confederation lauded the intent but said the proposals lacked teeth to force companies into decisive action. It complained that small- and medium-size companies, where such discrimination often happens, were excluded from key elements of the enforcement.The proposal now goes to the European Parliament and EU countries for further discussion before it can be approved.The announcement came ahead of International Women's Day next Monday.The EU noted that women had been disproportionally affected by the pandemic, many having to add more home tasks to their work schedule because of the closure of schools and day care centers.“The COVID-19 pandemic has not only consolidated injustices and inequalities that already existed in our societies, it is also likely to wipe out decades of achievements by women, on progresses in the labor market," said European Parliament President David Sassoli.Jourova said women were vulnerable because most were still at the bottom of the pay scale.“That over-representation in lower-paid sectors and occupations such as, for instance, hospitality, retail or personal services has made them particularly vulnerable in the labor market struck by the COVID-19 crisis," Jourova said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-wants-employers-to-report-pay-levels-to-fix-gender-gap-101614865523894.html
04-03-2021||World||US jobless claims tick up to 745,000 as layoffs remain high||The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits edged higher last week to 745,000, a sign that many employers continue to cut jobs despite a drop in confirmed viral infections and evidence that the overall economy is improving.Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims rose by 9,000 from the previous week. Though the pace of layoffs has eased since the year began, they remain high by historical standards. Before the virus flattened the U.S. economy a year ago, applications for unemployment aid had never topped 700,000 in any week, even during the Great Recession.All told, 4.3 million Americans are receiving traditional state unemployment benefits. Counting supplemental federal unemployment programs that were established to soften the economic damage from the virus, an estimated 18 million people are collecting some form of jobless aid.Restrictions on businesses and the reluctance of many Americans to shop, travel, dine out or attend mass events have weighed persistently on the job market. Job growth averaged a meager 29,000 a month from November through January, and the nation still has nearly 10 million fewer jobs than it did in February 2020. Though the unemployment rate was 6.3% in January, a broader measure that includes people who have given up on their job searches is closer to 10%.The data firm Womply reports that 64% of movie theaters and other entertainment venues, 40% of bars and 34% of hair salons and beauty shops are closed. And on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reported that across the country, “overall conditions in the leisure and hospitality sector continued to be restrained by ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.”On Friday, though, economists have forecast that the government will report a strong job gain for February of near 200,000, which would raise hopes that layoffs will slow. Optimism is rising that increasing vaccinations and a new federal rescue aid package that will likely be enacted soon will spur growth and hiring in the coming months. Many analysts foresee the economy expanding at an annual rate of at least 5 percent in the current quarter and 7 percent for all of 2021.Already, crucial sectors of the economy are showing signs of picking up as vaccinations increase, federal aid spreads through the economy and the Fed’s low-rate policies fuel borrowing and spending. Last month, America’s consumers bounced back from months of retrenchment to step up their spending by 2.4% — the sharpest increase in seven months and a sign that the economy may be poised to sustain a recovery.The solid gain suggested that many people were growing more confident about spending, especially after receiving $600 checks that went to most adults early this year in a federal economic aid package. Additional relief is likely for American households and businesses as Congress considers President Joe Biden’s proposal for a new aid package amounting to $1.9 trillion.At the same time, rising bond yields in the financial markets are pointing to worries that higher inflation could be on the way as the economy recovers. This week, Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, sought to calm investors by stressing that the Fed, while generally optimistic in its outlook, is still a long way off from raising interest rates or otherwise lessening its support for the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-tick-up-to-745-000-as-layoffs-remain-high-101614865564929.html

04-03-2021||World||GOP state lawmakers seek to nullify federal gun limits||With Democrats controlling the presidency and Congress, Republican state lawmakers concerned about the possibility of new federal gun control laws aren't waiting to react.Legislation in at least a dozen states seeks to nullify any new restrictions, such as ammunition limits or a ban on certain types of weapons. Some bills would make it a crime for local police officers to enforce federal gun laws.That can create confusion for officers who often work with federal law enforcement, said Daniel Isom, a former chief of the St. Louis Police Department who is now a senior advisor for Everytown for Gun Safety. Federal law plays a big role in some areas, such as keeping guns away from domestic violence offenders.Putting local officers in a position to decide which laws to enforce is the last thing police need at a time when cities such as St. Louis are experiencing a rise in violent crime, Isom said.“This has been an extremely challenging year for both communities and law enforcement, and to ask any more mental strain on officers at this point in time seems to be quite displaced," he said. Gun sales also have set monthly records nationwide since the coronavirus pandemic took hold.Isom is concerned about a Missouri measure passed by the state House that would allow police departments with officers who enforce federal gun laws to be sued and face a $50,000 fine. It's not the first time Missouri has considered such a bill, but supporters pointed to President Joe Biden taking office as a reason to pass it now.In Utah, Republican Rep. Cory Maloy also referenced the incoming administration after the state House passed his bill with a similar provision forbidding the enforcement of federal gun laws. Many Republican state lawmakers see attempts to pass federal firearms restrictions as a threat to the Second Amendment.“We really feel the need to protect those rights,” he said.Several states passed similar laws under then-president Barack Obama, although judges have ruled against them in court. Most of the latest crop of federal nullification proposals focus on police officers inside their states who primarily enforce state rather than federal laws.While Biden has called for a ban on assault weapons, any new gun legislation will likely face an uphill climb given the political polarization that has tripped up past administrations. Democratic lawmakers from conservative-leaning states also could join Republicans in opposing new gun restrictions. Any measures likely to pass would have broad support, like background checks on all gun sales, said Everytown President John Feinblatt.Those dynamics haven't stopped state lawmakers who want to make the first move to protect gun rights in their states. Federal nullification bills have been introduced in more than a dozen other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wyoming, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Iowa. In Texas, the governor has called for the state to become a Second Amendment sanctuary.In Arizona, a Senate proposal that passed the chamber on Wednesday would allow officers to be sued for enforcing federal gun restrictions that the state considers violations of the Second Amendment. They potentially could face criminal charges. A bill in the House doesn't include those punishments, but its sponsor, Republican Rep. Leo Biasiucci, said it would be a clear rejection of federal restrictions on assault-style weapons, high-capacity magazines or other firearms."They can do that at a federal level, but in Arizona it’s not going to fly,” he said.His proposal passed the state House last week over the objections of Democrats such as Rep. Daniel Hernandez of Tucson, who was present at the 2011 shooting that severely injured former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. If signed into law, the measure would be unconstitutional and lead to an expensive court fight, he said.Biasiucci compares his plan to Arizona voters' move to legalize recreational marijuana even though it remains against federal law. Gun-control groups see it differently.“Guns kill people and are used to create a public safety issue, whereas marijuana is really not,” said Allison Anderman, senior counsel with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “What is likely to happen if gun laws are not followed is people get killed as a result.”Similar measures passed by the Republican Legislature in Montana were vetoed in previous years by the former Democratic governor. Now working with a Republican governor, the state House passed a bill last week to bar state officials from enforcing federal bans on certain firearms, ammunition or magazines.Under Obama's presidency, the Legislature passed a law in 2009 that made guns and ammunition manufactured in Montana exempt from federal law. It eventually was struck down in court, but several states still followed with their own nullification measures. In 2013, two Kansas men tried to use that state's nullification law to overturn their federal convictions for possessing unregistered firearms, but the challenge was rejected.“The main issue there is the Supremacy Clause," the part of the Constitution that says federal law supersedes state law, said Jacob Charles, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke Law School. Even so, the bills focused on what local police can and can't do could pass legal muster.“States have no obligation to enforce federal law," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-state-lawmakers-seek-to-nullify-federal-gun-limits-101614867596565.html

Most others described it as light.The closest major city to the epicentre is Gisborne with a population of about 35,500 residents. People near the coast from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay were told to evacuate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earthquake-of-7-3-magnitude-strikes-new-zealand-tsunami-warnings-possible-101614866721029.html
04-03-2021||World||China's parliament to discuss Hong Kong electoral reform||China's top legislature will discuss electoral reform in Hong Kong when it meets this week, state media said Thursday, as speculation grows that Beijing will use the event to further tighten control over the financial hub.Official news agency Xinhua said the National People's Congress (NPC) would deliberate a draft decision on "improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region".Chinese state media has run editorials in recent weeks saying "electoral loopholes" will be plugged, and officials have said only "staunch patriots" -- those loyal to the ruling Communist Party -- should be involved in governing Hong Kong.The city dominated headlines during last year's NPC session when delegates endorsed a tough security law designed to stamp out dissent in the semi-autonomous trading hub after months of violent unrest in 2019.The exact shape of any changes is unclear, but they could include removing some seats from local-level district councils.Hong Kong's lack of full democracy has been a regular source of political instability and public anger in the territory.The city's leader -- the chief executive -- is chosen by a 1,200-member committee that is deliberately stacked with Beijing loyalists.Hong Kong's 70-seat legislature is deliberately designed to return a government majority and only half of the seats are chosen by popular vote.But opposition candidates scored a landslide win in district council elections in late 2019, in a clear popular rebuke to Beijing.The NPC's roughly 3,000 members will fill Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People for a week of meetings choreographed to tout the achievements and power of the party.It is also an important occasion for the party to lay out priorities, economic expectations, and foreign policy for the coming year.The session will open less than a week after dozens of activists were arrested for subversion in Hong Kong after organising a primary election that was intended to offer a united opposition to establishment parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-parliament-to-discuss-hong-kong-electoral-reform-101614866593833.html
04-03-2021||World||Huawei CFO lawyer says Donald Trump comments a 'salvo' in trade war||Comments made by former US President Donald Trump turned a senior executive for Chinese communications giant Huawei Technologies, into a “bargaining chip” and “co-opted the extradition process,” her lawyers argued in a Canadian court Wednesday as they fought efforts to send her to the US in which Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder and the company's chief financial officer, at Vancouver's airport in late 2018.The US wants her extradited to face fraud charges. Her arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China's rise.The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of US sanctions.It says Meng, 49, committed fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran.Defense lawyer Richard Peck pointed to a 2018 interview in which Trump was asked if he would be willing to intervene in Meng's case if it would help secure a trade deal with China or aid US security interests.“If I think it's good for the country, if I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made – which is a very important thing – what's good for national security – I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,” Trump said at the time.Peck said Trump's comments make it clear he hoped to use Meng as leverage in trade negotiations with China.“These words cast a pall over these proceedings,” said Peck. “They reduce Ms. Meng from a human being to chattel. His words amount to an abuse of process.”Peck said the “abhorrent nature of the president's words” put a stain on the extradition proceedings and the Canadian justice system.“The requesting state's conduct ... has subverted this process, has destroyed the integrity of the process,” said Peck. “The requesting state has not acted in good faith. This is an affront to what is fair, right, and just."Peck told Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that the United States views Huawei as a threat and that attacks on China have come from both Republicans and Democrats.Peck also pointed to comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Justice Trudeau in December 2019, where he said the US should not sign a trade deal with China unless the case of Meng and two Canadians being held in China was settled.“The fact that he said it is problematic,” Peck said.Meng attended the hearing dressed in a short black dress and wearing an electronic tracking bracelet on her ankle.She listened to the proceedings through an interpreter, taking occasional drinks from a pink water bottle.Over the next several weeks Meng's defense team will present several justifications for halting the extradition proceedings.Later this month, they will claim an abuse of process, saying Canada Border Services Agency officers detained and questioned Meng without a lawyer, seized her electronic devices and compelled her to give up their passcodes before her official arrest.Her lawyers also contend the US is exceeding the limits of its jurisdiction by prosecuting a foreign citizen for actions that took place in Hong Kong and said Canada was misled by the US about the strength of its case.Meng's arrest has soured relations between Canada and China. In apparent retaliation, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor. China has also placed restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola oil seed.China also handed death sentences to four Canadians convicted of drug smuggling.Meng remains free on bail in Vancouver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-cfo-lawyer-says-donald-trump-comments-a-salvo-in-trade-war-101614861982071.html
04-03-2021||World||European Union sets itself jobs, training and equality targets for 2030||The European Commission on Thursday announced goals for the 27-nation bloc to reduce poverty, inequality and boost training and jobs by 2030 as part of a post-pandemic economic overhaul financed by jointly borrowed funds.The EU executive arm said the European Union should boost employment to 78% in 2030 from 73% in 2019, halve the gap between the number of employed women and men and cut the number of young people neither working nor studying to 9% from 12.6%"With unemployment and inequalities expected to increase as a fallout of the pandemic, focusing our policy efforts on quality job creation, up- and reskilling and reducing poverty and exclusion is therefore essential to channel our resources where they are most needed," the commission said.The goals, which will have to be endorsed by EU leaders, also include an increase in the number of adults getting training every year to adapt to the EU's transition to a greener and more digitalised economy to 60% from 40% now.Finally, over the next 10 years, the EU should reduce the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion by 15 million from 91 million in 2019."These three 2030 headline targets are deemed ambitious and realistic at the same time," the commission said.The goals are part of the EU's set of 20 social rights, agreed on in 2017, to make the EU more appealing to voters and counter eurosceptic sentiment across the bloc.They say everybody has the right to quality education throughout their lives and that men and women must have equal opportunities in all areas and be paid the same for work of equal value.The unemployed have the right to "personalised, continuous and consistent support", while workers have the right "to fair wages that provide for a decent standard of living".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-sets-itself-jobs-training-and-equality-targets-for-2030-101614853532332.html

No further action will be taken," Murray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-rule-out-criminal-inquiry-into-1995-princess-diana-interview-101614863169004.html

They can now be vaccinated more quickly," the ministry said. "We will shortly issue a regulation implementing both recommendations."Germany declined initially to authorise AstraZeneca's vaccine for those aged above 65, saying there was a lack of evidence from clinical trials confirming its effectiveness on that age cohort.But growing data showing the AstraZeneca shot's efficacy among the elderly in Britain has led to a change of heart in Berlin, while France has also eased a ban on administering the shot to people over the age of 65.The German decision was in line with recommendations by the European Union's health regulator that the second shot of AstraZeneca's vaccine be administered between four and 12 weeks after the first.There was no mention in the health ministry statement of the other main vaccine being administered in Germany, from a partnership between Pfizer and BioNTech .Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for the gap between administering the two shots to be extended to six weeks to stretch supply.Current guidance from the European Union's health regulator is for the Pfizer shot to be administered at three-week intervals in line with the company's own guidance.Politicians have faced growing criticism for the slow pace of vaccination in Germany, which is lagging well behind pack leaders Britain, Israel and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-approves-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-people-over-65-years-of-age-101614862945268.html
04-03-2021||World||Hong Kong removed from annual index of the world's freest economies||Hong Kong has been removed from an annual index of the world's freest economies because the think-tank that compiles the league table said the city was now directly controlled by Beijing.The announcement is a reputational blow for Hong Kong and comes as Beijing ramps up its bid to quash dissent after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019.The Heritage Foundation, a conservative US think-tank, publishes an annual Index of Economic Freedom ranking countries and territories for how business-friendly their regulations and laws are.Over the last 26 years Hong Kong topped the table for all but one year -- a source of pride to the city's government which often used the accolade in its official press releases and investment brochures.But when the 2021 ranking is released later on Thursday, Hong Kong will not appear because the report's authors believe the city is no longer independent enough of Beijing to justify separate inclusion."The loss of political freedom and autonomy suffered by Hong Kong over the past two years has made that city almost indistinguishable in many respects from other major Chinese commercial centres like Shanghai and Beijing," Edwin J. Feulner, the founder of the Heritage Foundation, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday."[Hong Kong's] ties to Beijing are increasingly forged in steel," Feulner added, while its pre-handover "traditions of English common law, freedom of speech, and democracy have weakened significantly".Also read: Hong Kong makes 100th pro-democracy arrest under national security lawThe Heritage Foundation is one of the major policy think-tanks that influences fiscal conservatives in the United States.Feulner is also a vocal critic of Beijing and chairman of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government embraced the think-tank's league table each year it came out.In 2019 -- when Hong Kong topped the table for the 25th consecutive year -- the government said it showed the city's "economic resilience, high-quality legal framework, low tolerance for corruption, high degree of government transparency, efficient regulatory framework and openness to global commerce".Last year the city fell from the top spot for the first time, replaced by rival Singapore, after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong.The city's commerce chief at the time brushed off concern and predicted Hong Kong would soon return to the top of the table.Instead it -- and neighbouring Macau -- will be counted as part of China which currently languishes in 107th place in the ranking, between Uganda and Uzbekistan, in a section where economies are rated as "mostly unfree."Beijing says the security law was needed to restore stability to Hong Kong.But it has also dramatically altered Hong Kong's legislative and judicial relationship with the authoritarian mainland.Chinese leaders have announced they want to ensure only "staunch patriots" run the city, including within the city's independent judiciary.That has created some jitters within the international business community, especially as Beijing falls out with a growing list of western power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-removed-from-annual-index-of-the-world-s-freest-economies-101614834533414.html
04-03-2021||World||US suspends tariffs on UK Goods in Airbus-Boeing dispute||The US will suspend retaliatory tariffs on UK products caught up in the longstanding dispute over illegal aid to Boeing Co. and Airbus SE in a boost for post-Brexit Britain’s trade agenda.The tariff suspension will last four months to “focus on negotiating a balanced settlement to the disputes”, the UK government said in a statement on Thursday. The decision means goods like Scotch whisky, biscuits and clotted cream can be imported to the US from Britain without being subject to an additional 25% duty.Removing tariffs on UK-US commerce has been a priority for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government as they seek a broader trade deal with President Joe Biden’s administration. Britain unilaterally dropped tariffs on some US products indefinitely in January in a bid to reduce trade tensions. The former Trump administration did not reciprocate the UK’s concession.The US’s temporary rollback could help resolve part of the World Trade Organization dispute over the aid to Boeing and Airbus, which has resulted in WTO-authorized tariffs targeting nearly $12 billion worth of transatlantic trade.The dispute, which has dragged on for 17 years, involves the US and the four European countries that manufacture Airbus aircraft and parts -- Germany, France, Spain and the UK.It was not immediately clear if the Biden administration would also agree to temporarily suspend its tariffs on EU goods that the Trump administration targeted for retaliation in the dispute.‘Bold’ MoveIn November, the EU announced tariffs targeting $4 billion worth of Boeing planes and US products including spirits, nuts and tractors as part of a tit-for-tat escalation against the US For its part, the US imposed levies on $7.5 billion of EU products starting in 2019.Though the European Commission had repeatedly asked the US for a six-month suspension of tariffs in order to negotiate a settlement, former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer declined to do so and further increased tariffs against EU goods in one of his final acts in office.The UK said the latest move was a “bold, joint step” toward resolving one of the longest running issues at the WTO. The statement also said that the UK and US would focus on “addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from non-market economies, such as China”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-suspends-tariffs-on-uk-goods-in-airbus-boeing-dispute-101614860454109.html

The dozen survivors from the collision were all taken to hospitals for treatment.Both the Ford Expedition involved in the crash and the Chevrolet Suburban that inexplicably burst into flames appeared to be the same vehicles seen in surveillance footage leaving the vicinity of the fence breach about 30 miles (48 km) to the east, Mora said.While Border Patrol agents regularly scout the area for illegal crossings, neither vehicle had been under pursuit by US authorities beforehand, according to the agency.Read | California crash kills 13 on route for illegal border crossingsNew details of Tuesday's fatal highway wreck near the remote farming community of Holtville, about 10 miles (16 km) north of the border, came to light as the CBP mounted an investigation into the suspected human smuggling operation believed to have led to the tragedy."Human smugglers have proven time and again they have little regard for human life," the agency said in a statement.Of the 13 people who died in the collision, at least 10 were Mexican nationals, and Mexicans were also among the injured, according to Mexico's foreign ministry.Guatemalan authorities said they had preliminary information that one Guatemalan national died and another was injured in the crash.Mora said investigators believe that both carloads of migrants crossed into California through a 10-foot-wide gap cut out of the border fence by smugglers in an area known for relatively frequent illegal border crossings.That section of the fence, consisting of steel bars 18 feet tall, was installed in 2009, some eight years before the Trump administration took office calling for a border wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-suv-crash-victims-suspected-of-being-smuggled-across-us-mexico-border-101614862211767.html

04-03-2021||World||US traffic deaths spike even as Covid-19 pandemic cuts miles travelled||Pandemic lockdowns and stay-at-home orders kept many drivers off US roads and highways last year. But those who did venture out found open lanes that only invited reckless driving, leading to a sharp increase in traffic-crash deaths across the country.The nonprofit National Safety Council estimates in a report issued Thursday that 42,060 people died in vehicle crashes in 2020, an 8% increase over 2019 and the first jump in four years.Plus, the fatality rate per 100 million miles driven spiked 24%, the largest annual percentage increase since the council began collecting data in 1923.And even though traffic is now getting close to pre-coronavirus levels, the bad behavior on the roads is continuing, authorities say.“It’s kind of terrifying what were seeing on our roads,” said Michael Hanson, director of the Minnesota Public Safety Department’s Office of Traffic Safety. “We’re seeing a huge increase in the amount of risk-taking behavior.”Last year's deaths were the most since 2007 when 43,945 people were killed in vehicle crashes. In addition, the safety council estimates that 4.8 million people were injured in crashes last year.Federal data shows that Americans drove 13% fewer miles last year, or roughly 2.8 trillion miles, said Ken Kolosh, the safety council's manager of statistics. Yet the number of deaths rose at an alarming rate, he said.“The pandemic appears to be taking our eyes off the ball when it comes to traffic safety," Kolosh said.Of the reckless behaviors, early data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show speed to be the top factor, Kolosh said. Also, tests of trauma center patients involved in traffic crashes show increased use of alcohol, marijuana and opiods, he said.In Minnesota, traffic volumes fell 60% when stay-home orders were issued early in the pandemic last spring. Hanson said state officials expected a corresponding drop in crashes and deaths, but while crashes declined, deaths increased.“Almost immediately the fatality rate started to go up, and go up significantly,” Hanson said, adding that his counterparts in other states saw similar increases. “It created less congestion and a lot more lane space for divers to use, and quite honestly, to abuse out there.”In late March and early April, the number of speed-related fatalities more than doubled over the same period in 2019 in the state, Hanson said. Last year, Minnesota recorded 395 traffic deaths, up nearly 9% from 364 in 2019.Drivers also used the empty roads to drive extreme speeds. In 2019, the Minnesota State Patrol’s 600 troopers handed out tickets to just over 500 drivers for going over 100 mph (160 kph). That number rose to 1,068 in 2020, Hanson said.Traveling over 100 mph makes crashes far more severe, the safety council said.The high number of speeding drivers is continuing even as traffic is starting to return to pre-pandemic levels, according to Hanson.The safety council is calling for equitable enforcement of traffic laws, infrastructure improvements, mandatory ignition switch locks for convicted drunken drivers, reducing speed limits to match roadway designs, and laws banning cellphone use while driving, among other recommendations to stem the deaths.The council collects fatal crash data from states on public and private roads. The numbers released on Thursday are preliminary, but every year are only slightly different from the final numbers, Kolosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-traffic-deaths-spike-even-as-covid-19-pandemic-cuts-miles-travelled-101614855997044.html
04-03-2021||World||EU's coast guard agency Frontex involved in dozen migrant pushback incidents||An inquiry into claims that the European Union’s border and coast guard agency was involved in illegally pushing back migrants has found no link to Frontex in any of the incidents but has been unable to establish what happened in five cases, according to the official report into the allegations.The report is by a special working group set up to investigate media allegations that staff, ships or aircraft working with Frontex took part in or were near more than a dozen pushback incidents at the border between Greece and Turkey last year, mostly in the Aegean Sea. Its findings will be the focus of an extraordinary meeting of the agency’s management board on Friday.Frontex, which is responsible for patrolling the external borders of the 27-nation EU, has rejected the pushback allegations and said that its own internal inquiry could find no evidence to substantiate the claims. Greece, which is in charge of operations involving coordinating Frontex on its territory, has also denied reports of pushbacks by its border officers.Pushbacks are forcibly preventing people from entering a country when they might want to apply for asylum. They are contrary to refugee protection agreements, which say people shouldn’t be returned to a country where their life and safety might be in danger due to their race, religion, nationality or political views. They also contravene EU law and policy.Also read: EU months away from issuing vaccine passports for travel, memo showsThe working group cleared Frontex of any wrongdoing in 8 cases, but said in five cases “it has not been possible to completely resolve the incidents beyond any reasonable doubt,” according to part of the restricted report, dated March 1 and seen by The Associated Press on Thursday.Investigators could not determine whether the people involved in the five incidents were picked up by Turkish authorities or made it safely onto Greek soil. “There is no indication of anybody injured, reported missing or having died in connection with the respective incidents,” the report said.The probe, by experts from seven European countries and the European Commission, was set up weeks after reports of collective migrant expulsions were revealed in an October joint investigation by media outlets Bellingcat, Lighthouse Reports, Der Spiegel, ARD and TV Asahi.The reports raised troubling questions about the actions of Frontex, whose mandate and budget has been massively boosted since the entry of well over a million people in 2015, most fleeing conflict in Syria, sparked one of the EU’s biggest ever political disputes over how to manage the influx.Last month, human rights lawyers called on the agency to immediately stop its activities in the Aegean Sea. They formally accused Frontex of violating the right to asylum, as well as other breaches of EU and international law. They gave Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri two months to respond or face action at the European Court of Justice.Some of the alleged incidents last year happened in chaotic times in the Aegean around March and April 2020, when Turkey, angered by the EU’s reluctance to support its invasion of northern Syria, allowed thousands of migrants to set out for the Greek border and islands unchecked.In one of the alleged “maritime pushback” cases on April 28-29, 2020, a group of refugees and migrants was said to have been returned to an unseaworthy life raft without a motor or paddles and towed toward Turkey from near the island of Samos, as a surveillance plane watched from the sky.But the working group could find no evidence that Frontex was involved or had been notified about it. None of the routings of the agency’s aircraft match the report, nor were any of its ships or vehicles in the area referred to in media reports.More broadly, the investigators insist that "serious incident reports” must be quickly drafted after any suspicious incident and fundamental rights officers immediately informed. Frontex was due to have hired 40 fundamental rights officers by this year. As of last month, none had taken up their posts.The investigators recommend that the actions of Frontex planes or ships be recorded on video, and that they remain after any incidents to observe the actions of national police and border agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eus-coast-guard-agency-frontex-involved-in-dozen-migrant-pushback-incidents-101614857619606.html

The Capitol Police put out a statement on Wednesday, saying they are aware of potential threats towards members of Congress and the Capitol building and have already made significant security upgrades to ensure the protection of “Congress, the public and our police officers.”“We have obtained intelligence that shows a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4,” the Capitol Police said.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had earlier released a bulletin to warn about an unidentified group of "militia violent extremists" who had discussed plans to “take control of the US Capitol and remove Democratic lawmakers on or about March 4.” In the wake of a possible plot by extremists to breach the US Capitol, the House of Representatives moved a planned vote from Thursday to Wednesday night to avoid being in session on March 4.Read | US Police uncover ‘possible plot’ by militia to breach Capitol on March 4Significance of March 4Many members of the “sovereign citizens”, a group of people who believe that they are not subject to any government rules or proceedings, believe that the United States turned into a corporation after a law was enacted in 1871. According to them, Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th US president, was the last legal American commander-in-chief, and some followers of QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory propagators, share those unfounded beliefs.Prior to 1937, US presidents were inaugurated in early March, so the date gained significance among “sovereign citizens" and subsequently among QAnon followers. Michele Anne Tittler, one of the most prominent voices of QAnon, had recently laid out the plan in a TikTok video, claiming Trump will be sworn in as the 19th president of the United States on March 4 “under the restored republic.”“This nation hasn’t existed since 1871 when this country ceased to be a nation and became a corporation belonging to the City of London. Every time you see an American flag with a gold fringe attached to it, it represents the corporation, not the country,” she said.The FBI has described the sovereign citizen movement as "domestic terrorism" in the US. They have often flagged such groups for holding illegal courts that issue warrants for judges and police officers and clogging up the court system with “frivolous lawsuits and liens against public officials to harass them.”(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-significance-of-march-4-behind-possible-plot-to-breach-us-capitol-101614859790764.html

March 4 is the date when US presidents were inaugurated until 1933.An unidentified group of "militia violent extremists" discussed plans in February to "take control of the US Capitol and remove Democratic lawmakers on or about March 4," according to a bulletin issued on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The police force that guards the US Capitol, seat of the legislature, said in a statement that it had "taken immediate steps to enhance our security posture and staffing for a number of days, to include March 4."Capitol Police also said that they were "aware of and prepared for any potential threats towards members of Congress or towards the Capitol complex," including the possible militia attack.The US House of Representatives will not be in session on Thursday, in part because of the threat of militia members attempting to invade the Capitol, according to a Democratic aide.Washington's police chief, Robert Contee, said on Wednesday his department was deploying more police around the city to ensure public safety.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 300 people for involvement in the storming of the US Capitol on Jan. 6 that led to five deaths, including a policeman.

No one will be able to leave town if not for business and health reasons. Milan citizens won’t be allowed to reach their holiday houses. Bars and restaurants will remain closed while shops can stay open.The Lombardy region around Milan will be put under the so-called “reinforced orange” alert from midnight, according to a statement. Italy has a three-tier system in place that classifies regions by low, medium and high-risk based on the numbers of cases.The decision follows a surge in cases in the original epicenter of the pandemic in Europe. Daily coronavirus infections in the country reached a two-month high Wednesday. Italy is nearing 3 million cases since the beginning of the outbreak last year as deaths may pass the grim milestone of 100,000 in the next few days.Prime Minister Mario Draghi this week appointed a new czar to coordinate the government’s action on the coronavirus pandemic as his government seeks to speed up the vaccination campaign in the country. Draghi is working on an overhaul of the country’s slow and uneven vaccination campaign, focusing on logistics and recruiting the military to help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/milan-shuts-down-schools-tightens-curbs-due-to-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101614860023134.html

The concept is that different short clips, which are taken from shows like 'Big Mouth' or stand-up specials from comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and Ali Wong, will play directly within the Netflix app.If any of the shows, films, or comedy specials sparks interest, people can add the said title to their saved list to watch later. Patrick Flemming, director of product innovation at Netflix, said, "We're always looking for new ways to entertain and make discovery easier for members."He added that Fast Laughs is a "new full-screen feed of funny clips from a wide variety of Netflix titles, ranging from films and series to our deep bench of stand-up specials."Considering the growth and prominence of TikTok in the market right now, Fast Laughs makes sense for Netflix. Netflix's last few earnings reports have specifically referenced TikTok as a major competitor. Though Netflix and TikTok make different types of content, people are spending more time on TikTok, which results in less time on Netflix.As per The Verge, to access Fast Laughs, subscribers can use the bottom navigation menu to click on the Fast Laughs tab.

04-03-2021||World||#MeWho? Global firms lag on sex harassment, women-friendly policy: Report||Most big firms are failing to ban sex harassment at work or enact policies that let mothers work flexibly, a global workplace equality index found on Thursday, highlighting the obstacles women face at work.Fewer than half of firms' policies directly address sex harassment, despite years of #MeToo campaigns that show the extent of abuse at work, said the report by women's workplace equality organisation Equileap.The finding suggests legislation to force action is a "necessary evil", said its chief executive Diana van Maasdijk.The index data was drawn from 3,702 firms in 23 countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Australia."It's only when companies are forced to do something that it's going to happen," said van Maasdijk, citing progress in Spain after a law compelled firms to publish plans that addressed sexual harassment."Some studies have shown one in three women will experience sexual harassment in their lifetime, so it's really important that this is addressed and it is called exactly what it is."The #MeToo movement began in 2017 in the United States after accusations of sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood, and quickly spread to a worldwide campaign that sparked wider debate around harassment, pay and representation.Women went online to call out their male bosses - from tech to academia - and share stories of unwanted sexual approaches, harassment, coercion, discrimination in the office or poor pay.But three years on and 51% of companies assessed for the index did not publish an anti-sexual harassment policy last year, said Equileap, albeit an improvement on the 58% in 2019.Pandemic impactsThe report also highlighted the problems mothers routinely face juggling paid work and a rota of home duties, a struggle exacerbated by the pandemic.Setting aside temporary policies enacted for the crisis, it found a lack of permanent, flexible working policies at many firms, with less than four in 10 publishing a policy on flexible hours and just 24% offering one on location.Women made "modest" progress on cracking glass ceilings in the latest annual report, it said, with women making up 25% of company boards, 17% of executives, 24% of senior management, and 37% of the overall workforce last year.The pandemic may bring some wins for women at work: more firms are likely to make flexible working permanent and ethical investors increasingly focus on gender, said van Maasdijk.But there is a risk that Covid-19's outsized impact on women's jobs may slow or push back progress, she said."We will have to see if we will have the same number of women in the workforce after the pandemic," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video call."I'm hoping that we will, but I'm a little worried."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mewho-global-firms-lag-on-sex-harassment-women-friendly-policy-report-101614855991042.html
04-03-2021||World||With wish to donate organs, Kyal Sin, 19, dies fighting military rule in Myanmar||Kyal Sin always let her clothes do the talking -- at one Myanmar anti-coup rally, she taped a sign onto the back of her black jacket: "We need democracy. Justice for Myanmar. Respect our votes."Weeks later, when the 19-year-old was gunned down Wednesday at a protest on the streets of Myanmar's second largest city Mandalay, her t-shirt read: "Everything will be ok".The slogan has become a poignant refrain echoing across social media, and thousands turned out for her funeral in Mandalay on Thursday.For Kyal Sin, nicknamed "Angel", restoring her country's fragile democracy trumped concerns about her own safety as she protested for an end to military rule.Also read: 'I will shoot whoever I see': Myanmar soldiers use TikTok to threaten protestersThe young dance enthusiast joined hundreds of thousands across the country calling for the release of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the military took over on February 1.Before going to a demonstration this week, she listed her blood type on her Facebook page, her phone number, and said her organs were available for donation if anything were to happen to her."If you need, you can contact me freely at this phone number any time," she wrote."I could donate (my organs) if I died. If someone needs urgent help, I can donate even if it causes my death."She was one of at least 38 people the United Nations said were killed on Wednesday, Myanmar's deadliest day since the coup.Footage posted on social media shows Kyal Sin's final moments during a demonstration that turned violent -- crawling along the road and running for cover amid the sounds of gunfire and a plume of tear gas.A doctor confirmed to AFP she had been shot in the head.- 'One vote from the heart' -In the hours following news of Kyal Sin's death, tributes flooded online, with artwork created of her striking a crouching pose on the day of her death.On her Facebook page, she showed a different side -- posting videos of her dance moves, selfies of her outfits, and showcasing her close relationship with her father.In a tender moment last month, he tied a red ribbon symbolising bravery around her wrist, according to photos she posted."I don't want to post too much about this -- just thank you, daddy," Kyal Sin wrote, along with the hashtag "Justice for Myanmar".Late last year, father and daughter took photographs of their purple ink-stained fingers after casting their votes at Myanmar's second democratic election, which Suu Kyi's party went on to win in a landslide."For the first time in my life, I have undertaken my responsibility as a citizen... one vote from the heart," Kyal Sin wrote on Facebook, posting a picture of her kissing her inked finger.On Thursday morning, mourners sang popular revolutionary song "We Won't Forget Until the End of the World" as they filed past her coffin carrying bouquets and floral wreaths.Leading the funeral procession to the cemetery was a truck covered in flowers with a "hero" poster on the front followed by an elaborate black and gold hearse.The outpouring of grief extended online with many calling her a martyr."My heart feels so much hurt," one of her friends posted on Facebook."Rest in peace my friend," another male friend wrote. "We will fight this revolution until the end."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-wish-to-donate-organs-kyal-sin-19-dies-fighting-military-rule-in-myanmar-101614851953514.html

If you want to become a martyr, I will fulfil your wish."Reuters was unable to contact him or the other uniformed men who appear in the TikTok videos or to verify that they are in the armed forces.TikTok is the latest social media platform to suffer a proliferation of menacing content or hate speech in Myanmar.US tech giant Facebook has now banned all pages linked to Myanmar's army - and has itself been banned.TikTok said in a statement: "We have clear Community Guidelines that state we do not allow content that incites violence or misinformation that causes harm... As it relates to Myanmar, we have been and continue to promptly remove all content that incites violence or spreads misinformation, and are aggressively monitoring to remove any such content that violates our guidelines."TikTok's policies forbid displays of guns unless they are in "safe environments".Reuters reviewed over a dozen videos where uniformed men, sometimes brandishing guns, threatened to harm protesters who are calling for the reversal of the coup and the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Some videos had tens of thousands of views. Those reviewed by Reuters were taken down this week. Some used hashtags relating to U.S celebrities.Already growing fast in Myanmar, TikTok saw a strong rise in downloads after the military banned Facebook last month. It is in the top 20 most downloaded apps in Myanmar, according to industry data.Facebook, which remains popular in Myanmar despite the ban, has toughened its scrutiny of content since being accused of helping to fan atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority in 2017.Researchers like Htaike say they believe the military is now attempting to grow its presence on other platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-will-shoot-whoever-i-see-myanmar-soldiers-use-tiktok-to-threaten-protesters-101614854431271.html

Here’s why||While top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has been urging eligible residents to take any authorised coronavirus vaccine available to them, some bishops have weighed in to discourage Catholics from getting Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine. Last week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals Companies of Johnson & Johnson to prevent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in individuals aged 18 or older.Citing the available trial data on the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine, the FDA said that the “known and potential benefits outweigh its risks known and potential risks”. The federal agency further assured that the EUA was given to Janssen’s vaccine after conducting a thorough evaluation of the available information on its safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.“After a thorough analysis of the data, the FDA’s scientists and physicians have determined that the vaccine meets the FDA’s expectations for safety and effectiveness appropriate for the authorization of a vaccine for emergency use,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.However, the assurance from the FDA on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy isn’t enough for some bishops who are dissuading people from getting Johnson & Johnson vaccine when alternatives are available. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and other dioceses from across the United States have expressed “moral concerns” over the Covid-19 vaccine developed using adenovirus type 26 (Ad26).Read | UK, 4 other countries to fast-track modified Covid-19 vaccinesThe bishops have raised objection to the use of cell lines originating from the tissue of aborted fetuses to develop the vaccine. In January, the USCCB released an FAQ document that said Pfizer and Moderna used an “abortion-derived cell line” to test the efficacy of their Covid-19 vaccines but didn’t use it in the development or production. On the other hand, Janssen vaccines raise “additional moral concerns” because of the use of such a cell line in development and production, they added“If one can choose among equally safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines, the vaccine with the least connection to abortion-derived cell lines should be chosen. Therefore, if one has the ability to choose a vaccine, Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccines should be chosen over Johnson & Johnson’s,” US bishop chairmen for Doctrine and for Pro-Life said in a joint statement.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson, in a statement to CNN, said that the vaccine uses an inactivated non-infective adenovirus vector and there is no fetal tissue in the vaccine. In multiple reports, scientists and health experts have also noted that the cells used in the testing, development and production of vaccines are thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bishops-discouraging-catholics-from-getting-j-j-covid-19-shot-here-s-why-101614851773188.html

According to Icelandic Meteorological Office (ICO), over 18,000 tremors have been recorded in a week, compared to 1,000 normally for a whole year.1/2 Yesterday, about 2500 earthquakesmeasured, since midnight almost 800 earthquakes measured. In total, there have been over 18000 earthquakes since eruption began about a week ago. Most activity limited to Fagradalsfjall, slight movement to the SW compared to activity yesterdayThe meteorological office said that an "increase in seismic tremor" was detected throughout most of the country. "Magma movements are a likely cause for the ongoing signal, and it is possible that an effusive (lava-producing) eruption could occur close to Keilir," the department said in its bulletin on Wednesday."The magma is fracturing and it is so close to the surface... that we have to take it seriously," Freysteinn Sigmundsson, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland, told news agency AFP.Iceland is the most active volcanic region in Europe, with an eruption every five years on average. It has 30 volcanic systems and more than 600 hot springs, and straddles tectonic plates on the mid-Atlantic ridge.The residents of capital Reykjavik and in areas close to the city have been tokd that the volcanic area was expected to release lava slowly over the next few weeks. However, the weather scientists say there was no indication that the event would pose a threat to human life or property.The meteorological department, meanwhile, has elevated the alert for air travel from yellow to orange - the third-highest level. Red, the highest level of alert, is reserved for an imminent or ongoing volcanic eruption.The ICO analysed the satellite data of the area around Reykjanes, which is around 50 kilometre from the capital, to present some possible developments, including a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in the Fagradalsfjall area.The most powerful earthquake in recent days of magnitude 5.6 struck the region on February 24. Five more were recorded on the same day.Such intense seismic activity has not been recorded in the region since digital monitoring began in 1991.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iceland-records-over-16-000-earthquakes-in-8-days-101614853214789.html

The junta overthrew a democratically-elected government, and detained its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, having disputed her party's landslide victory in November.India is already home to thousands of refugees from Myanmar, including ethnic Chin people and Rohingya who fled the southeast Asian country during previous bouts of violence.A Chin community leader in New Delhi said police have rarely fled to India."This is something unusual,” said James Fanai, president of the India-based Chin Refugee Committee. "Because in the past, police and military just follow orders.”Myanmar's ruling military council has stressed the importance of police and soldiers doing their duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-myanmar-police-seek-refuge-in-india-rather-than-carry-out-junta-s-orders-101614853380025.html
04-03-2021||World||Myanmar protesters, undaunted by killings, march again||Demonstrators in Myanmar protesting last month's military coup returned to the streets Thursday, undaunted by the killing of at least 38 people the previous day by security forces.New protests were held in at least three areas of Yangon, the country's largest city, that have been scenes of violence for the past few days. Police again used force to try to disperse the crowds, according to social media accounts.Protests also continued In Mandalay, the second-biggest city. A formation of five fighter planes flew over the city on Thursday morning in what appeared to be a threatening show of force.The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said 38 people were killed Wednesday, a figure consistent with other reports.The death toll was the highest since the Feb. 1 takeover, when the military ousted the elected government of leader Aung San Suu Kyi. More than 50 civilians, mostly peaceful protesters, are confirmed to have been killed by police and soldiers since then.The U.N. Security Council has scheduled closed-door consultations on Friday on calls to reverse the coup — including from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres — and stop the escalating military crackdown.Any kind of coordinated action at the United Nations will be difficult since two permanent members of the Security Council, China and Russia, are likely to veto it. Some countries have already imposed or are considering their own sanctions.U.N. envoy Schraner Burgener said she warned Myanmar’s army that the world’s nations and the Security Council “might take huge strong measures.”“And the answer was, ‘We are used to sanctions and we survived those sanctions in the past,’” she said. When she also warned the army that Myanmar would become isolated, she said, “the answer was, ‘We have to learn to walk with only a few friends.’”The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Suu Kyi’s rise to power after 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investing into the country.Schraner Burgener said the army has been taken aback by the strong opposition, which has been led by young people.“I think that the army is very surprised that it doesn’t work because in the past, in 1988 and 2007 and 2008, it worked,” she said, referring to previous violent crackdowns on uprisings against military rule.Demonstrators have flooded the streets of towns and cities across Myanmar since last month's coup, even though gatherings of five or more people are banned and security forces have repeatedly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to disperse the crowds, and arrested protesters en masse.Wednesday's highest death toll was in Yangon, where an estimated 18 people died. Most if not all of the deaths occurred in the eastern neighborhood of North Okkalapa.Stark video shot Wednesday night at the main hospital there showed grieving relatives collecting the blood-soaked bodies of family members who were shot. Some relatives sobbed uncontrollably, while others looked in shock at the scene around them.Protesters in Mandalay flashed a three-fingered salute of resistance on Thursday as they rode their motorbikes to follow a funeral procession for Kyal Sin, also known by her Chinese name Deng Jia Xi, a university student who was killed as she attended a demonstration on Wednesday. The black hearse that carried her remains had a photo of her on the windshield, and the hearse was preceded by a truck full of floral bouquets. Many thousands of people attended.In the central city of Monywa, which has turned out huge crowds of protesters on an almost daily basis, a memorial service was held Thursday before a protest march began. At least eight people were reported to have been killed on Wednesday.According to multiple posts on social media, protests were also happening Thursday in Pyinmana, a satellite town of the capital Naypyitaw; Myingyan in central Myanmar, where there was one death Wednesday; Pathein, west of Yangon; and Myeik, near the country’s southern tip.As part of the crackdown, security forces have arrested well over a thousand people, including journalists, according to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. On Saturday, at least eight journalists, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, were detained. he and several other members of the media have been charged with violating a public safety law that could see them imprisoned for up to three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-undaunted-by-killings-march-again-101614853342052.html

She asked former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about how the tech giant uses third party seller data. She also questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on how the social networking giant harvests and monetises user data and then utilizes it to copy, acquire, and kill rivals, the media release said.Additionally, Jayapal asked Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai about the company’s total control of the ad market as the owner of the market, the ad buyer, and the ad seller, which has harmful effects on the local and independent journalism necessary for our democracy to thrive.The hearing was part of the Antitrust Subcommittee’s more than 16-month investigation into the state of competition in the digital economy.“I can say conclusively that self-regulation by Big Tech comes at the expense of our communities, small businesses, consumers, the free press, and innovation,” she said after the investigation’s findings were released in October.In December, Jayapal was elected as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), making her one of the most powerful US lawmakers in the 117th Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pramila-jayapal-named-vice-chair-of-a-key-congressional-subcommittee-101614852639181.html

We continue to have strong confidence in our investments in the Taiwan market," a GIC spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.One source said that sovereign wealth funds have been viewing Taiwan stocks like an "ATM" during the Covid-19 pandemic due to their strong performance backed by the island's sound economic fundamentals.Taiwan's central bank, which regulates the foreign currency activities of overseas players in the island's financial markets, did not respond to a request for comment.GIC had no immediate comment.Despite a lack of formal diplomatic relations with the Chinese-claimed island, Singapore and Taiwan have close ties.Foreign investors account for about a third of all stock trading in Taiwan.Taiwan's government last month revised up its outlook for 2021, predicting the economy will grow at its fastest pace in seven years, seeing gross domestic product (GDP) expanding 4.64% on a boom in exports driven by tech demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapores-gic-cashes-in-on-taiwan-stock-boom-sources-101614845870361.html

The rebels also call themselves the Nepal Communist Party.This group is known for violence, threats and enforcing general strikes.It had split from the Maoist Communist party, which fought government troops between 1996 and 2006 when it gave up its armed revolt, agreed to UN-monitored peace talks and joined mainstream politics.The Maoist fighting had left 17,000 people killed, hundreds missing and many more maimed.The peace agreement with the rebel group comes at a time when the prime minister and his government are facing a political crisis since a split developed in his own ruling party and the Supreme Court reinstated the Parliament he had dissolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-signs-peace-agreement-with-communist-rebel-group-101614840515821.html
04-03-2021||World||UK, 4 other countries to fast-track modified Covid-19 vaccines to fight emerging variants||Regulators in the UK and four other countries plan to fast-track the development of modified Covid-19 vaccines to ensure that drugmakers are able to move swiftly in targeting emerging variants of the disease.Previously authorized vaccines that are modified to target new variants “will not need a brand new approval or lengthy' clinical studies,” Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said in a statement.The new guidance was issued jointly by regulators in the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland. The guidelines build on the model already used to modify the flu vaccine in response to continual changes in that virus.Under the new rules, developers will be required to provide “robust evidence” that modified Covid-19 vaccines produce a strong immune response to the variant, as well as data showing they are safe and meet quality standards.“Our priority is to get effective vaccines to the public in as short a time as possible, without compromising on safety,” Dr. Christian Schneider, the MHRA's chief scientific officer said in a statement. “Should any modifications to authorized Covid-19 vaccines be necessary, this regulatory approach should do that.”The announcement comes amid concerns that a variant first discovered in Brazil may be more resistant to existing vaccines than other variants. The UK has banned direct flights from 33 countries in an effort to prevent variants of concern from becoming established in Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-4-other-countries-to-fast-track-modified-covid-19-vaccines-to-fight-emerging-variants-101614846929524.html

That means some high schoolers could get in line for those shots whenever they become eligible in their area, either because of a medical condition or once availability opens up.Pfizer and Moderna both have completed enrollment for studies of children ages 12 and older, and expect to release the data over the summer. If regulators clear the results, younger teens likewise could start getting vaccinated once supply allows. The Moderna vaccine is currently cleared for people 18 and older.Researchers started with older children because they tend to respond to vaccines most similarly to adults. Testing even younger groups is more complex, because they may require a different dose or have differing responses.“Children are not just small adults,” said pediatrician Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “The younger you get, the higher the odds are that things could be different.”Children develop serious illness or die from Covid-19 at much lower rates than adults, but can still spread the virus.“There’s no question: we do want to immunize children,” said Drexel University pediatrics professor Dr. Sarah Long.Pfizer and Moderna expect to start studies in children 11 and younger later this year.“It’s unlikely we could get community protection without immunizing children,” Long added. “This is the lynchpin to getting everything back to some kind of normalcy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-children-be-able-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-101614847821149.html
04-03-2021||World||South Korea's top prosecutor resigns in clash with President Moon Jae-in||South Korea’s top prosecutor resigned in protest against President Moon Jae-in’s policy to strip the office of investigative powers, in a move could impact the country’s presidential election in a year’s time.Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl, whose public support has risen in the simmering battle with Moon over prosecutorial powers, told reporters on Thursday at the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office in Seoul that he was stepping down. Moon’s ruling party is pushing to form a new state agency that would strip prosecutors of much of their investigative powers.“The spirit of the constitution and rule of law is being destroyed,” Yoon said, referring to the plans. “It’s hard to see our value of justice being collapsed.” About an hour after Yoon spoke, the presidential office said Moon had accepted the resignation.The move could open a path for Yoon to run for president in the March 2022 elections to replace Moon when his single, five-year term ends. Current surveys show Yoon as a top choice for president, outpolling contenders in Moon’s progressive camp.Yoon last year said he was considering ways to serve the nation, not ruling out the possibility of running for the presidency. The fight between Moon and Yoon’s office has lasted for months and at times pushed the government’s support rate to record lows.Yoon was handpicked by Moon in 2019, with a mandate to make good on the president’s pledges to clean up government and go after the most powerful. But ties soured after probes that included members of government and led to the resignations of two of Moon’s justice ministers.The Moon administration has been pushing for the establishment of another state investigative agency.The authority of prosecutors has been a sensitive issue in South Korea for years. While the office pledges independence, it has faced criticism from the left and right for using its power for political purposes and protecting the privileged.“Regardless of my position, I will do my absolute best to protect people and liberal democracy,” Yoon said in announcing his resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-top-prosecutor-resigns-in-clash-with-president-moon-jaein-101614840599839.html

The board would begin an immediate search for a new CEO.Magness worked at ERCOT for more than a decade and became its CEO and president in 2016 after working as its general counsel, the Texas Tribune newspaper reported.Brad Jones, former head of New York's power grid, is the leading candidate to replace Magness as ERCOT's CEO, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the board's thinking.Magness was grilled for hours last week for leaving power prices at up to 450 times the usual rate after the threat to the state's grid had ended.Seven of ERCOT's 15 directors have resigned in the last week and the head of the state's Public Utility Commission, which supervised ERCOT, resigned on Monday.The winter storm caused widespread blackouts across Texas, a state unaccustomed to extreme cold, knocking out power to more than 4 million people at its peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-power-grid-operator-ercot-fires-ceo-after-deadly-blackouts-101614847400423.html
04-03-2021||World||Thailand probes Facebook's removal of 185 army-linked accounts and groups||Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha says he has assigned the Royal Thai Army to investigate after Facebook Inc. removed 185 accounts and groups allegedly engaged in an information-influencing operation in Thailand run by the military.That followed Facebook’s announcement a day earlier that it had deleted 77 accounts, 72 pages, 18 groups and 18 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against government interference, which is defined as coordinated inauthentic behavior on behalf of a government entity.“Facebook took action like this. It can be interpreted in many ways. We must make it clear,” said Prayuth.About 703,000 accounts followed one or more of these pages, about 100,000 accounts joined at least one of these groups and around 2,500 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts. Facebook said.Facebook says the network of accounts originated in Thailand and targeted domestic audiences in its southern provinces, where the army faces a longstanding insurgency movement. The people behind the network used both authentic and fake accounts, posting their content on multiple pages to make it look more popular than it was. The majority of page postings appear to have occurred in 2020.The Facebook report says the network posted primarily in Thai about news and current events, including content in support of the Thai military and the monarchy. The posts included calls for non-violence, regional Covid-19 updates, allegations of violence by the insurgent groups in southern Thailand and criticism of separatist and independence movements.“Although the people behind it attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to the Thai military’s Internal Security Operations Command,” Facebook said.On Thursday, three activists including Yingcheep Atchanont, Sarinee Achavanuntakul and Winyu John Wongsurawat, filed a suit with the Administrative Court in Bangkok seeking an order to stop the Royal Thai Army’s information operation. The three said they have been targeted in such operations.They said they also planned to contact Facebook and the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression seeking an investigation into army’s information operations against Thai civilians.“The army has no authority to commit such information operations," Yingcheep told reporters. “The government should protect people who want to express their opinions, not create propaganda and attack those who have differing views."The issue of army information operations has surfaced during parliamentary debates.Nattacha Boonchaiinsawat, a lawmaker from the opposition Move Forward Party, accused the army of misusing funds to foment hatred toward critics of the government. The army responded by saying it just trains officers for public relations, to promote a positive image for the military.In October 2020, Twitter disclosed it had uncovered a network of 926 accounts allegedly involved in information operations linked to the army. It said the accounts were engaging in amplifying pro-Royal Thai Army and pro-government content and also targeting prominent political opposition figures.Apart from in Thailand, Facebook said last month that it had detected and removed attempts to reestablish a presence on the platform by military-linked networks in Myanmar, where the army took over in a Feb. 1 coup. Facebook had removed those accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-probes-facebook-s-removal-of-185-army-linked-accounts-and-groups-101614844321512.html
04-03-2021||World||China is training astronauts for space station crewed flights||China said Thursday a cohort of astronauts is training for four crewed missions this year as the country works to complete its first permanent orbiting space station.The station’s core module, christened Tianhe, could be launched as soon as next month, according to the China National Space Administration and foreign observers. The massive Long March-5B Y2 rocket and its payload were moved into place last month at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in tropical Hainan province for assembly and testing.That launch would be the first of 11 missions over the next two years to finish constructing the station by the end of 2022. Two other modules will be launched later, along with four Tianzhou cargo supply mission and the four Shenzhou crewed missions.CNSA listed 12 astronauts training for the crewed missions, including veterans of previous Shenzhou flights, newcomers and women, though it wasn't clear if there were others selected.Up to three crew members will reportedly live at a time in the the core module, which has docking ports to allow the attachment of scientific modules launched later.China has already launched two smaller experimental space stations to test measures for rendezvous, docking and life support aboard. Once completed, the permanent space station will allow for stays of up to six months, similar to the International Space Station.The Chinese station reportedly is intended to be used for 15 years and may outlast ISS, which is nearing the end of its functional lifespan.ISS is backed by the US, Russia, Japan, Europe, Canada and others, but China did not participate, partly at the insistence of the United States, which was wary of sharing technology with the secretive, military linked Chinese program.China’s space program, though, has chalked up steady progress since it first put an astronaut into orbit around Earth in 2003.A rover went to the little-explored far side of the moon in 2019.Another craft, the Tianwen-1, is in a parking orbit around Mars in anticipation of landing a rover on the surface in the coming months. If it succeeds, China would become only the second country after the US to put a spacecraft on Mars.China is also working on a reusable space plane and planning a crewed lunar mission and a possible permanent research base on the moon, though no dates have been proposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-is-training-astronauts-for-space-station-crewed-flights-101614843710167.html

No charges have yet been laid, police said."Any messages of hate or people wanting to cause harm in our community will not be tolerated - it's not the Kiwi way," said John Price, Canterbury District Commander Superintendent in an emailed statement.New Zealand is heightened alert ahead of the March 15 anniversary of Christchurch attack. Armed with high-capacity semi-automatic weapons, Australian Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people and injured dozens more after opening fire on worshippers at the two mosques, livestreaming the attacks on Facebook before being arrested.In August, Tarrant was sentenced to life in prison without parole, the first time New Zealand confined anyone for the rest of their life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-police-arrest-2-for-threat-to-mosques-attacked-in-2019-101614841671920.html
04-03-2021||World||George Floyd Justice in Policing Act approved by US House; revamps policing||Cheered on by President Joe Biden, House Democrats hustled Wednesday to pass the most ambitious effort in decades to overhaul policing nationwide, able to avoid clashing with moderates in their own party who are wary of reigniting a debate they say hurt them during last fall's election.The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was approved 220-212 late Wednesday.The sweeping legislation, which was first approved last summer but stalled in the Senate, was named in honour of Floyd, whose killing by police in Minnesota last Memorial Day sparked protests nationwide. The bill would ban chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement and create national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability.“My city is not an outlier, but rather an example of the inequalities our country has struggled with for centuries,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who represents the Minneapolis area near where Floyd died. She asked her colleagues if they would "have the moral courage to pursue justice and secure meaningful change?”Democrats say they were determined to pass the bill a second time, to combat police brutality and institutional racism after the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans following interactions with law enforcement — images of which were sometimes jarringly captured on video.Also watch: Biden official on situation in Jammu & Kashmir & US stand on issueFloyd’s family watched the emotional debate from a nearby House office building.But the debate over legislation has turned into a political liability for Democrats as Republicans seized on calls by some activists and progressives to “defund the police” to argue that Democrats were intent on slashing police force budgets. This bill doesn't do that.Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said it was a reason the party, after talking confidently of growing its majority in November, instead saw it shrink to just 10 seats, 221-211.“We played too much defence on ‘defund the police,’” Perez said.Moderate Democrats said the charge helped drive Democratic defeats in swing districts around the country.“No one ran on ‘defund the police,’ but all you have to do is make that a political weapon,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Texas Democrat who has pushed for more police funding in places like his city of Laredo, where the law enforcement presence is especially concentrated given the close proximity to the Mexican border.While Democrats used their then-larger majority to pass the police reform measure in the House last summer, it stalled in the then-Republican-controlled Senate, where GOP senators pushed an alternate plan that Democrats blocked from consideration, calling it inadequate. Democrats now control both chambers of Congress, but it seems unlikely the bill could pass the Senate without substantial changes to win GOP support.The bill had been set for a vote Thursday, but House leaders abruptly changed the schedule to wrap up their week's work after US Capitol Police warned of threats of violence at the Capitol two months after the Jan. 6 siege.Senior Democratic congressional aides said Wednesday they were eager to get the bill to the Senate, where negotiations will take longer.Republicans quickly revived the “defund the police” criticisms. “Our law enforcement officers need more funding not less,” Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., said during Wednesday's debate.Despite the political attacks by Republicans, even the House's more centrist lawmakers, some representing more conservative districts, backed the bill.“Black Americans have endured generations of systemic racism and discrimination for too long, and this has been painfully evident in their treatment by law enforcement," said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash, who chairs the moderate New Democrat Coalition.That endorsement came despite the bill's prohibitions on so-called qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement from certain lawsuits and is one of the main provisions that will likely need to be negotiated in any compromise with the Senate.Police unions and other law enforcement groups have argued that, without such legal protections, fear of lawsuits will stop people from becoming police officers — even though the measure permits such suits only against law enforcement agencies, rather than all public employees.California Rep. Karen Bass, who authored the bill, understands the challenge some House members face in supporting it.“My colleagues, several of them, I do not make light of the difficulty they had getting re-elected because of the lie around defunding the police,” Bass said.She called provisions limiting qualified immunity and easing standards for prosecution “the only measures that hold police accountable — that will actually decrease the number of times we have to see people killed on videotape.”Bass said she would not make concessions before the bill cleared the House. Changes would only serve to weaken it while failing to shield Democrats from the false “defund the police” narrative surrounding it, she said.“Even if they were to vote against the bill, even if they were to have a press conference denouncing the bill, they are still going to be hit with the same lie,” Bass said of Democrats.She also acknowledged the challenges Democrats faced last November — and may likely see again — when former President Donald Trump's re-election campaign and other leading Republicans crowded the airwaves with images of cities around the country burning. But Bass said those attacks, like much of the opposition to the bill, are built on racism, promoting fears about how “the scary Black people are going to attack you if you try to rein in the police.”“That's as old as apple pie in our history,” she said. “So do you not act because of that?”Still, she conceded that changes are likely to come if the measure is to win the minimum 60 votes it will need to advance in the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Bass said she'd been in contact with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, and was confident he would help deliver some GOP support.Scott said this week that the legislation's sticking points were qualified immunity and prosecutorial standards and that in both areas, “We have to protect individual officers.”“That's a red line for me,” Scott said, adding, “Hopefully we'll come up with something that actually works.”That could prove a tall order, despite the White House's vocal support for police reform. Biden has promised to combat systemic racism and signed executive orders he says will begin doing that, though advocates are expecting the new administration to go further.Biden has tweeted that he hopes "to be able to sign into law a landmark police reform bill.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-approved-by-us-house-revamps-policing-101614829103703.html
04-03-2021||World||North Korea may be trying to extract plutonium to make more nuclear weapons||North Korea may be trying to extract plutonium to make more nuclear weapons at its main atomic complex, recent satellite photos indicated, weeks after leader Kim Jong Un vowed to expand his nuclear arsenal.The 38 North website, which specializes in North Korea studies, cited the imagery as indicating that a coal-fired steam plant at the North’s Yongbyon nuclear complex is in operation after about a two-year hiatus. Smoke was observed emanating from the plant’s smokestack at various times from late February and early March.This suggests “preparations for spent fuel reprocessing could be underway to extract plutonium needed for North Korea’s nuclear weapon,” the website said Wednesday. But it added that “this could also mean simply the facility is being prepped to handle radioactive waste.”Earlier this week, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said some nuclear facilities in North Korea continued to operate, citing the operation of the steam plant that serves the radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon. The laboratory is a facility where plutonium is extracted by reprocessing spent fuel rods removed from reactors.“The DPRK’s nuclear activities remain a cause for serious concern. The continuation of the DPRK’s nuclear program is a clear violation of relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and is deeply regrettable,” Grossi told the IAEA's board of governors, according to IAEA's website. DPRK refers to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Plutonium is one of the two key ingredients to build nuclear weapons along with highly enriched uranium. The Yongbyon complex, north of the capital city of Pyongyang, has facilities to produce both ingredients. It’s not clear exactly how much weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium has been produced at Yonbyong and where North Korea stores it.Outside estimates on North Korea’s nuclear arsenal vary. In 2018, a South Korean official told Parliament the North may have 20 bombs to as many as 60.US-led diplomacy aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear program in return for economic and political benefits has been deadlocked since a summit between President Donald Trump and Kim collapsed in early 2019. Trump rejected Kim’s calls for extensive sanctions relief in return for dismantling the Yongbyon complex in what was seen as a limited denuclearization step because North Korea had already built nuclear weapons and is believed to be running other covert bomb-making facilities.In January, Kim vowed to enlarge nuclear arsenal and disclosed an array of high-tech weapons systems targeting the United States, saying the fate of bilateral ties depends on whether Washington withdraw its hostile policy on North Korea.Some experts say Kim is attempting to pressure President Joe Biden’s government to return to diplomacy and ease sanctions on the North.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-may-be-trying-to-extract-plutonium-to-make-more-nuclear-weapons-101614839972312.html
04-03-2021||World||Joe Biden pledges deeper ties in Indo-Pacific, India in national security plan||The Biden administration on Wednesday pledged to a “most robust” military presence in the Indo-Pacific as well as in Europe, asserting the “deepest connection” with the two globally significant regions in a guidance report that outlined for the first time President Joe Biden’s national security strategy.The 21-page paper — titled “Interim National Security Strategic Guidance” — also stated the Biden administration’s aim to “deepen” ties with India as a part of the strategy.The report portrayed an “increasingly assertive” China and “destabilising” Russia as main adversaries confronting the United States, but it clearly held the former as the more consequential of the two.China is “the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system”, the report said.The US pivot to Asia — in response to and as an acknowledgement of China as a growing threat — started under Barack Obama, and then gathered steam on Donald Trump’s watch with, among other things, the renaming of the US military’s Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command. It has been taken to a different level by the Biden administration, accorded the same significance as Europe, which has dominated US diplomatic and military thinking and spending for more than a century now, starting with World War I.The paper outlines President Biden’s approach to tackling a whole range of national security issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, economic recovery, climate change, immigration, racial injustice, challenges to democracy and the rise of extremism at home and their external manifestations abroad, and global issues such as proliferation, trade pacts and agreements, and multilateral forums such as the UN, the WHO and the WTO.The report is premised on, as it said, on “a basic truth: in today’s world, economic security is national security”.US secretary of state Antony Blinken summarised the Biden administration’s approach at some length in his first major foreign policy speech just hours before the release of the report, saying, “The interim guidance lays out the global landscape as the Biden administration sees it, explains the priorities of our foreign policy — and specifically how we will renew America’s strength to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of our time.”Ties with India came up in a section of the report that describes Biden’s commitment to reengaging the world, reversing predecessor Trump’s “America First” policy, and to rebuilding alliances and partnerships to leverage their collective negotiating clout to confront China and other challenges.As the US will seek to rebuild partnerships — clearly the second tier of relationships after treaty allies and alliances such as Japan, South Korea and Nato — the report said, “We will recognise that our vital national interests compel the deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere.”The report went on to add, “We will deepen our partnership with India and work alongside New Zealand, as well as Singapore, Vietnam, and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) member states, to advance shared objectives.”The pitch for Indo-Pacific was significant, especially for an administration that came in looking, to critics, somewhat unsure and confused on this issue. “Asia-Pacific”, a phrase favoured by Beijing as an alternative to “Indo-Pacific”, had popped up frequently in remarks and speeches by top Biden appointees initially. Officials and commentators in India and the Indo-Pacific countries — especially in Japan and Australia, which are member countries of the Quad grouping, were worried.The Biden administration took note. And “Asia-Pacific” gradually fell out of use.The report also talks about sealing a strategic shift, adding, “We will recognise that our vital national interests compel the deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere.”And it will translate into military terms. While addressing issues such as military interventions — as opposed to “forever wars” but keen to continue battling terrorists — the report said, “as we position ourselves to deter our adversaries and defend our interests, working alongside our partners, our presence will be most robust in the Indo-Pacific and Europe”.The Biden administration also pledged to take on China more aggressively, as detailed by the guidance, than indicated before: “We will support China’s neighbours and commercial partners in defending their rights to make independent political choices free of coercion or undue foreign influence.”That was a barely concealed reference to countries that China has entrapped into sovereignty-compromising debts through its predatory one-belt-one-road initiative. Pakistan is one of the victims though it will not acknowledge it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pledges-deeper-ties-with-indo-pacific-india-in-national-security-plan-101614833495516.html

04-03-2021||World||Australia PM Morrison supports his attorney-general's denial of rape accusations||Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday expressed support for his attorney-general, who this week denied accusations he raped a schoolgirl when he was a teenager.Morrison told reporters Australia must follow the rule of law and the presumption of innocence in the matter, after police concluded there was insufficient evidence to investigate lawmaker Christian Porter, a 50-year-old former prosecutor.The woman who accused Porter died by suicide last year after she had gone to police and then later withdrawn her complaint. Her accusation against Porter became public last week after being sent anonymously to Morrison and other lawmakers.The case has intensified scrutiny of the culture in Parliament, where a staff member two weeks ago made an unrelated claim that she was raped by a senior colleague.In the latest case, Morrison said his heart broke for the woman's family, who lost a loved one.“These are harrowing events," he said.But he said Porter had absolutely rejected the allegations and Australia must follow the law.“You will be aware of the terrible things that can happen in a country where the rule of law is not upheld and is not supported, in whatever the circumstances," Morrison said. "The rule of law is essential for liberal democracies, and we weaken it at our great peril.”Prominent lawyers and the woman’s friends have called for an independent inquiry to test the evidence against Porter, while some opposition lawmakers say the allegations are serious and credible.But Morrison said police were the authorized authorities to make judgments about the case, and “that's where the matter rests.”On Thursday, Porter held an emotional press conference in which he said he wouldn't quit his job."If I stand down from my position as attorney-general because of an allegation about something that simply did not happen, then any person in Australia can lose their career, their job, their life’s work based on nothing more than an accusation that appears in print,” Porter said.The allegations date back more than three decades, when Porter was 17 and his accuser was 16, and they competed alongside each other on a four-member school debate team.Porter said he remembered his accuser as intelligent, bright and happy — but that nothing sexual occurred between them.“It just didn’t happen,” he told reporters.Porter said he's planning to take a couple of weeks off “just for my own sanity” before returning to work.Morrison said he was pleased Porter was taking the break.“I’m looking forward to him returning to his duties once that period of leave is completed," the prime minister said.A new confidential complaints hotline for reporting serious workplace incidents has been set up for Parliament House staff, the government said this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-pm-morrison-supports-his-attorney-general-s-denial-of-rape-accusations-101614822043734.html

Monmouth University poll results announced on Wednesday shows a decline in the approval rating of the President. From 54 per cent in January, 51 per cent of Americans approve of the President in March. His disapproval rating has jumped from 30 per cent to 42 per cent."It’s probably not a surprise that Biden’s honeymoon period has closed quickly. He does maintain a net positive rating, but the Covid stimulus package will be the first significant test of how stable that support is," Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute said.The drop in the approval rating also comes with a shift in the people who now have an opinion on the President. The category of people with 'no opinion' on Biden in late January has dropped from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.The poll results also found that 6 in 10 or 62 per cent of Americans approve the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus package. The majority of the public (51 per cent) are satisfied with the $1,400 direct payments to individuals and families of certain income levels. Around 28 per cent hope for larger payments and just 14 per cent want smaller payments.Also Read | SpaceX’s biggest rocket manages first successful landing, then explodesAbout 53 per cent of Americans support the increase in the minimum wage and 67 per cent approve the additional jobless benefits and its extension through the summer included in the stimulus package. The hike in the minimum wage included in the bill is expected to be cut out in the Senate due to a previous parliamentary ruling.However, the poll results also show that 59 per cent of Americans do not approve of the job being done by the Congress and 61 per cent believes that the nation's trajectory is headed in the wrong direction. Only 30 per cent approve of the job done by the Congress and only 34 per cent feel that the nation is headed in the right direction.Biden enjoys around 91 per cent approval rating from the Democrats and 80 per cent disapproval from the Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-approval-rating-declines-in-2-months-maintains-majority-approval-101614822266971.html
04-03-2021||World||SpaceX’s biggest rocket manages first successful landing, then explodes||Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s newest and biggest rocket pulled off its first successful landing, then exploded a brief time later and was engulfed by fire.The Starship SN-10 prototype lifted off from SpaceX’s seaside launch pad at about 5:15 p.m. in Boca Chica, Texas, on Wednesday, based on a live video stream on SpaceX’s website. The rocket then flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (around 6 miles) before turning its engines back on and settling on the landing pad with a slight lean.Shortly after that, the rocket was lifted into the air by an explosion and consumed by flames, possibly after a fire ignited fuel. Until that point, the rocket appeared to achieve a key milestone with its first stable landing in three attempts. After its ascent, Starship shut off its three Raptor engines and performed a controlled “belly flop” descent, then reignited its engines to make a vertical landing.Despite the mishap, the test is likely to signal progress for the massive vehicle. An earlier Starship rocket slammed to the ground on the program’s first high-altitude flight Dec. 9, igniting a fireball, followed by a similar outcome with a second prototype last month. No one was hurt in the mishaps, and there were no reports of injuries from the fire after the latest flight, which was the third high-altitude test.SpaceX founder Elon Musk plans to use the Starship to shuttle as many as 12 people around the moon in 2023, land NASA astronauts on the lunar surface and eventually settle explorers on Mars. The company still has work to prepare the Starship for its first orbital flight, which could occur later this year.“I’m highly confident that we will have reached orbit many times with Starship before 2023, and that it will be safe enough for human transport by 2023,” Musk said Tuesday in a video released by Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, who has invited eight people to apply to join his “fun trip” around the moon. “It’s looking very, very promising.”SpaceX conceived the stainless steel Starship as a versatile, fully reusable craft that can carry 100 metric tons for deep-space missions to the moon and Mars. It’s also designed to serve as a hypersonic, point-to-point vehicle to reduce travel times across Earth.Excluding a heavy booster that creates a two-stage system, Starship is 160 feet (49 meters) high with a 30-foot diameter, and able to carry as many as 100 passengers.Musk said in October that he’s 80% to 90% confident that Starship will be ready for an orbital flight this year. SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, California, plans to fly multiple Starship prototypes from its Texas launch site near the U.S.-Mexico border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacexs-biggest-rocket-manages-first-successful-landing-then-explodes-101614819756543.html

04-03-2021||World||Nearly 40 killed in violent day of protests against Myanmar coup, says UN envoy||Thirty-eight people were killed in Myanmar as the military quelled protests in several towns and cities on Wednesday, the United Nations said, the most violent day since demonstrations against last month's military coup first broke out.Police and soldiers opened fire with live rounds with little warning, witnesses said.The bloodshed occurred one day after neighbouring countries had called for restraint in the aftermath of the military's overthrow of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Also Read: As Myanmar turns violent, India can adopt a two-track approach"It's horrific, it's a massacre. No words can describe the situation and our feelings," youth activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters via a messaging app.The dead included four children, an aid agency said. Hundreds of protesters were arrested, local media reported."Today it was the bloodiest day since the coup happened on the 1st of February. We had today — only today — 38 people died. We have now more than over 50 people died since the coup started, and many are wounded," United Nations special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said in New York.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.Schraner Burgener said that in conversations with Myanmar's deputy military chief Soe Win, she had warned him that the military was likely to face strong measures from some countries and isolation in retaliation for the coup."The answer was: 'We are used to sanctions, and we survived'," she told reporters in New York. "When I also warned they will go (into) isolation, the answer was: 'We have to learn to walk with only few friends'."The U.N. Security Council is due to discuss the situation on Friday in a closed meeting, diplomats said.SUSTAINED SHOOTINGKo Bo Kyi, joint secretary of Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners rights group, had said earlier the military killed at least 18. But the toll rose by the end of the day.In the main city Yangon, witnesses said at least eight people were killed, seven of them when security forces opened sustained fire in a neighbourhood in the north of the city in the early evening.Also Read: Concerned by loss of lives in Myanmar, India calls for restraint"I heard so much continuous firing. I lay down on the ground, they shot a lot," protester Kaung Pyae Sone Tun, 23, told Reuters.In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was "appalled" by the increase in violence. The administration of President Joe Biden was evaluating "appropriate" measures to respond and any actions would be targeted at Myanmar's military, he added.The United States has conveyed to China that it is looking for Beijing to play a constructive role in Myanmar, the spokesman said.The European Union said the shootings of unarmed civilians and medical workers were clear breaches of international law. It also said the military was stepping up repression of the media, with a growing number of journalists arrested and charged.In the central town of Monywa, six people were killed, the Monywa Gazette reported. Others were killed in the second-biggest city Mandalay, the northern town of Hpakant and the central town of Myingyan.Save the Children said in a statement four children were among the dead, including a 14-year-old boy who Radio Free Asia reported was shot dead by a soldier on a passing convoy of military trucks. The soldiers loaded his body onto a truck and left the scene, according to the report.'WE SHALL OVERCOME'Security forces breaking up protests in Yangon detained about 300 protesters, the Myanmar Now news agency reported.Video posted on social media showed lines of young men, hands on heads, filing into army trucks as police and soldiers stood guard. Reuters was unable to verify the footage.Images of a 19-year-old woman, one of two shot dead in Mandalay, showed her wearing a T-shirt that read "Everything will be OK".Police in Yangon ordered three medics out of an ambulance, shot up the windscreen and then kicked and beat the workers with gun butts and batons, video broadcast by U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia showed. Reuters was unable to verify the video independently.Democracy activist Esther Ze Naw told Reuters that the sacrifices of those who died would not be in vain."We shall overcome this and win," she said.On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to make a breakthrough in a virtual foreign ministers' meeting on Myanmar.While united in a call for restraint, only four members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore - called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees."We expressed ASEAN's readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner," the ASEAN chair, Brunei, said in a statement.Myanmar's state media said the military-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, attended and "apprised the meeting of voting irregularities" in the November election.The military justified the coup by saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 vote were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second term.The election commission said the vote was fair.Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame. U.N. envoy Schraner Burgener said his deputy Soe Win told her that "after a year they want to have another election."Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-40-killed-in-violent-day-of-protests-against-myanmar-coup-un-envoy-says-101614819069754.html
04-03-2021||World||Rishi Sunak delays UK fiscal squeeze until year before next election||Rishi Sunak put off steps to tackle the UK’s record budget deficit for another two years, focusing on stimulus for a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Tax and spending measures in the chancellor of the exchequer’s annual budget will add 73 billion pounds ($101 billion) to the economy by April 2023. In the three years after that, the Treasury will take back almost the same amount of money and drive the overall tax burden to its highest since the 1960s.It’s a political gamble for Sunak since the Conservative government will be campaigning for re-election in 2024 around the time when the tightening starts to bite. That would also be around the time that some economists expect the Bank of England to start unwinding its own stimulus after cutting interest rates to a record low and expanding its asset purchase program.“The debate will become at what point the bank will want to give some sort of hawkish signal about starting the process of normalization,” Jacob Nell, chief U.K. economist at Morgan Stanley and a former Treasury official, said in an interview after Sunak’s statement on Wednesday. “Previously we had the recovery lagging. Now it’s going to be level-pegging with Europe.”Sunak’s largesses brings to about 350 billion pounds the sum the Treasury is spending on the Covid crisis. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s rapid vaccination program opening the prospect of fewer restrictions by the middle of this year, Sunak is allowing time for a recovery to gather momentum before fixing the public finances.The looser fiscal stance added fuel to a rise in interest rates in financial markets, where investors increasingly anticipate both a quick bounce for the economy and higher borrowing. U.K. government bonds led a sell off across Europe on Wednesday, with yields on the benchmark 10-year gilt rising 9.3 basis points.What Our Economists Say ...“With Sunak giving the economy more chance to recover before removing the key pillar of fiscal support, the chances of a sharp rise in unemployment when the scheme ends have been dramatically reduced. By limiting the rise in unemployment Sunak has raised the possibility of the economy recovering more quickly.”--Dan Hanson, Bloomberg Economics. “The fiscal backdrop will be more favorable for growth this year and next,” said Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan Securities Plc. “We also think this has some implications for the BOE. This hints at an earlier start to monetary policy tightening.”The economy will return to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of next year, six months earlier than forecast in November, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The agency said Sunak’s decision to extend wage support for furloughed workers means unemployment is likely to peak at 6.5% rather than 7.5% -- a difference of about 340,000 people.Business investment, which stagnated following the 2016 Brexit referendum and plunged last year, is set to get a boost from Sunak’s announcement of a 12 billion-pound temporary tax break that encourages firms to bring forward investment from future years. The OBR sees investment jumping by almost 17% in 2022.The scale of those measures plans prompted some economists to lift their forecasts for growth. Others said it complicated the task facing the central bank.“This is tricky for the BOE because at the two-year horizon, where monetary policy has most effect, you’re going to see a large fiscal contraction,” said Robert Wood, chief U.K. economist at Bank of America. “You can’t have both the BOE hiking rates and the government consolidating to this degree at the same time.”Sunak plans to raise taxes from 2023 by lifting the main rate on corporate profits, freezing tax thresholds and reducing existing departmental spending plans by about 4 billion pounds a year. The chancellor said his aim is for Britain only to borrow for investment, not day-to-day spending, a goal the OBR said he may come close to meeting by the middle of the decade.Despite the brighter near-term outlook, the OBR was no more optimistic that the economy will escape the scarring effects of the pandemic. Five years from now, it said GDP may be 3% lower than it would have been had the crisis not happened.Some of the Treasury’s forecasts could be difficult to achieve. The government sees income from property-transaction taxes soaring 40% to 17.3 billion pounds in 2025-26 from 12.3 billion pounds in the coming fiscal year. That’s almost as much as was raised before the pandemic and without a tax holiday on purchases.“More may yet need to be done in forthcoming fiscal events in order toput the public finances back on an even keel,” said George Buckley, chief U.K. economist at Nomura International Plc in London.Even so, the macroeconomic outlook delivered by the Treasury is similar to the Bank of England’s expectation of a sharp rebound starting the the middle of the year.“The budget delivered a net, near-term fiscal loosening, which should buttress the economic recovery,” said Martin Beck at Oxford Economics. “The OBR’s forecast of 4% GDP growth this year looks far too pessimistic -- we are considering raising our current projection of 5.5%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-delays-uk-fiscal-squeeze-until-year-before-next-election-101614818648724.html

Privately, he’s discussed alternatives to Pence as he takes stock of who he believes stood with him at the end of his term and who didn’t, according to two of the people.They requested anonymity because the conversations have been private.Trump’s advisers have discussed identifying a Black or female running mate for his next run, and three of the people familiar with the matter said Pence likely won’t be on the ticket.Two advisers have suggested Trump consider South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, the people said. Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, are hosting a fundraiser for Noem on Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and home in Palm Beach. The former president is planning to make an appearance, people familiar with the matter said.And on Tuesday, Trump issued a public endorsement for South Carolina Senator Tim Scott’s re-election. Scott is the only Black Republican in the U.S. Senate.Pence rejected his boss’s appeals to unilaterally overturn Trump’s re-election defeat when he presided over the congressional count of Electoral College votes on Jan. 6. The event turned into an insurrection by Trump’s supporters, who invaded the Capitol, disrupted the count and forced the vice president and members of Congress to flee. Five people died in the melee.The two men didn’t speak for days afterward. Pence hasn’t said whether he’d be interested in running with Trump again, according to person familiar with the situation, who believes it’s doubtful Pence would.Trump adviser Jason Miller said “no such conversations are happening” about picking someone other than Pence if he runs again, and that the former president “hasn’t made any decisions regarding a potential 2024 run.” A Pence spokesperson didn’t immediately comment.In Trump’s camp, there’s been no serious consideration of future vice presidential candidates yet, the people familiar with the matter said. If he runs, Trump likely won’t make a formal announcement until the summer of 2023, they said.If Trump runs in 2024, it would be good for him to pick a female running mate or someone who can appeal to voters that he lost in 2020 and for Pence to break out on his own and partner with someone who shares his core conservative values but doesn’t put off voters in the way that Trump’s rhetoric did at times, said Alyssa Farah, a former communications director for Trump.“It’s probably best for both of them,” Farah said on Bloomberg Radio’s “Sound On” program Wednesday.At a rally outside the White House before the deadly Jan. 6 riot, Trump said he would win the 2020 election if Pence did “the right thing” and rejected Electoral College votes for Joe Biden from several states where the former president had alleged, without evidence, that widespread fraud had cost him victory.After Pence refused, Trump tweeted that his vice president “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our Constitution.” At the time, the mob was swarming the Capitol, with some insurrectionists chanting “hang Mike Pence,” as the Secret Service spirited the vice president to safety.While Trump didn’t formally announce his candidacy at CPAC on Sunday, his first public appearance since leaving office on Jan. 20, he hinted at another bid. Trump rattled off the accomplishments of his term in the White House, repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election and added, “Who knows? I may even decide to beat them a third time.”The former president’s public musing about another run may effectively freeze the 2024 Republican presidential field, as many other prominent GOP candidates are likely to wait on the former president’s decision before announcing their own campaigns.Trump is building a political structure that would serve as a campaign foundation should he decide to run again, including an existing political action committee, Save America, that accepts donations up to $5,000 per individual. A new super PAC, which would accept unlimited donations, is also planned.Pence was invited to speak at CPAC but informed organizers weeks ahead of the event that he and his family had decided to keep a low profile in the first half of the year. He has said he’s opening a transition office and plans to move back to Indiana this summer.The former vice president is himself considered a top-tier potential candidate in 2024. A Harvard-Harris poll conducted Feb. 23-25 found that 42% of Republican voters preferred Trump as their 2024 nominee, compared to 18% for Pence, who placed second.Without Trump, Pence led the field with the support of 36% of Republican voters, followed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz at 13%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-weighs-2024-run-without-mike-pence-say-allies-101614816670968.html

The rocket then flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (around 6 miles) before reigniting its engines and touching down on the landing pad.The successful landing -- the craft’s first -- likely marks the start of a new development phase for the massive vehicle, which SpaceX founder Elon Musk plans to use to shuttle as many as 12 people around the moon in two years, land NASA astronauts on the lunar surface and eventually settle explorers on Mars.

04-03-2021||World||Biden administration asks for more time on decision to release Trump taxes to Congress||The Biden administration said it needed more time to decide whether to turn over former president Donald Trump’s tax returns to Congress.In a court filing Wednesday, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department said they were still weighing how to respond to a subpoena by House Democrats seeking six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the government more time and ordered the parties to submit a status report on March 31.“Because the transition to new leadership at both agencies is still ongoing, Defendants require additional time to complete this process,” government lawyers said in the filing.Attorneys for House Democrats said any extension granted by the judge “should be limited, given how long the Committee’s request has been stymied.”The legal battle dates to 2019, when the House Ways and Means Committee sued to compel then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to hand over the tax records. Under Trump, the Justice Department fought subpoenas issued by the committee, which filed a lawsuit.Other lawsuits over the president’s tax records involving his accountants and bankers reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that Congress could not compel disclosure, at least for the time being. Those cases were sent back to the lower courts to assess whether lawmakers should narrow the scope of the information they sought.Separately, the district attorney in Manhattan, Cyrus Vance, has obtained Trump’s tax records as part of a criminal investigation into the former president’s business dealings. It’s unclear whether Vance will make those documents public.In September 2020, the New York Times cited previously undisclosed returns in reporting that Trump had claimed chronic losses for years as a way to avoid taxes. He paid $750 in federal income tax in 2016, and paid no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, the newspaper reported.The case is Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, 19-cv-1974, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-asks-for-more-time-on-decision-to-release-trump-taxes-to-congress-101614815561748.html

And on Monday, hairdressers opened after a 2 1/2-month break. Current lockdown rules were set to run through Sunday.On Wednesday, Merkel and the state governors -- who in highly decentralized Germany have the power to impose and lift restrictions -- set out a phased plan that allows for some further relaxation of restrictions.

However, the FATF president Marcus Pleyer pointed out the deficiencies yet to be addressed are all “serious” as they related to terror financing.At the NEC meeting, it was decided that the additional legislation has to “cover some weaknesses in the existing framework that limited the authorities from taking action, including imposing sanction or apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them”, the report said.The Pakistan government will have to submit an updated report within 30 days to the FATF on progress in legislation and other steps to be taken to address outstanding concerns. The meeting concluded there shouldn’t be any hurdle in making two more legal amendments, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-needs-to-enact-laws-to-fulfil-fatf-targets-101614799176514.html

He also participated on Tuesday in the group’s conference call, which was off-limits to reporters.The public absence was more glaring after legislative leaders announced on Tuesday that they were limiting the governor’s broad powers to set state policy during the Covid-19 pandemic.The governor is also facing criticism for withholding, for months, a full account of the number of nursing home residents who died from Covid-19.Under the bill, Cuomo would still have the power to keep alive his existing Covid-19 rules or tweak them. But he’ll no longer be allowed to make decisions without any input from the legislature. He’ll have to notify legislative committees and local governments.Neither Cuomo nor his spokespeople have commented on the latest allegation made against him on Monday night. A woman told The New York Times that Cuomo touched her inappropriately and misbehaved with her at a September 2019 wedding event.Most leading Democrats have signalled they want to wait for the results of an investigation by New York attorney general Letitia James into claims that Cuomo sexually harassed at least two women in his administration. State Democratic Party chair Jay Jacobs said it’s “premature” to opine before the investigation concludes. Several members of the National Governors Association said they support the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scandalhit-cuomo-may-see-emergency-powers-taken-away-101614798804334.html

No words can describe the situation and our feelings,” youth activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters via a messaging app.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment. Ko Bo Kyi, joint secretary of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners rights group, said in a post on Twitter, “As of now, so called military killed at least 18.”In Yangon, witnesses said at least eight people were killed, one early in the day and seven others when forces opened sustained fire with automatic weapons in a neighbourhood in the north of the city in the evening.“I heard so much continuous firing. I lay down on the ground, they shot a lot,” protester Kaung Pyae Sone Tun, 23, told Reuters. A protest leader in the community, Htut Paing, said the hospital there had told him seven people had been killed. Hospital administrators were not immediately available for comment.Another heavy toll was in the central town of Monywa, where six people were killed, Monywa Gazette reported. Others were killed in various places including the second-biggest city Mandalay, the northern town of Hpakant and the central town of Myingyan. At least 40 people have been killed since the coup.Ousted president faces two fresh chargesOusted President Win Myint is facing two new charges, his lawyer said on Wednesday, including a breach of the constitution that is punishable by up to three years in jail. Myint was arrested along with Suu Kyi. Myint was already facing charges of violating protocols to stop the spread of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/38-killed-on-bloodiest-day-says-un-envoy-101614797702262.html

He was killed but only slightly injured passers-by.In April 2017, a rejected and radicalised Uzbek asylum seeker mowed down pedestrians in Stockholm with a stolen truck, killing five people.
