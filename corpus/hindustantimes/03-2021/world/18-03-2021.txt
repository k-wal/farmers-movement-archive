This was the second consignment of Malathion, a 95% ultra-low volume pesticide, supplied to Iran under a government-to-government locust control programme, the external affairs ministry said on Thursday. The consignment was handed over to Iran’s Plant Protection Organization on March 18. Last year, India had approached Iran and Pakistan for a coordinated regional response to the threat of desert locusts. “It was in this context that Iran had requested the supply of pesticides. There was no response from Pakistan,” the external affairs ministry said. India supplied the first consignment of 20,000 litres of Malathion to Iran in June 2020. Iran is using the pesticide to control locust populations in Sistan-Balochistan and South Khorasan provinces, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The proposal for a coordinated response was made by India against the backdrop of swarms of the destructive pests making their way to Indian states such as Rajasthan after breeding and maturing in Iranian provinces and Pakistan’s Balochistan province. Iran witnessed its worst locust invasion of the past 25 years in 2020. Afghanistan, Iran and India signed a tripartite agreement on developing Chabahar port and setting up a trilateral transport and transit corridor in 2016. India then set up India Ports Global Limited to operate Shahid Behesti terminal at Chabahar. Since the Indian firm began operations in December 2018, the port has handled 123 vessels, 13,752 containers and 1.8 million tonnes of cargo. There has also been an increase in the average monthly calls by merchant vessels, and 110,000 tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been shipped to Afghanistan through the port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-delivers-20-000-litres-of-pesticide-to-iran-to-fight-locust-swarms-101616091077019.html
18-03-2021||World||China offers domestic Covid vaccine to diplomats, foreign workers, journalists||China has for the first time offered a Covid-19 vaccination option to diplomats, including those from India, foreigners working in Chinese companies as well as foreign journalists, months after it began to inoculate its own citizens under emergency laws.Foreigners working in international aid companies have also been given the option to take a shot of a Chinese-made vaccine, HT learnt.Family members in the age group of 18-59 years are included in the offer.Beijing rolled out vaccinations for its own citizens, mostly for frontline workers, in health care, customs and specific industries that the government selected under emergency laws in July last year, but it was for the first time, earlier this month, that the government reached out to foreign missions, companies and journalists through the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs.The vaccine being offered is the inactivated Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, developed by Sinopharm’s China National Biotec Group, which has been granted conditional market approval by China’s National Medical Products Administration.The two shots - the second to be taken after 21 days - will cost about 90-100 yuan each ( ₹900-1,000).Diplomats, HT spoke to, said they were weighing the option whether to take the shot.Indians working in the service industries such as restaurants have also been offered the option though their employers.The World Health Organization (WHO) is yet to approve the vaccine, or for that matter, any of the other four jabs given the green signal by the Chinese government.A Chinese foreign ministry email to expat journalists sent out on Wednesday outlined the offer.“In order to facilitate the work and life of foreign journalists based in Beijing, the information department of the ministry of foreign affairs will provide facilitation and assistance for the vaccination of foreign journalists in Beijing (including their accompanying family members) who are within the eligible age group (from 18 to 59 years old),” the notice said.“Recipients will receive vaccination on a voluntary basis with informed consent, pay for the relevant expenses, and bear related risks,” it added.The government notice said experiments showed that inactivated Covid-19 vaccines were relatively safe, but that’s no guarantee against vaccine-related reaction.“Prior to inoculation, all recipients should read carefully the Covid-19 inactivated vaccine information consent, and confirm that they are fully aware of the possible adverse reactions and do not have contraindications to vaccination,” the notice said.The notice added that existing clinical research data show that most people produce antibodies “against Covid-19 after vaccination, but no vaccine can be 100% effective”.“Therefore, recipients will still need to comply with all the prevention and control requirements after vaccination, and take personal protective measures such as mask-wearing, frequent hand-washing, social distancing, and reducing group activities,” the notice said.China is yet to approve any Covid-19 vaccine developed by Western drug makers; five domestic ones are currently approved in China.China, according to government officials at a press briefing on Monday in Beijing, has administered 64.98 million doses of vaccines.China has been slow to vaccinate its people relative to other countries, administering 3.56 doses per 100 people so far in a population of 1.4 billion, Zhong Nanshan, leading a group of experts attached to China’s National Health Commission, said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-offers-domestic-covid-vaccine-to-diplomats-foreign-workers-journalists-101616090536935.html
18-03-2021||World||German archbishop offers to quit after criticism over handling abuse cases||A report commissioned by Germany’s Cologne archdiocese on church officials’ handling of past cases of sexual abuse found 75 cases in which high-ranking officials neglected their duties. The findings on Thursday prompted the archbishop of Hamburg to offer his resignation to Pope Francis.The report, commissioned by Cologne Archbishop Rainer Maria Woelki, absolved Woelki himself of any neglect of duty with respect to abuse victims.However, Woelki’s late predecessor, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, was accused of two dozen instances of wrongdoing such as failing to follow up on or report cases of abuse, not sanctioning perpetrators or not caring for victims. Meisner retired in 2014 and died in 2017.Hamburg Archbishop Stefan Hesse — who previously was a senior church official in Cologne — was faulted for 11 cases of neglecting his duty.Later Thursday, Hesse posted a video statement in which he conceded that he had made “mistakes” in the past, and said he very much regretted if he caused new suffering to victims or their relatives “through my action or omission.”“I never participated in cover-ups,” he said. “I am nevertheless prepared to carry my part of the responsibility for the failure of the system.”“To prevent damage to the office of the archbishop and to the Hamburg archdiocese, I am offering my resignation to Pope Francis, and I am asking him to relieve me of my duties immediately,” he said.The lawyer in charge of the report, Bjoern Gercke, told reporters in Cologne that his investigation touched on the cases of 314 abuse victims — a majority of the boys under the age of 14 at the time of the abuse — and 202 people accused of abuse in the Cologne diocese since 1975.The focus wasn’t so much on what the suspects did to the victims, but more on whether the church — former and current archbishops, vicars-general and other high-ranking church officials — responded correctly to accusations of abuse.Altogether, the report found 75 cases in which eight high-ranking officials neglected their duties to either follow up on, report or sanction cases of alleged abuse by clergy and lay church employees, and failed to take care of the victims.Woelki infuriated many local Catholics over recent months by citing legal concerns to keep under wraps a first report on how local church officials reacted when priests were accused of sexual abuse. He commissioned the new report — an 800-page investigation based on church files and put together by a German law firm.Gercke said the first report, by a Munich law firm, also had concluded that the current archbishop wasn't guilty of any wrongdoing. The Cologne archdiocese has the most Catholics of any in Germany, some 1.9 million.In a first response to the new report, Woelki said the investigation confirmed his fears that high-ranking officials were guilty of not having reported perpetrators and thereby preventing their prosecution.“My predecessors, too, are guilty — as of today, it is no longer possible to say 'We didn’t know,’” Woelki said, adding that he would send the report to the Holy See in Rome.Woelki said he also would temporarily suspend two Cologne church officials based on the findings of the investigation. One of them, Auxiliary Bishop Dominikus Schwaderlapp, said he had offered his resignation to Pope Francis. The report found Schwaderlapp neglected his duty to inform and report abuse allegations in eight cases.German Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht said the report demonstrated anew “what horrific sexual violence children and teenagers had to suffer in Catholic institutions.”“Child abuse is not an internal church matter, but a crime that must be examined and decided by criminal courts,” the minister said.Jens Windel, 46, the founder of a support group for clergy abuse survivors,. watched a livestream of the news conference about the report on his laptop with other victims outside Cologne's landmark cathedral.The report, he said, “trivializes the severity of the cover-ups that took place.”There has been fierce criticism of Woelki's handling of the previous report. The head of the German Bishops’ Conference, Limburg Bishop Georg Baetzing, last month described the crisis management in Cologne as a “disaster.”A Cologne court last month announced that it was raising the number of appointments available for people seeking to formally leave the church to 1,500 from 1,000 starting in March, amid strong demand.Revelations about past sexual abuse have dogged the church in Germany and elsewhere for years.In 2018, a church-commissioned report concluded that at least 3,677 people were abused by clergy in Germany between 1946 and 2014. More than half of the victims were 13 or younger when the abuse took place, and nearly a third of them were altar boys.In January, a new system drawn up by the church to compensate abuse survivors took effect. It provides for payments of up to about 50,000 euros (nearly $60,000) to each victim. Under a previous system in place since 2011, payments averaged about 5,000 euros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-archbishop-offers-to-quit-after-criticism-over-handling-abuse-cases-101616087675018.html
18-03-2021||World||Of 11 mn AstraZeneca shots in UK thus far, rare blood clots reported in 5 cases||Britain's medicines regulator said there had been five cases of a rare type of blood clot in the brain among 11 million given AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine but said that it found the benefits of the shot far outweighed any possible risks.Concerns about reports of blood clots, along with low platelet levels, have led to some European countries including Germany to pause the rollout of the shot while the cases are investigated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is set to announce its findings later in the day.Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that use of the vaccine should continue while five reports were investigated, and one official said that the rollout would likely continue even if a link was proved."There is no evidence that blood clots in veins is occurring more than would be expected in the absence of vaccination, for either vaccine," said June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive, referring to AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots.Raine said there had been a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis, or CSVT) occurring together with lowered platelets soon after vaccination."Given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these CSVT events among the 11 million people vaccinated (with AstraZeneca), and as a link to the vaccine is unproven, the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, continue to outweigh the risks of potential side effects," she said.One of the reported cases was fatal, MHRA Vaccine Safety Lead Philip Bryan said, adding that the cases were all among men aged between 19 and 59.NO PAUSE NECESSARYThe MHRA said anyone with a headache that lasts for more than four days after vaccination, or bruising beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek medical attention.The regulator said there was an ongoing review into "five UK reports of a very rare and specific type of blood clot in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis) occurring together with lowered platelets (thrombocytopenia)".Munir Pirmohamed, Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, in a statement suggested that even if a link between the clots and the vaccine was established, it likely wouldn't halt Britain's rollout."If we feel that there's causal link then we may need to update the product information, but overall, I don't think that would necessitate pause to any kind of vaccination programme," he told reporters in a briefing.The EMA is investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine in the EU, and is focusing on blood clots in the head.Stephen Evans, at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that COVID-19 itself was associated with similar symptoms, making causality hard to establish."A major problem is discerning whether there is a possibility that this was caused by COVID-19," Evans told Reuters."Exactly these sort of conditions have been seen in patients with COVID-19 prior to the vaccines being available."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/of-11-mn-astrazeneca-shots-in-uk-thus-far-rare-blood-clots-reported-in-5-cases-101616087746332.html
18-03-2021||World||Dutch PM Mark Rutte's conservatives register fourth straight election win||The process of forming a new Dutch governing coalition began Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative party powered to a fourth consecutive victory in a vote held during a nationwide lockdown and dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic.The feat put Rutte in position to lead coalition talks, most likely with another big winner — the centrist, pro-European D66 party led by former diplomat Sigrid Kaag, who danced on a table Wednesday night when an exit poll showed her party capturing one of its biggest-ever victories.However those two parties will likely need at least two more partners to form a majority coalition. According to the national news agency ANP, based on 88% of votes counted, Rutte's party, known by its Dutch acronym VVD, won 35 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament while D66 garnered 24.Rutte wants to move quickly to hammer out a coronavirus recovery plan before getting into a government blueprint for the new coalition's four-year term.“We must have plans in place to unlock the country," Rutte told his lawmakers in a virtual meeting Thursday.The splintered political landscape in the Netherlands — 17 parties were forecast to have won at least one seat — could make coalition talks difficult.Party leaders took the first step Thursday by appointing two “scouts,” one from Rutte's VVD and a second from D66, to examine different parties' wish lists and investigate possible coalitions ahead of formal talks.The VVD selected Senator Annemarie Jorritsma, while D66 chose Kajsa Ollongren, who was interior minister and deputy prime minister in Rutte's last Cabinet. They plan to start talks with party leaders Monday and write a report for the newly elected lawmakers ahead of their first sitting on March 31.“In times of corona, it is of course important to form a new Cabinet as soon as possible.. that can get to work on the economic and social social recovery,” Jorritsma said, adding that she hopes it will be possible to form a new coalition before the summer.Rutte’s victory had been widely predicted even though the election came just two months after his last coalition resigned over a scandal in which the country’s tax office wrongfully labeled thousands of families who claimed child welfare benefits as fraudsters.The other big winner of the night was the far-right populist Forum for Democracy, which rose from two to eight seats after its flamboyant leader, Thierry Baudet, campaigned on a pledge to end the country's coronavirus lockdown.As other party leaders spoke to reporters Wednesday night, Baudet was conspicuous by his absence. By Thursday morning, the Twitter hashtag “waarisbaudet” or “whereisbaudet” was trending in the Netherlands. The party eventually expressed its gratitude to voters.“A half million people in the Netherlands have said: we want our lives back. A thunderous blow against the endless lockdowns. A huge victory for freedom,” the party tweeted.Baudet, arriving at parliament for a meeting of party leaders, told reporters he “was actually hoping for more” seats in the election.It was something of a political resurrection for the party that imploded late last year amid reports of anti-Semitic text messages among its youth wing.Despite the gains for Baudet, the far-right populist bloc in the Netherlands is unlikely to take part in any new coalition. Anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom lost three seats and is now the country's third-biggest party, said he would again lead the opposition.The political left also looks likely to be out of power after parties lost seats or failed to gain ground after four years in opposition to Rutte's outgoing center-right coalition. The Green Left party, a big winner in the 2017 election, was forecast to lose half of its 14 seats.The Dutch election, coming just months after Britain's Brexit divorce with the European Union came into full force, saw gains among pro-EU parties. D66 has long been a staunch defender of the 27-nation bloc and among new parties in the lower house was the pro-European party Volt, which was forecast to win three seats.Voter Tim Logemann said he was disappointed in the result.“I had hoped that the VVD would definitely lose some points,” he said. “I personally voted for one of the smaller parties that didn’t get any points at all, so that’s even more disappointing."Kaag, who served as minister for foreign trade and development cooperation in Rutte’s last coalition, had campaigned as a viable alternative to Rutte as national leader in a country that has never had a female prime minister. Speaking to party lawmakers Thursday, she laid out her party's key themes.“We want unity, renewal and sustainability," she said. “D66 must and will make that happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-s-conservatives-register-fourth-straight-election-win-101616087214749.html
18-03-2021||World||US Prez Biden to send Covid vaccine doses to Mexico, Canada in first exports||The US is planning to send a combined 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to Mexico and Canada in its first export of shots.A White House official confirmed Thursday that the Biden administration is planning to send 2.5 million doses to Mexico and 1.5 million to Canada as a “loan.” The details are still being worked out.The AstraZeneca vaccine has not been authorized for use in the U.S. but has been by the World Health Organization. Tens of millions of doses have been stockpiled in the US should it receive emergency use authorization, sparking an international outcry that lifesaving doses could not be used overseas.The White House has said President Joe Biden's priority is the vaccination of all Americans, but the official said Biden was authorizing the loan because the “virus knows no borders.”The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the transaction before it was officially announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-biden-to-send-covid-vaccine-doses-to-mexico-canada-in-first-exports-101616086538313.html
18-03-2021||World||Myanmar: Protesters fear 'digital dictatorship' as military deploys AI||Protesters in Myanmar fear they are being tracked with Chinese facial recognition technology, as spiralling violence and street surveillance spark fears of a "digital dictatorship" to replace ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Human rights groups say the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to check on citizens' movements poses a "serious threat" to their liberty.More than 200 people have been killed since Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi was overthrown in a Feb. 1 coup, triggering mass protests that security forces have struggled to suppress with increasingly violent tactics.Security forces have focused on stamping out dissent in cities including the capital Naypyitaw, Yangon and Mandalay, where hundreds of CCTV cameras had been installed as part of a drive to improve governance and curb crime.Human Rights Watch has expressed its "heightened concern" over cameras armed with AI technology that can scan faces and vehicle licence plates in public places, and alert authorities to those on a wanted list."Even before the protests, the CCTVs were a concern for us, so we would try and avoid them - by taking different routes to go home, for example," Win Pe Myaing, a protester in Yangon, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."We believe the police and the military are using the system to track demonstrations and protests. It's like a digital dictatorship - the regime is using technology to track and arrest citizens, and that's dangerous," he said.Myanmar authorities could not be reached for comment.Most of the equipment used in Safe City, a project to curb crime in big cities, is from Chinese technology firm Huawei, Myanmar Now publication had reported.Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.Huawei told Human Rights Watch it was providing "standard ICT infrastructure equipment" - information and communications technology, and that the facial and licence-plate recognition technology on the cameras was not from Huawei.There were many vendors, and Huawei "is not involved in any actual operation and data storage or processing," it said.Chinese tech firms have come under increased scrutiny for their use of tools to detect, track and monitor minority Uighurs in the Xinjiang region, where activists and United Nations experts say at least a million Muslim Uighurs are detained in camps.China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism."Authorities' ability to identify people on the streets, potentially track their movements and relationships, and intrude into private lives poses a grave risk to anti-coup activists," said Manny Maung, a researcher at Human Rights Watch."It can also be used to single out individuals in discriminatory or arbitrary ways, including for their ethnicity or religion," she said in a statement.Young activists have created mobile mapping apps to warn protesters of the presence of police and military on the streets. The crowd-sourced maps also show the locations of water cannons, roadblocks and ambulances.Chinese-made surveillance technologies deployed in locations from Britain to Vietnam have raised concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse and discrimination.In Myanmar, sections of the law protecting the privacy and security of citizens have been suspended, and there are no legal guidelines for the collection, use and storage of personal data.While no arrests can be linked to facial recognition technology due to a lack of transparency, some residents are covering up the cameras, said activist Debbie Stothard."There are very serious concerns about how the military junta is using digital technologies," said Stothard, founder of Alternative Asean Network on Burma."If they are not already using it to target protesters and others, it is inevitable - and imminent," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-fear-digital-dictatorship-as-military-deploys-ai-101616086282448.html

18-03-2021||World||Mexico seizes fake Sputnik Covid vaccine bound for Honduras||Mexican customs officials have seized purported vials of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine en route to Honduras that the Russian entity that bankrolled the vaccine’s development said Thursday were fake.The seizure came aboard a private plane in the Gulf coast state of Campeche, according to a statement from Mexico’s tax agency late Wednesday.Customs agents and soldiers found 1,155 vials containing more than 5,700 doses inside two coolers packed with ice and sodas. The crew and Honduran passengers were turned over to the Attorney General’s Office.Mexican officials did not identify the doses as fake, but the Russian Direct Investment Fund said in a statement Thursday that after reviewing photographs of the packaging, they determined the vaccine to be fake.“Analysis of the photographs of the seized batch, including the design of containers and labels, suggests that it is a fake substance which has nothing to do with the original vaccine,” according to the RDIF statement. “The shipment’s procedure was also in violation of packaging and transportation protocols for the official Sputnik V vaccine.”It said the Russian Health Ministry would cooperate with Mexican authorities to analyze the contents of the vials.The RDIF also drew geopolitics into the mix, saying, “This is an example of possible provocations against Sputnik V just as Russian officials warned last week. Mexican government stopped and prevented this provocation possibly aimed at discrediting Sputnik V vaccine through shipment of fake vaccine.”Russian state-funded news agencies last week cited an anonymous high-ranking Kremlin source saying that “the US and its allies” are plotting “a large-scale information campaign aimed at creating a bias” towards Russian scientific products designed to counter Covid-19.The source said that the alleged plan is to paint Sputnik V as ineffective and dangerous, including by “staging mass deaths, allegedly as a result of using” the vaccine.Mexico started vaccinating people with Sputnik V last month and has received 400,000 doses to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-seizes-fake-sputnik-covid-vaccine-bound-for-honduras-101616085155353.html
18-03-2021||World||Pakistan backtracks on uncapped prices for privately imported Covid-19 shots||Pakistan has reversed its decision to allow uncapped prices for Covid-19 vaccines imported by private firms, the health minister said on Thursday, a move that coincided with the arrival of a first shipment of privately imported Russian Sputnik V shots.Pakistan, with a population of 220 million and largely reliant on the COVAX vaccine sharing initiative for poorer nations, last month allowed private firms to import coronavirus vaccines and agreed to exempt them from price caps."Now, however, there is a formula, already in vogue, to determine maximum price," minister Faisal Sultan told Reuters. "So yes, there is a price cap that DRAP (Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan) will recommend and get approval for."An official with M/s AGP Ltd, the company that imported the Sputnik shots, said a first shipment of 50,000 doses arrived on Wednesday night and that it will be made available to the public as soon as the government agreed on a price.The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't officially authorised to release the information.Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), responsible for marketing the Sputnik V vaccine abroad, confirmed to Reuters that a batch had been delivered to Pakistan.The decision to allow commercial imports of vaccines with an exemption on upper price caps had sparked criticism that it would be unfair.China's Sinopharm and CansinoBio, Sputnik V and AstraZeneca vaccines are approved for emergency use in Pakistan, which hasn't secured any vaccine from manufacturing companies, relying so far on donations.The country is vaccinating frontline health workers and older people with over 1 million doses of Sinopharm donated by longtime ally China.Prime Minister Imran Khan, 68, got his Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, said a video statement from his office that showed him getting the shot.Pakistan is seeing a sharp increase in Covid cases. It has recorded 615,810 coronavirus infections and 13,717 deaths, with 3,495 cases and 61 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-backtracks-on-uncapped-prices-for-privately-imported-covid-19-shots-101616083614317.html
18-03-2021||World||'Safe but...': EU drug regulator rules on troubled AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||The European Union’s drug regulator said AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe to use, giving the bloc an opportunity to try to turn around its lagging inoculation campaign after months of disarray.The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that the vaccine is “safe and effective,” and the benefits outweigh risks. Still, they said they can’t completely rule out a link between the vaccine and blood clots, and will investigate further.Several of Europe’s largest countries suspended use of Astra shots this month over reports of blood clotting, going against advice from the EMA and the World Health Organization that the benefits outweighed the risks. The uncertainty complicated the EU’s struggling vaccination campaign since the Astra shot accounts for about a fifth of its supply.While governments said they were ready to resume once they got positive EMA guidance, the question remains if the suspensions did irreparable damage to the reputation of the vaccine and if people will get the shots in sufficient numbers to curb the spread of the virus. Thousands of appointments have been canceled because of concern about health risks.Earlier on Thursday, the U.K.’s drugs regulator weighed in on Astra’s shot, saying the benefits continue to outweigh the risks and people “should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so.”The crisis over vaccine side effects is just one of many playing out in the effort to inoculate populations. The EU has already been in a long-running battle with AstraZeneca over the pace of deliveries, and this week it ramped up tensions with the U.K. by threatening to restrict vaccine exports to its former member.The EU has committed to immunizing 70% of adults by the end of September but has suffered from supply issues. It’s administered 12 doses per 100 people, less than a third of the U.K., according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.The Astra vaccine is one of four approved in the EU. The bloc expects 360 million deliveries from all providers in the second quarter, almost four times as many as this quarter.The blood’s propensity to clot is highly regulated within the human body, but some medicines such as hormonal birth control pills can disrupt the process.The EMA reviewed case reports from Germany and Norway, among others, to determine whether the problems were caused by the vaccine or whether the timing was a coincidence. They also compared the patients’ medical profiles, seeking similarities that may point to certain people being at higher risk of clots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/safe-but-eu-drug-regulator-rules-on-troubled-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101616084215739.html

18-03-2021||World||WHO working on ‘smart digital certificate’, different from ‘vaccine passport’. Here’s why||The World Health Organization is working on a 'smart digital certificate' for people fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a senior WHO official said on Thursday. During a news conference, WHO Europe director Hans Kluge said that the UN health agency “very strongly” encourages vaccinated individuals to have the documentation, however, distinguished it from 'vaccine passport'."We encourage very strongly – as with any vaccine – that there is a documentation, whether this is paper-based or preferably digital,” said Kluge. “But this is something different than a passport. We do not encourage at this stage that getting a vaccination is determining whether you can travel internationally or not. It should not be a requirement," he added.Why is WHO making the distinction?Kluge cited ethical and scientific reasons for the distinction between a smart digital certificate and a vaccine passport. Highlighting the global shortage of Covid-19 vaccine, the top WHO Europe official said that vaccine passport would increase the inequities as vulnerable people got disproportionately hit by the pandemic.“There is a global shortage of vaccines. So this would increase the inequities, and if there's one thing that we learned from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that the vulnerable people got hit disproportionally," he told the news conference.Elaborating on the scientific reason, Kluge further said that the WHO is not sure about the longevity of immunity against Covid-19 after inoculation and vaccinated individuals may still be able to transmit the virus. He also cited a “practical reason” for the distinction, saying the WHO is working within an "international trusted framework, we have to document whether people got the vaccine."Kluge, meanwhile, has also urged countries across Europe to continue using the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, amid concerns over a small number of cases of blood coagulation. He stressed that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine, at this point in time, far outweigh any risks.“As of now, we do not know whether some or all of the conditions have been caused by the vaccine or by other coincidental factors," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-working-on-smart-digital-certificate-different-from-vaccine-passport-101616082669626.html
18-03-2021||World||Despite ties, UAE stays clear of Israeli PM Netanyahu's election maneuver||As Israel heads to the polls next week for the fourth time in two years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to capitalize on his new partnership with the United Arab Emirates in his desperate campaign to stay in power.But the UAE has been mostly muted — and perhaps unimpressed — in response to Netanyahu’s ebullient descriptions of billions in Emirati commercial investments and promises of a historic meeting with the powerful Abu Dhabi crown prince. One Emirati official said the federation will not get involved in Israel's electioneering, “now or ever."The conflicting signals from the countries, which normalized relations in a breakthrough US-brokered agreement last fall, have set off a firestorm of speculation, highlighted the political differences between the sides and undermined Netanyahu’s talking points about the Gulf Arab sheikhdom's friendly embrace.“The honeymoon ended quickly,” Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent Emirati political scientist, tweeted on Thursday.Locked in a tight re-election battle, Netanyahu repeatedly has tried to score a lightning trip to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, to brandish his diplomatic achievement. The visit promised little of substance beyond a valuable photo-op for Netanyahu, who has sought to present himself as an indispensable statesman uniquely qualified to turn Israel’s enemies into allies and guide his nation through turbulent times.After coronavirus restrictions foiled his plans several times, Netanyahu attempted a hasty visit last Thursday, only to call it off at the last second. In an embarrassing setback, he said Jordan had refused to allow him to fly through its airspace after disagreements over security arrangements prevented a private visit to Jerusalem by Jordan’s crown prince.Emirati officials were mostly silent, a response that appeared to mask an undercurrent of behind-the-scenes pushback.A rare exception was Anwar Gargash, an Emirati presidential adviser who until last month served as the minister of state for foreign affairs. “The UAE will not be a part in any internal electioneering in Israel, now or ever,” Gargash wrote on Twitter.“From the UAE’s perspective, the purpose of the Abrahamic Accords is to provide a robust strategic foundation to foster peace and prosperity with the State of Israel and in the wider region,” he wrote, referring to last year's agreements that saw four Arab countries establish ties with Israel.Struggling with an ongoing corruption trial and popular outrage over the economic fallout of the pandemic, Netanyahu has sought to focus the spotlight on the historic deals, the so-called Abraham Accords.In his speeches and interviews this week, Netanyahu vowed to reschedule the Abu Dhabi trip. He dangled the promise of normalization with four more Arab countries, without naming them. He told reporters that the UAE had pledged to invest $10 billion in Israel.The UAE’s state-run news agency WAM confirmed last week that the Abu Dhabi crown prince, Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, had discussed with Netanyahu the establishment of a $10 billion fund to invest in Israel’s “strategic sectors,” ranging from energy and space to healthcare and agriculture.But days later, following Netanyahu’s media blitz, Sultan al-Jaber, the Emirati Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, seemed wary of moving too fast. According to UAE state-linked newspaper The National, al-Jaber emphasized that the UAE’s investment plans “are in the very early days” and tried to wipe out any associations with Netanyahu and his re-election campaign.“We are at a very early stage in studying the laws and policies in Israel,” he said. “The $10 billion is commercially driven and not politically associated.”He added, vaguely, that the “UAE has a long history and rich track record in making the right investments in the right locations, based on the commercial assessment of that market.”As Netanyahu tried to wrangle a high-profile visit, plans for a more subdued diplomatic visit from Israel were underway. Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, a member of the rival Blue and White party, was scheduled to fly to the UAE earlier this week to inaugurate Israel’s new embassy in Abu Dhabi.But Netanyahu called off the visit at the last minute, said an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.Israeli media reported that Netanyahu deprived his political rival of the visit because he wanted to be the first Israeli leader to be photographed at a ceremony in the UAE.Ben-Dror Yemini, a senior columnist at Israel's Yediot Ahronot daily, said unnamed Emirati officials told him they were stunned by the decision to cancel Ashkenazi’s visit.“Netanyahu’s action is a negative sign,” Yemini wrote. “It may get (the Emiratis) to look at Israel slightly less positively."The Emirati Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press. Netanyahu's office declined comment when asked about Ashkenazi's canceled trip.On Wednesday, Netanyahu confirmed to an Israeli radio station that he would not be flying to Abu Dhabi before next week's election after all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-ties-uae-stays-clear-of-israeli-pm-netanyahu-s-election-maneuver-101616078158222.html
18-03-2021||World||EU to slap sanctions on Chinese officials over rights abuses in Xinjiang: Report||European Union officials have approved sanctions on Chinese officials, who are accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.The penalties were approved at preparatory meetings for next week's Foreign Affairs Council, according to people familiar with the discussions. The penalties will be formally adopted at a meeting of the bloc's top diplomats on Monday, South China Morning Post reported.These will be the first sanctions against Beijing since an EU arms embargo in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The embargo is still in place.China is the EU's second-largest trading partner.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community.Analysts described the move as having "crossed a threshold" in relations with Beijing. It also marks the first time that the EU will use its new human rights sanctioning toolbox -- adopted last year -- against China, having given it a maiden outing following the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny last month.Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian Prime Minister and now an MEP, welcomed the incoming sanctions, but said that a relationship long predicated on carrots could use a few "more sticks"."Towards China, that balance is especially difficult to find and maintain, but we have no other option. The next threat is to bar imports of goods produced in Xinjiang," Verhofstadt said."And in parallel, we are definitely withholding the 'carrots' that so attract international partners to Europe: if there is no significant and verified improvement, the European Parliament will not pass the EU-China investment agreement," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-slap-sanctions-on-chinese-officials-over-rights-abuses-in-xinjiang-report-101616077626442.html
18-03-2021||World||UN says refugees face long 'struggle' for getting vaccinated against Covid-19||The UN said Thursday that vaccinating some of the world's most vulnerable refugees could drag on beyond 2022 due to the slow roll-out of Covid-19 jabs in host countries.UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, said many urban refugees were driven into a downward spiral of poverty last year by the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile the capacity for dealing with Covid-19 among refugees in rural areas was very limited.The UNHCR is seeking $455 million (382 million euros) to tackle the additional problems posed in protecting refugees from the effects of the pandemic."Now the struggle is for vaccines," Sajjad Malik, UNHCR's resilience and solutions director, told reporters."2021 is the beginning but it may very much go into 2022 and beyond because the vaccine is trickling down very slowly into these countries."There are around 80 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, according to UNHCR's latest statistics.These include 45.7 million internally displaced people, 26.3 million refugees and 4.2 million asylum seekers.Despite early fears that refugee camps would prove ideal breeding grounds for the virus, the situation for refugees tends to mirror that of their host communities, Malik said.Impact kicks inHe said the socioeconomic impact for refugees in urban areas was stark, with refugees often working on a daily wage basis having lost their income rapidly when lockdowns kicked in."Over a very short period of time, they went into a downward spiral of poverty. That is beginning to tell now," said Malik."With no income they could not pay their rents, they could not afford their health care. They could not look after their children."That has really created a lot of hardships."Meanwhile in rural areas, health systems which were already struggling to cope before the pandemic had little capacity for testing, isolating and treating Covid-19 cases."Where refugees are hosted in rural areas, it's even more difficult," said Malik.He said the UNHCR was not seeking preferential treatment for refugees in vaccination campaigns, and welcomed that 106 countries had included refugees in their Covid-19 planning."They knew that if they leave a proportion of the community out, the entire community is at risk," he said.Malik's deputy Marian Schilperoord said around 63,000 refugees were known to have been infected with Covid-19.However, the true figure would be much higher as, besides unreported cases, some countries do not distinguish refugees in their statistics.Some 48 percent of child refugees were out of school due to the pandemic -- with girls more heavily affected."Many of these children, most likely the risk is they will not go back to school as a result of one year of no education," said Malik.Of the UNHCR's supplementary Covid-19 appeal, some $55 million is earmarked for restoring education for child refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-refugees-face-long-struggle-for-getting-vaccinated-against-covid19-101616075291210.html
18-03-2021||World||Thailand braces as refugees from Myanmar coup flee to border regions||Hundreds of people have fled Myanmar's towns and cities since last month's military coup and are sheltering in areas controlled by ethnic militias on the Thai border, an official from one of the groups said on Thursday, as Thailand prepared for a surge of refugees.An official from the Karen National Union (KNU), which has been fighting the Myanmar army for decades, said almost a thousand people were sheltering inside KNU-controlled territory.Myanmar's security forces have killed at least 217 people in their crackdown against opposition to the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a civil rights group in Myanmar."Hundreds of people are now in our area," Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said in an interview."Some are strike leaders, some are involved in CDM (civil disobedience), government staff ... deserters of police and military and then also some MPs (members of parliament) and doctors."He said a smaller number had also sought shelter further north, on the border with Shan state, in a region controlled by another ethnic militia.More than two dozen ethnic armed groups are active in Myanmar's borderlands, and the KNU is among those that have condemned the coup and vowed to support the resistance.Padoh Saw Taw Nee said a ceasefire agreement with the government prior to the coup had become "paralysed"."We strongly support CDM movement and people's demonstration," he said, echoing calls for Myanmar to become a democratic federation.A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls seeking comment.Thai authorities are bracing for a surge of refugees and have set aside areas to shelter more than 43,000 people in Mae Sot district, according to plans seen by Reuters.Thai army colonel Prasan Henprasert said border patrols had been increased."If there are clashes then we have to assess the situation and have areas prepared," he said."Based on our experience, many people may cross and go back when the situation is safer because they have their homes on the other side."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-braces-as-refugees-from-myanmar-coup-flee-to-border-regions-101616075726446.html
18-03-2021||World||Covid-19 origin probe: Team could face 'pressure', admits WHO expert||The head of a World Health Organization team working with Chinese colleagues to finish a long-awaited report into the origins of the coronavirus acknowledged its authors could face “pressures” but insisted the final product will have a unanimous green light from all of the team's science-minded members.Peter Ben Embarek, an expert on food safety and diseases that jump from animals to humans, said in interviews on Wednesday and Thursday that the team hopes the report -- now totaling some 280 pages and complete with graphs, dates and annexes -- will be ready for release next week.The report is a first-phase study that is expected to be followed by a more in-depth look as part of guidelines set by Chinese officials and the WHO team.Ben Embarek, who led a 10-person international team of experts that visited China in January and February, acknowledged that political pressures have loomed large over the virus pandemic.“We are in the world that we live in,” he said. “It’s possible that there will be pressures from right to left.”“What we can guarantee is that everyone will be on board” and “unanimous” in their backing of the report once that the text is completed, Ben Embarek said. The “fine-tuning of the text” has centered on scientific issues, while some Chinese-English translation issues were “taking a lot of time,” he said.He said the report was being written by all of the experts and is part of a “long and complex” process.China's Global Times newspaper on Wednesday published an interview with Liang Wannian, the head of the Chinese side of the team, who spoke of alleged political pressures that amounted to “huge disrespect to the work of our scientists.”Liang was quoted as saying some politicians and international media had "insisted on politicizing the scientific issue of tracing the source of COVID-19, regardless of scientific facts, for their own personal gain, arbitrarily misinterpreting the scientific findings and reports of our joint team.”He took pains to emphasize the spirit of cooperation among the scientists and said both sides had cooperated openly and fully throughout the month-long investigation, and that “results of this joint study in China are the consensus of Chinese and foreign experts.”Liang echoed the comments from Ben Embarek about the extended time to publish the report, saying the process required to present a complete and scientifically rigorous report “takes some time.”The team did not find cases of COVID-19 before December 8, 2019, he said.Ben Embarek cited the need to investigate the possible role in the pandemic of the local trade in wild animal products from farms in and around southern China in 2019 and beyond to a market in the city of Wuhan, which could have been a way that the virus entered a large city that was tied into global supply chains.“We don’t know yet the origins of the pandemic," he said, adding that cold-chain transmission, including through frozen food packaging, was a “possible route” of spread, but that the issue requires further exploration.Liang promoted Chinese government claims of other sources of the pandemic saying that cold chain transmission “plays an important part in the origin and transmission of the epidemic.” The international team left open the possibility of the cold chain playing a role in the transmission.It took many months for the U.N. team to arrange a visit to China with Chinese authorities. Critics say the delay cost valuable time in efforts to unearth the origins of the pandemic, which has led to at least 2.6 million reported deaths.On Friday, Chen Xu, the Chinese ambassador to U.N. organizations in Geneva, said the WHO had selected the team's members who did the work with Chinese counterparts, appearing to suggest no political influence by China was exerted.“We have our hands off, like the officials from the WHO as well,” Chen said, alluding to the U.N. agency's secretariat. "Let the scientists (do) their work.”China’s government detained some doctors who sought to raise the alarm about the outbreak, which is believed to have originated in or near Wuhan in late 2019.WHO repeatedly praised the Chinese government’s early response, even though recordings of private meetings obtained by The Associated Press exposed how top officials at the U.N. health agency were frustrated at China’s lack of cooperation.___Huizhong Wu in Taipei, Taiwan contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-probe-team-could-face-pressure-admits-who-expert-101616075622571.html
18-03-2021||World||Canada suffers slowest population growth since World War I||Canada’s population grew last year at the slowest pace in more than a century as Covid-related restrictions curbed immigration.The nation’s population rose by just 0.4% in 2020 to 38,048,738, Statistics Canada reported Thursday in Ottawa. That was the slowest annual growth since 1916, during World War I. In absolute numbers, the 149,461 annual increase was the smallest since 1945.A drop in international migration from closed borders was the main contributor. Canada recorded 184,624 immigrants in 2020, down by almost half from 2019. Also, more non-permanent residents left the country last year than came in, resulting in a loss of 86,535 people. That’s the largest net loss of foreign residents such as workers and students on record.Over the past five years, immigration has accounted for more than three quarters of Canada’s total population growth but that figure dropped to 58% in 2020. Immigration has been a key pillar of the country’s overall economic growth, impacting everything from the housing market to banking services.The number of deaths last year also increased to a record, surpassing 300,000 for the first time in the country’s history. Covid-19 was responsible for one in 20 deaths, the report said. The natural rate increase in population -- the difference between births and deaths -- also fell to 62,834, the smallest increase since at least 1922.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-suffers-slowest-population-growth-since-world-war-i-101616073703100.html
18-03-2021||World||Europe’s Covid vaccination drive running at half the pace of US: Report||The European Union’s Covid vaccination drive showed no sign of picking up the pace over the past week and is still running at less than half the pace of immunizations in the US, according to weekly figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The 29 countries in the bloc and wider European Economic Area took delivery of 9.9 million doses over the week through March 14 and administered 9.1 million shots over the period, the ECDC said Thursday. That equates to about 1.3 million vaccinations a day compared to 2.5 million a day in the U.S., where the population is only about 70% as large.The proportion of adults in the bloc who have received their first dose now stands at 9.8%, up 1.6 percentage points from the week before. The number rose by 1.7 points over the previous seven days. The data show that 4.3% of adults are now fully vaccinated, which has improved by 0.6 percentage points, the same increase as the week before.Politicians across the bloc have said the program must speed up significantly if the EU is to meet its target of vaccinating at least 70% of people by the end of the summer and for restrictive economic measures to be eased. The report showed that the bloc has received 12.5 million doses that have yet to be administered, 1 million more than in the previous week.“I’m not too concerned about the number,” Sam Fazeli, a pharmaceuticals analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a telephone interview. “You almost want to have some extra doses available, in case the next consignment doesn’t arrive and you need to give second doses. They should always have a stockpile.”Fazeli estimated, based on conversations with pharmacists, that it may take as long as two weeks for shots to be administered once officials have taken delivery of the vaccines from the drug companies.A separate EU document seen by Bloomberg suggested the backlog may be as much as 20 million shots. The EU has received about 70 million shots and administered around 50 million through March 16, the document showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europes-covid-vaccination-drive-running-at-half-the-pace-of-us-report-101616073274122.html
18-03-2021||World||'Time to bury the past and move forward', says Pak's General Bajwa on ties with India||Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said on Thursday that it was time for India and Pakistan to "bury the past and move forward" as he asserted that the peace between the two neighbours would help to "unlock" the potential of South and Central Asia.Addressing a session of the first-ever Islamabad Security Dialogue here, Gen Bajwa also said that the potential for regional peace and development always remained hostage to the disputes and issues between Pakistan and India - the two "nuclear-armed neighbours"."We feel it is time to bury the past and move forward," he said, adding that the responsibility for a meaningful dialogue rested with India.India last month said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.India has also told Pakistan that "talks and terror" cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India."Our neighbour will have to create a conducive environment, particularly” in Kashmir, Gen Bajwa said, adding that any effort to improve ties without addressing the core issue would be vulnerable to external political factors."The Kashmir issue is at the heart of this. It is important to understand that without the resolution of the Kashmir dispute through peaceful means, the process will always remain susceptible to derailment to politically motivated bellicosity,” he said.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Gen Bajwa’s remarks came a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan made a similar statement at the same venue.Prime Minister Khan said on Wednesday said India will be benefitted economically by having peace with Pakistan as it will enable New Delhi to directly access the resource-rich Central Asia region through Pakistani territory."India will have to take the first step. Unless they do so, we cannot do much," Khan said while delivering the inaugural address at the launch of the two-day Dialogue.Khan said that having a direct route to the Central Asian region will economically benefit India. Central Asia is rich in oil and gas.Central Asia, in the modern context, generally includes five resource-rich countries -- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Gen Bajwa also that peace between Pakistan and India would help to "unlock the potential of South and Central Asia" by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia.Though, both Prime Minister Khan and Gen Bajwa didn’t specify the minimum steps that India should take but many experts in Pakistan believe that some positive measures in Kashmir could ease pressure on the Pakistan government before entering into talks or restoring the normal diplomatic ties.Gen Bajwa also talked about poverty which he said was linked with the regional tension that had hindered the regional connectivity and integration."Despite being impoverished, we end up spending a lot of our money on defence, which naturally comes at the expense of human development," he said.However, he added that Pakistan was resisting the temptation to become part of the arms race or increase defence budget despite rising security challenges."This has not been easy, especially when you live in a hostile and unstable neighbourhood. But having said that, let me say that we are ready to improve our environment by resolving all our outstanding issues with our neighbours through dialogue in a dignified and peaceful manner," he said.India and Pakistan had announced on February 25 that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country.Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India's war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories in August, 2019.Talking about the concept of national security, Gen Bajwa said that it was not just about protecting countries from an external and internal threat."Today, the leading drivers of change in the world are demography, economy and technology…However, one issue that remains central to this concept is economic security and cooperation,” he said.He said that since national security involved ensuring human security, national progress and development, it was not solely the function of the armed forces and required a national effort to safeguard a nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-to-bury-the-past-and-move-forward-says-pak-s-general-bajwa-on-ties-with-india-101616072755667.html

18-03-2021||World||US jobless claims rise to 770,000, layoffs remain high||The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose last week to 770,000, a sign that layoffs remain high even as much of the US economy is steadily recovering from the coronavirus recession.Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims climbed from 725,000 the week before. The numbers have dropped sharply since the depths of the recession last spring but still show that employers in some industries continue to lay off workers. Before the pandemic struck, applications for unemployment aid had never topped 700,000 in any one week.The four-week average of claims, which smooths out weekly variations, dropped to 746,000, the lowest since late November.A total of 4.1 million people are continuing to collect traditional state unemployment benefits, down 18,000 from the previous week. Including separate federal programs that are intended to help workers displaced by the health crisis, 18.2 million Americans were receiving some form of jobless aid in the week of Feb. 27, down by 1.9 million from the week before.The continuing layoffs are occurring even as the overall job market has shown solid improvement. Last month, U.S. employers added a robust 379,000 jobs, the most since October and a sign that the economy is strengthening as consumers spend more and states and cities ease business restrictions.With vaccinations accelerating, hopes are rising that Americans will increasingly travel, shop, eat out and spend freely after a year of virus-induced restraint.President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package is also expected to help accelerate growth, especially with most adults this week receiving $1,400 stimulus checks that should fuel more spending. An extension of $300 weekly unemployment benefits into early September will provide support, too, along with money for vaccines and treatments, school re-openings, state and local governments and ailing industries ranging from airlines to concert halls.Yet the nation is still 9.5 million short of the number of jobs it had in February 2020. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested Wednesday after the Fed's latest policy meeting that the overall economic outlook remained cloudy.“The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain,” Powell said at a news conference after the Fed signaled that it expects to keep its key interest rate near zero through 2023 despite some solid economic gains and concerns about rising inflation pressures.By most barometers, business activity in the economy's vast and hard-hit service sector is still far from normal. The data firm Womply said, for example, that as of early last week 63% of movie theaters, galleries and other entertainment venues were closed. So were 39% of bars, 32% of gyms and other sports and recreation businesses and 30% of restaurants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-rise-to-770-000-layoffs-remain-high-101616072445032.html
18-03-2021||World||Shortfall in vaccine deliveries in UK will delay jabs for those below 50: Report||British health authorities say Covid-19 vaccinations for people under age 50 may be delayed for up to a month amid a shortfall in supply, partly due to reduced deliveries from the Serum Institute of India.Britain’s National Health Service told public health officials Thursday that vaccine supplies available for first doses would be “significantly constrained” beginning March 29. As a result, people under 50 shouldn’t get shots unless they have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk, according to a letter from Emily Lawson, the NHS’s chief commercial officer, and Dr. Nikita Kanani, medical director for primary care.Doctors had expected to begin vaccinating younger people next month, but that will have to be pushed back until May, said Dr. Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners and a GP in east London.“It was disappointing news when we heard yesterday that the supplies weren’t going to be available during April,” he told the BBC. “It’s a massively successful program overall, and this is a bit of a setback.”The Department of Health and Social Care said the delay won’t prevent the government from meeting its target of delivering a first dose of vaccine to everyone over 50 by mid-April and to all adults by July 31.The shortfall is due in part to smaller than expected deliveries from the Serum Institute of India, which was expected to supply Britain with 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine this month. However the Serum Institute maintains that there were no “stipulated timelines” for delivery of the vaccines.The institute said Thursday that 5 million doses have been delivered “and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunization program in India.”Britain is using vaccines developed by US drugmaker Pfizer and Anglo-Swedish rival AstraZeneca. More than 25 million people across the UK, or almost 38% of the population, have received at least one dose of vaccine so far.Robert Jenrick, the minister for housing, communities and local government, said the government has always expected fluctuations in vaccine supplies because of the difficulties in ramping up production. No single company is responsible for the current shortfall, he said.“There are multiple manufacturers around the world who are experiencing supply issues at the moment,” Jenrick told the BBC. “It would not be right for me to pin blame on any one manufacturer, factory or country. That is not the case.”Dr. Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the short-term disruption in supplies could have knock-on effects that last for months, including potential delays in lifting Covid-19 restrictions.“By pushing back the under-50s first doses, their second doses are also being pushed back,” he said. “If full vaccination becomes required for holidays abroad or even more mundane things like going to the cinema, millions of younger people may end up being excluded from participating for the whole summer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shortfall-in-vaccine-deliveries-in-uk-will-delay-jabs-for-those-below-50-report-101616071452984.html
18-03-2021||World||Europe, with millions of doses unused, is divided on export ban||European Union governments are divided over a controversial proposal to withhold vaccine exports to the UK, even as the bloc sits on about 20 million unused doses.Around 70 million shots have been delivered to countries in the EU, with 50 million of those already administered, according to an EU document seen by Bloomberg. About 15 million of the used shots were second doses.EU ambassadors on Wednesday discussed a new proposal by the European Commission that would restrict exports of vaccines to countries -- the UK in particular -- that don’t reciprocate or that already have high vaccination rates, according to a diplomatic note seen by Bloomberg. The UK is the largest recipient of doses made in the EU, receiving 10 million of the 42 million exported shots.“All options are on the table -- we are in the crisis of the century,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday. “We have to make sure that Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible.”EU members, including Italy and France, said they were open to exploring the vaccine export ban while others, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, urged caution and warned about the possible negative impact on European companies, according to the note.“What is obvious is that all of the vaccines which are currently being deployed require a second dose and therefore it is only natural that you would have a stock of vaccines which are in reserve in order to provide people with the second injection that they require,” European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said at the briefing on Thursday. “This is what makes comparisons in terms of vaccination rates difficult.”Any decision on the issue would ultimately be for EU leaders, who are set to meet next week.The discussion comes ahead of an announcement from the European Medicines Agency on Thursday, when the drugs regulator will make a decision on the safety of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. Some of the EU’s largest countries suspended use of the shot due to concern about blood clotting.The EU is struggling to overcome a slow start to its inoculation campaign and has committed to immunizing 70% of adults by the end of September. The bloc has administered 12 doses per 100 people, less than a third of the UK, according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. The US has given 34.A shortage in deliveries from AstraZeneca is due to low yields from factories in the Netherlands and Belgium and the company is trying to tap into its international supply chain, including from India, to make up for that, according to the note. Astra is now expected to deliver 30 million shots to the EU in the first quarter, less than half what it initially committed.The Astra vaccine is one of four approved in the EU. The bloc expects 360 million deliveries from all providers in the second quarter, almost four times as many as this quarter.The new vaccination numbers underscore the disparate rates of inoculations across the EU. Malta has administered 24 doses per 100 people, according to the document. Bulgaria, Croatia and Latvia have all given fewer than 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-with-millions-of-doses-unused-is-divided-on-export-ban-101616069975362.html
18-03-2021||World||'Takes one to know one': Vladimir Putin on Joe Biden's 'killer' remark||Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that US President Joe Biden’s remarks about him reflect US own past and current problems.Biden was asked in an interview whether he thought Russian President Vladimir Putin is a killer and said “I do.” Russia on Wednesday announced it’s recalling its ambassador in Washington for consultations.Asked about Biden’s remarks during a video call with residents of Crimea marking the anniversary of its 2014 annexation from Ukraine, Putin charged that they reflect the United States’ own troubled past.The Russian leader pointed at America's past history of slaughtering Native Americans and slavery, arguing that the painful legacy has weighed on the United States.“Otherwise where would the Black Lives Matter movement come from,” he said.He added that Russia would still cooperate with the United States where it answers Moscow’s interests.Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov deplored what he called “very bad remarks by the US president” that made it clear that “he doesn't want to normalize relations.”“We will proceed accordingly,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters, noting that "there was nothing like that in history.” He wouldn't answer if Russia could go as far as to rupture diplomatic ties with the United States.Konstantin Kosachev, a deputy speaker of the Russian parliament's upper house, said Biden’s “boorish statement” marks a watershed.“Such assessments are inadmissible for a statesman of his rank,” Kosachev said. “Such statements are unacceptable under any circumstances. They inevitably lead to a sharp exacerbation of our bilateral ties.”Kosachev warned that Russia’s response wouldn’t be limited to recalling the Russian ambassador “if the American side fails to offer explanation and excuse.” He wouldn’t elaborate on what other action the Kremlin may take.While announcing the decision to recall the Russian ambassador in Washington, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova blamed the US for bringing bilateral ties to a “dead end,” adding that “we are interested in preventing their irreversible degradation, if the Americans are aware of the associated risks.”Commenting on the Russian move Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki emphasized that “we will be direct, we will speak out on areas where we have concerns, and it will certainly be, as the president said last night — certainly, the Russians will be held accountable for the actions that they have taken.”The exchange of tough statements comes on the heels of a declassified report from the US national intelligence director’s office that finds President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to help Donald Trump in last November’s presidential election.“(Putin) will pay a price,” Biden said in the interview, asked about the declassified report.Russia's relations with the United States and the European Union already have plunged to post-Cold War lows after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, election meddling, hacking attacks and, most recently, the jailing of Russia's opposition leader Alexei Navalny that followed his poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. The Russian authorities rejected the accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-reacts-to-us-president-joe-biden-s-killer-remarks-101616070000920.html
18-03-2021||World||Italian PM Draghi says AstraZeneca verdict won’t change country's vaccine plans||Prime Minister Mario Draghi pledged to accelerate Italy’s vaccination campaign independently of the outcome of a European review of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine.The premier, visiting the northern region of Lombardy, the original epicenter of the pandemic in Europe, said that the decision to suspend use of the vaccine taken by several countries was “temporary and precautionary.”Referring to an assessment due by the European Medicines Agency on the Astra vaccine due later Thursday, Draghi vowed that, “whatever its decision, the vaccination campaign will continue with the same intensity, the same objectives.”Italy currently plans to triple the pace of inoculation to half million people per day by mid-April, reaching an 80% coverage by end-September. So far, Italy has administered 7 million vaccine doses, with only 3.5% of the population fully vaccinated.“The increase in the supplies of some vaccines will help to compensate the delay by other pharmaceutical companies,” Draghi said.Day of RemembranceThe premier earlier laid a wreath at the cemetery in Bergamo, one of the most-hit cities during the pandemic’s first outbreak last spring. Army trucks were used to transport coffins of virus victims when local services including the hospital morgue and the crematorium could no longer cope with the death toll.Draghi’s trip marks a national day of remembrance for virus victims. He spoke at a site dedicated to people who lost loved ones, and helped to plant a lime tree, the first of 850 trees at the so-called Memory Forest.The ex-central banker said his government had already taken “incisive decisions concerning the companies which do not respect commitments,” after his administration and the EU halted the export of a vaccines batch to Australia.Like most of the country, Lombardy which includes the financial capital Milan, has seen reimposed lockdown measures as the pandemic surges while a vaccination campaign stutters.Italy registered 23,059 new virus cases on Wednesday, compared to 20,396 the previous day. The country has seen more than 3 million cases and more than 100,000 deaths since the beginning of the outbreak last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-draghi-says-astrazeneca-verdict-won-t-change-country-s-vaccine-plans-101616069240146.html
18-03-2021||World||What now for North Korea and US talks?||Almost two months after Joe Biden took office, North Korea has finally acknowledged the new US president. However, unlike with his predecessors, it wasn't with a missile, but a vow to keep ignoring Washington.AFP takes a look at the country's intentions and what its next moves might be.What does North Korea want?US officials say they have attempted to reach out to Pyongyang through "several channels" in recent weeks, with no response.Dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington has been deadlocked since the collapse of the 2019 Hanoi summit North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then US president Donald Trump over sanctions relief.The North issued two separate statements by top officials this week, with first vice foreign minister Choe Son Hui demanding the US withdraw its "hostile policy" against her country."It had better drop the cheap trick by which it tries to use the DPRK-US contact as a means for gaining time," she said.Park Won-gon, a professor of North Korea studies at Ewha Womans University, told AFP: "North Korea is making it clear that it will not come to talks unless the US offers concessions first."But by not laying out a specific precondition to talks, he added, Pyongyang was "showing flexibility".Why is it speaking out now?North Korea has not directly addressed the new US administration until this week. The timing is clearly linked to the visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin to Asia."It's a way for Pyongyang to set the tone without overtly appealing for the Biden administration's attention," Soo Kim, a former CIA analyst now with the RAND Corporation, told AFP."The regime is also trying to reiterate that it calls the shots in the game, lest anyone has forgotten," she said.Will Pyongyang start testing missiles again?The first missile test after president Barack Obama's January 2009 inauguration came in early April, while Donald Trump had to contend with a launch only three weeks after being sworn in.The North has made rapid progress with its nuclear and missile programmes under Kim and unveiled a new submarine-launched ballistic missile at a military parade in January.Kim abandoned his self-declared moratorium on nuclear tests or ICBM launches in January 2020, but even so Pyongyang has confined itself to short-range missile tests since then, the last of them a year ago.Speculation about North Korean missile launches emerges regularly, but it could also choose lower-level actions such as static engine tests.Go Myong-hyun of the Asan Institute of Policy Studies said Pyongyang was waiting for the right timing to "ensure legitimacy for provocation".How are things in North Korea?The coronavirus pandemic has added to the pressures on the North, with Pyongyang closing its borders and blockading itself far more effectively than even the most hawkish backer of sanctions could ever hope to achieve.Trade has plummeted and several foreign embassies withdrawn their staff.Pyongyang insists it has not had a single case of the disease -- observers doubt the claim -- but the self-isolation has put further strain on the economy, along with sanctions and summer floods."They are in a tough situation for sure," said scholar Park. "That in turn could heighten their need for a breakthrough with Washington."Why hasn't Pyongyang mentioned Joe Biden yet?Pyongyang is notorious for its nasty name-calling of US presidents: it called Barack Obama a "monkey" and referred to Donald Trump was a "mentally-deranged dotard" at the height of tensions in 2017.Before Biden was nominated as candidate, the North's state media called him "a rabid dog" who should be beaten to death, but it has not even mentioned the new US president by name since his election."When North Korea mentions a president by name, it must be clear whether it is insulting him or praising him," said Go, adding Pyongyang was still assessing the new administration.The North's rhetoric has so far been relatively restrained, and Soo Kim said it may hesitate to provoke a confrontation that would result in a "rigid and inflexible" US stance."With four years remaining of Biden's term, I don't think Kim wants to take this big of a leap just yet," she said.Does Pyongyang miss Donald Trump?Trump's unorthodox approach to foreign policy saw him trade insults and threats of war with the North Korean leader before an extraordinary diplomatic bromance and a series of summits and meetings.Analysts say Pyongyang likely has mixed feelings over the Republican.Trump's absence ruled out any possibilities of "gratuitous summits", said former CIA analyst Soo Kim."Perhaps not Trump the person, but the fact that dealing with the US was a cakewalk under the Trump administration," she added.The North at one time saw Trump as an "opportunity for a breakthrough", noted professor Park, but struggled to deal with his unpredictability."In contrast, Biden's policy is very predictable," Park told AFP."Whether they prefer an unpredictable Trump or a predictable Biden is hard to put your finger on."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-now-for-north-korea-and-us-talks-101616063545883.html
18-03-2021||World||France to announce new coronavirus restrictions in Paris region||France is set to announce new coronavirus restrictions on Thursday, including a potential lockdown in the Paris region and in the north of the country, as the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units spikes.“We will make the decisions we need to make,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday while visiting the hospital of Poissy and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris. He added the new measures will be “pragmatic, proportionated and targeted.”Prime Minister Jean Castex is scheduled to detail the restrictions on Thursday evening.The virus is rapidly spreading in the Paris region, where the rate of infection has reached over 420 per 100,000 inhabitants and ICUs are closed to saturation. France’s nationwide infection rate is about 250 per 100,000.As during previous infection peaks, health authorities have organized transfers of critically ill patients to less-affected regions to ease some of the pressure on hospitals in Paris and in northern and southern France.People in France have been under a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. nationwide curfew for two months.French President Emmanuel Macron’s government had hoped the measure would prevent the country of 67 million people from the economic, social and psychological impact of another lockdown.Yet confirmed virus cases and ICU demand both have risen steadily in recent weeks. The more contagious virus variant first identified in the U.K. accounts for most cases, and around 250 people are dying each day from the virus.“We see people dying, we see people suffering....There’s a difficult situation.. and we don’t feel an appropriate response,” Enrique Casalino, head of the emergency service at Bichat hospital à Paris, told French broadcaster LCI.Government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said Wednesday that the new measures could include lockdowns in the Paris region, which is home to 12 million people, and in Hauts-de-France, the region bordering Belgium in northern France.“The localized strategy remains the good strategy. It enables to limit precisely and proportionally the expansion of the virus," he said.Two other areas previously were put under targeted, tougher restrictions. In those regions, around Nice on the French Riviera, and Dunkirk on the northern coast, weekend lockdowns have been added on top of the nightly curfew.The prime minister on Thursday also is expected to address France's decision on Monday to suspend use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which authorities hope to relaunch quickly. The European Medicines Agency is scheduled to release Thursday initial results of its investigations into whether the vaccine is connected to reports of blood clots in some recipients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-announce-new-coronavirus-restrictions-in-paris-region-101616067838924.html
18-03-2021||World||China 'deeply concerned' about anti-Asian violence in US||China called on the US to take measures to stem violence against people of Asian heritage after eight people were killed at Atlanta-area massage parlors.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Thursday that violence against Asians in the US was “outrageous and distressing,” leaving China “deeply concerned.”American authorities should “take practical measures to resolve issues of racism and racial discrimination at home, and earnestly safeguard and protect the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens in the United States,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.The 21-year-old suspect in Tuesday's shootings reportedly told police the attack was not racially motivated. He claimed that he targeted the spas because of a “sex addiction.” Six of those slain were identified as being of Asian descent and seven were women.South Korea’s Foreign Ministry has said four of the victims who died were women of Korean descent, while two of the other victims appeared to have Chinese names.China has long countered accusations of human rights abuses under the ruling Communist Party by pointing to racism and violence in America. Recent attacks on Asians in the US are partly attributed to anti-Chinese sentiment arising from the coronavirus pandemic that was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.While giving no names, Zhao said some American politicians had “instigated racism and hatred, and condoned discrimination against Chinese students in the United States.“The United States should take practical measures to resolve issues of racism and racial discrimination at home, and earnestly safeguard and protect the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens in the United States," Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deeply-concerned-about-anti-asian-violence-in-us-101616068627007.html
18-03-2021||World||Google pledges $7 billion investment to create jobs in US||Google announced a $7 billion investment in the US that will create at least 10,000 new jobs this year, a drop from the $10 billion it promised it would invest in 2020 before the pandemic swept the country.The Alphabet Inc. unit is investing in offices and data centers, including more than $1 billion in its home state of California, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in a statement on Thursday. Part of the investment will be used for data center expansions in Nebraska, South Carolina, Virginia, Nevada and Texas, Pichai said.In early 2020, Google said it would invest over $10 billion into offices and data centers in a range of states, including California, New York and Texas. This was also a drop from the $13 billion it pledged in 2019 to invest in order to expand in rural areas such as Nevada, Nebraska and Oklahoma.However, in April last year Pichai said Google would slow hiring for the remainder of 2020, “recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like data centers and machines.” Google had 135,300 staff at the end of 2020, and has said it will let employees work from home until July 2021.Alphabet broke out figures for its Google Cloud business for the first time in February. The unit had an operating loss of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, far behind its rival Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider, which generated fourth-quarter operating income of $3.56 billion.The Mountain View, California-based company revealed the number on Tuesday in a statement. For 2020, the cloud division lost $5.6 billion, Alphabet said.“An important element of our operating loss is that we have been building out our organization ahead of revenue, and that includes our product portfolio, the network of data centers,” Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. This will help the company pursue this large market opportunity, she added.In 2020, Google’s services drove $426 billion of economic activity for more than 2 million American businesses, nonprofits and other entities, the company said, citing its 2020 US Economic Impact Report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-pledges-7-billion-investment-to-create-jobs-in-us-101616067896509.html

The couple is living at Blair House, near the White House.The Texas man was detained by US Secret Service on Wednesday following an intelligence bulletin, a spokesperson for Washington's Metropolitan Police was quoted as saying by CNN.Police said the officers arrested and charged Paul Murray, of San Antonio, and that a rifle and ammunition were recovered from his vehicle, it said.A police report shows officers allege Murray was in possession of an "AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, 113 rounds of unregistered ammunition, and five 30 round magazines."According to police, he's been charged with several counts: carrying a dangerous weapon, carrying a rifle or shotgun outside of a business, possession of unregistered ammunition and possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device.The US Secret Service told CNN in a statement that Uniformed Division officers detained the man before Metropolitan Police arrived on the scene.A Secret Service official said none of the agency's protectees were at the residence at the time of the incident.Violent pro-Trump supporters, fuelled by the belief that President Biden and Harris had stolen the election from Donald Trump, stormed the Capitol on January 6, threatening lawmakers and law enforcement officers. Five people, including a police officer, were killed in the violence.Since the violent incidents, security and intelligence officials have often warned about the dangers of homegrown extremism in America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heavily-armed-texas-man-arrested-outside-kamala-harris-official-residence-101616066933760.html

The district made no admission of wrongdoing or liability. The money will be paid by the district's insurance carrier.Parsons was the high school's yearbook adviser when she said a secretary acting on behalf of the principal ordered her in 2017 to remove "Trump Make America Great Again” and make it appear as if the student was wearing a plain navy blue T-shirt."That has to go,” the suit alleged Parsons was told.Parsons, who said she voted for Trump in 2016, said she was made a scapegoat and received death threats. She was suspended with pay after the incident. She claimed she regularly complained about being forced to alter photos.Parsons will receive about $204,000 and the remainder of the settlement will cover attorney fees, according to the agreement.The school district reissued the yearbook with the original unaltered photo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-jersey-district-pays-325k-in-donald-trump-yearbook-censorship-101616065852316.html
18-03-2021||World||US president Joe Biden does not want to improve ties with Russia: Kremlin||Russia said Thursday US President Joe Biden had no interest in improving ties with Russia after he referred to Vladimir Putin as a "killer", sparking the biggest crisis in years between the former Cold War rivals.Russia's relationship with the West has eroded over a spate of disagreements, but relations plunged to new depths Wednesday after Biden agreed Putin was a "killer" in a US television interview."These statements from the president of the United States are very bad," Putin's spokesman Dmirty Peskov told reporters."It is clear that he does not want to get the relationship with our country back on track, and we will proceed from that," he added.In a swift response to Biden's comments, Moscow on Wednesday evening recalled its ambassador in the United States for urgent consultations -- an unprecedented move in recent Russian diplomacy.Its embassy in Washington said ambassador Anatoly Antonov was set to depart for Russia on Saturday to discuss "ways to rectify Russia-US ties, which are in crisis".Peskov on Thursday said that Putin would receive Antonov "if need be", but declined to say if Moscow was ready to sever diplomatic ties with the United States altogether.In the interview with ABC News on Wednesday Biden said Putin will "pay a price" for trying to undermine Biden's candidacy in the US election in 2020.Asked if he thought Putin is "a killer", Biden said, "I do".His comments stood in stark contrast with his predecessor, Donald Trump, who was often accused of going soft on Putin.'Watershed moment'Commenting on Moscow's decision to recall Antonov, the embassy warned that Biden's comments had pushed bilateral ties to the brink."Certain ill-considered statements of high-ranking US officials have put the already excessively confrontational relations under the threat of collapse," it said.Moscow and Washington share a deep and mutual distrust that flared after the Kremlin's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014.The G7 group of leading economic powers said on Thursday it would not accept Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, in a statement marking seven years since the takeover."We unequivocally denounce Russia's temporary occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. Russia's attempts to legitimise it are not, and will not, be recognised," it said.Washington's ties with Moscow deteriorated further over Russia's alleged meddling in the US elections in 2016 and more recently when the West concluded that Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was poisoned last summer by Novichok, a Soviet-designed nerve agent.But the two countries have continued to work together on issues of shared interest, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Afghanistan peace process.Biden's comments were aired as the US Commerce Department announced it was toughening export restrictions imposed on Russia as punishment for Navalny's poisoning in August.Konstantin Kosachev, a deputy head at the Russian parliament's upper house, on Thursday described Biden's comments as "a watershed moment" and demanded that Washington apologise."Such statements are unacceptable in any circumstances and will inevitably sharply damage our bilateral ties," he wrote on Facebook.Over the past few decades, Russia has rarely recalled its ambassadors.Moscow last summoned its envoy in the US in 1998 over a Western bombing campaign in Iraq.In 2014, during the fallout after the annexation of Crimea, Putin refused to recall a Washington envoy even after then US President Barack Obama said that the Russian leader would pay for his Ukraine policies.Putin at the time said recalling an envoy would be a "measure of last resort".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-does-not-want-to-improve-ties-with-russia-kremlin-101616065778760.html
18-03-2021||World||Explained: What's the Senate filibuster in US and why change it?||It's not that different from the movies. President Joe Biden said the Senate should operate like it did in the “old days,” with senators forced to stand up and speak all day and night if they plan to object to his legislative agenda with a filibuster.Changing the filibuster rules is an idea backed by some Senate Democrats eager to advance Biden's agenda in the evenly split 50-50 Senate. But Republicans are warning Democrats off any changes.Here's a look at how the filibuster works in the Senate.What's a filibuster?The filibuster is among the Senate’s “most distinctive procedural features,” according to the Congressional Research Service.The Senate has a longstanding practice of allowing any one senator to object to the proceedings, what's generally referred to as a filibuster that can halt action or votes.Senators have famously stood at their desks for hours making their case, as the character played by Jimmy Stewart did in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” or as South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond did to stall the 1957 Civil Rights Act.Today, senators can merely signal their intent to object, even privately, and that's enough for Senate leaders to take action. Leaders sometimes just drop the issue from floor consideration. At other times, they push ahead, taking cumbersome steps to cut off the filibuster and move forward with the proceedings.How to end a filibuster?Over time, senators grew tired of the endless filibusters and set rules for ending debate.At the start of the 20th century, a two-thirds vote was needed to end a filibuster. By 1975, the Senate agreed to lower it to 60 votes.Once debate is brought to a close, senators can move forward with consideration of the measure at hand, amendments or even final votes.What's the problem?As the country, and Congress, has grown more partisan, the filibuster has become a key weapon in what is often described as a procedural arms race in the Senate.Year by year, more and more senators threaten to wage filibusters to block legislation. Overcoming filibusters can take days, if not weeks.Even without a senator holding the floor, filibusters have forced senators into all-night and weekend votes to advance legislation, as happened during passage of the Affordable Care Act.“Filibusters and the prospect of filibusters shape much of the way in which the Senate does its work,” the CRS report said.Can the Senate change the filibuster?It takes 51 votes to change the Senate rules, a tall order at most times but especially in the now evenly split 50-50 Senate. Democrats hold a slim majority because Vice President Kamala Harris can be a tie-breaking vote.But senators have changed the filibuster rules before.Fed up with the Republicans stonewalling Barack Obama's executive and judicial branch nominees, Democrats led by then-Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada changed the rules to set a simple 51-vote threshold for confirming people in those positions. 'Republicans under Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky went a step further, eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, which allowed Donald Trump's three high-court justices to be confirmed.While several Democrats and advocacy groups call for ridding the Senate of the filibuster on legislation, there does not appear to be enough support from Democratic senators at this time to do so.Back to ‘talking’ filibuster?Biden supports a return to the “old days," as he put it, of the talking filibuster, forcing senators to stand at their desks and articulate their opposition to the proceedings, as was the practice when he first joined the Senate decades ago.“You’ve got to work for the filibuster,” he said in an ABC News interview that aired Wednesday.The idea has support from Democrats who see it as a possible alternative to fully ending the filibuster practice. But it still poses risks, and Democratic leaders have been reluctant to move toward that option.Several Republican senators, particularly those considering running for president in 2024, might see political advantage to seizing the floor to rail endlessly against White House priorities. The filibusters could also stall action on other Democratic priorities, including Biden's nominees.McConnell has warned of a “scorched earth” reaction if Democrats eliminate the filibuster.At the same time, many Democrats are ready to take that chance to end the filibuster, realizing their slim majority is fragile, and Republicans might do away with it anyway to advance their priorities the next time they control the Senate and the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-s-the-senate-filibuster-and-why-change-it-101616065260381.html
18-03-2021||World||Australian police boss faces backlash over sexual consent app proposal||A senior Australian policeman suggested on Thursday a phone app be developed to document sexual consent in a bid to improve conviction rates in sex crime cases.New South Wales state Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said dating apps have brought couples together and the same technology could also provide clarity on the question of consent.“Technology doesn’t fix everything, but ... it plays such a big role in people meeting at the moment. I’m just suggesting: is it part of the solution?” Fuller said.Fuller said the number of sexual assaults reported in Australia’s most populous state was increasing while a prosecution success rate of only 2% stemming from those reports showed the system was failing.“Consent can’t be implied,” Fuller wrote in News Corp. newspapers. “Consent must be active and ongoing throughout a sexual encounter.”Responses to the consent app suggestion have been largely negative or skeptical.State Premier Gladys Berejiklian congratulated Fuller on “taking a leadership position on having the conversation” about the sexual assault problem, but declined to share her opinion on the app.Lesley-Anne Ey, a University of South Australia expert on harmful sexual behavior involving children, said she didn’t think the app would work.“I don’t think they’re going to interrupt the romance to put details into an app,” Ey told Australian Broadcasting Corp.Catharine Lumby, a Sydney University specialist in ethics and accountability, described the app as a quick-fix that misunderstood the circumstances of sexual assaults."Fundamentally what we are now having a reckoning with is the fact that there is a very small minority of men in this society who are opportunists, who make the decision to sexually assault women,” Lumby said.“They don’t care where, how or why they do it. They will take the opportunity and I’m sure they are more than capable of manipulating technology,” Lumby said.More than 100,000 women protested in rallies across Australia on Monday demanding justice while calling out misogyny and dangerous workplace cultures.The public anger erupted after the Australian attorney general denied an allegation that he raped a 16-year-old girl 33 years ago, and a former government staffer alleged that she was raped two years ago by a colleague in a minister’s Parliament House office.Fuller said his suggestion could gain popularity in time.“To be honest with you, the app idea could be the worst idea I have in 2021, but the reality is in five years, perhaps it won’t be,” he said. “If you think about dating 10 years ago, this concept of single people swiping left and right was a term that we didn’t even know.”A consent app similar to Fuller’s proposal was launched in Denmark last month.

Indeed, the US currently does not have a permanent ambassador in Pakistan as relations plumb their lowest ebb in two decades, or since the beginning of the Afghanistan war, reported Asia Times.The prospect of an end to the war in Afghanistan and the beginning of a new era of US-China confrontation has created a geopolitical conundrum that Pakistan is struggling to crack.With Pakistan now seen as a strong economic and military ally of China, the question confronting Pakistani policymakers is: can Pakistan afford to jump on the US anti-China bandwagon and can it manufacture a non-terrorism-related geopolitical reason to revive its ties with the US? Sheikh questioned.Not only has China invested billions of dollars in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructure and related projects in Pakistan, it has also in recent years become the country's top supplier of weapons systems.With Pakistan and China deepening their strategic ties, the Biden administration's drive against China is a serious predicament whereby Pakistan cannot readily take sides, reported Asia Times.While Pakistan's economic ties with China have gathered apace, it still maintains import trade links to the US. By taking an overly pro-China policy, Islamabad would risk its trade and still-substantial economic assistance from the US.Whereas China is now Pakistan's biggest economic partner via the billions invested in CPEC projects, the US is still Pakistan's top destination for exports, which include textile and agricultural products, said Sheikh.Meanwhile, despite China's multi-billion-dollar investments, Pakistan's economy is still in the doldrums and in persistent need of US-led International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout packages.The IMF is known to view China's CPEC investments in Pakistan as a debt trap. As such, IMF packages have been linked with requirements of making the CPEC more transparent and open to scrutiny, which in turn has stressed Pakistan-China ties.Further, Biden looks to build an alliance of "likeminded" democracies against authoritarian China, Islamabad won't easily shift the focus of Pakistan-US relations from security to economics.The big question confronting Pakistani policymakers is how to maintain trade and economic ties with the US without hurting relations with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-us-china-confrontation-pakistan-faces-strategic-geopolitical-dilemma-101616063733147.html

18-03-2021||World||Blinken urges China to convince North Korea to denuclearize||America’s top diplomat on Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after the North said it will ignore US offers to resume negotiations.Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of high-profile security talks in Seoul, which included Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and South Korean foreign and defense ministers. The so-called “two plus two” meeting, the first of its kind in five years, came as President Joe Biden is pushing to restore America’s alliances in Asia in the face of growing challenges from China and North Korea.“Beijing has an interest, a clear self-interest in helping to pursue denuclearization of (North Korea) because it is a source of instability. It is a source of danger and obviously a threat to us and our partners,” Blinken told a news conference.He said Beijing has “a critical role to play” to persuade North Korea to denuclearize because most of the North’s external trade goes through China. Blinken stressed that China is obligated by UN Security Council resolutions to fully enforce sanctions imposed over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests.China, the North’s last major ally and biggest aid benefactor, has long been suspected of avoiding completely implementing sanctions on the North. Some observers say China believes a unified, pro-US Korea established on its doorstep would undermine its strategic interests, and worries that a humanitarian disaster in North Korea could push swarms of refugees flooding over the countries’ border.Earlier Thursday, Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, confirmed Blinken’s previous announcement that Washington had reached out to Pyongyang through several channels starting in mid-February, but it hasn’t received any response.Choe called the US outreach a “time-delaying trick” and said North Korea would keep discarding similar offers for talks unless Washington withdraws its hostility. “What has been heard from the US since the emergence of the new regime is only a lunatic theory of ‘threat from North Korea’ and groundless rhetoric about ‘complete denuclearization,’” she said.Asked about Choe’s statement, Blinken said he was aware but said he’s more interested in the comments and thoughts of US allies and partners while he was making a regional tour. South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong said Thursday’s talks dealt with the North Korean statement and its intentions. He said South Korea hopes for the early resumption of US-North Korean talks. US-led diplomacy focusing on North Korea’s nuclear weapons remains stalemated for about two years because of disputes over US-led sanctions. Experts are debating whether the United States and its allies should settle for a deal that would freeze North Korea’s nuclear activities in return for relaxing sanctions to prevent its arsenal from growing.Earlier this week, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned the United States to “refrain from causing a stink,” while criticizing the US-South Korean drills that her government views as an invasion rehearsal.Some experts say North Korea, which is eager to win sanctions relief, may further raise animosities with missile tests to boost its leverage in any negotiations with the United States. North Korea’s moribund economy is under additional pressure because of the pandemic-related border closure that has significantly shrunk its external trade and a spate of natural disasters last summer.After Thursday’s talks, Blinken, Austin and their South Korean counterparts said in a joint statement that North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile issues are “a priority for the alliance” and reaffirmed a shared commitment to address those issues.Austin said the US is fully committed to the defense of South Korea, using “the full range of US capabilities, including our extended deterrent.” Blinken slammed North Korea’s human rights record for a second straight day, saying that people in North Korea “continue to suffer widespread and systematic abuses at the hands of a repressive government.”Later Thursday, Blinken and Austin met South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who was once a driving force behind the early part of the U.S.-North Korean nuclear diplomacy in 2018. Moon said that Seoul will continue close cooperation with Washington to achieve complete denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.Blinken and Austin are on the first overseas trip by Cabinet-level officials since Biden took office in January. They visited Japan before coming to Seoul.South Korean Defense Minister Suh Wook said that during Thursday’s talks the US side stressed the importance of a US-led trilateral security cooperation involving Seoul and Tokyo many times. He said South Korea in principle agrees on the US view. Ties between Seoul and Tokyo have suffered major setbacks in recent years over issues stemming from Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.Blinken said Thursday’s talks discussed China’s role, and “we are clear eyed about Beijing’s consistent failure to uphold its commitments.”“And we spoke about how Beijing’s aggressive and authoritarian behavior are challenging the stability and security prosperity of the Pacific region,” he said. “Beijing’s actions make forging a common approach among our allies all the more important at a time when we’re seeing a rollback of democracy and human rights around the world, including in Burma.”Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington, while Austin will travel on to New Delhi for talks with Indian officials.China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said that Beijing doesn’t expect the Alaska talks will resolve all the issues between China and the US and “we don’t hold overly high hopes.” Cu still added that he hoped the meeting would be “a start and that the two sides can begin a dialogue process that is candid, constructive and realistic.”During Thursday’s talks, Chung said there wasn’t a direct discussion on the issue of South Korea joining an expanded format of the Indo-Pacific group that involves the United States, Japan, Australia and India — known as the Quad. Chung maintained a government stance that South Korea can join any forum if it values transparency, openness and inclusiveness and serves its national interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-urges-china-to-convince-north-korea-to-denuclearize-101616062518847.html
18-03-2021||World||African Union says benefits outweigh risks of AstraZeneca Covid shot||The African Union said on Thursday that it considers that the benefits of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine outweigh the risks and recommended that vaccinations continue across the continent.The announcement came a day after the World Health Organization backed the vaccine and as more than a dozen European countries have suspended the use of it amid concerns over the risk of blood clots.John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news conference that the "benefits still outweigh the risks" and that countries should "move forward" with the vaccination.AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.The head of the continent's disease control body said that adverse reactions would be monitored and reported for future assessments on the vaccine.Some African countries have already suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.On Friday the Democratic Republic of Congo delayed the rollout of the shot, citing the suspension of the use of the shots by European countries.Many African states expect to receive AstraZeneca shots from the COVAX Facility, a global vaccine allocation plan co-led by the World Health Organization and partners including the Gavi vaccines alliance, which will be delivering vaccines for free to some low and lower-middle-income countries.The European Medicines Agency is investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine in the EU. It said it has so far found no causal link.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-union-says-benefits-outweigh-risks-of-astrazeneca-covid-shot-101616062508823.html

They inevitably lead to a sharp exacerbation of our bilateral ties.”Russia announced Wednesday it is recalling its ambassador to the United States for consultations. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova blamed the U.S. for bringing bilateral ties to a “dead end,” adding that “we are interested in preventing their irreversible degradation, if the Americans are aware of the associated risks,” she added.Commenting on the Russian move Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki emphasized that “we will be direct, we will speak out on areas where we have concerns, and it will certainly be, as the president said last night — certainly, the Russians will be held accountable for the actions that they have taken.”The exchange of tough statements comes on the heels of a declassified report from the U.S. national intelligence director’s office that finds President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to help Donald Trump in last November’s presidential election.“(Putin) will pay a price,” Biden said in the interview, asked about the declassified report.In Moscow, Kosachev warned Thursday that Russia's response wouldn't be limited to recalling the Russian ambassador “if the American side fails to offer explanation and excuse.” He wouldn't elaborate on what other action the Kremlin may take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-warns-it-may-scale-up-response-to-joe-biden-s-statement-101616062163322.html
18-03-2021||World||Covid: State of emergency in Tokyo to end on Sunday, says Japanese PM Suga||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the state of emergency in the Tokyo region will end on Sunday after targets for relieving strain on the health care system were reached, even as coronavirus cases in the capital rose slightly.Suga told his virus task force Thursday the government will be carefully watching the situation to prevent a fresh surge in infections as he set an end to the measure that had been in place for more than two months in a region where about 36 million people live.While Tokyo recorded 409 new cases on Wednesday, the highest figure since Feb. 18, an expert panel approved the lifting of the restrictions.“The number of new cases is flat, or on a slightly upward trend, so there are concerns about a rebound,” Suga told his virus task force. “We have decided on measures based on five pillars to prevent another spread after the emergency is lifted.”The five pillars will be preventing infections related to eating out; strengthening monitoring for mutations; strategic testing; the rollout of vaccines and strengthening the health care system, Suga added.Tokyo and the adjoining prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba were the last to be kept under the emergency measure, which was imposed after a record surge of cases in January, and ended in other areas of the country earlier this month.Lifting the measure nationwide is a symbolic gesture of optimism just days before the torch relay begins on March 25 for the virus-delayed Tokyo Olympics, now scheduled to start in July. Relaxing controls before a significant number of Japanese have been vaccinated may leave the country vulnerable to another wave of infections.About 420,000 of Japan’s 126 million population had received at least one dose of the vaccine as of Wednesday. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said Thursday the government would step up testing and monitoring for virus mutants, and would warn people to avoid events like the cherry-blossom parties traditionally held in the spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-state-of-emergency-in-tokyo-to-end-on-sunday-says-japanese-pm-suga-101616061725344.html

Its Chief Executive Officer Stephan Sieber said it’s too early to tell how much of a structural shift has appeared due to Brexit and that more friction is coming end of March and over the Easter holiday.“Due to the new virus strains and waves, the pandemic and related restrictions are not a linear event,” Sieber said in an interview.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s has described lower trade as temporary “teething problems” that are already passing. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday revealed a 41% plunge in exports to the European Union from December to January and a 29% drop in imports. His officials attributed these trends to stockpiling, Covid-19 lockdowns and the residual effects of the pre-Christmas chaos at the port of Dover.Transporeon also said:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-trade-with-europe-remains-below-2020-levels-says-report-101616062172054.html
18-03-2021||World||Ultrasound has potential to damage novel coronaviruses: MIT study||Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, may be vulnerable to ultrasound vibrations, within the frequencies used in medical diagnostic imaging, according to a study that used computer simulations.The researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US modelled the mechanical response of the coronaviruses to vibrations across a range of ultrasound frequencies.They found that vibrations between 25 and 100 megahertz triggered the virus' shell and spikes to collapse and start to rupture within a fraction of a millisecond.The finding, published in the Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, shows this effect in simulations of the virus in both air and in water.The team said that its findings are a first hint at a possible ultrasound-based treatment for coronaviruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19."We've proven that under ultrasound excitation the coronavirus shell and spikes will vibrate, and the amplitude of that vibration will be very large, producing strains that could break certain parts of the virus, doing visible damage to the outer shell and possibly invisible damage to the RNA inside," said Tomasz Wierzbicki, professor of applied mechanics at MIT."The hope is that our paper will initiate a discussion across various disciplines," Wierzbicki said.The researchers noted that the preliminary results are based on limited data regarding the virus' physical properties.They said that it remains to be investigated how exactly ultrasound could be administered, and how effective it would be in damaging the virus within the complexity of the human body.In their study, the researchers introduced acoustic vibrations into the simulations and observed how the vibrations rippled through the coronavirus' structure across a range of ultrasound frequencies.They started with vibrations of 100 megahertz, or 100 million cycles per second, which they estimated would be the shell's natural vibrating frequency, based on what's known of the virus' physical properties.When the researchers exposed the virus to 100 MHz ultrasound excitations, the virus' natural vibrations were initially undetectable.However, within a fraction of a millisecond the external vibrations, resonating with the frequency of the virus' natural oscillations, caused the shell and spikes to buckle inward, similar to a ball that dimples as it bounces off the ground.As the researchers increased the amplitude, or intensity, of the vibrations, the shell could fracture -- an acoustic phenomenon known as resonance that also explains how opera singers can crack a wineglass if they sing at just the right pitch and volume.At lower frequencies of 25 MHz and 50 MHz, the virus buckled and fractured even faster, both in simulated environments of air, and of water that is similar in density to fluids in the body, they said."These frequencies and intensities are within the range that is safely used for medical imaging," Wierzbicki added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ultrasound-has-potential-to-damage-novel-coronaviruses-mit-study-101616059908140.html

18-03-2021||World||IRS delays US tax deadline to May 17 after disruptive year||The Internal Revenue Service is delaying the April 15 tax-filing deadline to May 17, giving taxpayers an additional month to file returns and pay any outstanding levies.The postponement applies to individual taxpayers, including people who pay self-employment tax, the IRS said in a statement Wednesday. The relief does not apply to the first-quarter 2021 estimated tax payments that many small business owners owe, however, the agency said. Those payments are still due on April 15. The IRS said it plans to issue more guidance in the coming days.“This continues to be a tough time for many people, and the IRS wants to continue to do everything possible to help taxpayers navigate the unusual circumstances related to the pandemic, while also working on important tax-administration responsibilities,” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. “Even with the new deadline, we urge taxpayers to consider filing as soon as possible, especially those who are owed refunds.”The filing extension gives taxpayers additional breathing room to meet their tax obligations in what is becoming one of the most complicated tax seasons in decades. The change comes after calls from accountants and lawmakers to put off the due date as new legislation and pandemic-related work changes disrupt taxpayer plans.The IRS said that taxpayers do not need to take any action to take advantage of the extended May 17 deadline. The agency highlighted that the delay does not apply to state tax returns, where the deadlines are set by each jurisdiction.New ExemptionAmong the changes this tax season are last-minute amendments to the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill signed into law earlier this month that give filers a new tax exemption on up to $10,200 of jobless benefits. The individual tax return, Form 1040, is also the mechanism for people to claim any missing $1,200 or $600 stimulus payments from last year.Besides the disruptions from the pandemic, the changes in tax law will mean some filers will have to wait for updated forms, resubmit their returns, or consult a tax adviser on how to proceed if they’ve already filed.House Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey -- head of that same panel’s oversight subcommittee -- and Mike Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, had asked Rettig to postpone the filing deadline.“This extension is absolutely necessary to give Americans some needed flexibility in a time of unprecedented crisis,” Neal and Pascrell said in a statement Wednesday. “While we are pleased with this 30-day extension, we will continue to monitor developments during this hectic filing season.”The IRS, which has the administrative authority to delay tax deadlines without congressional approval, extended the filing season last year at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.As of early March 2021, the IRS has been behind last year’s metrics in the number of tax returns filed and processed, and in the number of refunds issued. The filing season, which began Feb. 12, started about two weeks later than usual -- contributing to the slump.The tax extension also comes as the IRS has been handed another big task: processing a third round of direct payments to households, this time for $1,400 each. The IRS said Wednesday it has so far sent about 90 million payments totaling $242 billion.The delay could also affect H&R Block Inc.’s financial reporting, with the company’s fiscal year set to close at the end of April.“The shift could push $500 million of revenue” from H&R Block’s fiscal fourth quarter into the first quarter, Andrew Silverman, a Bloomberg Intelligence government analyst, said. “Even though the deadline is likely to only be delayed a month, as opposed last year’s three-month hiatus, it’s enough to completely disrupt Block’s 2021 results.”The company is also likely to have to spend more on marketing and human resources into the extended filing season, he said. TurboTax software parent, Intuit Inc., will also face some of the higher costs, but tax preparation revenue is just a portion of its business and the company’s fiscal year doesn’t end until July 31, so date change is less disruptive for them, Silverman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irs-delays-us-tax-deadline-to-may-17-after-disruptive-year-101616061231260.html
18-03-2021||World||China accuses outspoken scholar on Xinjiang of fabrication||China on Thursday accused a scholar and outspoken critic of its policies toward Muslim minorities of fabricating charges that have helped bring sanctions against Chinese officials and companies operating in the Xinjiang region.The ruling Communist Party’s deputy head of propaganda, Xu Guixiang, made the accusations against Adrian Zenz in the latest of a series of news conferences aimed at deflecting criticism over China’s detention of more than 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims in reeducation camps.Zenz has also used government documents to detail the mistreatment of Muslim women in such facilities and the coercive use of birth control that has radically cut the birthrate among such groups. He has also published on the alleged use of forced labor in Xinjiang's cotton fields.“Adrian Zenz and his so-called research reports are sure to be thrown on the dust heap of history and be despised by the 25 million people of various ethnicities in Xinjiang,” Xu said.China's Foreign Ministry and state media have said companies and individuals have petitioned to sue Zenz for economic and reputational damages, although the names of the plaintiffs haven't been revealed and it isn't clear how they will pursue the charges.China first denied the existence of the camps but has since described them as centers to provide job training and reeducate those exposed to radical jihadist thinking. Officials deny all charges of human rights abuses in the northwestern region.Xinjiang had been a hotbed of anti-government violence, but Beijing claims its massive security crackdown has brought peace in recent years.Zenz is a German anthropologist and senior fellow at the U.S.-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation that has been sharply critical of China’s human rights record and its policies in Xinjiang and Tibet.In a telephone call from Minnesota, Zenz said the Chinese government campaign against him “smacks of desperation.”“The attacks on the Uyghur witnesses have become more and more nasty. It’s especially disgusting,” Zenz said.Zenz said the economic pressure of sanctions, along with the designation of China’s campaign as genocide by some Western countries and growing calls for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics to be held in China, have led to increased attacks on his character.One video displayed during Xu's news conference showed two former husbands of a Uyghur woman who has spoken spoke to media about her abuse in detention. One of the men called her an obscene name and said she had “bad moral quality."Another video showed men alleging another woman who has spoken to the foreign media about Xinjiang had perpetrated a bank loan scheme.“You are a lousy person,” one man said. Another said the woman had been an unfaithful spouse.Zenz says the vast majority of his work is based on documents produced by the Chinese government such as propaganda videos, local government websites and company notices.“I used their propaganda against them, and read between the lines,” Zenz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-outspoken-scholar-on-xinjiang-of-fabrication-101616060278961.html
18-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca shipment from India said to be behind UK vaccine delay||A delayed shipment of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine from India is behind a cut in the UK’s supply starting later this month, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.Vaccine doses made by one of Astra’s manufacturing partners, the Serum Institute of India, were delayed, said the person, who didn’t want to be identified because the supply details are private. The Serum Institute has already contributed to the UK supply with doses this quarter, the person said.The supply crunch prompted the government to shift focus and offer remaining doses to the people most at risk of developing severe forms of Covid-19.Adar Poonawalla, the Serum Institute’s chief executive officer, told the UK’s Telegraph newspaper that the delay had to do with the Indian government allowing the export of the doses to the UK, and had “nothing to do” with the Serum Institute. In a letter to local health-service groups, NHS England didn’t offer specifics, saying the shortage was the result of reductions in “national inbound vaccines.”The delay comes after Britain announced a new milestone Wednesday -- more than 25 million people have now received a first shot of the vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or by Astra and the University of Oxford. The number equates to about half the UK’s adult population.The government responded to the shortage by saying it’s focusing on providing second doses to the most-vulnerable people who’ve already been offered jabs, and by vaccinating those in priority groups who’ve not yet taken up the offer.Astra declined to comment on the delay. The company said Wednesday that the “UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule.”Serum and the Indian government didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-shipment-from-india-said-to-be-behind-uk-vaccine-delay-101616060002323.html
18-03-2021||World||EU regulator reviews link between AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine and blood clots||The world is awaiting a decision from Europe’s top medical regulator on whether its initial investigation into whether there is any evidence to show the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine is linked to a small number of blood clots reported in people across the continent.The European Medicines Agency's expert committee is set to announce the results of its investigation later on Thursday.Earlier this week, more than a dozen countries including Germany, France, Spain and Italy suspended immunization using the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reports of unusual blood clots in several people among the 17 million who have received at least one dose in Europe. Both the EMA and the World Health Organization have said there is no current evidence to suggest the vaccine was responsible and that the benefits of immunization far outweighed the potentially small risk of getting vaccinated. AstraZeneca said after a careful review of its Covid-19 immunization data, it found no evidence of any increased risk of blood clots in any age group or gender in any country.On Tuesday, EMA executive director Emer Cooke said the agency's priority was the vaccine's safety and that it would consider issues including if extra warnings needed to be added for the AstraZeneca vaccine. She noted the daily toll Covid-19 is continuing to take across the continent and said vaccines were critical to stopping its spread.“We are worried that there may be an effect on the trust of the vaccines," she said. "But our job is to make sure that the products that we authorize are safe and we can be trusted by the European citizens.”The pause in vaccination using the AstraZeneca shot comes as Covid-19 is surging across the continent and Britain is expecting major delays in its vaccine deliveries. Tens of thousands of new daily cases have prompted new lockdown measures in Italy, caused hospitalizations in France to spike and led German officials to announce that the third wave of Covid-19 has begun.Any time vaccines are rolled out widely, scientists expect some serious health issues and deaths to be reported, simply because tens of millions of people are receiving the shots. Determining whether or not the vaccine is to blame can be difficult, since most of the people getting inoculated first are those most at risk of the coronavirus. But because there are no long-term data on any of the Covid-19 vaccines, any potential signal of trouble must be thoroughly investigated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-regulator-reviews-link-between-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-and-blood-clots-101616058961990.html

This kind of statement is not acceptable under any circumstances," he added, calling it a watershed moment in US-Russia ties.The Kremlin has not yet responded publicly to Biden's comments, but is likely to do so later on Thursday.Artur Chilingarov, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker in the lower house of parliament, called for a "tough reaction" from Moscow in comments made to Russia's Ekho Moskvy radio station.Russia's ties with the West, already languishing at post-Cold War lows since 2014, have come under new pressure over Russia's jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny whose freedom the West has demanded.Russia has dismissed that as unacceptable interference in its domestic affairs.The United States has said it is preparing new sanctions against Russia over an alleged hack and the alleged election meddling.Biden told ABC "You'll see shortly" when asked what consequences Russia would face for its alleged behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeks-us-apology-after-biden-s-killer-remark-says-kremlin-ally-101616056592359.html
18-03-2021||World||Indian American healthcare workers in Green Card backlog hold demonstration before US Capitol||A group of Indian-American frontline healthcare workers languishing in the Green Card backlog held a demonstration in front of the US Capitol urging lawmakers and the Biden administration to end the per capita country-specific quota.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently in the country.Indian IT professionals, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the US mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system which imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of the coveted Green Card or permanent legal residency.“We are frontline Covid warriors, and we are here to tell how we have been short changed into a life of perpetual indentured servitude. Each of us has a story. We are here from all over the country asking for justice. Justice that has precluded us for decades now,” Dr Raj Karnatak, an infectious disease and critical care physician and Dr Pranav Singh, a pulmonary and critical care physician, said.“Most of us are from India. We trained in the US and took oath as physicians to serve the sick and needy. Most of us are serving the rural and underserved areas. We are in a Green Card backlog due to archaic country caps that allow no country to get more than seven percent of employment-based green cards,” said the two Indian American doctors’ organisers of the peaceful protest said in a joint statement.According to them, due to decades of backlog, many high-skilled immigrants are not able to change jobs due to fear of losing the spot in the Green Card line and are indentured to one employer.“Can only work in the specialty occupation the visa is allotted for decades. Many healthcare workers could not serve in Covid-19 hot spots as the visas are tied to the job and employer,” they said.The small group of protestors said that President Joe Biden can direct United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to end the Green Card backlog for the frontline healthcare workers by utilising the unused green cards in the past years.There was an HR 1044 fairness bill that was passed in the House of Representatives by 365 votes in 2019 and its senate equivalent S386 passed the Senate in 2020.Now it is back to House as a modified version. Representative Zoe Lofgren, initial co-sponsor of the bill HR 1044 has not shown any interest in bringing the bill to vote as a bipartisan solution to end the suffering of skilled professionals including frontline healthcare workers, they alleged.Dr Karnatak and Dr Singh said that India is a land of more than a billion people, but the number of green cards India gets is the same as a country as small as Iceland.Indian high-skilled workers are brought into the US on an H-1B visa. There is no country cap on the H-1B visa and due to its sheer population, Indians make 50 per cent of the H-1B workforce.The H-1B visa, the most sought after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The discrepancy in the number of H-1B hired from India and a small number of green cards allotted to India creates an inhumane Green Card backlog.Green Card backlog is adversely affecting the professional and personal lives of high-skilled immigrants from India including the frontline healthcare workers, they said.“Frontline healthcare workers need immediate relief, they are suffering for a very long time. As frontline healthcare workers who are risking their lives in this pandemic, the least we deserve is a certainty. A certainty that if we die or get disabled, our children and spouses won’t be kicked out of the country,” said the joint statement on behalf of the protestors.Last month, President Biden revoked a policy issued by his predecessor during the pandemic that blocked many Green Card applicants from entering the US.Reopening the country to people seeking green cards, or legal permanent residence, Biden in his proclamation said that the policy of former president Donald Trump does not advance the interests of the country.“To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,” he said.The US is currently facing a backlog of nearly 473,000 qualified family-based Green Card requests.As a result of Trump’s ban on issuing green cards, as many as 120,000 family-based preference visas were lost. But this came as a big boon for issuing employment-based green cards, mainly those on H-1B visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-healthcare-workers-in-green-card-backlog-protest-before-capitol-101616056705171.html
18-03-2021||World||United States: Severe storms, tornadoes expected across the Deep South||The prospect of more tornadoes overnight and into Thursday across the Deep South had forecasters advising residents to take extra precautions after a wave of storms pounded the region throughout the day Wednesday, leaving a trail of splintered trees and damaged buildings.Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected Thursday for portions of eastern Georgia, through the Carolinas into extreme southeast Virginia, according to the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center. All severe hazards are possible. Other isolated severe storms are possible from southern Ohio into the central Appalachians.The biggest overnight threat of tornadoes remained over Alabama, according to the weather service, but severe storms and tornadoes were possible from east-central Georgia and northeast across South and North Carolina later in the day Thursday.“Significant tornadoes, wind damage and large hail will be possible from morning into afternoon,” the center advised late Wednesday. “Severe thunderstorms will also be possible from parts of the eastern Gulf Coast into the southern and central Appalachians.”The weather service advised residents throughout the region to keep the volume up on cellphones to hear emergency alerts throughout the night.Early Thursday there were no storm warnings across the metro Atlanta area but intense lightning, heavy rain and strong wind gusts of up to 40-50 mph were moving through the area.Morehouse College tweeted that it was delaying the opening of its campus until 11 a.m. and that faculty and staff should not arrive until after that time. All classes before then were to be held virtually, it said.While nearly 16 million people in the Southeast could see powerful storms, the prediction center said, a region of about 3 million stretching from southeastern Arkansas and northeastern Louisiana across Mississippi into Alabama was at high risk for big twisters that stay on the ground for miles, straight winds up to 80 mph (129 kph) and destructive hail.In South Carolina, the severe weather threat led the state Senate president to caution senators to state home Thursday while urging staff to work remotely for their safety. House Speaker Jay Lucas said that chamber would meet less than an hour Thursday to take up routine motions in advance of a budget debate next week — then adjourn.“If you are in a situation where it is perilous that you come, I’m asking you not to come,” Lucas said. “If you can come, give us a quorum and do these few things we need to do, we will be out of here in a hurry.”Nearly all of South Carolina is under moderate risk of severe storms. The forecast led a number of the state’s school systems to call off in-person classes Thursday and have students and teachers meet online.Possible tornadoes on Wednesday knocked down trees, toppled power lines and damaged homes in Chilton County, Clarke County and the Alabama communities of Burnsville and Moundville, where power was out and trees blocked a main highway.WTVM-TV reports that Jimmy Baker, whose home was one of at least three destroyed in Chilton, watched as the storm headed toward his house.“Then about a minute before it got here, we jumped. . . in the hall closet, a little, small closet," Baker said. “And just we heard it. You know, the sound from the house coming down. We were saved. We thank the Lord for that,” he said.“Downtown Moundville got it. Some roofs and stuff got taken off houses,” said Michael Brown, whose family owns Moundville Ace Hardware and Building. “There’s a lot of trees down. I guess it had to be a tornado; it got out of here pretty fast.”Ramond Barren told WALA-TV that a reported tornado destroyed the area near his sister's home in Campbell. First responders said Barren's sister and 3-year-old niece were thrown from their home but were not seriously injured.“I’m thankful for that,” Barren said. “I thank God for seeing them through.”Clarke County EMA Director Roy Waite said the incident is a rarity in the county.“This is the second time in the county that I can remember since I’ve been EMA Director that we’ve had a family thrown from a home, so they are fortunate,” Waite said. “We hope people will take warning, move to the center part of the house or go to a storm shelter when these events happen.”Additional damage was reported in Louisiana, Tennessee and Mississippi, where video showed an apparent tornado at Brookhaven. High winds blew down signs and trees in northeast Texas, and hailstones the size of baseballs were reported near the Alabama-Mississippi line, the weather service said.More than 70,000 homes and businesses were without power from Texas to Alabama, and radar showed additional storms moving across the region as initial cleanup work began.Storms were possible all the way from northern Texas in the west to northern Illinois and as far east as the Carolinas, forecasters said, and the weather service issued more than 50 tornado warnings in Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma. Tornado watches included parts of seven states.Dozens of school systems in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi canceled classes, switched to online learning or dismissed students early, and Mississippi State University moved to virtual teaching because of the potential for danger at its campuses in Starkville and Meridian.Large vaccination clinics where hundreds of people an hour can get shots without leaving their vehicles were canceled in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. In the Mississippi capital of Jackson, state employees were warned to head to stairwells if they hear weather sirens. Near Birmingham, labor organizers canceled an outdoor event at an Amazon facility where workers are voting on union representation.At least two waves of storms were likely, forecasters said, and the worst might not hit until a cold front passes through overnight.“The biggest question is how strong to severe these storms are going to be and if they’re going to be tornadic right off the bat,” Gary Goggins, a forecaster with the National Weather Service office for Birmingham, said Wednesday.Gov. Kay Ivey placed Alabama under a state of emergency, and communities across the South used social media to share the location of tornado shelters. Dozens of people gathered in a gymnasium that was opened as a shelter in Tuscaloosa, where more than 50 people died in a twister during a weather outbreak that occurred 10 years ago next month.In Jackson, Tennessee, officials said a civic center and the regional airport would be open for residents seeking shelter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-severe-storms-tornadoes-expected-across-the-deep-south-101616057553710.html
18-03-2021||World||China summons tech giants over 'deep fakes', internet security||Chinese authorities on Thursday said they had summoned 11 tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba and TikTok owner ByteDance for talks on "deep fakes" and internet security, as regulators try to reel in the country's runaway digital sector.The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said talks concerned "voice software that has yet to undergo safety assessment procedures", as well as the application of "deep fake" technology.It also said companies should report to the government plans to add new functions that "have the ability to mobilise society".China has in recent months taken a tough line on the country's fast-growing tech firms, with 12 companies hit with fines last week for allegedly flouting monopoly rules.Authorities last year halted a record $34 billion initial public offering by Alibaba fintech subsidiary Ant Group.They called in its billionaire founder Jack Ma and then opened an investigation into Alibaba business practices deemed anti-competitive.The latest summoning of big tech also involves companies such as smartphone maker Xiaomi, TikTok rival Kuaishou, and music streaming service NetEase Cloud Music, the CAC said.The aim is to ensure they comply with regulations, carry out safety assessments, and take "effective rectification measures" if potential hazards are found.In 2019, China issued rules banning online video and audio providers from using artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality technologies to produce "fake news"."Fake news" has been generalised to mean anything from a mistake to a parody or a deliberate misinterpretation of facts.Regulations stress the dangers of "deep fakes", meaning technology that manipulates videos to appear genuine but depict events or speech that never happened.The CAC notice comes shortly after China blocked the US invite-only audio app Clubhouse.The app briefly flickered in the mainland before vanishing but has since sparked a number of copycats.President Xi Jinping on Monday warned about risks surrounding "platform" companies -- a term that could refer to mobile and internet firms -- and called for greater oversight of the sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-summons-tech-giants-over-deep-fakes-internet-security-101616057401693.html
18-03-2021||World||Myanmar faces growing isolation as junta limits internet, locks up journalists||Myanmar faced growing isolation on Thursday with increasingly limited internet services and its last private newspaper ceasing publication as the military built its case against ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi was overthrown and detained in a Feb. 1 military coup, triggering mass protests across the country that security forces have struggled to suppress with increasingly violent methods.The total documented number of people killed in the unrest stood at 217 but the actual toll was probably much higher, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said.Western countries have condemned the coup and called for an end to the violence and for the release of Suu Kyi and others. Asian neighbours have offered to help find a solution, but the military has a long record of shunning outside pressure.Large parts of an economy already reeling from the novel coronavirus have been paralysed by the protests and a parallel civil disobedience campaign of strikes against military rule, while many foreign investors are reassessing plans.The U.N. food agency warned this week that rising prices of food and fuel could undermine the ability of poor families to feed themselves."Whatever happens in Myanmar over coming months, the economy will collapse, leaving tens of millions in dire straits and needing urgent protection," historian and author Thant Myint-U said on Twitter.While the security forces have focused on stamping out dissent in Yangon and other cities, small demonstrations have erupted elsewhere day after day.Several thousand people marched in the small town of Natmauk on Thursday, the Democratic Voice of Burma reported. The central town is the birthplace of Aung San, the leader of Myanmar's drive for independence from colonial power Britain, and Suu Kyi's father.About 1,000 protesters on motorbikes drove around the central town of Taungoo and hundreds marched in the northern jade-mining town of Hpakant, the Irrawaddy news service reported.There were no reports of violence.A 24-year-old campaigner against military rule died on Wednesday, three days after he was detained and beaten in the central town of Monywa, the Irrawaddy and Myanmar Now news portal reported.The U.N. human rights office in Geneva said this week "deeply distressing" reports of torture in custody had emerged in Myanmar.A junta spokesman did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.Alleged paymentsAuthorities have restricted the internet services protesters use to organise, with access to Wi-Fi in public areas largely shut off by Thursday. Residents of some towns, including Dawei in the south, reported no internet at all.The private Tachilek News Agency in the northeast published photographs of workers cutting cables it said were the fibre links with neighbouring Thailand. Reuters could not verify the report. Information within Myanmar is becoming increasingly difficult to verify.Some 37 journalists have been arrested, including 19 who remain in detention, the U.N. human rights office said.While authorities have ordered some newspapers shut, others have apparently been forced to close for reasons of logistics. The last private newspaper stopped publishing on Wednesday. State-run media have not been affected.State television said on Wednesday that Suu Kyi was being investigated for bribery in connection with accepting four payments worth $550,000 from a prominent businessman.Property developer Maung Weik, in comments broadcast in a state television news bulletin, said he had given Suu Kyi four payments, ranging from $50,000 to $250,000 from 2018 to 2020, when she headed the first civilian-led government in decades."According to the testimony of U Maung Weik...Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of bribery and the anti-corruption commission is investigating to take action under anti-corruption laws," it added.A spokesman for the junta said last week authorities were investigating Suu Kyi for receiving illegal payments.Her lawyer dismissed that accusation as a joke. He was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.Suu Kyi, 75, is hugely popular for her campaign against military rule since 1988, over which she has spent years in detention.The army defended its coup, saying its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election swept by Suu Kyi's party were rejected by the electoral commission.It has promised a new election but not set a date.Suu Kyi already faces various charges including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios and infringing coronavirus protocols. If convicted, she could be barred from politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-faces-growing-isolation-as-junta-limits-internet-locks-up-journalists-101616057297762.html
18-03-2021||World||Mauritian climate activist Shaama Sandooyea holds underwater protest to protect seagrass||In a remote stretch of the western Indian Ocean, a 24-year-old Mauritian marine scientist donned a snorkel and dived below the choppy waves to float in protest above the world's largest seagrass meadow.Holding a placard reading 'Youth Strike for Climate,' Shaama Sandooyea held her breath and hoped the images from her action would help spark more aggressive global action to fight climate change.The vast stretch of seagrass at the Saya de Malha Bank has become a priority for conservation partly for its role in absorbing climate-warming carbon dioxide. Elsewhere, the world is losing some 7% of its seagrass cover per year due to dredging, rising ocean temperatures and other factors.Thousands of marine species also rely on the Saya de Malha seagrasses for food and habitat, including endangered green sea turtles and rabbitfish, a crucial species for artisanal fisheries in the region."There is a lot of life in the ocean that we don't know exists and which is magical. It shouldn't be suffering because of the decisions that other people are making," Sandooyea said on the deck of a Greenpeace boat, called Arctic Sunrise, while sailing out to the area with scientists and environmentalists in early March.The campaigners are hoping to draw attention to a UN goal of persuading countries to protect at least 30% of the planet's land and ocean by 2030 - an interim target that many scientists say must be met to address the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.For Sandooyea, the Saya de Malha is also part of her home. The island nation of Mauritius shares jurisdiction over the surrounding seabed with the Seychelles. But while the remoteness of the seagrass fields hundreds of miles from shore has provided some protection up to now, the young activist scientist worries that could change if oceans become busier.Global shipping traffic increased four-fold between 1992 and 2012 with the Indian Ocean seeing one of the sharpest rises, according to a 2014 study in Geophysical Research Letters.Meanwhile, Mauritius is also still grappling with its worst-ever ecological disaster, caused in July when a Japanese ship hit a coral reef and spilled some 1,000 tonnes of oil into aquamarine waters that then washed up onto beaches.Against the backdrop of such events, Sandooyea said she felt compelled as a teenager to become an activist: "It was simply unacceptable to see no action, no concrete action."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mauritian-climate-activist-holds-underwater-protest-to-protect-seagrass-101616056716228.html

18-03-2021||World||Myanmar construction magnate with links to military claims cash payments to Suu Kyi||A Myanmar construction magnate with links to military rulers claimed he personally gave more than half a million dollars in cash to deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a broadcast on state television aimed at discrediting the ousted civilian government.The statement by Maung Waik could pave the way for more serious charges against Suu Kyi, who has been detained since the February 1 military takeover while security forces increasingly use lethal force against a popular uprising demanding the restoration of democratically elected leaders.The military has already tried to implicate Suu Kyi in corruption, alleging she was given $600,000 plus gold bars by a political ally. She and President Win Myint have been charged so far with inciting unrest, possession of walkie-talkies and violating a pandemic order limiting public gatherings.In the latest salvo of allegations, Maung Waik, who has previously been convicted of drug trafficking, told the state TV he gave cash to government ministers to help his businesses. He said the money included USD 100,000 given to Suu Kyi in 2018 for a charitable foundation named after her mother, USD 150,000 in 2019 for which he did not specify a reason, USD 50,000 last February and USD 250,000 in April, again with no purpose specified.On Wednesday, protesters fired slingshots and threw Molotov cocktails toward lines of security forces in a rare incidence of fighting back against a relentlessly violent crackdown, which one organization said has claimed more than 200 lives since the coup.At least two people were shot dead in Kalay in northwestern Myanmar, according to media and social media posts that included photos of the victims.Smoke and fires were seen in Kalay and Yangon on Wednesday night, reportedly from authorities burning down barricades protesters had set up during the day.Pope Francis appealed for an end to the bloodshed.In an apparent reference to widely broadcast images of a nun in Myanmar, kneeling on the street in front of armed security forces begging them not to shoot protesters, Francis said: “I, too, kneel on the streets of Myanmar and say: may violence cease.”In response to increased police violence, protesters began taking a more aggressive approach to self-defense — burning tires at barricades and pushing back when they could against attacks.A statement issued Sunday by the Committee Representing Pyihtaungsu Hluttaw — an organisation of the elected members of Parliament whom the military barred from taking their seats but who have set themselves up as an alternative government to the junta — announced that the general public has the legal right to self-defence against the security forces. The committee was earlier called a treasonous organisation by the junta, which declared it illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-construction-magnate-with-links-to-military-claims-cash-payments-to-suu-kyi-101616042611955.html
18-03-2021||World||Questions about Cuomo grow harder to ignore for Biden||President Joe Biden's relentless effort to avoid the day-to-day distractions of the political world is being put to the test by the growing calls for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign.Throughout the campaign and during his first two months in office, Biden’s team installed zealous message discipline, ignoring the outcries of Republicans and Twitter alike. The effort is especially important as the administration tries to sell a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package to the public. But the strategy is running into hurdles as Biden, in his role as the head of the Democratic Party, is being pulled into the debate over Cuomo's fate.The pressure on Biden grew dramatically last week when most of New York's congressional delegation, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, called on Cuomo to step aside. The governor has remained defiant and kept up his prominent role this week on the White House’s call with governors regarding the pandemic.By Wednesday, a question about the sexual harassment accusations against Cuomo was at the center of Biden’s rare one-on-one TV interview. Cuomo has denied any allegations of inappropriate touching and has insisted he will not resign.Biden, in the interview, went further than before on Cuomo’s future, saying “yes” when asked if the governor should resign if an investigation confirms allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate touching by multiple women. Biden added, “I think he’d probably end up being prosecuted, too.”“Takes a lot of courage to come forward, so the presumption is they should be taken seriously,” Biden told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “But there should be an investigation to determine whether what she says is true. And that’s what’s underway now.”The president’s public acknowledgement of possible criminal charges sent shockwaves throughout the ranks of Democratic politics, which have been grappling with the future of a three-term governor who remains popular with voters but has become the latest politician overwhelmed by allegations of sexual misconduct.White House aides later underscored the president’s declaration that decisions on Cuomo’s future should wait until after an investigation into the accusations. That has been their strategy since the moment the first accusation was made public last month: to keep as much distance as possible between the White House and the Governor’s Mansion in Albany.Asked Wednesday about the president’s comments, Cuomo said: “If you committed a crime, you can be prosecuted. That’s true. But what President Biden said is, ‘We should do an investigation.’ I agree with him on that. The people of New York agree with him on that.”Biden and Cuomo, once close allies, have not spoken since the allegations were made, officials said. When asked repeatedly about the allegations, White House press secretary Jen Psaki has recited the response that the women should be heard and the investigations should continue. Word went out throughout the West Wing, including to the president, to not talk to members of the governor’s staff except to coordinate the coronavirus response.Biden aides have strained to avoid a repeat of 2009, when President Barack Obama sent word through aides that another scandal-scarred New York governor, David Paterson, should not run again. That moment entangled the Obama White House in a state political issue when it was trying to fight on other fronts, most notably its own economic recovery package.Much like it ignored the daily churn of controversy tossed off by then-President Donald Trump during the campaign, Biden’s team has refused to engage in the cultural war firestorms — Dr. Seuss and Mr. Potato Head among them — ignited by the GOP in order to focus on passing, and now selling, the Covid-19 relief deal. But the constant drip of allegations from Albany has become harder for Biden to ignore.In addition to the claims from women, Cuomo faces complaints that his administration deliberately withheld data on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes to bolster his image.“I can’t see how President Biden would appreciate this kind of distraction at such a crucial moment in his presidency,” said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic consultant who once worked for Cuomo’s primary opponent Cynthia Nixon. “But his strong words do two things: They buy Cuomo a little bit of time until the report comes out but they also show where the president stands unequivocally.”Biden was first a friend to three-term Gov. Mario Cuomo, and then grew close to his son Andrew. During Biden's time as vice president, the two men frequently held events in New York to tout infrastructure improvements and Biden campaigned for Cuomo when the governor faced a stiff primary challenge in 2018.The two men share similar political views, having once been seen as Democratic centrists only to move to the left to mirror the rise of the progressives in their party. Their orbits are intertwined; a number of Democrats have worked for both men in their roles as senator, vice president, governor and housing secretary. And Biden briefly considered Cuomo for attorney general.Biden himself faced scrutiny during the 2020 presidential campaign for his conduct around women and apologized if he ever made anyone feel awkward with his hands-on campaigning. He vigorously denied a sexual assault allegation leveled at him by Tara Reade, a former staffer.Cuomo has tried to continue governing while facing the specter of multiple investigations. More than half of the New York State Legislature has called on him to resign, including three-quarters of Democrats in the state senate. The state assembly’s judiciary committee last week launched an “impeachment investigation” into allegations against the governor.When New York was the pandemic’s epicenter last year, Cuomo was widely hailed for his handling of the crisis even as questions began to percolate about COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes. In effect, he became the Democratic face of the pandemic and drew a national following for holding daily, somber, straightforward news conferences that stood in stark contrast to the often fact-free versions conducted by Trump.Cuomo, who raised eyebrows by writing a book about his Covid-19 response before the pandemic was over, has tried to maintain his grip on his post by arguing that he’s the best person to help New York recover at this moment.“Everything that I have learned in the federal government, as attorney general, as governor, I am bringing to the table at this moment,” he said while condemning other Democrats who have called for his ouster. “Politicians who don’t know a single fact, but yet form a conclusion and an opinion are, in my opinion, reckless and dangerous."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/questions-about-cuomo-grow-harder-to-ignore-for-biden-101616042056105.html
18-03-2021||World||Prisoners across globe, including in India, forgotten during Covid-19: Amnesty||Human rights group Amnesty International has said prisoners globally, including in India, have been forgotten during the Covid-19 pandemic as prisons face systemic challenges in preventing the virus spread. In a report released on Thursday, the group said the pandemic control measures in prisons led to serious human rights violations.The report added India was among the countries, where measures such as video conferencing were introduced for prisoners to stay in touch with their families on the Supreme Court’s directions during the lockdown introduced to check the Covid-19 spread. But it added the measures were inadequate. It cited a source in Jammu and Kashmir and said detainees there “were only allowed a phone call to their family once in 15 days.”Also Read | India records 35,871 new Covid-19 cases, highest daily spike this yearAmnesty International halted its work in India last year blaming an “incessant witch-hunt” after the government froze its bank accounts and forced the group to lay off its staff in the country.In the report, the group said even though prisoners have been released due to the pandemic in places like India, but the rates of releases remained ad hoc and insufficient to address the magnitude of the risk. “In India, prison staff were included among front-line workers, one of three priority categories for vaccination. Prisoners were not listed among the priority groups...”It referred to measures in prisons after the national lockdown was announced in India on March 24 and added prison departments across the country barred all personal physical meetings inside prisons. The group said there were plans to shift meetings with lawyers and family members to phones or video calls after a Supreme Court order required all higher courts to adopt video conferencing technologies. “Just as there were problems with the introduction of video conferencing in courts, the roll-out of video conferencing in prisons to allow detainees to communicate with family members was very slow. In the state of Karnataka, for instance, it only became operational in December 2020. In Haryana, it was not until February 2021 that officials announced that the first prison in the state had introduced a video conferencing facility. The duration of video calls was very limited. In Karnataka, for instance, it was reportedly between five and 10 minutes,” it saidThe group said India was also among 40 countries, where protests and unrest were reported from the prisons.Also Read | Over 150% rise in Covid cases in 70 districts, states asked to boost testingIt urged countries not to discriminate against those held in detention when developing vaccination policies and plans. “... urges states to make every effort to prioritize prisoners in their national vaccination plans, particularly given that their confined conditions do not allow them to physically distance and ensure that those at particularly high risk of COVID-19 (such as older prisoners and those with chronic health conditions) are prioritized for vaccination on a par with comparative groups in the general population,” it said.The report titled “Forgotten Behind Bars: Covid-19” said over an estimated 11 million people are imprisoned globally and prisons in many countries risk becoming hotbeds for the disease. It added many inmates struggle to access soap, proper sanitation, or personal protective equipment. The report said physical distancing is difficult to achieve and only limited health care is available.“As COVID-19 continues to rip through prisons across the world, measures introduced by governments to prevent the spread of the disease have led to human rights violations, including the use of excessive solitary confinement to aid social distancing and inadequate measures to reduce the detrimental effects of isolation,” said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International’s research and advocacy director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prisoners-across-globe-including-in-india-forgotten-during-covid-19-amnesty-101616041573518.html
18-03-2021||World||China seeks Biden-Xi meet next month if Alaska talks go well||Beijing is seeking a meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping next month if the first high-level US-China talks in Alaska starting Thursday are productive, according to people familiar with the situation.The Biden-Xi meeting as envisioned by Chinese officials would be organized around Earth Day on April 22 to show both leaders are focused on combating climate change, one of the people said. Biden is already set to gather global leaders together on that day to push the world for greater ambition in curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The prospect of the meeting was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Both the US and China have played down expectations for the talks in Alaska, which are set to run Thursday and Friday local time. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will represent the US, while Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Politburo member Yang Jiechi will speak for China.China’s expectations for the meeting aren’t “too high,” Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the US, said in comments reported by state-run China Central Television. It will be a success if it starts a “honest, constructive and rational” dialogue, he added.Both countries have sparred over how to describe the talks, with the US disputing China’s characterization of the meeting as a “high-level strategic dialogue.” Blinken on Wednesday said it will be an opportunity “to very directly, face-to-face, share with our Chinese counterparts the concerns that the United States has, that our allies and partners have about some of the things that China is doing.”China has urged the Biden administration to remove tariffs and sanctions imposed during Donald Trump’s presidency, as well as measures to restrict sales of key technology to Chinese companies. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing last week said the US “isn’t a reliable country that is to be trusted” after administration officials tightened restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co.China announced trials would start Friday for two Canadians accused of violating national security laws who were taken in shortly after the December 2018 arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei. China has often linked the cases to Meng’s, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman telling reporters last year that halting the extradition “could open up space for resolution to the situation of the two Canadians.”The US and China have sparred over issues such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang in calls since Biden took office, which Beijing has insisted are “internal” issues. But US officials have also sought to stress areas of potential cooperation, including on climate change and nuclear nonproliferation.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday that the Alaska meeting wasn’t meant to establish expectations for regular encounters between the two sides.“I wouldn’t see this as one in a series,” she said. “This is a meeting that our national security adviser and secretary of state are attending, and I wouldn’t build it out beyond there at this point in time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-biden-xi-meet-next-month-if-alaska-talks-go-well-101616037189559.html
18-03-2021||World||US subpoenas Chinese communications firms in probe of national security risks||The US Commerce Department said on Wednesday that it has served subpoenas on multiple Chinese companies that provide information and communications technology services in the United States to see if they pose a national security risk."Beijing has engaged in conduct that blunts our technological edge and threatens our alliances," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in statement.The subpoenas will gather information to "allow us to make a determination for possible action that best protects the security of American companies, American workers, and US national security."Also Read | Improvement in US-China relations depends on treatment of Australia: Biden aideThe statement did not name any companies. China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp were targeted by the previous administration of Donald Trump for removal from the US telecoms infrastructure.President Joe Biden's administration said last month it plans to allow a Trump-era rule targeting Chinese technology firms deemed to pose a threat to the United States to go into effect despite objections from US businesses.The Commerce Department issued an interim final rule in the final days of the Trump administration aimed at addressing information and communications technology supply chain concerns and said it would become effective after a 60-day period of public comment.Last month, the department said it would continue to accept public comment on the rule until March 22, when it would go into effect. The subpoenas would not have an impact on the interim final rule's timing, a department official said on Wednesday.The US Chamber of Commerce and groups representing major industries raised concerns in a letter to the Commerce Department in January that the interim rule gave the government "nearly unlimited authority to intervene in virtually any commercial transaction between US companies and their foreign counterparts that involves technology."Business Roundtable, a group representing major US chief executives, said earlier the proposal is "unworkable for US businesses in its current form."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-subpoenas-chinese-communications-firms-in-probe-of-national-security-risks-101616033103393.html
18-03-2021||World||Biden asked to back India, South Africa at WTO on Covid-19 vaccines||A group of lawmakers in the US have urged President Joe Biden to support the move by India and South Africa before the World Trade Organization for emergency temporary waiver of some Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules to enable greater production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests.The move comes after India and South Africa, along with several other countries, have urgently gone to the WTO seeking a time-limited waiver of the TRIPS agreement. The previous Trump administration had opposed such a move.At a news conference here on Wednesday, the lawmakers -- Rosa DeLauro, Jan Schakowsky, Earl Blumenauer, Lloyd Doggett, Adriano Espaillat, and Andy Levin -- said this while urging President Biden to support the emergency temporary waiver at the WTO as requested by countries led by India and South Africa.The lawmakers said more than 60 US representatives would collectively write to Biden to announce support for the TRIPS waiver proposed by India and South Africa at the WTO. The temporary TRIPS waiver would allow countries and manufacturers to directly access and share technologies to produce vaccines and therapeutics without causing trade sanctions or international disputes, they said.“The Biden administration has an obligation to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration and reestablish our nation’s global reputation as a public health leader,” said DeLauro.“As we see every day, the Covid-19 pandemic knows no borders. Our globalised systems cannot recover if only parts of the world are vaccinated and have protection against the virus. We must make vaccines available everywhere if we are going to crush the virus anywhere, and we need to make public policy choices, both in the US and at the WTO, that put people first,” DeLauro said.“Congress has appropriated billions of dollars of emergency relief for the travel, tourism, and hospitality industries and is planning billions more. The faster we can bring this emergency to an end, the faster these industries can recover. President Biden’s support for the TRIPS waiver is key to the end of the pandemic and the beginning of a strong global recovery.”Schakowsky said big pharma companies are adamantly opposed, claiming in their letter to President Biden that "intellectual property is the foundation for both the development and sharing of new technologies," not mentioning their own profits, or the billions of dollars that tax payers have contributed to their research and development.“As a global community, we must come together and use every tool at our disposal to stop this pandemic. We have seen that WTO intellectual property rules and corporate greed have disastrous impacts for public health during past epidemics, and we need to ensure that this doesn’t happen again,” said Blumenauer.“The Biden administration has already shown that we are in this together with our allies. They understand that a deadly pandemic does not stop at any one border. Working to ensure that trade rules do not stunt the developing world’s access to vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests is the next step,” he said.“Mindful of COVID variants from Brazil and South Africa to stop this deadly virus, we need widespread immunisation everywhere around the globe, not just in the wealthiest countries,” said Doggett. “While we have lacked sufficient vaccines in America, immunisation has been almost non-existent in poorer countries,” he said.“America has an obligation to support the global community with the tools and vaccine resources we developed to combat the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Espaillat, adding that a global conundrum exists with countries having to wait months or even years to vaccinate their citizens – a delay that will only allow the virus to continue to mutate, spread, and kill more people.“We simply cannot allow this to happen. During this time of crisis, rather than protecting wealthy pharmaceutical companies’ bottom lines or intellectual property derived from our collective investments, we must remove all impediments to vaccine distribution, including maximising capacity worldwide to ensure every person who wants this vaccine has access as soon as possible regardless of economic background, race, or nationality,” Espaillat said.“The World Trade Organization (WTO) has the ability to accomplish this task, and I encourage the Biden administration to urge the WTO and partner member-nations to use the tools at its disposal to do so,” he said.“I desperately want a return to normalcy,” said Levin. “But I want that normalcy to be sustainable! I want to be sure that this virus isn’t going to keep spreading, keep mutating - potentially in a way that’s resistant to the vaccines we’re getting right now. I don’t say this to fearmonger,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-asked-to-back-india-south-africa-at-wto-on-covid-19-vaccines-101616033130090.html
18-03-2021||World||Why Georgia attack spurs fears in Asian Americans||The shootings at three Georgia massage parlors and spas that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent, come on the heels of a recent wave of attacks against Asian Americans since the coronavirus entered the United States.As details emerge, many members of the Asian American community see the Georgia killings as a haunting reminder of harassment and assaults that have been occurring from coast to coast.WHAT HAPPENED IN ATLANTA?Five people were shot Tuesday at a massage parlor about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Atlanta, four of whom died. Police found three women shot to death at Gold Spa in Atlanta, and another woman dead at Aromatherapy Spa across the street.South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that its diplomats have confirmed that four of the victims who died were women of Korean descent.A 21-year-old white man, Robert Aaron Long, suspected in the shooting has been taken into custody and charged with murder.IS THERE A MOTIVE?As many raised concerns that the shootings are the latest in a string of hate crimes against Asian Americans, police suggested the suspect may have had other motives.Long told police the attack was not racially motivated. He claimed to have a “sex addiction,” and authorities said he apparently lashed out at what he saw as sources of temptation.But those statements spurred outrage and widespread skepticism given the locations and that most of the victims were women of Asian descent.HOW HAVE SOME ASIAN AMERICANS RESPONDED?Asian American lawmakers have expressed heartbreak on social media and emphasized the need to support Asian American communities during this moment. The official Twitter account of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus wrote that its members are “horrified by the news ... at a time when we're already seeing a spike in anti-Asian violence."Many lawmakers acknowledged a heightened sense of fear among Asian Americans as a result of the increasing number of hate incidents.Rep. Judy Chu of California reminded people of the effect of anti-Asian rhetoric.“As we wait for more details to emerge, I ask everyone to remember that hurtful words and rhetoric have real life consequences,” she wrote on Twitter. “Please stand up, condemn this violence, and help us #StopAsianHate.”HOW PREVALENT HAVE ASSAULTS AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS BEEN?Recent attacks, including the killing of an 84-year-old San Francisco man in February, have raised concerns about worsening hostilities toward Asian Americans. Nearly 3,800 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and its partner advocacy groups, since March 2020. Nationally, women reported more than double the number of hate incidents compared with men.Police in several major cities saw a sharp uptick in Asian-targeted hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, according to data collected by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. New York City went from three incidents to 27, Los Angeles from seven to 15, and Denver had three incidents in 2020 — the first reported there in six years.HOW FAR BACK DOES ANTI-ASIAN RACISM GO IN THE UNITED STATES?Racism against Asian Americans has long been an ugly thread of US history and was enshrined into law in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was designed to prevent Chinese American laborers from entering the U.S. as a result of widespread xenophobia.Asian Americans have also long been used as medical scapegoats in the U.S. and falsely blamed for public health problems, including a smallpox outbreak in San Francisco in the 1870s. This racist association between Asian Americans and illness and uncleanliness has also affected views of Asian food and contributes to the “perpetual foreigner” trope that suggests Asian people are fundamentally outsiders.This fueled suspicions of Japanese Americans during World War II, when many were sent to detention camps solely due to their ethnicity, as well as Islamophobia and prejudice toward Muslim and South Asian Americans following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.In 1982, 100 years after the Chinese Exclusion Act, a 27-year-old Chinese American, Vincent Chin, died after being attacked in Detroit because of his race. At the time, a growing Japanese auto industry was leading to major job losses in the city’s auto sector. His killers, two autoworkers, mistook him for Japanese, using racial slurs as they beat him outside a club where he was celebrating his bachelor party. His death led to protests from Asian Americans nationwide.WHAT ARE POLITICIANS DOING ABOUT THE RECENT UPTICK?President Joe Biden signed an executive order in January condemning anti-Asian xenophobia in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The directive acknowledges the role rhetoric from politicians, including the use of derogatory names for the coronavirus, has played in the rise of anti-Asian sentiment and hate incidents targeting Asian Americans. Former President Donald Trump, for example, has repeatedly used racial terms to describe the virus, including during a Tuesday night interview with Fox News.The rash of attacks in the past two months has renewed attention from politicians, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed legislation allocating $1.4 million to Stop AAPI Hate and the UCLA Asian American Studies Center for community resources and tracking of anti-Asian hate incidents.Initiatives such as increased police presence, volunteer patrols and special crime hot lines have also been suggested by local officials and citizens, with big-name brands like the NBA's Golden State Warriors and Apple, based in the Bay Area, promising to donate to the cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-georgia-attack-spurs-fears-in-asian-americans-101616032002099.html
18-03-2021||World||Man charged with killing 8 people at Georgia massage parlors||A white gunman was charged Wednesday with killing eight people at three Atlanta-area massage parlors in an attack that sent terror through the Asian American community, which has increasingly been targeted during the coronavirus pandemic.A day after the shootings, investigators were trying to unravel what might have compelled 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long to commit the worst mass killing in the U.S. in almost two years.Long told police that Tuesday’s attack was not racially motivated. He claimed to have a “sex addiction,” and authorities said he apparently lashed out at what he saw as sources of temptation. But those statements spurred outrage and widespread skepticism given the locations and that six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent.The shootings appear to be at the “intersection of gender-based violence, misogyny and xenophobia,” state Rep. Bee Nguyen said, the first Vietnamese American to serve in the Georgia House and a frequent advocate for women and communities of color.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that regardless of the shooter’s motivation, “it is unacceptable, it is hateful and it has to stop.”Authorities said they didn’t know if Long ever went to the massage parlors where the shootings occurred but that he was heading to Florida to attack “some type of porn industry.”“He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as something that allows him to go to these places, and it’s a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,” Cherokee County sheriff’s Capt. Jay Baker told reporters.Baker drew criticism for saying Long had “a really bad day" and “this is what he did." A Facebook page appearing to belong to Baker promoted a COVID-19 T-shirt with racist language about China last year.The Facebook account featured numerous photos of Baker going back months, including one of him in uniform outside the sheriff’s office. The account was deleted Wednesday night, and Baker did not immediately respond to voicemails and an email seeking comment.Meanwhile, Sheriff Frank Reynolds said it was too early to tell if the attack was racially motivated — “but the indicators right now are it may not be.”The Atlanta mayor said police have not been to the massage parlors in her city beyond a minor potential theft.“We certainly will not begin to blame victims,” Bottoms said.The attack was the sixth mass killing this year in the U.S., and the deadliest since the August 2019 Dayton, Ohio, shooting that left nine people dead, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University.It follows a lull in mass killings during the pandemic in 2020, which had the smallest number of such attacks in more than a decade, according to the database, which tracks mass killings defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter.The killings horrified the Asian American community, which saw the shootings as an attack on them, given a recent wave of assaults that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States. The virus was first identified in China, and then-President Donald Trump and others have used racially charged terms to describe it.The attacks began when five people were shot at Youngs Asian Massage Parlor near Woodstock, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Atlanta, authorities said. Four died: 33-year-old Delaina Ashley Yaun, 54-year-old Paul Andre Michels, 44-year-old Daoyou Feng and 49-year-old Xiaojie Tan, who owned the business.Yaun and her husband came to the spa on a date, her mother, Margaret Rushing, told WAGA-TV. Yaun leaves behind a 13-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter.Her half-sister, Dana Toole, said Yaun’s husband locked himself in a room and wasn’t injured.“He’s taking it hard,” Toole said. “He was there. He heard the gunshots and everything. You can’t escape that when you’re in a room and gunshots are flying — what do you do?”The manager of a boutique next door said her husband watched surveillance video after the shooting and the suspect was sitting in his car for as long as an hour before going inside.They heard screaming and women running from the business, said Rita Barron, manager of Gabby’s Boutique.The same car was then spotted about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away in Atlanta, where a call came in about a robbery at Gold Spa and three women were shot to death. Another woman was fatally shot at the Aromatherapy Spa across the street.Long was arrested hours later by Crisp County deputies and state troopers. He refused to stop on a highway and officers bumped the back of his car, causing him to crash, Sheriff Billy Hancock said.Officers found Long thanks to help from his parents, who recognized him from surveillance footage posted by authorities and gave investigators his cellphone information, which they used to track him, said Reynolds, the Cherokee County sheriff.“They’re very distraught, and they were very helpful in this apprehension,” he said.President Joe Biden called the attack “very, very troublesome."“We don’t yet know the motive, but what we do know is that the Asian-American community is feeling enormous pain tonight. The recent attacks against the community are un-American. They must stop," Biden tweeted.Vice President Kamala Harris expressed support to the Asian American community after the “tragic” shooting and offered condolences to the victims’ families.“We’re not yet clear about the motive. But I do want to say to our Asian American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people,” said Harris, the first Black and South Asian woman in that position.Over the past year, thousands of incidents of abuse have been reported to an anti-hate group that tracks incidents against Asian Americans, and hate crimes in general are at the highest level in more than a decade.“While the details of the shootings are still emerging, the broader context cannot be ignored,” Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta said in a statement. “The shootings happened under the trauma of increasing violence against Asian Americans nationwide, fueled by white supremacy and systemic racism.”Nico Straughan met Long when he moved to the area in seventh grade, saying Long brought a Bible to school every day and was “super nice, super Christian, very quiet.”“I don’t know what turn of heart he might have had, but he went from one of the nicest kids I ever knew in high school to being on the news,” Straughan said. “I mean, all my friends, we were flabbergasted.”The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize sex addiction in its main reference guide for mental disorders. While some people struggle to control their sexual behaviors, it’s often linked to other recognized disorders or moral views about sexuality, said David Ley, clinical psychologist and author of “The Myth of Sex Addiction.”“These sexual behaviors getting this label are a symptom, not a cause,” Ley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-charged-with-killing-8-people-at-georgia-massage-parlors-101616032789583.html
18-03-2021||World||Australia unemployment drops to 5.8% as recovery strengthens||Australia’s jobless rate tumbled in February as rising sentiment from a vaccine rollout combined with fiscal and monetary stimulus accelerated the economy’s recovery and returned employment to pre-pandemic levels.Unemployment dropped to 5.8% from a revised 6.3% in January, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday in Sydney. Employment jumped by 88,700 in February, compared with an expected 30,000 gain. The participation rate was unchanged at 66.1%, in line with expectations.“The strong employment growth this month saw employment rise above 13 million people, and was 4,000 people higher than March 2020,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS.The Australian dollar advanced following the data’s release and was trading at 78.23 U.S. cents at 11:44 a.m. in Sydney.Australia is experiencing a V-shaped recovery as the containment of Covid-19 boosts confidence and encourages cashed-up households to spend. That’s prompted firms to accelerate hiring and people to resume job-hunting.The Reserve Bank of Australia said last month it was extending its quantitative easing program by a further A$100 billion ($78 billion) and reiterated that it doesn’t expect to increase interest rates until 2024. It’s trying to keep a lid on a currency, which left unchecked could appreciate further and hurt exports and employment.Among other details in today’s jobs report:The central bank’s most recent forecasts show the jobless rate falling to around 6% by the end of this year and 5.5% at the end of 2022. Under an optimistic scenario for unemployment, the rate would drop to 4.75% by the end of next year.The labor market’s strength might cool in the period ahead as the government’s vast wage-subsidy program JobKeeper, designed to keep workers attached to their employers, expires at the end of this month. The government is providing ongoing support to industries like tourism and airlines that are still struggling from closed borders.The RBA late last year cut interest rates and its three-year yield target to 0.10% and initiated a quantitative easing program to lower borrowing costs across the economy. That came on the heels of the government announcing tax cuts, incentives for firms to invest and hire and infrastructure projects to boost activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-unemployment-drops-to-5-8-as-recovery-strengthens-101616032028042.html

But Covid-19 transmission dynamics so far appear to have been influenced mainly by government interventions like mask mandates and travel restrictions, they said, rather than the weather.The task team therefore insisted that weather and climate conditions alone should for now not be the trigger for loosening anti-Covid restrictions."At this stage, evidence does not support the use of meteorological and air quality factors as a basis for governments to relax their interventions aimed at reducing transmission," said task team co-chair Ben Zaitchik of the earth and planetary sciences department at The John Hopkins University in the United States.He pointed out that during the first year of the pandemic, infections in some places rose in warm seasons, "and there is no evidence that this couldn't happen again in the coming year".Also Read: Prosecutions for mask, distancing violations drop from Oct-Nov peakThe experts, who focused only on outdoor meteorology and air quality conditions in the report, said laboratory studies had provided some evidence the virus survives longer in cold, dry weather and when there is low ultraviolet radiation.But it remained unclear whether meteorological influences "have a meaningful influence on transmission rates under real world conditions".They also highlighted that evidence around the impact of air quality on the virus remained "inconclusive".There was some preliminary evidence that poor air quality increases Covid-19 mortality rates, "but not that pollution directly impacts airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-may-become-seasonal-if-it-persists-for-many-years-un-101616030849533.html
18-03-2021||World||Countries should keep using AstraZeneca vaccine: WHO experts||World Health Organization experts on Wednesday recommended countries continue to use the AstraZeneca vaccine, but said they were looking into the jab's safety after a slew of countries suspended its use over health fears.The WHO, Europe's medicines regulator and AstraZeneca itself have repeatedly said the vaccine was safe after several countries reported feared links with blood clots or brain haemorrhages.The suspensions have marred the global vaccine drive aimed at ending a year-long pandemic that has already killed more than 2.6 million people around the world since it first emerged in China in late 2019.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBut the WHO's vaccine experts said Wednesday it was still better to take the AstraZeneca vaccine than not -- adding that it was looking into available data on the jab."The WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data," the UN health agency said in a statement."At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue."The recommendation echoed a similar statement from the European Medicines Agency on Tuesday advising countries to continue using the vaccine, saying there was no link with clots.The Amsterdam-based agency said in a statement is holding an extraordinary meeting Thursday to finalise its conclusions on the blood clot issue and "make any necessary recommendations for further action".Several countries from France to Venezuela to Indonesia said they would not use the vaccine after several reports emerged of blood clots and brain haemorrhages in people who had received the vaccine.The British-Swedish jab has been dogged by controversy from early on in its rollout, after some countries initially recommended it for people over the age of 65 and then backpedalled, saying there was insufficient data for people in the age group that had received the shot.The firm later sparred with the EU, which accused it of failing to fulfil vaccine contracts after the bloc's immunisation campaign came under fire for a sputtering start.- 'Crisis of the century' -The head of the EU Commission on Wednesday threatened to introduce export curbs to stop suppliers within the EU from sending jabs outside the bloc to ensure "reciprocity" from other vendors.Ursula von der Leyen singled out Britain, which she accuses of operating a de facto export ban to achieve its own vaccine success at home, which London furiously denies.She said the EU was "still waiting" for its AstraZeneca orders to come out of production sites in Britain, despite the fact that 10 million doses from other manufacturers had entered the United Kingdom from the EU."This is an invitation to show us that there are also doses from the UK coming to the European Union, so that we have reciprocity," she said.The warning came as the EU chief also unveiled plans for a digital certificate that could allow people who have been vaccinated to travel freely withing the bloc.The pass could also apply to people with a recent negative test, or who have been previously infected and therefore are presumed to have antibodies, she said, calling the pandemic "the crisis of the century".Governments are hoping that vaccines will clear the path to a return to normal, more than a year into the pandemic that has plunged the world into a devastating recession and subject much of humanity to some sort of anti-virus restrictions.In Ireland, St Patrick's day celebrations were dampened for a second year running with the country still facing restrictions -- after the first wave of anti-virus measures shut the party down last year."It's a year on now and... we seem to be back where we started," said publican Tom Cleary, perched on a barstool in Dublin next to a Guinness tap fashioned in the shape of the Celtic harp."It's sad there's no end in sight," he told AFP. "I mean, will we be here next St Patrick's Day with the same problems?"- New lockdowns - More than 382 million doses of vaccine have been administered globally, the vast majority in wealthier countries while many poorer nations have yet to receive a single jab.AstraZeneca's shot, among the cheapest available, was billed as the vaccine of choice for poorer nations and the clot reports have had an impact beyond Europe.The suspensions come as some countries see worrying new caseloads, including in Iraq and India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for "quick and decisive steps" to halt a new wave of infection.In France, President Emmanuel Macron was to decide Wednesday whether to impose a weekend lockdown on the Paris region as it faced its own third wave of infections that have bloated hospital ICUs.And Poland announced a three-week partial lockdown of its own, while in the South Pacific the health minister of Papua New Guinea issued an urgent appeal for vaccines to stave off a wave of new infections."The community transmission is out there, and I'm pretty sure that we haven't detected a lot of it," Jelta Wong told AFP, saying his country was "running at full throttle" to prevent further spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-should-keep-using-astrazeneca-vaccine-who-experts-101616028181846.html
18-03-2021||World||North Korea cites hostile police of the US, ignores offer for talks||North Korea said Thursday it will ignore a US offer for talks unless it withdraws its hostile policy on the North, days after Washington said it reached out to Pyongyang through various channels.The statement by Choe Son Hui, the first foreign minister, came hours before the top diplomats and defense chiefs of the United States and South Korea meet in Seoul in their first joint talks in five years to discuss North Korea's nuclear programme.“We don't think there is need to respond to the US delaying-time trick again,” Choe said in a statement carried by state media. “We have already declared our stand that no (North Korea)-US contact and dialogue of any kind can be possible unless the US rolls back its hostile policy toward (North Korea). Therefore, we will disregard such an attempt of the US in the future, too.”US-led diplomacy on North Korea's nuclear programme remains stalemated for about two years because of disputes over US-led sanctions on the North.Experts are debating over whether the United States and its allies should settle for a deal that would freeze North Korea's nuclear activities in return for relaxing sanctions to prevent its arsenal from further growing.Earlier this week, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to abandon rapprochement deals with South Korea and warned the United States to “refrain from causing a stink,” while criticising regular US-South Korean military drills that her government views as an invasion rehearsal.Choe again took issue with this month's drills, saying that the United States “openly started aggression-minded joint military exercises targeting us.”Some experts say North Korea, which is eager to win sanctions relief, may further raise animosities with missile tests to boost its leverage in potential negotiations with the United States.North Korea's moribund economy is suffering further setbacks because of the pandemic-related border closure that has significantly shrunk its external trade and a spate of natural disasters last summer.Blinken said during a visit to Tokyo earlier this week that Washington reached out to North Korea through several channels starting in mid-February, but it hasn't received any response. He said the Biden administration was looking forward to completing its policy review on North Korea in coming weeks and was looking both at possible “additional pressure measures” and “diplomatic paths.”When Blinken met South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong on Wednesday, he said the United States will work with South Korea, Japan and other allies to achieve the denuclearisation of North Korea.According to the State Department, Blinken and Chung also reaffirmed a shared commitment to address North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile issues that they said are “a priority for the alliance.”Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are in Seoul for Thursday's “two plus two” meeting with their South Korean counterparts, the first such contact between the two countries in five years. Before coming to Seoul, they had similar security talks with Japanese officials in Tokyo.Blinken and Austin's Asian trip is the first overseas tour by Cabinet-level officials of the Biden administration since its inauguration in January. Biden is pushing to restore alliances that were frayed under his predecessor Donald Trump's “America First” approach and bolster a US leadership on the world stage.South Korea and Japan, which together host a total of about 80,000 US troops, are at the centre of the Biden administration's efforts to return the Asia-Pacific to the top of the US foreign policy agenda to cope with a rise in China's power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-cites-hostile-police-of-the-us-ignores-offer-for-talks-101616027923202.html
18-03-2021||World||Tanzania's President John Magufuli dies at 61||Tanzania's President John Magufuli, one of Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptics, has died aged 61, Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan said on Wednesday after a more than two-week absence from public life that led to speculation about his health.She said he died from the heart disease that had plagued him for a decade. She said burial arrangements were under way and announced 14 days of mourning and the flying of flags at half staff. State television broadcast mournful and religious songs.Magufuli, had not been seen in public since Feb. 27, sparking rumours that he had contracted Covid-19. Officials denied on March 12 that he had fallen ill and on Monday the vice president urged Tanzanians not to listen to rumours from outside the country and said it was normal for a human being to be checked for the flu or fever..“Dear Tanzanians, it is sad to announce that today 17 March 2021 around 6 p.m. we lost our brave leader, President John Magufuli who died from heart disease at Mzena hospital in Dar es Salaam where he was getting treatment," the vice president said on state broadcaster TBC.He was Tanzania's first president to die while in office.Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said on Friday that he had spoken to Magufuli, and blamed the narrative of the president's ailment on some "hateful" Tanzanians living abroad.Tundu Lissu, Magufuli's main rival in the October election when the president won a second five-year term, had suggested Tanzania's leader had been flown to Kenya for treatment for COVID-19 and then moved to India in a coma.After the death was announced, opposition leader Zitto Kabwe said he had spoken to Vice President Hassan to offer condolences for Magufuli's death. "The nation will remember him for his contribution to the development of our country," Kabwe said in a statement published on Twitter.HASSAN WOULD BE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENTAccording to Tanzania's Constitution, Vice President Hassan, 61, should assume the presidency for the remainder of the five-year term that Magufuli began serving last year after winning a second term. She would be the East African nation's first female president.Born in the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, Hassan studied economics in Britain, worked for the U.N.'s World Food Programme and then held various government posts prior to becoming Tanzania's first female vice president in 2015.Hassan said Magufuli was admitted on March 6 to Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute for heart problems and discharged the next day. A week later he felt bad and was rushed to Mzena hospital where he was getting treatment under supervision of doctors from the cardiac institute, she said.In Dar es Salaam, the country's commercial capital with more than two million residents, the streets were empty when news of Magufuli's death was announced just before midnight."I remember him since his days when he was minister of works and then he became president, a president who worked hard that even if you didn't agree with him it got to a point that you agreed with him. I appreciated him, he did a really good job," one man, Patrice Tarimo, said in Dar es Salaam after hearing the news.THE BULLDOZERNicknamed "The Bulldozer" because of his reputation for pushing through policies despite opposition, Magufuli frustrated the World Health Organization (WHO) during the pandemic by playing down the threat from Covid-19, saying god and remedies such as steam inhalation would protect Tanzanians.The former chemistry teacher had mocked coronavirus tests, denounced vaccines as part of a Western conspiracy to take Africa's wealth, and opposed mask-wearing and social distancing.Tanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it had reported 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to the WHO, which has urged the government to be more transparent.He was re-elected for a second term in 2020, winning 84% of the vote in an election the opposition said was marred by irregularities and whose results it rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tanzanias-president-john-magufuli-who-denied-covid-19-dies-at-61-101616026450453.html
18-03-2021||World||US used 'cheap tricks' to initiate contact: North Korea||A top North Korean diplomat confirmed that the United States had recently tried to initiate contact, but blasted the attempts as a "cheap trick" that would never be answered until Washington drops hostile policies.The statement by Choe Son Hui, first vice minister of foreign affairs for North Korea, is the first detailed rebuttle of tentative approaches by the new US administration under President Joe Biden, who took office in January.It came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting South Korea alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a first overseas trip by top-level members of Biden's administration.The attempts at contact were made by sending e-mails and telephone messages via various routes, including by a third country, she said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.Choe said North Korea had already made clear it would not talk while the United States maintains hostile policies such as military drills and sanctions, and that the attempts at contact were a "cheap trick" for gaining time and building up public opinion."What has been heard from the US since the emergence of the new regime is only lunatic theory of 'threat from North Korea' and groundless rhetoric about 'complete denuclearization,' she said.Speaking in Seoul on Wednesday, Blinken accused North Korea of committing "systemic and widespread abuses" against its own people and said the United States and its allies were comitted to the denuclearisation of North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-used-cheap-tricks-to-initiate-contact-north-korea-101616019617073.html
18-03-2021||World||Biden's 'pay the price' threat to Putin prompts diplomatic crisis as Russia recalls US ambassador||Russia called its US ambassador back to Moscow for consultations on Wednesday after Joe Biden described Vladimir Putin as a "killer" who would "pay a price" for election meddling, prompting the first major diplomatic crisis for the new American president.In an interview with ABC News, Biden was asked about a US intelligence report that the Russian leader tried to harm his candidacy in the November 2020 election and promote that of Donald Trump."He will pay a price," the 78-year-old Biden said.Asked if he thought Putin, who has been accused of ordering the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and other rivals, is a "killer," Biden said: "I do."The comments were aired as the US Commerce Department announced it was toughening export restrictions imposed on Russia as punishment for Navalny's poisoning.Russia responded by summoning its envoy home, but stressed that it wanted to prevent an "irreversible deterioration" in relations."The Russian ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, has been invited to come to Moscow for consultations conducted with the aim of analyzing what should be done and where to go in the context of ties with the United States," the Russian foreign ministry said.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told RIA Novosti that "responsibility for further deterioration of Russian-American ties fully rests with the United States."In Washington, the State Department noted the Russian move and said the United States will "remain clear-eyed about the challenges that Russia poses."White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked by reporters whether the president considers Putin literally or just metaphorically a killer."He does not hold back on his concerns about what we see as malign and problematic actions," Psaki said, citing election interference, Navalny's poisoning, cyberattacks and bounties on US troops in Afghanistan."He's not going to hold back in his direct communications, nor is he going to hold back publicly," she said. "We are not going to look the other way as we saw a little bit over the last four years.""From his first phone call with President Putin, President Biden has been clear that the United States will also respond to a number of destabilizing actions," she said.Asked about that phone call by ABC News, Biden said he had a "long talk" with Putin after taking office in January."The conversation started off, I said, 'I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared'," Biden said.Biden's assessment that Putin is a "killer" marked a stark contrast with Trump's steadfast refusal to say anything negative about the Russian president.In a 2017 interview with Fox News, Trump was asked about Putin being a "killer." "There are a lot of killers," he replied. "You think our country's so innocent?"'Know the other guy'Despite his thoughts about the Russian leader, Biden said "there are places where it's in our mutual interest to work together.""That's why I renewed the START agreement with him," he said of the nuclear treaty. "That occurred while he's doing this, but that's overwhelmingly in the interest of humanity, that we diminish the prospect of a nuclear exchange."Biden said he had learned from dealing with "an awful lot" of leaders during a political career spanning almost five decades -- including eight years as vice president -- that the most important thing was to "just know the other guy."Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, denounced Biden for agreeing with the description of Putin as a "killer.""Biden insulted the citizens of our country," Volodin said. "Attacks on (Putin) are attacks on our country."The Kremlin on Wednesday also dismissed the US determination that Russia had targeted election infrastructure during the 2020 presidential election."It is absolutely groundless and unsubstantiated," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, and an "excuse" to impose new sanctions.Tense relationsAccording to US intelligence, Putin and other senior officials "were aware of and probably directed" Russia's influence operation to sway the vote in Trump's favor.It concluded, however, that the election results were not compromised.Russia faced allegations of US election meddling in 2016 for launching a social media campaign to boost Trump's candidacy and discredit his opponent Hillary Clinton.After Biden's victory over Trump, Putin was among the last world leaders to congratulate the newly elected Democratic president.Tensions between the former Cold War rivals have soared in recent months over hacking allegations and US demands that Russia free Navalny.The Commerce Department said the new sanctions prevent export to Russia of more items controlled for national security reasons, including technology and software."The Department of Commerce is committed to preventing Russia from accessing sensitive US technologies that might be diverted to its malign chemical weapons activities," it said.Navalny returned to Russia in January after being treated for the poisoning in Germany, and is serving a two-and-a-half year jail term in a penal colony outside Moscow.The latest sanctions add to US penalties imposed on Moscow since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-recalls-envoy-biden-s-pay-the-price-warning-prompts-diplomatic-crisis-101616018400493.html
18-03-2021||World||Hardline Hefazat-e-Islam supporters attack Hindu village in Bangladesh: Report||Thousands of hardline Islamist organisation Hefazat-e-Islam supporters on Wednesday attacked a Hindu village in Shalla upazila of Sunamgan district, after a Hindu man criticised the group joint-secretary general Mawlana Mufti Mamunul's speech in social media post.A young Hindu man from Noagaon, Shalla upazila allegedly made a Facebook post criticizing Mamunul, who opposed the sculpture of Bangabandhu on Tuesday.After this, a mob with makeshift weapons attacked the village on Wednesday, Dhaka Tribune reported.Hefazat leaders in the area had already staged a protest on Tuesday night, accusing the social media post of inciting religious violence.To bring the situation under control, the police arrested the youth the same night.However, several thousand followers of Hefazat leader Mamunul Haque from Kashipur, Nachni, Chandipur and some other Muslim-populated villages gathered in Noagaon village at around 9 am on Wednesday and attacked the homes of local Hindus.According to the police, 70-80 houses were vandalized in the incident.Habibpur union chairman Vivekananda Majumder Bakul said several houses in the village had been attacked.Many local Hindus fled their homes to save themselves. The followers of Hefazat-e-Islam entered the village, ransacked and looted many houses.An umbrella platform for ulema (religious scholars), Hefazat-e-Islam was established in 2010 in Chittagong ostensibly to defend Islam from ruling Awami League's allegedly anti-Islamic policies, especially a proposed policy to confer equal inheritance rights to womenIn 2013, it mobilized its supporters against surging secular activism in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hardline-hefazat-e-islam-supporters-attack-hindu-village-in-bangladesh-report-101616007480061.html
