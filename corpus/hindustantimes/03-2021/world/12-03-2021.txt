It had referenced Australia’s decision to join Exercise Malabar 2020.“The decision, announced after the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) held in Tokyo, has pulled Australia militarily back into Quad, an informal strategic forum originally formed by the United States, Japan, Australia and India in 2007,” Xinhua had reported.“There is no reason for China to be messed around with such baseless speculations as China, though having taken note of the latest development, has made it clear that military cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability,” the report had added.Wang Yi, China’s state councillor and foreign minister, had last year dismissed Quad as a “so-called Indo-Pacific new Nato”.Wang was quoted in a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry as saying the “Indo-Pacific strategy” proposed by the US is in essence aimed at building a so-called Indo-Pacific “new Nato” underpinned by the quadrilateral mechanism involving India, the US, Japan and Australia.“The strategy is to trumpet the old-fashioned Cold War mentality to stir up confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition, in a bid to maintain the dominance and hegemonic system of the United States,” Wang was quoted as saying during a visit to Malaysia last October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/refrain-from-forming-exclusive-cliques-china-on-quad-summit-101615571919983.html
12-03-2021||World||Google slams Microsoft over support for media antitrust bill||Alphabet Inc.’s Google attacked Microsoft Corp. for rallying support for legislation that would give news publishers more power to negotiate with technology platforms for payment for content.Google said in a blog post on Friday that Microsoft is engaging in “naked corporate opportunism” by appearing before Congress to back a proposal that would allow media organizations to band together to negotiate with Google and Facebook Inc.“They are reverting to their familiar playbook of attacking rivals and lobbying for regulations that benefit their own interests,” wrote Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker. “They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.”Google’s statement came ahead of a hearing Friday held by the House antitrust panel that’s considering legislative proposals aimed at reining in the power of Google and Facebook, and fostering competition in digital markets. The committee, led by Democratic Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, last fall released the findings of a 16-month investigation that accused tech platforms of abusing their dominance.Friday’s hearing was focused on legislation introduced in the House and Senate this week that would give news publishers an antitrust exemption to band together to negotiate with the tech platforms.‘Lost Forever’“It’s clear that we must do something in the short term to save trustworthy journalism before it’s lost forever,” Cicilline said. “This bill is one support measure, not the answer for ensuring the long-term health of the news industry. We need an all-of-the-above approach to save journalism and to take out monopoly power.”Microsoft President Brad Smith testified in favor of the news media bill. He lamented the closing of small newspapers in communities across the country, and blamed tech companies for siphoning advertising revenue from news organizations. He placed particular blame on Google’s control over the digital advertising market.“The problems that beset journalism today are caused in part by a fundamental lack of competition in the search and ad tech markets that are controlled by Google,” Smith said in his written testimony. “As a result, there is a persistent and structural imbalance between a technology gatekeeper and the free press, particularly small and independent news organizations.”Pay for ContentMicrosoft is pushing lawmakers around the world to approve measures to force the tech platforms to pay news outlet for content. The software maker publicly backed a law in Australia that prompted Facebook last month to impose a news blackout on its site, and has called for a similar measure in Europe.Smith has couched Microsoft’s support as a way to promote a healthy news industry and democratic speech, but the move could also help Microsoft’s Bing search engine gain ground against Google. Microsoft compensates news organizations through licensing deals for its MSN web portal, and said last year that it has paid out more than $1 billion since 2014.Republicans also blamed Google and Facebook for harming news publishers and accused them of using their power to censor content.“These companies track and seek to run our lives through their technologies and algorithms,” said Republican Ken Buck of Colorado. “Big tech companies have become digital kings and they represent precisely the kind of political power the antitrust laws are designed to tackle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-slams-microsoft-over-support-for-media-antitrust-bill-101615569646563.html

12-03-2021||World||Britain urges citizens to leave Myanmar as violence against protesters mounts||Britain urged its citizens to leave Myanmar on Friday as security forces cracked down on more protests against the junta, forcing patients out of a hospital in the west of the country and arresting a Polish journalist.After 12 people were killed on Thursday in one of the bloodiest days since the Feb. 1 coup, the British foreign office warned that "political tension and unrest are widespread since the military takeover and levels of violence are rising".Friday's protests came as South Korea said it would suspend defence exchanges and reconsider development aid to Myanmar because of the violence.More than 70 protesters have now been killed in the Southeast Asian nation since the military seized power, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group said.Memorials were held for some of them on Friday, including one man whose family said his body had been taken by the security forces and not returned.A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment."Despite repeated demands of the international community, including South Korea, there are an increasing number of victims in Myanmar due to violent acts of the military and police authorities," South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement.It said Seoul would suspend defence exchanges, ban arms exports, limit exports of other strategic items, reconsider development aid and grant humanitarian exemptions allowing Myanmar nationals to stay in South Korea until the situation improved.Protests were held in Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, and several other towns on Friday, photographs posted on social media by witnesses and news organisations showed. Many were dispersed by security forces.Poland's foreign ministry said a Polish journalist was arrested, the second foreign reporter to be detained. A Japanese journalist was briefly held while covering a protest.Riot police and armed soldiers entered the general hospital in Hakha, in the western Chin state, forcing all 30 patients to leave and evicting staff from on-site housing, said local activist Salai Lian.Soldiers have been occupying hospitals and universities across Myanmar as they try to quash a civil disobedience movement that started with government employees like doctors and teachers but has expanded into a general strike that has paralysed many sectors of the economy.The country has been in crisis since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government last month, detained her and officials of her National League for Democracy party, and set up a ruling junta of generals.Junta spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said on Thursday Suu Kyi had accepted gold and illegal payments worth $600,000 while in government. He said Phyo Min Thein, a former chief minister of Yangon, who is also in jail, had admitted making the payments.Adding corruption charges to the accusations facing Suu Kyi, 75, could bring her a harsher penalty. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate currently faces four comparatively minor charges, such as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and flouting coronavirus curbs."This accusation is the most hilarious joke," Suu Kyi's lawyer Khin Maung Zaw said on social media on Friday. "She might have other weaknesses but she doesn't have weakness in moral principle."'Crimes against humanity'Thursday's dead included eight people killed when security forces fired on a protest in the central town of Myaing, the AAPP said.Chit Min Thu was killed in the North Dagon district of Yangon. His wife, Aye Myat Thu, told Reuters he had insisted on joining the protests despite her appeals that he stay at home for the sake of their son."He said it's worth dying for," she said through her tears. "He is worried about people not joining the protest. If so, democracy will not return."The bloodshed came hours after the U.N. Security Council had called for restraint from the army.U.N. human rights investigator Thomas Andrews on Friday dismissed as "absurd" comments by a senior Myanmar official that authorities were exercising "utmost restraint". Addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, he called for a united approach to "strip away the junta's sense of impunity."The army did not respond to requests for comment on the latest deaths, but junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said on Thursday the security forces were disciplined and used force only when necessary.Rights group Amnesty International accused the army of using lethal force against protesters and said many killings it had documented amounted to extra-judicial executions.Suu Kyi fought for decades to overturn military rule under previous juntas before tentative democratic reforms began in 2011. She had spent a total of about 15 years under house arrest.The army has justified taking power by saying that a November election, overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi's party, was marred by fraud - an assertion rejected by the electoral commission.The junta has said a state of emergency will last for a year, but has not set a date for the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-urges-citizens-to-leave-myanmar-as-violence-against-protesters-mounts-101615565638600.html
12-03-2021||World||Farmers’ issue ‘absolutely, totally’ a matter for India: UK minister||India as a democracy has guaranteed the right to protest throughout and the farmers’ protests over agricultural reforms is an issue that is “absolutely and totally” a matter for the government of India, UK minister Lord Tariq Ahmad said on Friday ahead of his visit to New Delhi.A debate in a UK parliamentary committee room earlier this week over the issue was condemned by India as “gross interference in the politics of another democratic country” and even led to Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla calling in British High Commissioner Alex Ellis for a meeting.Lord Ahmad, the minister of state responsible for Indian affairs in the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), will begin his five-day visit to India on Monday.“It was a very cordial meeting. It was the first time they were formally meeting and whilst the issue of the protests was discussed and India made clear their position, we have also reiterated the point that the parliamentary scheduling of debates and the nature of our parliamentary democracy is such (but) the government's position can be made very clear too,” he said during a virtual pre-visit interaction with reporters here.“The protests have been taking place for several months now and India as a democracy has totally guaranteed and secured the right to protest, which we fully acknowledge. I equally fully want to endorse, and regularly articulate, that the principle of the farmers' protest in terms of the actual nature of it is absolutely and totally a matter for the government of India. That position has been longstanding and has not changed,” he said.The minister categorically ruled out any scope of the matter overshadowing his extensive schedule in India, which covers ministerial meetings in New Delhi, followed by interactions with regional and community leaders in Chandigarh, Chennai and Hyderabad before concluding with trade talks in Mumbai.The visit is seen as further finalising the groundwork for the forthcoming tour of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is scheduled to visit India in the coming weeks ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall in June.“The intense programme underlines the importance of our strong relationship with India. It follows on from our ongoing senior-level engagement at ministerial level. We look forward to the Prime Minister's (Johnson) visit in advance of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi visiting as part of the G7,” the minister said.“Our relationship with India is not just one of bilateral importance, it's also about how these two countries are working together and there's no better illustration than the current Covid-19 pandemic which grips us… The role that India has played as the pharmacy of the world has been phenomenal.“We've been extremely collaborative in our approach to this and publicly acknowledged the role India played in unlocking certain other pharmaceuticals, including the delivery of paracetamol,” Ahmad said.With reference to planned supplies of a batch of Covishield vaccines from the Serum Institute of India to the UK, the minister reiterated that it symbolised the wide range of bilateral ties and would not impact both countries’ commitment to ensuring supplies to more vulnerable regions through the UN-led COVAX facility.“We work together with India on securing domestic supplies but that hasn't taken away from our commitment through Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance) to the COVAX facility. India, through the likes of the Serum Institute of India, are absolutely integrated to ensure the supply of that,” he said.Ahmad’s visit to India will coincide with the UK’s release of the government’s Integrated Review into its post-Brexit foreign policy priorities next week, which is widely expected to confirm a so-called Indo-Pacific tilt in favour of countries like India.While not wanting to be drawn into the specifics of the review, the minister said: “It can be taken as read in as much as government policy is concerned, there is a very strong belief and focus on the Indo-Pacific tilt and it’s right we do so. When you look at the countries within that part of the region, India is foremost in our minds.”This will be the latest in a series of high-profile UK visits to India in preparation for Prime Ministers Johnson and Modi signing off on a highly-anticipated UK-India Enhanced Trade Partnership, which is seen a precursor to a wider free trade agreement (FTA) in the future.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops.The Indian government has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the mandi system.Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions have not been able to resolve the deadlock.India has emphasised that the protests by farmers must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity and the Ministry of External Affairs said that some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken," it said last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-issue-absolutely-totally-a-matter-for-india-uk-minister-101615568517853.html
12-03-2021||World||'Free and open' Indo-Pacific essential for all, says Biden||In a clear message to China, President Joe Biden told leaders of the Quad coalition on Friday that a "free and open" Indo-Pacific is essential to their countries and vowed that the US was committed to working with its partners and allies in the region to achieve stability amidst Beijing's coercive actions.In his opening remarks during the first virtual summit of the Quad leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Biden described Quad as a new mechanism to enhance cooperation and raise mutual ambition as the member states address accelerating climate change."A free and open Indo-Pacific is essential to each of our futures, our countries," Biden told the top leaders of the Quadrilateral alliance involving the US, India, Australia and Japan.“This is a group particularly important because it is dedicated to the practical solutions and concrete results," he said at the virtual summit, which is the first conclave of the top leaders of the Quad."We know our commitments...Our region is governed by international law, committed to all the universal values and free from coercion but I am optimistic about our prospect,” he said, in an apparent reference to China which is flexing its muscles in the strategically vital region.Biden noted that their meeting is also the first multilateral summit that he had the opportunity to host as president since assuming office on January 20."The Quad is going to be vital in our cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and I look forward to looking closely to working with all of you in the coming years," Biden told the Quad leaders as he requested Prime Minister Modi to speak."It's great to see you," Biden, who is attending the summit less than two months after he took charge as US President, told Prime Minister Modi.The other Quad leaders expressed similar excitement and willingness to collaborate in the Indo-Pacific region.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison thanked President Biden for brining in the four nations together and said that ''history teaches us that we are nations engaged together in a partnership of strategic trust of common hope and shared values, much can be achieved.''Stating that it will be the Indo-Pacific which will now shape the destiny of the world in the 21st century, Scott said that "as leaders of four great liberal democracies in Indo-Pacific let our partnership be the enabler of peace, stability and prosperity."Morrison said it was important to do so inclusively with the many nations in the region in order to respect and support their sovereignty, independence and security by upholding the values and supporting international law and to address many challenges from COVID to climate change.He said that Australia was ready to look into these tasks and do its share of heavy lifting.Earlier, Morrison dubbed the meet as "a historic meeting of four leaders from these nations, which are such close friends."Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga recalled the 2004 Tsunami disaster when Quad first member states came together."We received massive support from the US, Australia, and India in our response to the disaster. Joe visited the affected area soon after the disaster, and I think you once again," he said.The Quad summit took place as China and India are involved in a military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May last year. After lengthy rounds of talks, the two sides simultaneously withdrew troops from Pangong Lake area last month while talks are on for the withdrawal of soldiers from the rest of the friction points along the LAC.China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. In the East China Sea Japan has maritime disputes with China.Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.China has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both maritime areas in the South and East China seas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.Known as the "Quadrilateral Security Dialogue,” representatives for the four member nations have met periodically since its establishment in 2007.The Quad member states have been resolving to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.The foreign ministers of the Quad countries held a virtual meeting on February 18 during which they vowed to uphold a rules-based international order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of disputes.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.The Quad foreign ministers held their first meeting under the Quadrilateral or Quad framework in New York in September 2019.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.

Andrew Cuomo to resign in the wake of mounting allegations of sexual harassment and an allegation of groping.The Democratic governor has denied he ever touched anyone inappropriately, and has said he’s sorry if he ever made anyone uncomfortable.But a majority of state lawmakers are calling on him to resign, and Democratic congressional members including US Reps. Jerry Nadler and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez joined those calls Friday.

It also toughened curbs on economic activity and freedom of movement from Monday to try to rein in a rise in COVID-19 infections.Italy has reported more than 100,000 deaths from the disease since discovering its first cases 13 months ago, the seventh highest toll worldwide.Draghi said a new decree to be presented next week will extend furlough schemes, bolster income support for the poor and simplify procedures to compensate firms whose revenue have been hit by COVID closures.This package of measures, worth 32 billion euros ($38.17 billion), was already budgeted for by the previous government, while Draghi said he would ask parliament in April for authorisation to increase spending further.Draghi said Italy's medicines authority believed there was no link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and recent deaths of people who had taken it, which prompted Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Bulgaria to suspend the vaccine and Italy to block a batch.Italy is currently vaccinating some 170,000 people per day, the prime minister said, adding: "The goal is to triple that quickly."Amid reports of many Italians managing to get vaccinated ahead of the elderly and chronically sick, Draghi appealed for a sense of responsibility."I ask everyone to wait their turn," he said, citing the example of the 79-year-old head of state Sergio Mattarella, who was only vaccinated this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-hike-budget-deficit-further-italy-pm-draghi-on-how-to-support-economy-101615564326969.html
12-03-2021||World||Explained: Mexico’s landmark move to legalise marijuana and possible impact on US||Mexico’s lower house on Wednesday passed landmark legislation that would decriminalise the use of cannabis for recreational purposes. The legislation will now go to the Senate for a review and final vote, before President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, popularly known as AMLO, signs the bill into law, which would potentially make Mexico one of the biggest legal marijuana markets in the world.Mexico’s Supreme Court has set a April 30 deadline for lawmakers to pass the bill after the apex court declared the prohibition unconstitutional. López Obrador has also backed the bill, saying it would help the government curb drug-related violence which claims thousands of lives every year. Mexico is now on the verge of becoming the third country in the world, after Canada and Uruguay, to legalise cannabis nationwide for recreational use.The bill is aimed at establishing a system of licenses required for the entire chain of production, distribution, transformation and sales. Individuals will also be allowed to grow cannabis plant for personal use, with not more than six plants per individual and a maximum of eight in a single household. According to the bill in its current form, adults will be fined if they are caught with more than one ounce (28 grams) of marijuana. The bill also provides for a jail term for adults if they are caught with more than 12 pounds (5.6 kilogrammes) of marijuana.Lisa Sanchez, director of Mexico United Against Crime, a non-governmental organisation that has been pushing marijuana legalisation, told news agency AFP that “in theory, it will create the largest legal market in the world due to Mexico's production capacity.” Sanchez said that marijuana grows in Mexico in “natural conditions without the energy investments that are made in Canada.”The United States is likely to get sandwiched between potentially the two biggest legal marijuana markets if the bill becomes law. According to a Politico report, the move could even pressure US President Joe Biden, who doesn’t support legalising weed, to embrace marijuana. Although Biden doesn’t support full legalisation, he is in favour of ending criminal penalties and expanding medical research.The US House, controlled by Democrats, passed legislation in December 2020 that would end federal penalties for cannabis possession. However, the White House is yet to comment on whether Mexico’s move would change Biden’s stance on the use of marijuana for recreational purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-mexico-s-landmark-move-to-legalise-marijuana-possible-impact-on-us-101615563753686.html
12-03-2021||World||NYC prosecutor overseeing probe against Trump probe says won't seek reelection||The veteran New York City prosecutor overseeing a criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump said Friday that he won't seek reelection, opting against a primary fight with progressive candidates who say he's a relic, not a reformer.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and almost certainly guaranteeing it'll be a brand-new D.A. who sees the Trump case through. His term expires at the end of the year.Vance, a Democrat, counted Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction a year ago among his crowning achievements but faced withering criticism over other high-profile cases, including dropping rape charges against French financier Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011 and declining to prosecute Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. over fraud allegations in 2012.“I never imagined myself as District Attorney for decades like my predecessors. I never thought of this as my last job, even though it’s the best job and biggest honor I’ll ever have. I said twelve years ago that change is fundamentally good and necessary for any institution,” Vance, 66, said in a written statement.His decision not to seek reelection was widely anticipated, but he held off on making it official while the U.S. Supreme Court weighed whether his office could obtain Trump’s tax records. The court ruled in Vance’s favor last month.Some of the Democrats campaigning to replace Vance want to slash the office's budget, cut staff and skip prosecutions for a wider range of low-level offenses. Eight candidates — including six women and a Black man — are on the ballot for the party’s June primary, an election likely to decide Vance’s successor because Manhattan is so heavily Democratic.As D.A., Vance ended most prosecutions for possessing and smoking marijuana and for jumping subway turnstiles, slashing the cases handled by his office by nearly 60%, to about 42,000 in 2019. He also embraced diversionary programs for first-time offenders and established a unit to review old cases and remedy wrongful convictions.The Supreme Court ruling on access to Trump's taxes was a capstone for Vance's tenure as district attorney, ending an 18-month fight with Trump's lawyers and bolstering a grand jury investigation that has drawn worldwide attention.Vance's wide-ranging investigation includes examining whether Trump or his businesses lied about the value of assets to gain favorable loan terms and tax benefits, and hush-money payments paid to women on Trump’s behalf.Vance will lead that probe through the end of this year with his general counsel, Carey Dunne, who made appeals court arguments on the office's behalf. He recently hired former mafia prosecutor Mark Pomerantz to assist in the probe.The Trump case will likely be an early test for the next D.A. And in the short term, legal observers say, Vance's announcement could hasten the departure of prosecutors who've been loyal to him and won't want to work for his successor.The candidates have avoided speaking directly about the Trump matter, saying they didn't want to prejudge an ongoing investigation.“What’s really important is that if there’s a case or if it’s just an investigation that’s pretty far along that it’d be left in the hands of somebody who knows what they’re doing, who’s competent, who’s experienced, who has judgment and who doesn’t think politically,” said Daniel R. Alonso, Vance’s former chief assistant district attorney who's now a partner at Buckley LLP.Vance’s successor will be just the fourth elected district attorney in Manhattan in the last 80 years. Frank Hogan served for 31 years. Robert Morgenthau was in office for 34 years, until he was 90.It’s one of the most high-profile prosecution jobs in the world, dramatized on TV’s “Law and Order” and “Blue Bloods.” The district attorney oversees a staff of 500 lawyers and has a budget of about $125 million.A separate forfeiture fund bankrolled by Wall Street settlements and worth more than $800 million is used for grants to criminal justice and community organizations and big initiatives, such as testing backlogged rape kits.Vance ran as a death penalty opponent and positioned himself as a national criminal justice innovator, taking interest in national and global efforts to prevent cyberattacks, gun violence and the theft of artwork and antiquities.After he made a made a campaign pledge to re-examine the 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz, a 2012 tip led to a new suspect and ultimately a conviction.Weinstein’s conviction in a landmark #MeToo case last year boosted Vance’s lagging legacy, giving him a career-defining win in a tenure clouded by concerns that he repeatedly gave powerful people special treatment.They included sidestepping an effort to pursue charges against Weinstein in 2015 and striking a deal in 2016 so well-connected gynecologist Robert Hadden could avoid prison for allegedly sexually abusing patients. Vance's office reopened the Hadden case amid public outcry last year, and the doctor was indicted on federal charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyc-prosecutor-overseeing-probe-against-trump-probe-says-won-t-seek-reelection-101615563762960.html
12-03-2021||World||Memo banning Afghan girls from singing prompts #IAmMySong protest||A memo from Afghanistan's education ministry banning girls 12 years old and older from singing at school functions has been causing a stir on social media, prompting the authorities to say it was a mistake and that its authors had misunderstood the objective.Still, #IAmMySong is gaining traction on Twitter, with some Afghan girls singing their favorite tunes for the camera and calls popping up for petitions to oppose the directive.The controversy comes as women’s rights activists and civil society groups are fighting to ensure that fragile human rights gains made over the last 20 years in Afghanistan — since the U-led invasion ousted the Taliban regime — take center stage in the peace talks underway with the insurgents. It also shows how the rights of girls and women are under threat from conservatives on both sides of the protracted conflict.“This is Talibanization from inside the republic,” Sima Samar, an Afghan human rights activist of nearly 40 years, said on Friday. When they ruled the country, the Taliban — notorious for their repression of women — denied girls the right to education. Music, except religious songs, was also banned, as was television.The memo, which went to all school districts in Kabul, was rescinded, said ministry spokeswoman Najiba Arian, insisting that its authors had misunderstood the purpose. A new memo was subsequently sent, saying music groups for both secondary school girls and boys are banned.The objective was not to ban girls singing but to prevent boys and girls from participating in public events that could spread the coronavirus, she said. Afghanistan has recorded more than 55,000 cases of the virus and 2,451 deaths but testing is inadequate and the real numbers are believed to be far greater.The hashtag campaign was started by Ahmad Starmast, the founder of Afghanistan's Institute of Music. It has had over 600,000 clicks, according to Haroon Baluch of BytesforAll, a Pakistan-based rights organization that monitors internet traffic. He also said the trend is building.Sarmast said he began the #IAmMySong to “let authorities know that the people of Afghanistan oppose this decision and they will stand for the rights of the children, whether boys or girls.”The memo, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press, does not mention the pandemic or any health concerns. Rather it clearly states that girls older than 12 cannot perform in any public events and that singing at such events is strictly forbidden. It goes on to say that only female teachers can teach music to girls older than 12.“The education department of Kabul city, all government, private sector and literacy centers are seriously advised not to let female students . . . above 12 years of age participate and sing in any type of events or general programs," it said, with the exception of all-female gatherings.Samar, who launched Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission in 2002 and served as its head until 2019, said the directive violates basic human rights. It also violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children, to which Afghanistan is a signatory, she added.The memo violates both national and international law, Starmast said. According to one tweet, 100,000 signatures have been collected throughout several Afghan provinces to protest the directive.After the fiasco of the first memo, a second one went out. It banned both boys and girls older than 12 from singing or performing in public — an even more shocking directive as it takes “the right of choice and freedom of expression away from all students in secondary and high schools,” Starmast said.The education ministry has had to deal with other missteps recently. In December, it came under attack after suggesting children in first through third grade should be taught in mosques. After a furor erupted, the ministry was forced to correct itself, saying it was referring to rural areas where there are no school buildings so mosques are the only option for some of the country's poorest.Schools linked to mosques are known as madrassas and are often attended by the country's poorest. The Ministry of Interior was said in January to be preparing to register thousands of madrassas operating in the country.Focusing mostly on religious education rather than language, liberal arts and science, madrassas are run by hard-line clerics. They have also been accused of propagating jihad or holy war and spreading intolerance between Islam's two major sects, Sunni and Shiite Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/memo-banning-afghan-girls-from-singing-prompts-iammysong-protest-101615561481649.html

Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cooperation-between-countries-should-not-target-third-party-china-101615561279463.html
12-03-2021||World||Saudi King Salman sacks hajj and umrah minister in royal decrees||Saudi Arabia's King Salman dismissed Mohamed Benten as minister for the hajj and umrah, a position with a leading role in organising Islam's annual pilgrimage, a royal decree carried by state news agency (SPA) said on Friday.State minister, Issam ben Saeed, was appointed acting minister.Haj and Umrah, which generated billions of dollars each year before the pandemic, is a major source of income for the Saudi government."Mohammed Saleh ben Taher Benten, Minister of Hajj and Umrah shall be relieved form his position," SPA said in a tweet, without giving reasons behind the decision. Benten was appointed minister in 2016.The kingdom, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam’s holiest sites in Mecca and Medina and its peaceful organisation of the haj, sharply scaled back last year's haj to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, after barring Muslims abroad from the rite for the first time in modern times.Companies operating in the sector have been hit hard by the government's preventive measures. Before the pandemic, more than 1,300 hotels and hundreds of stores buzzed around the clock to cater to pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.Earlier this week, Jabal Omar Development Company, one of Saudi Arabia's largest listed property developers, secured 1.6 billion riyals ($427 million) in loans from Banque Saudi Fransi backed by a Finance Ministry guarantee, after being hit hard by the Mecca lockdown.Earlier this week, SPA said King Salman approved a range of initiatives aimed at assisting firms and individuals operating in the sector to mitigate Covid-related financial and economic effects they incurred during the lockdown.Separately, the royal decrees also included relieving the head of the General Aviation Authority, Abdulhadi al-Mansouri, from his position and appointing him at a foreign ministry post.Abdulaziz al-Duaelij was appointed as new head of the aviation authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-king-salman-sacks-hajj-and-umrah-minister-in-royal-decrees-101615560394086.html

12-03-2021||World||Japan fears satellite it made for Myanmar might be used for 'military purposes'||Myanmar's first satellite is being held on board the International Space Station following the Myanmar coup, while Japan's space agency and a Japanese university decide what to do with it, two Japanese university officials said.The $15 million satellite was built by Japan's Hokkaido University in a joint project with Myanmar's government-funded Myanmar Aerospace Engineering University (MAEU). It is the first of a set of two 50 kg microsatellites equipped with cameras designed to monitor agriculture and fisheries.Human rights activists and some officials in Japan worry that those cameras could be used for military purposes by the junta that seized power in Myanmar on Feb. 1.That has put the deployment on hold, as Hokkaido University holds discussions with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the two Hokkaido University officials said."We won't get involved in anything that has to do with the military. The satellite was not designed for that," one of the officials, a manager of the project, told Reuters, asking not to be identified."We are discussing what to do, but we don't know when it will be deployed. If it is halted, our hope is that the project could be restarted at some point."The manager did not say when the satellite was meant to be deployed, or when a decision would have to be taken by JAXA either to go ahead or delay it.The second Hokkaido University official said the contract with MAEU did not specify that the satellite cannot be used for military purposes. However, data from the spacecraft would be collected by the Japanese university and cannot be independently accessed by Myanmar officials, the second official said.Since the coup, university officials had been unable to contact the rector of MAEU, Prof Kyi Thwin, the second official added.Officials at JAXA could not be reached for comment. MAEU did not respond to calls seeking comment, nor did a spokesman for Myanmar's junta.The satellite was launched by NASA on Feb 20 as a small part of a large and varied payload of supplies to the International Space Station 400 km (250 miles) above the earth. It has since been kept by JAXA inside Japan's Kibo experiment module. JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi is one of the seven crew members now on board the space station.Japan has close ties to Myanmar and is one of its biggest aid donors. While condemning the violence, it has not taken as hard a stance against the coup as the United States and some other Western countries which have applied sanctions.While the spacecraft has not been built to military specifications, Teppei Kasai, Asia programme officer for Human Rights Watch, said it would be easy for Myanmar's army rulers to appropriate the technology for military use."So the involved Japanese universities should suspend the project and urgently review it for potential human rights risks," Kasai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-fears-satellite-it-made-for-myanmar-might-be-used-for-military-purposes-101615557132982.html
12-03-2021||World||India, China to ensure stability on LAC, call another meeting of commanders soon||India and China agreed on Friday to ensure stability in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and convene another meeting of senior military commanders soon to take forward disengagement and de-escalation at friction points on the disputed border.These were among the outcomes of a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which was held against the backdrop of the disengagement process stalling after the withdrawal of troops by both sides from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February.The meeting was held hours before the first summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which will be joined by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden. The Quad Summit is expected to lead to several initiatives aimed at countering China’s influence and actions across the Indo-Pacific.At the WMCC meeting, the two sides reviewed the situation in the western sector of the LAC and had “in-depth discussions on the remaining issues” in this sector, a statement from the external affairs ministry said.The two sides agreed to continue their dialogue through diplomatic and military channels to “reach a mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement from all friction points at the earliest”, the statement said.They also agreed to convene the 11th meeting of the senior military commanders “at an early date so that two sides could work towards complete disengagement from the remaining friction areas”, the statement added.The disengagement would enable both sides to “look at broader de-escalation of troops in the area and work towards restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas”. The two sides further agreed that in the interim period, they would “continue to maintain stability at ground level and prevent any untoward incident”, the statement said.A similarly worded readout issued from the Chinese side said the two sides had agreed to continue communications through diplomatic and military channels, “hold the next round of military-level talks as soon as possible, promote further de-escalation of the situation on the ground and jointly safeguard the hard-won peace and stability in the border areas”.The Indian statement said the two sides viewed the completion of disengagement on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake as providing a “good basis for the two sides to work towards early resolution” of remaining issues. It added that the agreement between the two foreign ministers during their meeting on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet in Moscow last September and their phone conversation last month “should continue to guide the work of two sides”.The Chinese readout noted that the two sides had positively evaluated the disengagement at Pangong Lake and had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on promoting resolution at other areas. It added that the two sides had agreed to stabilise the situation on the border and avoid any “repetition of the situation on the ground in accordance with the five-point consensus reached at the Moscow meeting of the two foreign ministers and the spirit of their February 25 phone call”.The WMCC meet was co-chaired additional secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and oceanic department of China’s foreign ministry.The 10th meeting of the senior military commanders was held on February 20 after the two sides completed the withdrawal of frontline troops with armoured formations and artillery from the banks of Pangong Lake. However, the two sides were unable to make progress on efforts to disengage at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains.The two sides have been locked in a standoff since May last year after Chinese troops impeded patrols by Indian forces and there were scuffles in the Ladakh and Sikkim sectors. A brutal clash at Galwan Valley last June – which left 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops dead and was the first incident on the LAC involving fatalities since 1975 – took bilateral ties to an all-time low.India has insisted that China’s actions on the LAC have seriously damaged bilateral ties and normalcy can be restored only by disengagement, de-escalation and restoration of the status quo on the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-to-ensure-stability-on-lac-call-another-meeting-of-commanders-soon-101615556851232.html
12-03-2021||World||Shell's oil trading earnings double in 2020 to USD 2.6 billion||Royal Dutch Shell's 2020 earnings from trading crude oil and refined products doubled from the previous year to $2.6 billion, helping to offset a sharp drop in fuel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.Shell's oil trading operations, known internally as Trading & Supply, accounted for 43% of the Oil Products division's total earnings of $5.995 billion in 2020. Trading earnings totalled $1.3 billion in 2019, Shell's annual report, which was released on Thursday, said.The unusually high contribution from trading helped Shell to weather one of the toughest years in the industry's history, when energy consumption collapsed during the pandemic.Shell, the world's largest energy trader, experienced a 28% drop in oil sales last year to 4.71 million barrels per day on average, the annual report said.Its 2020 profit dropped to its lowest in at least two decades.Shell's oil trading figures do not include natural gas, liquefied natural gas, power and renewables. Shell is the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader.Rival BP's trading arm made nearly $4 billion in 2020 on oil and gas trading, a copy of an internal BP presentation seen by Reuters showed, almost equalling the company's 2019 record trading profit.Companies can make large profits even during times of lower demand for commodities by storing products such as oil on shore or at sea. Shell's vast refining, trading and retail operations also allow it to take advantage of short-lived changes in supply and demand around the world.The strong trading results for BP and Shell show that there is real value creation which will transfer over into renewable power as the companies shift away from oil and gas, Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said in a note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shells-oil-trading-earnings-double-in-2020-to-usd-2-6-billion-101615557698026.html

12-03-2021||World||WHO says its advisory committee looking at AstraZeneca vaccine issues||A World Health Organization expert advisory committee is currently looking at AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after some countries paused distribution of it, but there is no reason not to use it, a spokeswoman said on Friday.Health authorities in several countries including Denmark, Norway, Iceland have suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine following reports of the formation of blood clots in some people who have been vaccinated.Margaret Harris told a briefing that it was an "excellent vaccine" and that no causal relationship had been established between the shot and the health problems reported, calling the pause in use "a precautionary measure"."It's very important to understand that, yes, we should continue to be using the AstraZeneca vaccine," she said.The WHO's global advisory committee on vaccine safety is currently reviewing the reports and will revert on its findings, she added, as it does with any safety issues."It is very important we are hearing safety signals because if we were not hearing about safety signals that would suggest there is not enough review and vigilance"," she said.The AstraZeneca vaccine is the main shot in the early phase of a WHO-led global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX that aims to distribute 2 billion doses this year, ensuring access for poorer countries.WHO data shows that more than 268 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from various developers have been administered worldwide and no deaths have been found to have been caused by them, Harris said.The Geneva-based body has given emergency use listing for the Pfizer/BioNTech and versions of the AstraZeneca vaccines -- a step that broadens access to those shots considerably.Asked about the timing of emergency listings for China's Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech vaccines, she said reviews were now underway and approval would "probably" be given this month."I don't want to put an exact date on depending on all sorts of issues but we would expect by the end of March," she added, saying that it partly depends on how quickly developers provide the requested responses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-its-advisory-committee-looking-at-astrazeneca-vaccine-issues-101615554690251.html

It comes at a crucial time for the peace process ahead of a May 1 deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan.The United States has drafted a peace plan calling for the current Afghan government to be replaced with an interim administration until a new constitution is agreed and elections held, but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has refused to step aside for a transitional government."The formation of an interim coalition government should be decided by the Afghans themselves during national reconciliation negotiations," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters at her weekly briefing."At the same time we have noted that the formation of an interim, inclusive administration would be a logical solution to the problem of integrating the Taliban into Afghanistan's peaceful political life."The US-drafted peace plans suggests that under the interim Afghan administration, the national parliament could either be expanded to include members of the Taliban or suspended until after the election.Moscow has said its conference next week is meant to support peace talks held in Doha, which have struggled to yield any breakthroughs.A source close to the Taliban told Reuters on condition of anonymity that a team of four or five members of the Taliban's political office in Doha would attend the Moscow conference.Earlier on Friday, Turkey said it would also host Afghan peace talks in April in Istanbul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-should-be-included-in-interim-afghan-administration-says-russia-101615552617295.html

Meanwhile, the debate on criminalising sexual behaviour and what is to be deemed offensive, subject to a universal set of rules, rages on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/97-of-women-aged-18-24-in-uk-faced-sexual-harassment-reveals-survey-101615550870254.html

12-03-2021||World||Germany 'regrets' pausing of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine shots by EU nations||Germany's top health official expressed regret Friday that some neighbouring countries have paused their use of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots in some people, despite the lack of any evidence the shot was responsible.Health Minister Jens Spahn said that while Germany takes reports of possible side effects from vaccines “very, very seriously,” both the European Medicines Agency and Germany's own vaccine oversight body have said they have no evidence of an increase in dangerous blood clots in connection with the shots.“I regret that on the basis of the knowledge of Friday morning some countries in the European Union have suspended vaccinations with AstraZeneca,” Spahn told reporters in Berlin.Denmark was the first to temporarily suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine Thursday after reports of blood clots in some people. The Nordic nation's health authority said the decision was “based on a precautionary principle” and that one person who developed a blood clot after vaccination had died.Norway decided to follow suit and halted use of the Anglo-Swedish company's vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford. Italy's pharmaceutical agency on Thursday ordered a precautionary ban on a particular batch of the vaccine after what it said were “serious adverse events.”The European Medicines Agency, which approved the shot for use across the 27-nation EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, said “the vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered” while a closer evaluation of the blood clot cases continues.“There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions,” the regulator said. It said the number of people with blood clots in vaccinated people was no higher than those who hadn't been inoculated.Spahn, the German health minister, said there was no evidence so far of a causal link between the blood clots and the vaccinations, adding that it was important to strike “a balance ... between being vigilant and not causing alarm.”Other health experts pointed out that the people most likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 are also more likely to have other health problems, which could put them at higher risk for blood clots.Britain's medicines regulator said it had not received any reports of blood clots in people that were caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 11 million doses of AstraZeneca have been administered in the U.K.“Reports of blood clots received so far are not greater than the number that would have occurred naturally in the vaccinated population," the agency said. “People should still go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-regrets-pausing-of-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-shots-by-eu-nations-101615550911431.html

12-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine use halted in several EU countries. What do we know so far||Several European nations have temporarily halted the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as a precautionary measure after reports of patients developing blood clots emerged. While Denmark, Norway, and Iceland on Thursday suspended the use of all of their AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine supply, some other European states have decided to suspend its use from a particular batch of the vaccine.Austria suspended the use of an AstraZeneca vaccine batch following the death of a 49-year-old nurse due to “severe blood coagulation problems” days after receiving an anti-Covid jab. Other European nations that suspended the same vaccine batch of one million shots sent to 17 countries include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg. As of March 9, at least 22 cases of thromboembolic events, marked by the formation of blood clots, has been reported among 3 million people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.On Friday, Bulgaria became the latest country to suspend inoculations using the AstraZeneca vaccine as the government urged the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to send a written statement dispelling all doubts about the vaccine's safety. Meanwhile, non-European countries like Australia and Canada have decided to continue with the rollout of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, saying there was no evidence that the vaccine caused adverse effects such as blood clotting.The European Union’s drugs regulator said in a statement that it was aware of Denmark’s temporary suspension of its vaccination campaign. However, it insisted there is currently no indication that AstraZeneca’s vaccine has caused the conditions, which are not listed as side effects. The EMA reiterated the position of its safety committee, saying the vaccine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the inoculations can continue while the regulator investigates the concerns.The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday said that there was no reason to stop the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine. During a briefing in Geneva, WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris told reporters that there has been no death “proven to have be caused by vaccination” and the health authorities “should continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine.” "We must always ensure that we look for any safety signals when we roll out vaccines, and we must review them," she said.A WHO spokesperson had earlier told Sputnik, Russia’s state-owned news agency, that Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) is “carefully assessing” the reports on risk related to the AstraZeneca vaccine. The spokesperson said that any changes to current recommendations will be immediately communicated to the public as soon as the UN health agency gains a full understanding of the events, reported Sputnik."The committee further noted that the vaccine can continue to be administered while the investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing," the spokesperson was quoted by Sputnik as saying.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-use-halted-in-several-eu-countries-what-do-we-know-so-far-101615548179755.html
12-03-2021||World||Poll reveals popularity of Harry and Meghan plummets in UK after Oprah interview||The popularity of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan has tumbled in Britain and has never been lower following their explosive interview with U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey, according to a poll on Friday.During the interview aired last Sunday, Meghan said her pleas for help while she felt suicidal were ignored and that one unnamed member of the family had asked how dark their son Archie’s skin might be.Meanwhile, Harry, Queen Elizabeth's grandson, also bemoaned his family's reaction of the couple's decision to step back from official duties.The tell-all interview has plunged the 1,000-year-old monarchy into its greatest crisis this century, and according to a YouGov poll, the standing of the two royals has also taken a big hit in the aftermath.It found 48% percent of the 1,664 respondents had a negative attitude of Harry compared to 45% with a positive view, the first time his net favourability rating had been negative, and a fall of 15 points from a week earlier.Meanwhile, only three in 10 people had a positive view of Meghan, while 58% had a negative opinion.As with other polls conducted since the interview, there was a divide between generations, with a majority of those aged 18 to 24 liking Harry and Meghan and those over 65 overwhelmingly having negative feelings towards them.The only other member of the family to see their popularity fall was Harry's father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles. The survey said 42% now had a negative view of him compared to 49% with a positive opinion.That compared to the 94-year-old queen, who was liked by 80%, and Harry's elder brother and his wife Kate, who were popular with three-quarters of respondents.A separate poll, conducted partly before the interview was broadcast in Britain, found support for the monarchy as a whole was largely unchanged with 63% backing the institution and 25% wanting an elected head of state.But there were some worrying figures for the royal family. Among the youngest age group, support for an elected head of state was higher than that for the monarchy by 42% to 37%, although YouGov said this was within the margin of error.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poll-says-popularity-of-harry-and-meghan-plummets-in-uk-after-oprah-interview-101615549954998.html
12-03-2021||World||No reason to stop using AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine: WHO||The World Health Organization said Friday there was no reason to stop using AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after several countries suspended the rollout over blood clot fears.The WHO, which said its vaccines advisory committee was examining the safety data coming in, stressed that no causal link had been established between the vaccine and clotting.The UN health agency also said that after the injection of more than 260 million coronavirus vaccine doses so far around the world, no deaths had yet been attributed to a Covid-19 jab.Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused the use of the AstraZeneca jab as a precaution after isolated reports of recipients developing blood clots.Italy and Austria have banned the use of shots from separate batches of AstraZeneca, and Thailand and Bulgaria said they would delay the rollout of the shot.A range of health authorities around the world have insisted the jab is safe, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the WHO."AstraZeneca is an excellent vaccine, as are the other vaccines that are being used," WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters at a briefing in Geneva."Yes, we should continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine," she added, stressing though that any concerns over safety must be investigated."We must always ensure that we look for any safety signals when we roll out vaccines, and we must review them," she said."But there is no indication to not use it."- No causal link found -The EMA said Thursday that there had been 30 cases of so-called thromboembolic events among five million people who had received the jab in Europe.But European countries could still keep using the vaccine, the EU's drug regulator said.Harris said that while a few countries had, as a precaution, suspended the use of a specific batch of AstraZeneca vaccine distributed in Europe, based on reports of blood coagulation disorders, "a causal relationship has not been shown"."Vaccination against Covid-19 doesn't reduce deaths from any other causes," she said."As of March 9, there have been over 268 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered since the start of the pandemic."No causes of death have been found to have been caused by Covid-19 vaccines to date."Harris said the WHO's advisory committee on vaccine safety, which meets at least every two weeks, systematically reviews any safety reports coming in."They're currently assessing the reports on AstraZeneca," she said.- Crucial role in Covax -The AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 jab is one of only two to have been given the WHO seal of approval so far.The organisation has granted emergency use listing to the AstraZeneca versions being manufactured in India and South Korea.The only other Covid-19 vaccine with the WHO green light is that produced by Pfizer/BioNTech.A decision is expected this month on the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, while verdicts are due at the earliest in March on China's Sinopharm and Sinovac jabs, along with the Moderna vaccine.The AstraZeneca jab makes up almost all of the doses being distributed in the first wave of the Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme.All vaccines deployed via the facility must first be authorised by the WHO.Some 238.2 million vaccine doses will be distributed to some 142 countries and territories by the end of May through the programme, which is aimed at boosting access to coronavirus jabs in poorer nations.The facility has already shipped more than 20 million doses to 20 countries.Covax aims to distribute another 14.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to 31 more countries this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-reason-to-stop-using-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-who-101615548248689.html

They blew me off. So, once again, I'm dragging them to court", Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Twitter.Austin is located in Travis County.Several major retailers, grocery and restaurant chains in Texas have said they would still require masks to be worn in their stores.That was their right, Paxton said in a letter dated March 10 to Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Andy Brown.However, such a decision "does not rest with jurisdictions like the City of Austin or Travis County," he added.Adler told MSNBC in an interview on Thursday: "We think that masking is so important. Now is not the time to take a risk. We are not far enough along yet. We are still battling this virus."The US death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is above 500,000, the highest of any single country. Around 20% of the population have received at least one dose of vaccine.Texas was one of the first US states to reopen its economy after the first wave of the pandemic last May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-attorney-general-sues-government-officials-over-not-lifting-mask-mandate-101615544171315.html

12-03-2021||World||Quad to launch historic Covid-19 vaccine initiative helmed by India||Quad leaders will announce at their first-ever summit on Friday a “historic” initiative to significantly ramp up production of Covid-19 vaccines in India, one of the four member countries, to around 1 billion doses by 2022 for distribution in the Indo-Pacific region, Biden administration officials said on Thursday. US President Joe Biden is hosting the virtual summit - involving the leaders of America, India, Japan and Australia - which is the first for the grouping that was founded in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. Biden will be joined virtually by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian PM Scott Morrison and Japan’s PM Yoshihide Suga. US secretary of state Antony Blinken will moderate the discussion and the meeting is expected to last 90 minutes, starting at 7pm, India time. US officials said the American president had convened the summit. “President Biden has worked hard to bring these leaders together to make a clear statement of the importance of the Indo-Pacific region,” an official said. The officials said, previewing the summit for reporters on background, the four members of the group will announce a task force of Covid-19 experts focused on last-mile delivery of vaccines produced through the new initiative. The meeting of the Quad leaders will also be focused on the climate crisis and they will announce “important steps” on that front. They will pledge themselves to the Paris Agreement and the “adaptation of resilience technology capacity building and climate finance”. The four leaders will then announce several working groups on the climate crisis and also, significantly, on “critical and emerging technologies”, including working to set tech standards and norms and jointly developing some of the critical technologies of the future, the officials said. Chinese telecom giant Huawei could figure in the talks in the context of progression towards 5G. The Covid-19 vaccine initiative is the most ambitious deliverable, and the only one, for the grouping, which was revived in 2017. “I do believe that this is a historic deliverable. It’s unprecedented, it’s complex, it’s deeply strategically significant, and it is timely,” said an administration official, adding that “it’s hard to do these things, and the fact that the Quad has rallied and engaged deeply essentially around the clock, over the course of the last few weeks to do this in a manner which allowed the president to host” the summit. The initiative will be financed by the governments of the US and Japan - and possibly Australia, though it’s not clear yet. They will work with the Indian government and Indian companies, which are “already able to produce and export safe and effective vaccines” to ramp up production of jabs, which the officials did not identify but said they will be those that “are authorised by the WHO or stringent regulatory authorities”. The vaccines will be meant for distribution in Southeast Asian countries that have been hit by an “acute shortage” of jabs. There was no immediate indication of the size of the investment, but officials said they are in talks with the US International Development Finance Corporation, which works with private sector companies in developing countries to find solutions to local issues. The Biden administration is touting the summit as another evidence of America’s return to the world stage in its leadership position, reversing former president Donald Trump’s “America First” approach that had alienated allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-to-launch-historic-covid-19-vaccine-initiative-helmed-by-india-101615543778807.html
12-03-2021||World||Russia: 3 charged over 2009 murder of notorious mobster Vyacheslav Ivankov||Russian prosecutors on Friday charged three men over the 2009 murder of one of the country's most notorious gangsters and drug traffickers who had served time in both Russian and US prisons.Vyacheslav Ivankov, alias Yaponchik or The Little Japanese, was shot in the abdomen in July 2009 by sniper fire as he left a glitzy Thai restaurant in the Russian capital. He died from his wounds several months later, aged 69.The Prosecutor-General's office said Friday that it had charged Kakhi Gazzayev, Murtazi Shadanii and Dzhambula Dzhanashii in Ivankov's murder, saying they had carried out the killing at the behest of a rival mobster to Ivankov."In April 2009, a previously convicted resident of the Moscow region, Ilya Simoniya, organised the murder of Ivankov in order to redistribute the spheres of influence in the criminal community," the Prosecutor-General's office said in a statement.It said that another two men, Nugzar Papava and Astamur Butba, were involved in the murder and that Butba was the triggerman. It added that both men, like Simoniya, had fled Russia.The men are subject to an international warrant for their arrest.Simoniya, known as Makho, was arrested in absentia by a Moscow court last year, charged with organising Ivankov's murder.The Prosecutor-General's office said Gazzayev, Shadanii and Dzhanashii have been taken into custody and that they have also been charged with the illegal possession of weapons and ammunition.They face up to 20 years in prison on murder charges and up to eight on the weapons charges.Ivankov was nicknamed "The Little Japanese" because of his short stature, facial features and expertise in the martial art of ju-jitsu.He began a career of racketeering, robbery, arms smuggling and drug trafficking in the 1960s and served long jail terms before his release in 1991.He fled Russia the next year, beginning a reign over the Russian community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York.After serving a nine-year sentence in a US prison, Ivankov was released in 2004 and deported to Russia.His close ally Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hassan, was shot and killed by a sniper in Moscow in January 2013, having survived four previous assassination attempts.Simoniya left Russia after an attempt on his life in the wake of Usoyan's murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-3-charged-over-2009-murder-of-notorious-mobster-vyacheslav-ivankov-101615543430493.html

First you broke open the Karachi hotel room door where Maryam was staying. Now you are threatening her that if she does not stop, she will be smashed. If anything happens to her Prime Minister Imran Khan, Army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, ISI head Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed and Gen. Irfan Malik will be responsible,” 71-year-old Sharif said in the video which he posted on his Twitter account on Thursday.Sharif has been in London since November 2019. The Khan government had allowed him to leave the country after the Lahore High Court granted him bail for four weeks on medical grounds.He was serving a seven-year imprisonment in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail in Al-Azizia Mills corruption case.Taunting the military for requesting politicians not to drag it in politics, Sharif said: “You (generals) rigged 2018 polls to impose inept Imran Khan on the nation and after the defeat in the Senate you helped your selected (PM Khan) to get vote of confidence and it is no more a secret”.Addressing the generals, Sharif said: “What you have done is a grave crime and you will be answerable to your deeds.”Meanwhile, Maryam, a senior functionary of the PML-N party said in a tweet that she had not only been threatened but those issuing the threat had also used abusive language.Earlier, Maryam, 47, named the intelligence agencies being used to pressure PML-N senators to vote for the government candidate in the senate chairman election being held on Friday.Since September last year Sharif had started taking on the Pakistan Army and ISI chiefs for their alleged interference in politics and installing their ‘puppet’ government of Khan by "stealing" the 2018 polls.Maryam has also been targeting the military establishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-accuses-pakistan-army-of-threatening-daughter-maryam-101615542721556.html

Make tapes and their players far more portable and easier to use.“During the development of the cassette tape, in the early 1960s, he had a wooden block made that fit exactly in his coat pocket,” said Olga Coolen, director of the Philips Museum in the southern city of Eindhoven. “This was how big the first Compact Cassette was to be, making it a lot handier than the bulky tape recorders in use at the time.”The final product created in 1962 later turned into a worldwide hit, with more than 100 billion cassettes sold, many to music fans who would record their own compilations direct from the radio. Its popularity waned with the development of the compact disc, an invention Ottens also helped create as supervisor of a development team, Philips said.The cassette tape's success stemmed from its simplicity, Ottens said in an interview published by the Philips Museum.“It was a breakthrough because it was foolproof,” he said, adding that players and recorders also could run on batteries, making them very user-friendly and, ultimately, portable.“Everybody could put music in their pocket,” Ottens said.The prototype wooden block never made it to the company's museum. Ottens used it to prop up his jack when replacing a wheel with a flat tire and left it by the side of a road, Coolen said.“Lou loved technology, when he talked about that his eyes began to twinkle,” museum director Coolen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lou-ottens-dutch-inventor-of-audio-cassette-dies-at-age-94-101615543182433.html

12-03-2021||World||'Climbing without a map': Japan's nuclear clean-up has no end in sight||For one minute this week, workers at the Fukushima nuclear station fell silent to mark the 10-year anniversary of a natural disaster that triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.Then they went back to work tearing down the reactors melted down in the days after a tsunami on March 11, 2011.The job ranks as the most expensive and dangerous nuclear clean-up ever attempted. A decade in, an army of engineers, scientists and 5,000 workers are still mapping out a project many expect will not be completed in their lifetime.Naoaki Okuzumi, the head of research at Japan's lead research institute on decommissioning, compares the work ahead to climbing a mountain range - without a map."The feeling we have is, you think the summit's right there, but then you reach it and can see another summit, further beyond," Okuzumi told Reuters.Okuzumi and others need to find a way to remove and safely store 880 tonnes of highly radioactive uranium fuel along with a larger mass of concrete and metal into which fuel melted a decade ago during the accident.The robotic tools to do the job don't yet exist. There is no plan for where to put the radioactive material when it is removed.Japan's government says the job could run 40 years. Outside experts say it could take twice as long, pushing completion near the close of the century.Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which once had six reactors, was plunged into crisis by the tsunami that followed a magnitude 9.0 quake off the shore of northern Japan on March 11, 2011.The quake and tsunami flooded the back-up power generators at Fukushima, knocking out cooling systems. The reactors quickly overheated, setting off explosions as uranium cores melted down. The radioactive plumes that formed forced the evacuation of about 160,000 people.It wasn't until 2017 that engineers understood how complicated the clean-up would become. By that point, five specially designed robots had been dispatched through the dark, contaminated waters pumped in to cool the uranium. But radiation zapped their electronics.One robot developed by Toshiba Corp, nicknamed the "little sunfish", a device about the size of a loaf of bread, provided an early glimpse of the chaotic damage around the cores.Kenji Matsuzaki, a robot technician at Toshiba who led development of the "sunfish", had assumed that they would find melted fuel at the bottom of the reactors.But the sunfish's first video images showed a tumult of destruction, with overturned structures inside the reactor, clumps of unrecognizable brown debris and dangerously radioactive metal."I expected it to be broken, but I didn't expect it would be this bad," Matsuzaki said.The delivery of a robotic arm to start removing fuel, developed in a $16 million programme with the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, has been delayed until 2022. Tepco plans to use it to grab some debris from inside reactor 2 for testing and to help plan the main operation.The project has had some successes. About 2,000 spent fuel rods in reactors No. 3 and No. 4 - which could have caused another massive radiological release if they overheated - have been removed after giant frames and cranes were erected over the buildings.Radiation has been reduced in most of the Fukushima work site, about the size of New York's Central Park. In most areas of the plant, the 5,000 workers no longer need special protective equipment that had slowed work during Japan's hot, humid summers.But the cleanup has been delayed by the buildup of contaminated water in tanks that crowd the site. The melted cores are kept cool by pumping water into damaged reactor vessels.The water is pumped out and treated. Storage tanks now hold enough radioactive water to fill more than 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Tepco expects it will max out its storage space next year.Most analysts expect the government to release the water into the ocean after further treatment. Fishing communities have lobbied against that and South Korea and China have objected to such a move.There still is no plan for where to put the radioactive debris from the reactors."It's no good just moving highly radioactive waste from inside the nuclear reactor to somewhere else in the plant," said Hiroshi Miyano, the head of the decommissioning committee of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

12-03-2021||World||UK economy shrank by less than feared in January, trade with EU hit by Brexit||Britain's economy shrank by less than feared in January as the country went back into a coronavirus lockdown, official data showed, but trade with the European Union was hit hard at the start of the country's new, post-Brexit trading relationship.Gross domestic product in January was 2.9% lower than in December, the Office for National Statistics said.Economists polled by Reuters had expected a contraction of 4.9%.Britain's economy is likely to shrink by 4% in the first quarter of 2021, due mostly to the latest lockdown but also because of disruption caused by new, post-Brexit rules for trade with the European Union, the Bank of England said last month.Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Friday's data and other more recent indicators suggested the economy might now be on course to fall by a less severe 2% in the first quarter.The BoE is expected to keep its stimulus programmes on hold at the end of its March meeting next Thursday as it predicts that Britain's vaccination programme - Europe's fastest - will trigger a bounce-back in the economy in the coming months.The ONS data showed exports and imports from Britain to the EU plunged by the most on record although the ONS said a difference in the way the figures were gathered was causing a delay to some data.Exports of goods to the EU, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, slumped by 40.7%. Imports fell by 28.8%.Many companies brought forward imports of goods late last year to avoid the risk of border disruption as the new UK-EU trading relationship began in early 2021 and global trade flows have been hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The ONS said the overall GDP figures were hit hard by the impact of social distancing rules on Britain's huge services sector."The economy took a notable hit in January, albeit smaller than some expected, with retail, restaurants, schools and hairdressers all affected by the latest lockdown," Jonathan Athow, an ONS statistician, said."Manufacturing also saw its first decline since April with car manufacturing falling significantly. However, increases in health services from both vaccine rollout and increased testing partially offset the declines in other industries."Britain's economy shrank by 1.7% in the three months to January, a smaller fall than a median forecast of a contraction of 2.5% in the Reuters poll.The economy was 9.2% smaller than in January last year, the ONS Statistics said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to ease England's coronavirus restrictions gradually before lifting most of them by late June.Growth in the next few months is also likely to get a boost from finance minister Rishi Sunak's announcement last week that he will pump a further 65 billion pounds into the economy, including an extension of his jobs-protecting furlough scheme.The ONS said Britain's dominant services sector - which has been hit hard by social-distancing rules - shrank by 3.5% in January from December. The Reuters poll had pointed to a 5.4% contraction.Manufacturing contracted by 2.3% but construction output rose by 0.9%.The monthly fall of nearly 3% in GDP in January was much less severe than its plunge of 18.3% in April last year when Britain went into its first coronavirus lockdown.Many companies have adapted to life under lockdown, including retailers who have ramped up their online shopping operations and services firms who have tried to help workers to do their jobs from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-economy-shrank-by-less-than-feared-in-january-trade-with-eu-hit-by-brexit-101615538455433.html
12-03-2021||World||Biden admin issues notification to further delay mandatory minimum pay for H-1B visa||The Biden administration on Friday issued a formal notification to delay the implementation of the previous Trump regime's controversial rule to raise mandatory minimum pay for foreign workers on the H-1B visa, the most sought after among Indian IT professionals.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The Department of Labour in its federal notification published on Friday said that it is considering whether to propose a further delay of the final rule's effective date and accompanying implementation periods that are currently scheduled to take effect on May 14, 2021, and July 1, 2021, respectively.Before further delaying the effective date and implementation periods, the Department will provide the public an opportunity to comment, it said.On February 1, the Department of Labour proposed to delay the effective date of the final rule entitled “Strengthening Wage Protections for the Temporary and Permanent Employment of Certain Aliens in the United States,” published in the Federal Register on January 14, 2021, for a period of 60 days.The Department proposed to delay the effective date of the final rule until May 14, 2021, in accordance with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021, from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review.”As stated in the proposal, the 60-day delay would allow agency officials the opportunity to review any questions of fact, law, or policy. The Department invited written comments from the public for 15 days on the proposed delay of effective date. All comments had to be received by February 16, 2021.The Department received 57 comments from the stakeholder community. It has reviewed the comments received in response to the proposal and will delay the effective date of the final rule for a period of 60 days, said the notification.According to Mercury News, major Silicon Valley technology companies, which employ H-1B workers directly and via staffing firms, rely heavily on the visa and push to increase the annual 85,000 cap on new visas, claiming that they need more of them to secure the world’s top talent.“Critics point to abuses and allege that the visa is used by outsourcers and staffing companies, as well as by tech giants, to replace US workers with cheaper foreign labour, drive down wages and facilitate outsourcing,” it said.The rule is a carry-over from the administration of former President Donald Trump, which proposed revisions to proposed mandatory salaries after losing a court battle to organisations including the Bay Area Council over an initial version.If imposed, workers on the H-1B at the lowest wage level would have to receive at least the 35th percentile of the prevailing wage for their job type and location, compared to the 45th percentile in the initial version. Workers at the highest wage level would have to receive the 90th percentile, compared to the 95th percentile, the report said.Meanwhile, a US group on Thursday opposed the move of the Biden administration to reverse some decisions of the Trump administration on the H-1B visas, in particular going back to the lottery system for allocation of this most sought after work visa for foreign technology professionals.The rule, Modification of Registration Requirement for Petitioners Seeking To File Cap-Subject H-1B Petitions, requires that US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prioritise the higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign workers for H-1B cap-subject visas, thus ensuring US businesses have access to the best pool of foreign workers, while also discouraging wage suppression and creating unfair competition to American workers.In its comment submitted to the Department of Homeland Security, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) asserted that the implementation of the Trump administration rule would reduce abuse of the H-1B programme by unscrupulous employers while also protecting American workers.Founded in 1979, FAIR is the country's largest immigration reform group. "President (Joe) Biden often portrays himself as a man from the 'working class' who is a tireless defender of the American worker," said FAIR president Dan Stein."Yet his administration is set to postpone, by at least a year, an important rule change that prevents unscrupulous employers from using the H-1B programme to undercut American wages while ensuring that companies that truly need skilled foreign workers have access to the best and the brightest," he alleged.Current DHS policies require USCIS to select registrations on a purely random basis, utilising a lottery system, when demand for H-1B visas exceeds the numerical limit set by statute, note the comments."This random lottery selection process places no weight on wage or skill levels and fails to ensure businesses actually have access to the best and brightest workers possible. Worse, the lottery creates a scenario where American workers could be replaced by foreign workers who can be paid significantly less or who possess considerably lower skills," said Stein.FAIR strongly urged DHS to implement these critical reforms without undue delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-notification-to-further-delay-mandatory-minimum-pay-for-h-1b-visa-101615538429010.html
12-03-2021||World||China hits back at US criticism of legal overhaul in Hong Kong, questions 'moral capital'||A Chinese official hit back Friday at U.S. criticism of planned election law changes in Hong Kong, noting the chaos surrounding the recent American presidential election.Semi-autonomous Hong Kong is an internal Chinese issue that no foreign country has the right to interfere in, said Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council.“I don’t know that after the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, how the U.S. has such moral capital to point fingers at the election institutions of Hong Kong,” he said.A statement from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned what it called China's “continuing assault on democratic institutions in Hong Kong." It followed Thursday's approval by China's rubber-stamp legislature of a plan to increase Beijing's control of how Hong Kong's legislature is chosen.The changes would give a largely pro-Beijing Election Committee the responsibility of nominating all members of Hong Kong's legislature and directly electing some lawmakers to ensure that Hong Kong is administered by “patriots" and exclude “anti-China” forces from holding key roles in governance.The 1,500-member Election Committee will pick the territory’s chief executive and an unspecified “relatively large” number of its 90-seat legislature. The revision has prompted concern that the proportion of directly elected lawmakers will be reduced.“These actions deny Hong Kongers a voice in its own governance by limiting political participation, reducing democratic representation, and stifling political debate,” Blinken said.Zhang likened the changes to Hong Kong's electoral system as a “minimally invasive surgery” that will restore health to the city's “democratic system.”“The distinctive features of minimally invasive surgery are small wounds, deep penetration, and quicker recovery,” he said, adding that Hong Kong residents will be able to live and work more peacefully as a result.Zhang also said that the electoral changes are not aimed at excluding Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp from the governance structure as anti-China forces cannot be equated with the opposition.“The opposition, especially the pan-democrats, also have patriots, and they can still stand for election and be elected according to the law in the future," he said.Zhang's comments come even as 47 pro-democracy activists and former legislators were charged in court for subversion last week for their involvement in an unofficial primary election that authorities say was part of a plot to paralyze the Hong Kong government.Most of Hong Kong's prominent pro-democracy advocates are currently in jail or in self-exile. Of the 47, only five have received bail.On Friday, 21 activists who were denied bail last week appeared in court for a bail review.The court rejected 11 bail applications, including those from former lawmakers Claudia Mo and Leung Kwok-hung. The remaining 10 defendants withdrew their application. They will remain in custody.For former lawmaker Emily Lau, a member of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, Zhang's words provide little reassurance that any semblance of democracy can still be maintained.“I consider myself a patriot,” said Lau. “But our worry is that many people from my party, and from the pro-democracy camp may be excluded.”She said that even after lawmakers are elected, there is still continuous vetting throughout their service since they can still be stripped of their seats if they're found to be insufficiently patriotic.“I don't know what their definition of patriotism is, and that is the worrying thing,” she said. “Once this (electoral system) is set up, you will lose the confidence of the people, and that's bad for any government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hits-back-at-us-criticism-of-legal-overhaul-in-hong-kong-questions-moral-capital-101615537547603.html
12-03-2021||World||Defying rules, anti-vaccine accounts continue to spread misinformation on social media||With vaccination against Covid-19 in full swing, social platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter say they’ve stepped up their fight against misinformation that aims to undermine trust in the vaccines. But problems abound.For years, the same platforms have allowed anti-vaccination propaganda to flourish, making it difficult to stamp out such sentiments now. And their efforts to weed out other types of Covid-19 misinformation — often with fact-checks, informational labels and other restrained measures, has been woefully slow.Twitter, for instance, announced this month that it will remove dangerous falsehoods about vaccines, much the same way it’s done for other Covid-related conspiracy theories and misinformation. But since April 2020, it has removed a grand total of 8,400 tweets spreading Covid-related misinformation — a tiny fraction of the avalanche of pandemic-related falsehoods tweeted out daily by popular users with millions of followers, critics say.“While they fail to take action, lives are being lost,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a watchdog group. In December, the nonprofit found that 59 million accounts across social platforms follow peddlers of anti-vax propaganda — many of whom are immensely popular superspreaders of misinformation.Efforts to crack down on vaccine misinformation now, though, are generating cries of censorship and prompting some posters to adopt sneaky tactics to avoid the axe.“It’s a hard situation because we have let this go for so long,” said Jeanine Guidry, an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies social media and health information. “People using social media have really been able to share what they want for nearly a decade.”The Associated Press identified more than a dozen Facebook pages and Instagram accounts, collectively boasting millions of followers, that have made false claims about the Covid-19 vaccine or discouraged people from taking it. Some of these pages have existed for years.Of more than 15 pages identified by NewsGuard, a technology company that analyzes the credibility of websites, roughly half remain active on Facebook, the AP found.One such page, The Truth About Cancer, has more than a million Facebook followers after years of posting baseless suggestions that vaccines could cause autism or damage children’s brains. The page was identified in November as a “Covid-19 vaccine misinformation super spreader” by NewsGuard.Recently, the page stopped posting about vaccines and the coronavirus. It now directs people to sign up for its newsletter and visit its website as a way to avoid alleged “censorship.”Facebook said it is taking taking “aggressive steps to fight misinformation across our apps by removing millions of pieces of Covid-19 and vaccine content on Facebook and Instagram during the pandemic."“Research shows one of the best ways to promote vaccine acceptance is by showing people accurate, trusted information, which is why we’ve connected 2 billion people to resources from heath authorities and launched a global information campaign," the company said in a statement.Facebook also banned ads that discourage vaccines and said it has added warning labels to more than 167 million pieces of additional Covid-19 content thanks to our network of fact-checking partners. (The Associated Press is one of Facebook's fact-checking partners).YouTube, which has generally avoided the same type scrutiny as its social media peers despite being a source of misinformation, said it has removed more than 30,000 videos since October, when it started banning false claims about Covid-19 vaccinations. Since February 2020, it has removed over 800,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading coronavirus information, said YouTube spokeswoman Elena Hernandez.Prior to the pandemic, however, social media platforms had done little to stamp out misinformation, said Andy Pattison, manager of digital solutions for the World Health Organization. In 2019, as a measles outbreak slammed the Pacific Northwest and left dozens dead in America Samoa, Pattison pleaded with big tech companies to take a closer look at tightening rules around vaccine misinformation that he feared might make the outbreak worse — to no avail.It wasn’t until Covid-19 struck with a vengeance that many of those tech companies started listening. Now he meets weekly with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to discuss trends on their platforms and policies to consider.“When it comes to vaccine misinformation, the really frustrating thing is that this has been around for years,” Pattison said.The targets of such crackdowns are often quick to adapt. Some accounts use intentionally misspelled words — like “vackseen” or “v@x” — to avoid bans. (Social platforms say they're wise to this.) Other pages use more subtle messaging, images or memes to suggest that vaccines are unsafe or even deadly.“When you die after the vaccine, you die of everything but the vaccine,” read one meme on an Instagram account with more than 65,000 followers. The post suggested that the government is concealing deaths from the COVID-19 vaccine.“It’s a very fine line between freedom of speech and eroding science,” Pattison said. Purveyors of misinformation, he said, “learn the rules, and they dance right on the edge, all the time.”Twitter said it is continuously reviewing its rules in the context of COVID-19 and changes them based on guidance from experts. Earlier this month, it added a strikes policy that threatens repeat spreaders of coronavirus and vaccine misinformation with bans.But blatantly false Covid-19 information continues to pop up. Earlier this month, several articles circulating online claimed that more elderly Israelis who took the Pfizer vaccine were “killed” by the shot than those who died from Covid-19 itself. One such article from an anti-vaccination website was shared nearly 12,000 times on Facebook, leading earlier this month to a spike of nearly 40,000 mentions of “vaccine deaths” across social platforms and the internet, according to an analysis by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs.Medical experts point to a real-world study showing a strong correlation between vaccination and decreases in severe Covid-19 disease in Israel. The nation’s health ministry said in a Thursday statement that the Covid-19 vaccine has “profoundly” reduced the rate of deaths and hospitalizations.As U.S. vaccine supplies continue to increase, immunization efforts will soon shift from targeting a limited supply to the most vulnerable populations to getting as many shots into as many arms as possible. That means tackling the third of the country’s population who say they will not or probably won’t get it, as measured by a February AP-NORC poll.“Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation could be a big barrier to getting enough of the population vaccinated to end the crisis,” said Lisa Fazio, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University.Some health officials and academics generally believe that the social-platform efforts are helpful, at least on the margins. What’s not clear is how big of a dent they can put in the problem.“If someone truly believes that the Covid vaccine is harmful and they feel a responsibility to share that with friends and family ... they will find a way,” Guidry said.And some still blame business models that they say encouraged the platforms to serve up engaging, if false, coronavirus misinformation in order to profit from advertising.When the Center for Countering Digital Hate recently studied the crossover between different types of disinformation and hate speech, it found that Instagram tended to cross-pollinate misinformation via its algorithm. Instagram might feed an account that followed a QAnon conspiracy site further posts from, say, white nationalists or anti-vaxxers.“You continue to allow things to disintegrate because of the seamless intermingling of misinformation and information on your platforms,” Ahmed, the center’s CEO, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-rules-anti-vaccine-accounts-continue-to-spread-misinformation-on-social-media-101615536253060.html
12-03-2021||World||Israel, Greece, Cyprus hold naval drill as they deepen ties||The Israeli military said Friday that it has conducted a joint naval exercise with Greece and Cyprus, in the latest sign of increased cooperation among three countries that increasingly view Turkey as a rival in the Mediterranean Sea.It said the “Noble Dina” exercise, which was led by Israel and also included France, covered “anti-submarine procedures, search and rescue scenarios, and a scenario simulating battle between ships.” The exercise was concluded on Thursday.“Over the past week, the Navy led a large-scale exercise in which it implemented capabilities in underwater warfare, search and rescue, convoy escort and surface combat," Rear Admiral Eyal Harel, the head of Israeli naval operations, said.“These exercises are of paramount importance in strengthening the Navy’s connection with foreign fleets who share common interests,” he added.Israel, Greece and Cyprus have taken a number of steps in recent months to cement ties, including advancing plans to build a 2,000 megawatt undersea electricity cable and a 1,900-kilometer (1,300-mile) undersea gas pipeline. The three countries' defense ministers met in November and agreed to increase military cooperation.Greece and Cyprus are embroiled in a dispute with Turkey, which has sent gas prospecting vessels into waters claimed by Greece and drilling ships into an area where Cyprus claims exclusive rights. The tension brought NATO allies Greece and Turkey close to open conflict last year, but tensions have eased since then.Israel and Turkey were once close allies but had a major falling-out in 2010, when 10 Turkish citizens were killed by Israeli forces as a Turkish-led flotilla tried to break Israel’s blockade on the Gaza Strip.The two countries agreed to a U.S.-brokered reconciliation agreement in 2016, but ties broke down two years later over a U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan portrays himself as a champion of the Palestinian cause and has provided political support to Hamas, the Islamic militant group that seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. A number of Hamas leaders are based in Turkey, and Erdogan met with the group's top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in December 2019.Israel and Western countries view Hamas as a terrorist group. Turkey considers it a legitimate political actor because it won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006, and denies providing any aid to the group's armed wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-greece-cyprus-hold-naval-drill-as-they-deepen-ties-101615536059747.html

12-03-2021||World||US imposes new 5G license limits on some Huawei suppliers||The Biden administration has informed some suppliers to China’s Huawei Technologies Co. of tighter conditions on previously approved export licenses, prohibiting items for use in or with 5G devices, according to people familiar with the move.The 5G ban is effective as of this week, according to the people, who asked not to be identified to discuss nonpublic communications.The rules create a more explicit prohibition on the export of components like semiconductors, antennas and batteries for Huawei 5G devices, making the ban more uniform among licensees. Some companies had previously received licenses that allowed them to keep shipping components to Huawei that the Chinese company may have then used in 5G equipment, while other companies were already subject to tighter restrictions.Companies had complained about confusing rules after former President Donald Trump’s administration added Huawei to the Entity List, requiring that U.S. firms obtain government licenses if they want to sell American tech and intellectual property to the Chinese telecommunications-equipment giant. U.S. officials had deemed the company a national-security threat.The move is also a sign that the Biden administration plans to move forward on the tighter export controls implemented under Trump and more broadly indicates officials are following through on pledges to be tough on China. In an interview with MSNBC this month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo promised to use the Entity List “to its full effect.”“From one perspective, it’s cleanup and correcting mistakes from the previous administration,” said William Reinsch, who served as undersecretary of commerce for export administration in the Clinton administration and is now senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There’s bipartisan support for a tough line on technology transfer to China, and this reflects that.”Chinese-listed telecom equipment stocks such as Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies Co. and Shennan Circuits Co. fell more than 1%, while rival ZTE Corp. was largely unchanged in Hong Kong and down about 1.8% in Shenzhen.Protecting InterestsThe U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees the Entity List, said in an emailed statement that it can’t comment on “specific export licensing questions.” The bureau said it “works with its interagency partners to apply consistently the licensing policies set forth in the Export Administration Regulations to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.”The Trump administration used export controls, prohibitions and executive orders to block companies including Huawei, chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd. from American goods and consumers. Now, it’s up to Biden whether to maintain, remove or deepen those measures.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will meet with their Chinese counterparts in Alaska next week. It would represent the highest-level in-person exchange between the two sides since President Joe Biden took office in January. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Feb. 10.Trump slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports from China, sparking a trade war that hurt U.S. manufacturing and agriculture even as it protected some slices of industry like steelmakers.While Biden criticized Trump’s strategy and promised to work with global allies to confront China on issues including intellectual property theft, he’s also indicated that he won’t immediately remove the tariffs, taking time to review U.S. policy.In late February the Biden administration also signaled that it intends to go ahead with a Trump administration-proposed rule to secure the information-technology supply chain, a move that gives the Commerce Department broad authority to prohibit transactions involving “foreign adversaries.”The interim rule, which will allow Commerce to monitor transactions of governments including China’s, was first proposed by the previous administration in January -- days before Biden’s inauguration -- and follows an executive order Trump signed in 2019. The department said it would accept public comments on the plan through March 22, the same day it becomes effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-new-5g-license-limits-on-some-huawei-suppliers-101615531544805.html
12-03-2021||World||European Union drug regulator backs AstraZeneca vaccine after suspensions||The European Union’s drugs regulator said the benefits of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine continue to outweigh its risks, and the shot can still be administered while investigations of possible blood clots are ongoing.The European Medicines Agency reiterated that there is currently no indication that the Astra vaccine caused these conditions, which aren’t listed as side effects. The EMA issued the statement as Denmark, Italy and Norway joined other European countries in temporarily suspending use of some or all of their Astra Covid shots. The regulator is investigating the concerns.It’s the latest setback for AstraZeneca’s European rollout, which has already encountered a number of bumps along the way. Delayed deliveries fueled a dispute between the EU and the U.K., where AstraZeneca is based, and there were questions over its efficacy for people over 65. Several EU countries have since reversed course on earlier restrictions after new data showed the vaccine’s benefits for the elderly.Further negative perceptions among the public could affect take-up of the Astra vaccine in the EU, which is relying on the shot as it races to catch up with the rest of the developed world in inoculating its population.Even before the latest questions arose, perceptions of the shot’s safety in Europe were lower compared with the one from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, and the vaccine produced by Moderna Inc., according to a March 7 YouGov survey. In Britain, by contrast, Astra’s was viewed as the safest of the three.Precautionary MoveDenmark said it wants more research conducted before resuming inoculations with the company’s vaccine. Danish Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called the decision a precautionary move, following “signals of a possible serious side effect in the form of deadly blood clots” stemming from a batch of the vaccine.Shares in AstraZeneca fell 2.5%.AstraZeneca said the safety of its vaccine was demonstrated in clinical trials. An analysis of more than 10 million records has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in any age group, gender, batch or country using the shot, the company said in a statement.“In fact, the observed number of these types of events are significantly lower in those vaccinated than would be expected among the general population,” AstraZeneca said.The U.K. government also sprang to Astra’s defense, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, calling it “safe” and “effective,” in response to reporters’ questions about Denmark’s decision.News of the risk of clotting drew different reactions across the EU. In Sweden, health authorities said they saw no reason to stop using Astra. Italy said on Thursday it has blocked use of the Astra batch in question, pending a review.The development follows news from Austria, where authorities last weekend suspended use of the Astra batch after reports of a death and an illness among recipients.Phil Bryan of the U.K. Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency issued a statement to underline that “it has not been confirmed that the report of a blood clot, in Denmark, was caused by the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.”“We continually monitor the safety of vaccines to ensure that the benefits outweigh any potential risks,” he said. He also said the reports of blood clots received so far “are not greater than the number that would have occurred naturally in the vaccinated population,” and he urged people to continue seeking inoculation.In the Philippines, health authorities concurred with European regulators, saying there was no reason to stop the rollout of Astra’s shot and that they were closely monitoring the situation.Meanwhile, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Latvia have all suspended use of shots from the Astra batch, according to the EMA. Iceland has since said it will also put its Astra program on hold until more is known about the side effects.Vaccines from the lot, totaling 1 million shots, have also been delivered to France, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden, the EMA said.Danish FatalityThe EMA’s list of side effects referred to one Danish fatality, identified by local authorities as a 60-year-old woman. Health authorities are stressing that it’s currently not possible to establish a link between her death and AstraZeneca’s vaccine. Denmark will pause its Astra shots for two weeks, with a new assessment due in the week starting March 22.“It’s important to underline that we haven’t abandoned the AstraZeneca vaccine,” the Danish Health Authority said in a statement. “But we’re pausing its use. There’s good documentation that the vaccine is both safe and effective.”Denmark said the development could delay its immunization program by about a month.The country’s decision represents a “super-cautious approach based on some isolated reports in Europe,” said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “The problem with spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to a vaccine are the enormous difficulty of distinguishing a causal effect from a coincidence.”Denmark has given more than 142,000 inoculations with the AstraZeneca vaccine, accounting for about one-quarter of all Danes who have received a first Covid shot.A year ago, Denmark became one of the first EU nations to go into a lockdown and shut its borders, and it has stood out for its cautious approach to fighting the pandemic. That includes forcing its fur industry to cull the entire Danish mink population amid concerns the animals were spreading the virus.Denmark has also been one of the EU leaders in vaccinations, giving 13 shots per 100 people, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-drug-regulator-backs-astrazeneca-vaccine-after-suspensions-101615514736254.html
12-03-2021||World||No evidence of Covid-19 leak from Wuhan lab, may have emerged from wildlife trade, say WHO scientists||The four World Health Organisation (WHO) scientific experts who travelled to China to probe the Covid-19 pandemic's origins said that contrary to conspiracy theories, there currently is no evidence that suggests the novel coronavirus 'leaked' from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan.Instead, the most likely explanation is that the pandemic may have been caused by unfettered wildlife trade in the country, the experts said.Speaking at a virtual event hosted by the Chatham House think-tank, the experts said that they found a 'link' between the wet market in Wuhan, where people first fell ill, and neighbouring regions in South China where bats were found with viruses.Dr Peter Daszak, zoologist and president of EcoHealth Alliance, a global nonprofit researching human, animal and environmental health, said, "There was a conduit from Wuhan to the provinces in South China, where the closest relative viruses [to the coronavirus] are found in bats.” It is thus possible that the virus crossed into domesticated and farmed animals and arrived in Wuhan on account of wildlife trade, he said.Dr Daszak was a part of the four-member expert team sent by WHO, along with Professor David Heymann, Professor Marion Koopmans, and Professor John Watson.Koopmans, the Head of the Department of Viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, said that as part of their investigation, the team had also visited the three laboratories closest to the Huanan market in Wuhan and scrutinised their protocols and research."We concluded that it’s extremely unlikely there was a lab incident,” she said."Incidentally, the three aforementioned laboratories, including the much talked about Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have been the focus of several conspiracy theories and unfounded speculations on the origins of the virus, partly fueled by internet forums and imageboards playing the market for rumours.The incident was also heavily politicised in the US by the erstwhile Trump administration, which defunded the National Institutes of Health also blacklisted critical coronavirus research, which was going on in collaboration with the Wuhan labs.Addressing the issue of navigating this 'special politics' over the unfounded coronavirus origin speculations, Dr Daszak said that the scientific process related to the investigation offers a way to deal with this political intrigue."This scientific process here -- which involves looking at data, analysing it, coming to conclusions about what it means, and making it public -- is extremely important because it allows you to do the work irrespective of the politics. There is a purity to this process, and in other scientists reacting to it. I find solace in that," he said.The United Nations' health agency worked for months to send an international team to Wuhan to help determine how the novel coronavirus first jumped from animals to humans. But in a tense geopolitical climate, the highly sensitive mission only landed on the ground this past January -- more than a year after the first cases were detected in the Chinese city in late 2019. The independent experts, who spent four weeks in Wuhan visiting sites linked to early cases, wrapped up their mission last month without conclusive findings.The team, which has stressed this was just a first stage in the process, is expected to publish a report with their full findings next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-evidence-of-covid-19-leak-from-wuhan-lab-say-who-scientists-101615529203740.html
12-03-2021||World||US white wheat growers cash in as China snaps up supplies||China is scooping up supplies of US white wheat to feed livestock, pushing export forecasts for the grain usually used to make sponge cakes and noodles to a 27-year-high.The purchases are the latest disruption in commodities markets caused by Chinese buying of grains and oilseeds during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing prices of major commodity crops to multi-year highs.China has booked more US white wheat this year than any country besides the Philippines, the top buyer of the grain. While US producers have long tried to woo the growing Chinese market for confectionary foods made from white wheat flour, the recent purchases reflect a need for animal feed, Chinese traders and analysts said.On Tuesday, the US Agriculture Department (USDA) raised its forecast for exports of US white wheat to 245 million bushels, the most since 1994, due to strong demand from China and South Korea.In a sign of the varied pace of global economic recoveries, USDA lowered its export forecast for the most common U.S. wheat class, hard red winter wheat, citing lower demand to "several Western Hemisphere markets."While white wheat is not typically fed to animals, high corn prices - benchmark U.S. futures hit 7-1/2-year highs last month - made it a viable alternative in China.China is scouring the globe for feed grains as it rebuilds the world's largest hog herd, which was ravaged by African swine fever.“Most of the imported wheat is going to the feed sector as corn prices are high and there is profit (to import)," said Li Hongchao, a senior grains analyst with trade website Myagric.com.China signed a trade deal with the United States in January 2020. More recent trade tensions between China and Australia, which grows a slightly different hard white wheat, have also sent China seeking alternative wheat supplies.Nine months into the 2020/21 wheat marketing year begun June 1, 2020, China's purchases of all U.S. wheat classes are at a seven-year high of 2.9 million tonnes, according to USDA's weekly export sales data. White wheat bookings represent about a third of the total, at 947,863 tonnes as of March 4.Chinese purchases of U.S. white wheat began ramping up in November, after grinding to a near halt in 2018 and 2019 when Beijing and Washington were in the thick of a trade war.Prior to 2018, China had been building its U.S. white wheat purchases, booking 228,000 tonnes in 2016/17 and 307,000 tonnes in 2017/18. The U.S. wheat industry, anticipating the growth of China's economy, has spent years cultivating a relationship with China's flour millers and bakers."It's a growing middle class, and their interest (is) in diversifying their diet," said Randy Fortenbery, an agricultural economist at Washington State University.Most U.S. white wheat is soft white wheat, grown in the Pacific Northwest and beloved by bakers for its pale color and low gluten strength, ideal for cakes and steamed breads.'GOOD RUN-UP IN PRICES'While the wheat has been cheaper than corn in China, where feed grains are in high demand, it is earning U.S. farmers a premium. The booming export market for white wheat has sent cash prices at the Portland, Oregon, export hub hovering around $7.50 a bushel, up about $2 or 35% from July post harvest.Idaho grower Cordell Kress says he sold about a third of his expected 2021 white wheat harvest and has even pre-sold some of his 2022 crop."That is more than usual. But we have had a pretty good run-up in prices," said Kress, who grows about 3,000 acres (12 square kilometers) of wheat each year in southeast Idaho.Even so, grain merchandisers and farmers do not expect much of a jump in U.S. white wheat acres this spring, given strong prices for competing crops like canola. While most of the US white wheat crop was planted last autumn, before the price rally, a smaller portion is seeded each spring."Lots of things go into crop selection besides price," said Kress. "I do what is best for my farm and the soil, and typically that involves sticking to crop rotations," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-white-wheat-growers-cash-in-as-china-snaps-up-supplies-101615530252748.html
12-03-2021||World||'America is coming back' declares President Biden on his maiden prime time address||President Joe Biden has told his countrymen that "America is coming back" as it is on a path to defeat the deadly coronavirus and revive the economy badly hit by the pandemic.The US is the worst-hit country with the world's highest number of confirmed cases and deaths at 29,150,068 and 529,102, respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance and some 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed their doors.“America is coming back,” Biden said in his maiden prime time address to the nation on Thursday on the 50th day of his presidency.“The development, manufacture, distribution of vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It's one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. We also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars, stunning images of our dreams that are now reality, another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another,” he said.Reflecting on the last one year wherein the country lost more than 500,000 Americans, he said there is something else that the country lost.“We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people. But as I stand here tonight, we're proving once again something I've said time and time again to the--probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it to foreign leaders and domestic alike. It's never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people,” Biden said."And today, I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes USD 1,400 in direct rescue checks — payments. That means a typical family of four earning about USD 110,000 will get checks for USD 5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check — a Treasury check," he said.This has been Biden's first and most pressing legislative priority since taking office on January 20.“It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers health care premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it funds all the steps to beat the virus and create millions of jobs,” he said.This will tackle the pandemic and get direct financial assistance and relief to Americans who need it the most.In the coming weeks and months, Biden said he will be travelling, along with the first lady, the vice president, the second gentleman, and members of his Cabinet to speak directly to Americans, to tell them the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment.“If it fails in any place, I will acknowledge that it failed, but it will not; about how after long, dark years, one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead,” he said.“If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we'll have proven once again that this country can do anything, hard things, big things, important things,” he said.“Over a year ago, no one could have imagined what we were about to go through, but now we're coming through it. It is a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. We are also bound together by the hope and the possibilities in the days in front of us,” he said.Biden said his fervent prayer for the country is that, "after all we have been through, we’ll come together as one people, one nation, one America.""I believe we can and we will. We’re seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation’s history — darkest we’ve ever known," he said.More than 95.7 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered across the nation, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are three Covid-19 vaccines that have received emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-is-coming-back-declares-president-biden-on-his-maiden-prime-time-address-101615531207415.html
12-03-2021||World||Canadian company pulls ads thanking India for Covid-19 vaccine support||Less than a day after an Indo-Canadian community group sponsored nine billboards in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) that thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for sending across Covid-19 vaccines to Canada, the ad company has taken down the hoardings apparently after receiving complaints.The billboards featured an image of Modi against the backdrop of the flags of India and Canada, and read, “Thank You, India & PM Narendra Modi. Long Live Canada India Friendship.” The domestic community group Hindu Forum Canada (HFC) had sponsored the ad campaign, signing up with Outfront Media for a five-week display at various locations in the GTA.On Thursday, Outfront Media emailed HFC, saying they “had to pause the digital impression buy because of community complaints on the creative design”.It is learnt that HFC was later informed the complaints were apparently made over the use of Modi’s image and that there was pressure from some unidentified people on Outfront Media to pull the campaign.HFC members plan to discuss the matter with Outfront Media’s CEO, Michele Erskine, and they intend to point out that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau himself had thanked the Indian prime minister for sealing a deal as per which a total of two million doses of the Covishield vaccine will be shipped to Canada.In a statement sent to HT, HFC president Rao Yendamuri said the community group was “disappointed” that the campaign was placed on hold and “still hopeful” that Outfront Media would resume it since message was “very positive”.The first shipment of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines arrived in Canada last Wednesday.HT reached out to Erskine as well as Outfront Media’s vice-president for legal matters, Kate Leslie, but received no response.It is believed in some circles that Outfront Media was forced to pull the ads possibly because of a social media campaign that was launched targeting the company.The campaign features Outfront Media’s phone number and says, “Call this number and educate them.” It uses the hashtag #AskIndiaWhy, which was initiated by Vancouver-based Poetic Justice Foundation, a non-profit that was behind the toolkit controversy that recently erupted in India surrounding the ongoing farmers’ protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-company-pulls-ads-thanking-india-for-covid-19-vaccine-support-101615530758182.html
12-03-2021||World||Africa proves rocky terrain for Russian and Chinese Covid-19 vaccines||Russia and China are racing to plug the Covid-19 vaccine gap in Africa, hoping to cement their influence on a continent where many countries have yet to administer a single shot.But, so far, vaccine donations from Beijing and Moscow have been small, the commercial deals they offer are costly, and some African governments are wary about a lack of data.As rich countries ramp up their inoculation drives, Africa, without the resources to pre-order Pfizer, AstraZeneca , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, is being left behind.With Western nations facing criticism for hoarding supplies, flooding Africa with life-saving shots would be a soft-power coup for Russia and China.Moscow has offered 300 million doses with financing to an African Union (AU) purchasing scheme.Beijing has pledged nearly a quarter of all its vaccine donations to Africa, according to data compiled by Bridge Consulting, a Beijing-based health sector advisory."This is a vivid manifestation of China-Africa friendship," China's foreign ministry told Reuters."Africa is one of the key markets for Sputnik V," said the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the sovereign wealth fund marketing its Sputnik V vaccine abroad.French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe and the United States risk losing influence in Africa over the issue.However, John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, cautioned against "vaccine diplomacy", saying powers must not use token allocations to curry political influence."Africa will refuse to be that playing ground where we use Covid as a tool to manage relationships," he said on a webinar hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank in late February."It becomes like you're trying to sprinkle water on a very hot day on children ... Then you can tick the box that you did that," he said. "That's not what we are after as a continent."While other developing regions have turned to Russia or China, in Africa their engagement has translated into few shots in arms.Africa has received around 3.15 million shots from China - or less than 4% of its vaccine exports - Bridge Consulting data showed."The numbers of vaccines China is donating are not going to move the needle in any of these countries. But it's as much about the optics," said Eric Olander, co-founder of The China-Africa Project.Russia has shipped a total of around 100,000 vaccine doses to Algeria, Tunisia and Guinea.The global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX, meanwhile, delivered nearly 15 million shots to 22 African countries in its first 10 days.The facility co-led by the World Health Organization, GAVI and others aims to ship 35 million doses to Africa by the end of the month and 720 million by the end of 2021.That will still only be enough to inoculate those at greatest risk.DATA DEFICITChina's leading vaccines - from the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and Sinovac - are not yet approved for emergency use by the WHO. Neither is Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.China offered South Africa - the African nation hardest hit by the pandemic - 2 million shots, its health minister said.But a government official involved in procurement told Reuters the lack of trial data meant Chinese vaccines were not being seriously considered for now. Sputnik V was also relegated to a second tier of vaccines South Africa says need more study, according to the health ministry.Even some countries that accepted donations have shied away from purchases.Uganda considered buying Chinese vaccines but is focused on COVAX due to their cost and the availability of data, said Ombeva Malande, director of the East Africa Centre for Vaccines and Immunization, which advised the government. Kenya is taking a similar line, he said.Diana Atwine, permanent secretary in Uganda's health ministry, said authorities would consider affordable vaccines approved by the WHO.The head of Kenya's vaccine task force confirmed it was not in talks to procure Chinese vaccines, and health ministry plans do not include Russian vaccines.DOLLARS AND DOSESWhile COVAX shots are free for most African nations, countries doing commercial deals are paying a premium.Senegal paid $20 a shot for 200,000 doses of Sinopharm, a two-shot vaccine."The worst thing that could happen now is for countries to not start vaccinating," said Tandakha Ndiaye Dieye, a member of Senegal's vaccine advisory group, explaining the decision.By comparison, India's Serum Institute is selling AstraZeneca shots it manufactures for $3. The Indian government has also donated over a half million of those shots to eight African countries, according to a Reuters tally.Beijing has so far not announced financing packages that would make vaccine deals more affordable in Africa.At around $10 per dose, Sputnik V is cheaper, and RDIF told Reuters it would be even more competitive if subsidised via COVAX.RDIF said it was in "advanced negotiations" with the WHO to be included in COVAX and could offer a one-shot version to reduce the cost. A spokesperson for GAVI, the global vaccine alliance helping lead COVAX, said all vaccines would be considered but they first needed approval from the WHO or another stringent regulatory authority.RDIF said some deliveries of the Sputnik V doses offered via the AU plan could start in May.A senior AU diplomat told Reuters that talks were taking place but no agreement had been reached. No details have been announced about the finance package. RDIF did not respond to Reuters questions about the potential deal.Both China and Russia must increase production if they hope to become major global vaccine suppliers. For Moscow, exporting shots is politically sensitive when its own population still needs vaccinating."I'm not worried about whether Russia's going to be able to deliver the doses," said W. Gyude Moore of the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank."I'm worried about how African countries are going to pay for them ... COVAX is just not going to be enough."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-proves-rocky-terrain-for-russian-and-chinese-covid-19-vaccines-101615529481306.html
12-03-2021||World||To counter China, Biden to meet leaders of Australia, India and Japan||US President Joe Biden will meet on Friday with the leaders of Australia, India and Japan, a group central to his efforts to counter China's growing military and economic power.The White House said the virtual meeting of the countries known as the Quad would show the importance Biden placed on the Indo-Pacific region and focus on ways to fight the coronavirus, cooperate on economic growth and the climate crisis.India and Australia have emphasized the importance of regional security cooperation, which has been boosted by previous lower-level meetings of the four countries.A senior Biden administration official told Reuters the meeting would announce financing agreements to support an increase in manufacturing capacity for coronavirus vaccines in India, something New Delhi has urged to counter China's widening vaccine diplomacy.The United States wants to strengthen ties with allies and partners as China adopts an increasingly assertive foreign policy in Asia and beyond. Washington says the additional vaccine capacity will be used in vaccination efforts in Southeast Asia, where Beijing is competing for influence.The virtual meeting between Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will aim to lay the groundwork for an in-person meeting later this year, the administration said.Among the issues to be addressed are supply chains exposed as heavily reliant on China during the pandemic.Japan's Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday that the four countries would work together to secure rare earth metals essential to the production of electric car motors and other products.The US official told Reuters on Tuesday the United States and Japan would help fund Indian firms manufacturing vaccines for US drugmakers Novavax Inc and J&J.However, Indian government sources said US curbs on exports of critical materials could hamper that effort and those to start large-scale distribution to Southeast Asia.India, Australia and Japan have all faced security challenges from China, strengthening their interest in the four-nation alliance. Cooperation among them dates back to their joint response to the Indian Ocean earthquake and Tsunami in 2004.The Quad was revived under the Trump administration, which saw it as a vehicle to push back against China's spreading influence. The United States hosted a foreign ministers' meeting in 2019, that was followed by another in Japan last year and a virtual session in February.Friday's meeting coincides with a major US diplomatic drive to solidify alliances in Asia and Europe to counter China.On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will head to Japan and South Korea for the first meetings between senior officials of the Biden administration and US allies - underscoring the critical importance Washington places on Asia and the China challenge.Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will join Blinken in Alaska next week for a meeting with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councillor Wang Yi, the first high-level in-person contact between the two sparring countries under the Biden administration.Washington has said it will not hold back in its criticism of Beijing over issues ranging from Taiwan to Hong Kong and the genocide it says China is committing against minority Muslims.Biden's administration has committed to reviewing elements of policies toward China, in consultation with allies, as the world's two largest economies navigate frosty relations that sank to their lowest depths in decades during Donald Trump's presidency.Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a "disaster" for both nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/to-counter-china-biden-to-meet-leaders-of-australia-india-and-japan-101615529588165.html
12-03-2021||World||Hong Kong activists remain in custody after court rejects bails||Twenty-one Hong Kong activists will remain in custody after a court on Friday rejected requests by some for bail and others withdrew their applications in a widely monitored case where they are charged with conspiracy to subvert the government.The charges against a total of 47 opposition figures represent the most sweeping use yet of Hong Kong's new security law, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.The case offers an insight into how the mainland-style justice drafted by Beijing into the security law clashes with the global financial hub's common-law traditions, and is being closely watched by foreign diplomats and rights groups.In contrast with past practice, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.Since the group of 47 were charged around two weeks ago, the court has heard a series of requests for bail. While most requests were rejected, the court approved some applications, prompting immediate appeals from prosecutors to overturn some of those approvals. Just five of the group are currently out on bail.Of the 21 defendants in court on Friday, Judge Victor So rejected 11 applications while the rest were withdrawn by the defendants. The rejected defendants have the right to file for another review in eight days, although most indicated they did not intend to do so.The 47 activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll in July 2020 that authorities said was part of a "vicious plot" to "overthrow" the government.The vote was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.The detentions have been fiercely criticised by governments in the West, including Britain and the United States.Hong Kong's Department of Justice has said no one should interfere with independent prosecutorial decisions. Supporters of the new law say it has restored stability after months of pro-democracy protests in 2019.Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings. The next hearing in the case is on May 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activists-remain-in-custody-after-court-rejects-bails-101615528041244.html
12-03-2021||World||UN chief Antonio Guterres blasts vaccine nationalism, hoarding, side deals||The United Nations chief criticized the “many examples of vaccine nationalism and vaccine hoarding” as well as side deals with Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers that undermine access to all people in the world.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement marking one year since the UN World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic that “the global vaccination campaign represents the greatest moral test of our times.”Ensuring that all people are vaccinated -- and “many low-income countries have not yet received a single dose” -- is essential to restart the global economy “and help the world move from locking down societies to locking down the virus,” he said.Guterres reiterated his call for Covid-19 vaccines to be seen as “a global public good.”“The world needs to unite to produce and distribute sufficient vaccines for all, which means at least doubling manufacturing capacity around the world,” he said. “That effort must start now.”The secretary-general paid tribute to health workers and other essential workers who have kept societies running.“I salute all those who have stood up to the deniers and disinformation, and have followed science and safety protocols,” he said. “You have helped save lives.”Guterres also commended “women, men and young people everywhere for adapting to work, learn and live in new ways.”“So many lives have been lost,” he said. “Economies have been upended and societies left reeling. The most vulnerable have suffered the most. Those left behind are being left even further behind.”Some 117 million people are confirmed to have been infected by the coronavirus, and according to Johns Hopkins, more than 2.6 million people have died.Guterres said the United Nations will keep pressing for affordable vaccines available for everyone and a recovery that improves the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-antonio-guterres-blasts-vaccine-nationalism-hoarding-side-deals-101615515272253.html
12-03-2021||World||Canada: Spotlight on NDP leader Jagmeet Singh after man arrested for assault||A man believed to be New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh’s brother-in-law has been arrested by Canadian law enforcement officers and charged with assault related to an incident of violence that occurred during a car rally organised by the Indo-Canadian community in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) on February 28 to celebrate the then awaited arrival of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines in Canada.In a statement released on Thursday evening, Peel Regional Police (PRP), which is investigating the incident at the rally, said, “Jodhveer Dhaliwal, a 30-year-old man from Caledon”, was charged with assault causing bodily harm. He is scheduled to attend the Ontario court of justice in Brampton on a later date.In a report published on Thursday headlined “NDP leader’s brother-in-law in altercation under police probe as south Asian Canadian factions clash over India unrest”, the daily National Post reported that as per a video of the incident, “a man resembling” Dhaliwal “strides toward an India supporter, shoving the man in the chest and sending him toppling backwards onto the pavement”. The report says Dhaliwal is married to Jagmeet Singh’s wife’s sister and is also distantly related to Liberal Party MP Ruby Sahota.The victim of that episode had filed a complaint with local law enforcement. A spokesperson for Peel police told HT that investigations based on a couple of videos from that day were in progress. Earlier, Jaskaran Singh, a 27-year-old from Brampton, a township in the GTA, was arrested and charged with assault on March 5, also related to multiple attacks on participants in the car rally.In its statement, PRP noted that it “supports the right to peaceful and lawful assembly. However, there will be no tolerance for violence or criminality, and all reported incidents will be investigated and those involved may be charged”. The victim is not being named due to concerns over his safety.The violence at the rally, which featured nearly 350 vehicles, took place as participants faced protesters, some flashing pro-Khalistan flags. On February 7, Indo-Canadian community members had also organised a similar car rally in the Metro Vancouver area and organisers later faced protesters, and were threatened and harassed. A delegation of Indo-Canadian community members went to the office of Jagmeet Singh in the town of Burnaby on Thursday and pasted posters on a window showing his face with the word “Missing”. Other posters read “Your silence is violence” and “Denounce Hatred against Hindus”. They were protesting over the apparent lack of action or statement from Jagmeet Singh over the community being targeted by alleged pro-Khalistan elements. This was a follow-up to a February 26 protest at the same venue, when a group under the banner of Concerned Citizens of Burnaby, BC, left a memorandum with Jagmeet Singh’s staff, calling upon him to address the root causes of “hate against Hindus arising from the pro-Khalistan movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-spotlight-on-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-after-man-arrested-for-assault-101615528778124.html

They said the cases have been found in about half of Japan’s 47 prefectures but need to be closely watched and precautions should be increased.Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures are under a non-binding state of emergency since Jan. 7. The measure, which was to end on March 7 in those areas, has been extended for two weeks as the infections have not slowed enough.Japan had about 444,300 cases and 8,451 deaths as of Thursday, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-tighten-border-control-against-coronavirus-variants-101615527510957.html
12-03-2021||World||Thailand puts off AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot after blood clot reports in Europe||Thailand delayed the use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine scheduled to start on Friday with its prime minister and cabinet members taking the first shots, citing safety concerns after reports of blood clots in some vaccinated people in Europe.The Asian nation is the first country outside of Europe suspending the use of the AstraZeneca shot, while several countries including Canada, Australia, the Philippines and South Korea said they would go ahead.In a health ministry news conference, Prasit Watanapa, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, confirmed the rollout would be delayed after a suspension of inoculations using the vaccine in Denmark, Norway and Iceland."AstraZeneca is still a good vaccine but with what has happened ... the health ministry based on this advice would like to postpone the usage of the AstraZeneca vaccine momentarily," Kiattiphum Wongjit, permanent secretary for the Public Health Ministry.Thailand was in a position to suspend the rollout for safety investigations because it had largely brought a second wave of coronavirus under control through quarantines and border controls, he said.AstraZeneca said on Thursday it had found no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis - marked by the formation of blood clots - in safety data of more than 10 million records, even when considering subgroups based on age, gender, production batch or country of use.More than 11 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine have so far been administered across the United Kingdom.Yong Poonvorawan, a Thai virology expert, told the news conference the investigation would also check on whether any issues might be related to particular batches in Europe and said the vaccines supplied to Thailand were made in Asia.Thailand has so far recorded just over 26,500 coronavirus infections and 85 fatalities in a population of 66.5 million. New cases are now registering below 100 per day."This may reflect how much the decision makers in a country tolerate temporary uncertainty about vaccine safety and balance that against the vaccine’s undoubted benefits of protection from COVID-19," said Julie Leask, a public health professor at the University of Sydney, referring to varying government decisions.Thailand's overall vaccination strategy is heavily reliant on the AstraZeneca shot to be produced locally by a company owned by the country's king, with 61 million doses reserved for its population.However, the Thai-produced AstraZeneca is not due until at least June, and Thailand last week began limited inoculations with 200,000 imported doses of Sinovac vaccine from China.Thailand last week received 117,300 doses of imported AstraZeneca vaccine, which the prime minister and his cabinet had been scheduled to receive on Friday.Austria said on Sunday it had stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism.It later said the batch, ABV5300, amounted to roughly one million doses in total and was sent to 17 European countries. It is not immediately clear whether the same batch has been sent to other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-puts-off-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-shot-after-blood-clot-reports-in-europe-101615526863034.html
12-03-2021||World||Biden says hate crimes against people of Asian descent are 'un-American'||US President Joe Biden has said that the "vicious" hate crimes against Asian Americans in the country amidst the pandemic were "un-American" and they must stop.Denouncing "violent" attacks on the Asian Americans, Biden in his first prime-time address to the nation since assuming office in January, said that members of the community were harassed, blamed and scapegoated.A surge in anti-Asian attacks has been reported since the start of the pandemic. It has left Asian Americans across the country scared and concerned. The actual number of hate incidents against them could be even higher, according to a civil rights group.Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition aimed at addressing anti-Asian discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, received more than 2,800 firsthand reports of anti-Asian hate, including physical and verbal assaults, between March 19 and December 31, 2020, the National Public Radio (NPR) reported.Recent attacks, including multiple violent attacks on elderly Asian Americans, have sparked outrage and activism in the Asian American community and spurred lawmakers and organisers to respond to the threat.Biden said that during this coronavirus pandemic too often, Americans turned against one another.“A mask, the easiest thing to do to save lives sometimes, it divides us. States pitted against one another instead of working with each other; vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated,” Biden said.“At this very moment, so many of them are our fellow Americans on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives, and still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's un-American, and it must stop,” Biden said.Biden’s reference to the hate crime against Asian Americans was welcomed by Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna.“Thank you” President Biden “for speaking up clearly and forcefully against the scapegoating of Asian Americans,” Khanna said in a tweet.Congressman Ted Lieu also thanked Biden for the strong words to protect Americans of Asian descent, and for the executive order to combat hate crimes."This is in stark contrast to the former President who made racist remarks like “Kung Flu” that inflamed prejudices against Asian Americans,” Lieu said.Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris said that hate of any kind is simply unacceptable.“Right now, Asian Americans and Asian immigrants in our country are facing an increase in hate and violence,” the first Asian-American US Vice President said.Biden and Harris said “are committed to working with the community to ensure all Americans are protected and respected.”On January 26, Biden issued the “Presidential Memorandum Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States.It mandates that the Attorney General shall explore opportunities to prevent discrimination, bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) individuals, and expand collection of data and public reporting regarding hate incidents against such individuals.The reported incidents range from verbal harassments to physical altercations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-hate-crimes-against-people-of-asian-descent-are-unamerican-101615526169520.html
12-03-2021||World||China eyes record monopoly fine near $1 billion for Alibaba: Report||China is considering imposing a record fine of nearly $1 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for allegedly flouting monopoly rules, according to a report, as authorities continue to put the screws on the firm as part of a crackdown on the technology sector.The penalty could top the $975 million paid by US chipmaker Qualcomm in 2015 -- the biggest known for anticompetitive practices in China -- the Wall Street Journal report said, citing unnamed "people with knowledge of the matter".Antitrust regulators in charge of Alibaba's case did not immediately respond to AFP queries on the report, which was published by the Journal late Thursday.The company, China's largest online shopping portal, has been in the crosshairs of authorities in recent months over concerns of its reach into the daily finances of ordinary Chinese people.But its legal troubles began after comments in October last year by billionaire founder Jack Ma in which he laid into China's convoluted regulatory system.In November, financial regulators pulled the plug on the record $35 billion Hong Kong-Shanghai initial public offering of Alibaba's online payment subsidiary Ant Group.A month later, officials opened an investigation into Alibaba's business practices, deemed anti-competitive, and Ma disappeared from public view until mid-January.The company based in the eastern city of Hangzhou said it was "fully cooperating" with the investigation by the State Administration for Market Regulation last month.Regulators are also investigating whether the conglomerate should divest assets unrelated to its main online retail business, the Journal reported without offering details.An Alibaba spokesperson declined to comment on the report when contacted by AFP.The company has come under fire in the past for allegedly forbidding its merchants from listing on rival e-commerce platforms.Once finalised, measures against Alibaba will need to be approved by China's top leadership.The squeeze on one of China's most influential companies is the latest sign that the leadership is ready to deflate the ambitions of big tech firms in a runaway internet sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-eyes-record-monopoly-fine-near-1-billion-for-alibaba-report-101615525269594.html
12-03-2021||World||Joe Biden aims for 'independence from this virus' by July 4||One year after the nation was brought to a near-standstill by the coronavirus, President Joe Biden pledged in his first prime-time address Thursday night to make all adults eligible for vaccines by May 1 and raised the possibility of beginning to "mark our independence from this virus” by the Fourth of July. He offered Americans fresh hope and appealed anew for their help.Speaking in the White House East Room, Biden honored the “collective suffering” of Americans over the past year in his 24-minute address and then offered them a vision for a return to a modicum of normalcy this summer.“We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by,” he said. "We are also bound together by the hope and the possibilities in the days in front of us.”He predicted Americans could safely gather at least in small groups for July Fourth to “make this Independence Day truly special.”But he also cautioned that this was a “goal” and attaining it depends on people's cooperation in following public health guidelines and rolling up their sleeves to get vaccinated as soon as eligible. Only that, he said, can bring about an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 530,000 Americans and disrupted the lives of countless more.“While it was different for everyone, we all lost something," Biden said of the sacrifices of the yearlong-and-counting pandemic.The speech came just hours after Biden signed into law a $1.9 trillion relief package that he said will help defeat the virus, nurse the economy back to health and deliver direct aid to Americans struggling to make ends meet.Some cash distributions could begin arriving in the bank accounts of Americans this weekend.“This historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country,” Biden said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office.Most noticeable to many Americans are provisions providing up to $1,400 in direct payments and extending $300 weekly emergency unemployment benefits into early September. Also included are expanded tax credits over the next year for children, child care and family leave — some of them credits that Democrats have signaled they’d like to make permanent — plus spending for renters, food programs and people’s utility bills.In his Thursday night address, Biden said that as vaccine supplies continue to increase, he will direct states and territories to make all adults eligible for vaccination by May 1. The U.S. is expecting to have enough doses for those 255 million adults by the end of that month, but Biden warned the process of actually administering those doses would take time, even as his administration looks to instill confidence in the safety of the vaccines to overcome hesitance.“Let me be clear, that doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1,” he said.Biden announced an expansion of other efforts to speed vaccinations, including deploying an additional 4,000 active-duty troops to support vaccination efforts and allowing more people — such as medical students, veterinarians and dentists — to deliver shots. He is also directing more doses toward some 950 community health centers and up to 20,000 retail pharmacies, to make it easier for people to get vaccinated closer to their homes.Biden added that his administration is planning to launch a nationwide website to help people find doses, saying it would address frustrations so that there would be “no more searching day and night for an appointment.”Even as he offered optimism, Biden made clear that the July 4 timetable applied only to smaller gatherings, not larger ones, and requires cooperation from Americans to continue to wear face coverings, maintain social distancing and follow federal guidelines meant to slow the spread of the virus in the near term. He also called on them roll up their sleeves to get vaccinated as soon as they’re eligible.This is “not the time to not stick with the rules," Biden said, warning of the potential for backsliding just as the nation is on the cusp of defeating the virus. “I need you, the American people," he added. "I need you. I need every American to do their part.”The House gave final congressional approval to the sweeping package by a near party line 220-211 vote on Wednesday, seven weeks after Biden entered the White House and four days after the Senate passed the bill. Republicans in both chambers opposed the legislation unanimously, characterizing it as bloated, crammed with liberal policies and heedless of signs the crises are easing.Biden had originally planned to sign the bill on Friday, but it arrived at the White House more quickly than anticipated."We want to move as fast as possible,” tweeted chief of staff Ron Klain.Biden's initial prime-time speech was “a big moment,” said presidential historian and Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley. “He’s got to win over hearts and minds for people to stay masked and get vaccinated, but also recognize that after the last year, the federal government hasn’t forgotten you.”Biden's evening remarks were central to a pivotal week for the president as he addresses the defining challenge of his term: shepherding the nation through the twin public health and economic storms brought about by the virus.On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released initial guidance for how vaccinated people can resume some normal activities. On Wednesday, Congress approved the president’s $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan,” aimed at easing the economic impact of the virus on tens of millions of people. And the nation was on pace to administer its 100 millionth dose of vaccine as soon as Thursday.Almost exactly one year ago, President Donald Trump addressed the nation to mark the WHO’s declaration of a global pandemic. He announced travel restrictions and called for Americans to practice good hygiene but displayed little alarm about the forthcoming catastrophe. Trump, it was later revealed, acknowledged that he had been deliberately “playing down” the threat of the virus.Biden implicitly criticized his predecessor, opening his remarks by referring to “denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-aims-independence-from-this-virus-by-july-4-101615526000436.html
12-03-2021||World||Ten years of conflict in Syria, from protest to war to economic decline||Ten years into Syria's conflict, President Bashar al-Assad has survived the bloody insurgency which started out with peaceful protests in March 2011.He holds sway over many parts of the country, helped by Russia's military presence and Iran's Shi'ite militias.Hostile Turkey still controls swathes of territory in the northwest and the U.S. has a presence in the northeast, a major oil and wheat producing area.But Assad's biggest challenge now is the economy.Post-war discontent with corruption, spiralling food prices, a collapsed currency, worsening power cuts and gasoline shortages have aggravated hardships for many families who have lost loved ones.This is a timeline of how the conflict began with peaceful pro-democracy protests, then developed into a multi-sided conflict that sucked in world powers, killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more.* March 2011 - The first big protests against Assad's rule that began in Deraa in southern Syria spread across the country. Security forces respond with arrests and shootings.* June 2012 - World powers meet in Geneva and agree on the need for a political transition, but divisions on how to achieve it will foil years of U.N.-sponsored peace efforts.* July 2012 - Assad launches air raids on towns and cities that had rebelled against his rule, as once peaceful protesters now carry arms. Thousands are killed.* Aug. 2013 - Washington declares the use of chemical weapons a red line, but a gas attack on densely populated rebel-held Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus kills hundreds of civilians without triggering a U.S. military response.* Jan. 2014 - An al Qaeda splinter group seizes Raqqa before grabbing territory across Syria and Iraq, declaring a caliphate and renaming itself Islamic State.* Sept. 2014 - Washington builds an anti-Islamic State coalition and starts air strikes, helping Kurdish forces turn the jihadist tide but creating friction with ally Turkey.* March 2015 - As Assad's forces lose ground in many towns and cities that rose up against his one-party Baath rule, a mainstream armed insurgency composed of former demonstrators and army defectors is slowly undermined by Islamist militants helped by foreign jihadists coming to Syria.* Sept. 2015 - Russia joins the war on Assad's side, deploying warplanes and giving military aid that, with the help of Iran, swiftly turns the course of conflict against the rebels.* Aug. 2016 - Alarmed by Kurdish advances on the border, Turkey launches an incursion with allied rebels, making a zone of Turkish control that it later extends in 2018.* Dec. 2016 - The Syrian army and its allies defeat rebels in their biggest urban base of Aleppo after months of siege and bombardment, confirming Assad's momentum.* March 2017 - Israel acknowledges launching air strikes against Hezbollah in Syria, aiming to degrade the strength of Iran whose elite Quds forces and Shi'ite militias from Afghanistan and Lebanon steadily expand their influence in Syria.* April 2017 - The United States launches a first cruise missile attack on a Syrian government airbase near Homs after a poison gas attack on rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun.* Nov. 2017 - U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces defeat Islamic State in Raqqa. That offensive, and a rival one by the Syrian army, drives the jihadists from nearly all their land.* April 2018 - After months of blockade and air raids, the Russian-backed army recaptures Eastern Ghouta, before retaking the other insurgent enclaves in central Syria, and then the rebels' southern bastion of Deraa in June.* Sept. 2018 - A Russian-Turkish deal over Idlib and the rebel-held northwest freezes the frontlines and reduces the bombing raids that killed hundreds of civilians in the last major opposition bastion.* March 2019 - As its local allies take Islamic State's last area in the east, the United States decides to keep some troops in Syria after earlier saying it would pull out.* April-Dec. 2019 - Russian-backed forces launch a campaign in the northwest that ends with the capture of a strategic rebel town of Khan Sheikhoun in August, a site of a major chemical attack on civilians.* A Russian-Turkish summit in October reduces fighting until Moscow resumes a major assault in December that pushes deeper into the last opposition bastion.* Dec. 2019 - March 2020 - The Russian-led offensive in northwest Syria displaces about one million civilians, marking the worst humanitarian crisis since the conflict began. Ankara sends thousands of soldiers across the border to help stem the offensive. Turkey says it will not stop Syrian refugees from reaching Europe and opens its borders. Thousands flee for Greece.* March 2020 - Turkey and Russia agree a ceasefire for Idlib, vowing to hold joint patrols and establish a secure corridor near the M4 highway.* March-Aug. 2020 - Syria struggles with widespread transmission of COVID-19 that adds to the country's hardships.* May 2020-March 2021 - The government faces severe fuel shortages and Syrians queue for hours for subsidised bread, signs of a faltering economy. The government is forced to ration supplies and apply several rounds of steep price hikes.* May 2020 - The first public signs of a fallout between Assad and his cousin tycoon Rami Makhlouf surface, with the later posting videos about the rift on social media.* June 2020 - The United States announces the toughest U.S. sanctions against Damascus known as the "Caesar Act", with wider powers to freeze assets of anyone dealing with Syria, regardless of nationality, and covering more sectors from construction to energy.* Dec. 2020-March 2021 - Israel steps up its air strikes against various parts of Syria, especially the east, hitting targets to prevent further Iranian entrenchment.* Feb. 2021 - Joe Biden's U.S. administration carries out an airstrike in Syria's east alongside the Iraqi border against a structure belonging to what it said were Iran-backed militia. Syria calls the attack "cowardly".* March 2021 - The Syrian pound hits new lows, trading close to 4,000 to the dollar as the economy weakens amid severe foreign currency shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ten-years-of-conflict-in-syria-from-protest-to-war-to-economic-decline-101615525393549.html

12-03-2021||World||Japan-Australia venture starts producing hydrogen from dirty coal||A Japanese-Australian venture has begun producing hydrogen from brown coal in a A$500 million ($390 million) pilot project that aims to show liquefied hydrogen can be produced commercially and exported safely overseas.The plan is to create the first international supply chain for liquefied hydrogen and the next big step will be to ship a cargo on the world's first liquefied hydrogen carrier."We have the potential here to be world leaders in the production and export of hydrogen and this project is developing up that technology to do exactly that," Australian Energy Minister Angus Taylor told Reuters on the sidelines of a ceremony marking the event.Australia, already dominant in global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade, is hoping liquefied hydrogen will give it a greener market for its coal and gas.Run by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and located in the state of Victoria, home to a quarter of the world's known brown coal reserves, the project is key to helping Japan meet its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.The world's fifth-largest energy consumer aims to boost its annual hydrogen demand tenfold to 20 million tonnes by 2050, equivalent to about 40% of its current power generation.Brown coal is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low energy content and has fuelled some of Australia's dirtiest power stations, some of which have already shut or are slated for closure."The important thing is hydrogen should be cost competitive, and Victorian brown coal is a cheap source of hydrogen," said Hirofumi Kawazoe, general manager of Kawasaki's Hydrogen Engineering Australia unit.The project is producing hydrogen by reacting coal with oxygen and steam under high heat and pressure in a process that also yields carbon dioxide and other gases.If the project goes commercial, the carbon dioxide would be buried off the coast of Victoria. The Australian and Victoria state governments are running a parallel project to test transporting and injecting carbon dioxide under the seabed.Studies show hydrogen produced from coal with carbon capture and storage is half to one-third the cost of producing green hydrogen, said Jeremy Stone, a J-Power director on the project.Green hydrogen is produced using wind and solar power to split water and unlike hydrogen produced from coal is dependent on the weather.Groups campaigning to end the use of brown coal say, however, that the project is a waste of money."The technology will be superseded in the next few years by clean hydrogen sourced from renewable energy. Any investment in coal-to-hydrogen infrastructure will quickly become a white elephant," said Environment Victoria campaigns manager Nicholas Aberle.The hydrogen produced in the 70 kilograms a day demonstration plant will be transported by trailer to a port site where it will be liquefied for export.The first cargo to Japan has been delayed to the second half of this year due to COVID-19 restrictions which have slowed final checks on the tanker.Partners in the project include Iwatani Corp, Marubeni Corp, Sumitomo Corp and AGL Energy Ltd, whose mine is supplying the brown coal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japanaustralia-venture-starts-producing-hydrogen-from-dirty-coal-101615524153822.html
12-03-2021||World||'Combination of punches': China justifies legal overhaul in Hong Kong||China's plans for electoral reform in Hong Kong, coupled with the imposition of a security law, amount to a "combination of punches" to quell unrest in the southern city, a top Beijing official said Friday.Hong Kong was rocked by massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019 against Beijing's encroachment on its unique freedoms.The Chinese government has since cracked down on the opposition, arresting dozens of activists and smothering the street movement with a draconian national security law.On Thursday it moved to ensure only "patriots" run the city, when an annual rubber-stamp parliament voted for sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system -- including powers to veto candidates.The plan was swiftly pilloried by the US, EU and Britain, the city's former colonial ruler which handed control of the territory to Beijing in 1997 under a special "one country, two systems" arrangement.A Beijing official in charge of Hong Kong policy told reporters Friday the "chaos" of recent years showed that the city's electoral system has "clear loopholes and shortcomings".Alongside the national security law, the move represents "a combination of punches, to... effectively manage the ongoing chaos", said Zhang Xiaoming, of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.The problem in Hong Kong is a "political one", he said, repeating an often-used -- but unproven -- allegation by Beijing that outside forces are fomenting disruption in the financial hub."It is a contest between a seizure of power and countering the seizure, subversion and counter-subversion, infiltration and counter-infiltration," Zhang said."We have no room for concession on this issue."'Invasive surgery'At its annual congress last year, the Communist Party leadership approved the national security law that has since seen dozens of campaigners prosecuted or jailed.Changes to Hong Kong approved this year still need to be written and then promulgated under the country's opaque political system -- but are likely to include vetting the political views of candidates in Hong Kong's legislature and reducing the number of directly elected seats.Hong Kong's influential Election Committee, which selects the city's leader and is already stacked with Beijing loyalists, will be expanded to 1,500 representatives, up from 1,200."To be precise, this is a minimally invasive surgery," Zhang said of the reform proposals."Minimally invasive surgery is characterised by small wounds, deep penetration, and quicker postoperative recovery."He insisted "you will still be able to hear different voices" in the Hong Kong government.After the proposed reform was approved criticism has poured in from the United States and the European Union.The move is "a direct attack on autonomy promised to people in Hong Kong under the Sino-British Joint Declaration" before the handover of the territory in 1997, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.Blinken also urged Hong Kong to go ahead with the September elections, which the city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has hinted will be delayed again.The EU said the decision would have a "significant impact on democratic accountability and political pluralism in Hong Kong."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/combination-of-punches-china-justifies-legal-overhaul-in-hong-kong-101615524417496.html
12-03-2021||World||'Will never let the Fukushima Daiichi accident fade': Japan marks 10 years||Japan fell quiet at 2:46 p.m. Thursday to mark the minute that an earthquake began 10 years ago, setting off a tsunami and nuclear crisis that devastated the country’s northeast coast in a disaster that one survivor said he fears people are beginning to forget.Carrying bouquets of flowers, many walked to the seaside or visited graves to pray for relatives and friends washed away by the water. Emperor Naruhito and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga were among those observing a moment of silence at a memorial in Tokyo. Dignitaries and representatives of the survivors spoke — but most watched the ceremony online or on television because of restrictions to slow the coronavirus pandemic.The magnitude-9.0 quake that struck on March 11, 2011 — one of the strongest on record — triggered a wall of water that swept far inland, destroying towns and causing meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.The days following the quake were terrifying for many in Japan and farther afield, as hydrogen explosions released radiation into the air and technicians worked furiously to try to cool the plant’s nuclear fuel by pumping in seawater. There were concerns and confusion about the extent of meltdowns, and how far radiation might travel, including fears that Tokyo and even the US west coast were at risk. Officials said they were not, but panicked shoppers as far away as China and Russia scrambled to stock up on goods they thought would protect them.More than 18,000 people died, mostly in the tsunami, and nearly half a million people were displaced. The government recognizes another 3,700 — mostly from Fukushima prefecture — who died of causes linked to the disaster, such as stress.Ten years on, more than 40,000 people are still unable to return home, and areas near the wrecked plant are still off-limits due to contamination from the initial radiation fallout. Many in Japan have said that the country’s intense focus on physically rebuilding has at times ignored other healing that needed to be done.“Reconstruction in disaster-hit areas has moved forward significantly, but recovery of the survivors' hearts is not making as much progress as we wish," Makoto Saito, a teacher at an elementary school in Minamisoma who lost his 5-year-old son Shota in the tsunami, said in a speech at the Tokyo ceremony.The government has said this is the last year it will organize a national commemoration for the disaster. Saito, representing Fukushima survivors, said that he is afraid memories are fading outside the disaster zone and he is committed to preventing that from happening by continuing to recount the lessons from the disaster and telling the stories of his son.Naruhito said “my heart aches” when he thinks of those who have struggled to adapt to drastic changes to their lives because of the triple disaster, including the loss of loved ones, jobs and whole communities.“I also consider it important to heal emotional scars and watch over the mental and physical health of those afflicted, including the elderly and children,” he said. He stressed that it's important for people to stand by them and help reconstruct their lives “without leaving even a single soul behind in this difficult situation.”In Tokyo’s posh shopping district of Ginza, pedestrians stopped to observe the moment of silence as in previous anniversaries. But a memorial concert at the nearby Hibiya park, which has drawn many people in past years, was held online this year due to the pandemic and attracted only a small audience. Some anti-nuclear groups also held a protest in Tokyo.Beyond Tokyo, many marked the day by raising awareness for disaster prevention. In Kyoto, authorities conducted emergency drills.Roads, train lines, houses and other key infrastructure have mostly been rebuilt in the disaster-hit region at the cost of more than 30 trillion yen ($280 billion). But no-go zones remain in parts of Fukushima, where shops and houses were abandoned and cordoned off and massive amounts of radioactive waste from decontamination pile up. Swaths of empty land remain in coastal towns farther north in Miyagi and Iwate prefectures, which were already seeing people move away before the disaster and have seen that trend accelerate.In Otsuchi town in Iwate prefecture, where the tsunami destroyed the town hall, killing about 40 employees, families in dark suits gathered on a piece of empty land where the building used to stand. In Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture, dozens of residents prayed at a cenotaph carrying the names of more than 3,000 victims.In Rikuzentakata, another Iwate city where a tsunami as high as 17 meters (56 feet) killed more than 1,700 residents, dozens of police officials wearing orange life vests combed the coastline in search of remains of those who have not been found — an effort that is still repeated in many towns every month. The remains of a woman found in February were returned to her family on Tuesday.No deaths have been confirmed directly from the radiation, but Fukushima has fallen behind in the recovery efforts, with pieces of land totaling 33,000 hectares (81,500 acres) in seven towns near the nuclear plant still classified as no-go zones. Securing the nuclear fuel, dismantling the reactors and decontaminating the plant is an unprecedented challenge, with some questioning after 10 years of work whether it can be done.But the president of Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings, which ran the plant, said in a statement Thursday that the company is determined to continue the cleanup and help develop jobs and businesses related to that process.“We do not consider the 10th anniversary a breaking point, and will never let the Fukushima Daiichi accident fade,” Tomoaki Kobayakawa said.Thursday's ceremony comes just two weeks before the Olympic torch relay begins from Fukushima for the delayed Tokyo Summer Games in July.Suga has said the Olympics will showcase Japan’s recovery from the disaster and will be proof of human victory over the coronavirus pandemic.

In May, it extended a $500 million loan to provide relief to Filipinos who had lost jobs during lockdowns.Separately, the ADB allotted $400 million for the Philippines, the first recipient of its vaccine access support programme.The Philippines, which started its inoculation programme on March 1 with 600,000 Sinovac doses donated by China, is battling a renewed surge in Covid-19 cases.The country, which aims to inoculate 70 million of its more than 108 million population, is in talks with vaccine manufacturers to buy 161 million doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-secures-900-mn-in-loans-from-world-bank-adb-for-covid-19-vaccines-101615521838098.html

Ottens, who engineered the concept of magnetic tape players and compact discs (CDs), passed away at his home on Sunday in Duizel, the Netherlands. The cause of his death has not been given yet.Born on June 21, 1926, Ottens showed keen interest in engineering and even built a radio as a teenager which his family used to receive Radio Oranje during Germany’s wartime occupation of the Netherlands. The device that he made was equipped with a directional antenna which he termed as “Germanenfilter” because it was resistant to the jammers used by the Nazi regime. After the war, Ottens obtained an engineering degree and joined Philips in 1952. Five years after joining Philips, Ottens became the head of the company’s product development department at its audio plant in Hasselt, Belgium. In 1960, Ottens with his team developed the first portable tape recorder and two years later, he invented CDs.“Nothing can match the sound of the CD,” Ottens had then told the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad. “It is absolutely noise and rumble-free. That never worked with tape … I have made a lot of record players and I know that the distortion with vinyl is much higher. I think people mainly hear what they want to hear.”In 1963, the devices invented by Ottens and his team were presented at the Internationale Funkausstellung which is a trade exhibition for audio products in Berlin and were widely praised. Ottens struck a deal between Sony and Phillips with the aim to manufacture cassettes at feasible rates for the portable tape recorders after which Japanese manufacturers quickly copied Ottens’ ideas and sold the copies of the model in the Japanese market in a different format, according to Philips. Ottens himself managed to sell approximately 100 billion cassette tapes worldwide, according to Philips, before retiring in 1986.On the 50th anniversary of the invention of the cassette tape in 2013, a special exhibition was created at the Philips museum to honour Ottens' work. "When your time has gone, it’s time to disappear,” Ottens was quoted saying during the exhibition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lou-ottens-dutch-inventor-of-cassette-tape-dies-at-94-101615520224389.html
12-03-2021||World||North Korean defectors struggle to send money home due to Covid crisis||For the first time in years, Choi Bok-hwa didn’t get her annual birthday call from her mother in North Korea. Each January, Choi’s mother had climbed a mountain and used a broker's smuggled Chinese cellphone to call South Korea to wish her happy birthday and arrange a badly needed money transfer.Choi, who hasn't sent money or talked to her 75-year-old mother since May, believes the silence is linked to the pandemic, which led North Korea to shut its borders tighter than ever and impose some of the world’s toughest restrictions on movement.Other defectors in the South have also lost contact with their loved ones in North Korea amid the turmoil of Covid-19 — and the trouble is not just on the North Korean side. The disconnection between defectors and their families in the North is shutting down an important emotional and financial link between the rival Koreas, whose citizens are banned from contacting each other.Defectors in the South have long shared part of their income with parents, children and siblings in North Korea. But these defectors, who face chronic discrimination and poverty in the South, now say they’ve stopped or sharply reduced the remittances because of plunging incomes. Others are postponing them because they can’t contact the brokers who act as middlemen or because the brokers are demanding extremely high fees.Choi, a singer in a North Korean-themed art troupe, last year earned only about 10-20% of what she usually gets because of canceled performances.“I’m waiting for her call more than ever these days,” said Choi, 47, who lives in Ansan, just south of Seoul.About 33,000 North Koreans have escaped to South Korea since North Korea suffered a famine in the mid-1990s. Last year, during the pandemic, only 229 came to South Korea, down from 1,047 in 2019.Many defectors use brokers to stay in touch with their families in the North, but that process is complex, expensive and risky.Brokers in North Korea often use smuggled mobile phones to call the South from mountains near the border with China, where they can get better reception and avoid official detection.The calls are often followed by money transfers, which require defectors to send money to the bank accounts of other brokers on the Chinese side of the border. The brokers in China and in North Korea are often separately smuggling goods in and out of North Korea. This means that money transfers don’t need to be sent across the border immediately; instead, brokers in North Korea can give the cash to defectors’ relatives and get paid back by their smuggling partners in China later.But North Korea’s year-long border closure has battered the smuggling business, leaving brokers with little money to use for defectors’ remittances, observers say.Gen. Robert Abrams, the chief of US troops in South Korea, said last year that North Korea had sent special forces along its border with China to keep smugglers out and had “shoot-to-kill orders in place.”Lee Sang Yong, managing editor at Daily NK in Seoul, an online media organization with sources in North Korea, said Pyongyang has tried to jam mobile signals and enforced severe restrictions along the border.Brokers in North Korea and China have long taken 30% of the money being transferred as commission. But during the pandemic some brokers have taken a 40-50% slice, according to defectors and activists.There are no official, extensive studies on how the pandemic has affected money transfers. But separate surveys of several hundred defectors by civic groups showed 18-26% of respondents sent money to North Korea last year, down from about 50% in a similar-sized poll in 2014.Shin Mi-nyeo, head of the Saejowi civic group that conducted one of the recent surveys, said that money transfers were down even before the pandemic because many defectors had cut contact with their families in the North for financial reasons.“They are initially eager to support their families in the North because they know what their lives are like there,” Shin said. After a while, though, it becomes “out of sight, out of mind.”Each time Choi’s mother called her, she often gave the phone numbers of neighbors who had fled to South Korea who weren’t answering calls from their families back home.When Choi reached some of them, she said they told her that illness or financial difficulties meant they couldn't afford the regular requests for money from their families in the North, where the estimated gross national income per capita in 2019 was one-27th of South Korea’s.It's not clear how much worse this will make the North's already moribund economy. South Korea’s spy agency last year reported a four-fold price increase of imported foods like sugar and seasoning in the North, while Chinese data show its official trade volume with North Korea plunged by 80% last year.“The money we send is a lifeline,” said Cho Chung Hui, 57, who transferred the equivalent of $890 to each of his two siblings every year before the pandemic. “It’s such big money. If someone works really diligently in North Korea's markets, they make only $30-40 per month.”Cho said his siblings used to travel for hours to the border to meet brokers and call him for money. But he hasn't heard from his siblings since November 2019.Cho said some “robber-like brokers” now ask for a huge cut of the transferred money and that many of his defector friends are waiting for commissions to stabilize before resuming remittances.Kim Hyeong Soo, 57, said North Koreans with family members in South Korea used to be called “traitors’ families.” But the sneer turned to envy when they began receiving money. Kim, co-head of a human rights group called the Stepping Stones, said he stopped sending remittances last year because his income plummeted.South Korean law bans its citizens from unauthorized contact with North Koreans, but authorities don’t strictly apply the regulations to defectors because of humanitarian reasons. North Korean officials often overlook money transfers because they get bribes from those receiving money.“North Korean police officers are poor, too,” Cho said.Cho, head of the Seoul-based NGO Good Farmers, said it’s “very burdensome” to send money to his siblings, but he'd do it again if his family called. “I feel sorry for them because we couldn’t come here together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-defectors-struggle-to-send-money-home-due-to-covid-crisis-101615519496811.html

The U.S. wants her extradited to face fraud charges.China has revealed few details of the charges against the two, and Canadian diplomats allowed occasional visits have said little other than to call for them to be released.Global Times said Kovrig was “accused of having used an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig.”Meng, who remains free on bail in Vancouver, is also the daughter of the founder of Huawei, which China's government has promoted around the world as one of its national champions. Her arrest enraged Beijing, which sees the U.S. case as a political move designed to prevent China’s rise, and it sent China-Canada relations into a tailspin.China has also retaliated by placing restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola oil seed, and handed death sentences to four Canadians convicted of drug smuggling.Beijing has repeatedly demanded Meng's immediate, unconditional release as her case winds its way through the Canadian legal system.The Communist Party newspaper's report late Thursday gave no details on the timing or location of the proceedings again Kovrig and Spavor and cited a “source close to the matter” whom it did not further identify.Hearings have been delayed because of Covid-19 prevention measures but the court will “push forward the trial soon," the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-soon-try-2-canadians-on-spying-charges-says-newspaper-101615518014378.html

A second wave that began in December is now registering below 100 new infections per day.Thailand's overall vaccination strategy is heavily reliant on AstraZeneca, which will be produced locally by a company owned by the country's king, with 61 million doses reserved for the Thai population.However, the locally made AstraZeneca is not due to be ready until at least June, and Thailand last week began limited inoculations with imported doses of the Sinovac vaccine.Thailand has so far administered about 40,000 of the 200,000 recently received doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac, Kiattiphum said.The country also last week received 117,300 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which the prime minister and his cabinet had been scheduled to receive on Friday.Kiattiphum said that Thailand's imported doses were not from the same batch that is being investigated in Europe."We got this from global supply and there is no report of this (problem) in Asia," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-premier-delays-astrazeneca-shot-over-probe-into-blood-clots-101615517342115.html
12-03-2021||World||Myanmar: More protests planned as Suu Kyi's lawyer dismisses bribery claims||Myanmar activists pledged to hold more rallies and strikes on Friday, a day after a rights group said security forces killed 12 protesters and as the lawyer of deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi ridiculed new bribery allegations against her.The Southeast Asian country has been in crisis since the army ousted Suu Kyi’s elected government in a Feb. 1 coup, detained her and officials of her National League for Democracy party and set up a ruling junta of generals.Junta spokesman, Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, said on Thursday Suu Kyi had accepted illegal payments worth $600,000, as well as gold, while in government, according to a complaint by Phyo Mien Thein, a former chief minister of Yangon.Adding corruption charges to the accusations against Suu Kyi could mean she faces a harsher penalty. She currently faces four comparatively minor charges - including illegally importing six walkie talkie radios and flouting coronavirus restrictions."This accusation is the most hilarious joke," Suu Kyi's lawyer Khin Maung Zaw said in a statement posted on social media. "She might have other weaknesses but she doesn't have weakness in moral principle."Thursday was one of the deadliest days since the military took power.Among the dead were eight people killed in the central town of Myaing when security forces fired on a protest, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said.In Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, protester Chit Min Thu was killed in the North Dagon district. His wife, Aye Myat Thu, told Reuters he had insisted on joining the protests despite her appeals for him to stay home for the sake of their son."He said it's worth dying for," she said through her tears. "He is worried about people not joining the protest. If so, democracy will not return to the country."The bloodshed also came hours after the U.N. Security Council had called for restraint from the army, which has been trying to put down daily anti-coup protests and paralysing strikes.Pro-democracy activists urged people not to be cowed and in posts on social media called for night demonstrations on Friday and for strikes and civil disobedience campaigns that have paralysed swathes of the economy to continue.Candlelight vigils by protesters in defiance of a curfew have occurred more frequently in recent weeks.'CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY'Thursday's deaths brought the number of protesters killed since the coup to more than 70, the AAPP said. Some 2,000 people have also been detained since the coup, it says.UN human rights investigator Thomas Andrews told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva the military may have committed crimes against humanity. He called for multilateral sanctions on the junta and the state energy firm, Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise.The army did not respond to requests for comment on the latest deaths but the junta spokesman said on Thursday the security forces were disciplined and used force only when necessary.Amnesty International accused the army of using lethal force against protesters and said many killings it had documented amounted to extra-judicial executions.Suu Kyi, 75, fought for decades to overturn military rule under previous juntas before the start of tentative democratic reforms in 2011. She had spent a total of around 15 years under house arrest.The army has justified taking power by saying that a November election, overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi's party, was marred by fraud - an assertion rejected by the electoral commission.Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun reiterated the military would only be in charge for a certain period before holding an election. The junta has said a state of emergency will last for a year, but has not set a date for the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-more-protests-planned-as-suu-kyi-s-lawyer-dismisses-bribery-claims-101615516789300.html

Instead, all adult Australians wanting a Covid-19 vaccine will receive their first dose by October, he said on Friday.So far only around 150,000 people have been vaccinated, though Australia is under less pressure than other countries, as it has not recorded any locally Covid cases in nearly two weeks.Australia has reported just over 29,000 Covid-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began, far fewer than many developed countries, due international border closures, lockdowns and strict social distancing rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-continues-astrazeneca-roll-out-says-no-evidence-of-blood-clots-101615514852251.html

The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories."Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people," said Huang.The minister also asked local government to eliminate outdated capacity and said the MEE will guide companies to improve their pollution control levels.The most-traded iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange has slumped over 5% so far this week on concerns of tighter production controls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-101615514615302.html
12-03-2021||World||US group opposes Joe Biden administration's steps on H1B visas||A US group on Thursday opposed the move of the Biden administration to reverse some decisions of the previous Trump administration with regard to H-1B visas, in particular going back to the lottery system for allocation of this most sought after work visa for foreign technology professionals.The rule, Modification of Registration Requirement for Petitioners Seeking To File Cap-Subject H-1B Petitions, requires that US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prioritise the higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign workers for H-1B cap-subject visas, thus ensuring US businesses have access to the best pool of foreign workers, while also discouraging wage suppression and creating unfair competition to American workers.In its comment submitted to the Department of Homeland Security, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) asserted that the implementation of the Trump administration rule would reduce abuse of the H-1B program by unscrupulous employers while also protecting American workers.Founded in 1979, FAIR is the country's largest immigration reform group."FAIR strongly supports the substance of the final rule and urges DHS to implement the rule without delay. As DHS has reiterated throughout the rulemaking process, prioritising wage levels in the registration selection process incentivises employers to offer higher wages, or to petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher-skilled aliens that are commensurate with higher wage levels, to increase the likelihood of selection for an eventual petition," the comments note."President (Joe) Biden often portrays himself as a man from the 'working class' who is a tireless defender of the American worker," said FAIR president Dan Stein."Yet his administration is set to postpone, by at least a year, an important rule change that prevents unscrupulous employers from using the H-1B program to undercut American wages while ensuring that companies that truly need skilled foreign workers have access to the best and the brightest," he alleged.Current DHS policies require USCIS to select registrations on a purely random basis, utilizing a lottery system, when demand for H-1B visas exceeds the numerical limit set by statute, note the comments."This random lottery selection process places no weight on wage or skill levels and fails to ensure businesses actually have access to the best and brightest workers possible. Worse, the lottery creates a scenario where American workers could be replaced by foreign workers who can be paid significantly less or who possess considerably lower skills," said Stein.FAIR strongly urged DHS to implement these critical reforms without undue delay"This final rule will allow DHS to more effectively protect US workers against competition from foreign labor at a time when US workers need protection more than ever. The acute fiscal harm that US workers are facing as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic will only be exacerbated if employers are encouraged to continue to underpay H-1B beneficiaries because of an outdated and illogical current wage structure," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-group-opposes-joe-biden-administration-s-steps-on-h1b-visas-101615515369095.html

He stated that the US will overcome one of the "toughest and darkest periods" by beating the virus.Over 29 million Americans have been infected by the virus and more than 500,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US.Biden was addressing the nation on the anniversary of Covid-19 in the US."A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked... denials for days, weeks then months which led to more deaths, more stress and loneliness," Biden said in his address to the nation."While it was different for everyone, we all lost something... a collective sacrifice," Biden said.The US President underlined the national spirit and said, "Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do, in fact, it may be the most American thing we do, and that's what we have done."Biden said he carries a card in his pocket with the Covid-19 fatality toll of American."I know it's been hard, I truly know... I carry a card in my pocket with a number of Americans who have died due to Covid-19 till date... As of now, total deaths in America - 527,726 - that's more deaths than World War I, World War II, Vietnam War and 9/11 combined," Biden said.The President has also said that he wants states to make all US adults eligible for coronavirus vaccinations by May 1, further accelerating the government’s effort to end the pandemic to create a greater sense of normalcy in the country by July 4 Independence Day holiday.Earlier in the day, Biden signed the Rescue Plan law, designed to be a financial bridge to hard-hit Americans and a boost to the economy, with Vice President Kamala Harris at his side in the Oval Office.

12-03-2021||World||China's first potential target is Taiwan, says US Commander||As Taipei continues to remain at the forefront of the escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, Taiwan could be the first potential target of Chinese military aggression in the next five to 10 years, a top US military commander said.According to Focus Taiwan, Philip Davidson, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, made the comments in response to questions from Republican lawmaker Scott DesJarlais during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on national security challenges on Wednesday, including what he considers to be the most likely target of Chinese aggression or military action in the next 5 to 10 years."Given what they've said both publicly and over time, and certainly during the tenure of Chairman Xi Jinping, I would say Taiwan is the first," Davidson said.On Tuesday, the commander said that Beijing's threats toward Taiwan could manifest in the next six years as China seeks to supplant the U.S. leadership role in the international order.Focus Taiwan further reported that the US Commander was also asked to express his views on how cross-Taiwan Strait relations have evolved over the past three years during his tenure as commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command.He responded that China's revocation of its "one country, two systems" approach in Hong Kong alarmed Taiwan to an extent that during Taiwan's 2019 legislative elections, both the Democratic Progressive Party and the Kuomintang had to voice their opposition to the "one country, two systems" approach."So it has steeled, I think, Taiwan's status in the region and I think all other nations in the region as well have noticed a very pernicious approach that China took to Hong Kong and that has put a chill on many relationships as well," Davidson said.David F. Helvey, acting assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said the future of the US is inextricably linked to that of the Indo-Pacific region."As our department's priority theater, we're committed to upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific region where all nations, large and small, are secure in their sovereignty, can pursue economic opportunity and resolve disputes without coercion, and can exercise the freedoms of navigation over flight, consistent with an open and stable international order," Helvey explained.The White House on Monday said that Washington will continue to contribute to Taiwan's self-defence capabilities."Our position on Taiwan remains clear. We will stand with friends and allies to advanced our shared prosperity, security and values. And in the Indo-Pacific region, we maintain our long-standing commitment," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in a press briefing."We maintain our long-standing commitments as outlined in the three communicates, the Taiwan Relations Act and the six assurances. We will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability. So our position remains the same," she added.Sputnik citing an official reported that a State Department bilateral fact sheet stated the US and Taiwan enjoy an unofficial relationship, but Washington does not support the Island's independence.A 1979 pact with China switched US diplomatic recognition to Beijing, although The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in that same year, allows Washington to support the island's defensive capabilities.Deeming one-China policy as outdated and counter-productive, recently two United States congressmen have introduced a resolution calling for the US government to resume formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.The bill, US Congress House Concurrent Resolution 21, was sponsored by US House representatives Tom Tiffany and Scott Perry on February 26, Focus Taiwan reported. The resolution called US government to scrap the one-China policy.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing.Taiwan returned to the forefront of US-China tensions last weekend when Beijing sent more than two dozen warplanes into the self-governing island's air defence identification zone in a 48-hour period.While the frequency of such drills has increased in recent years, the timing and the composition of the latest formations -- mostly fighter jets and bombers -- appeared intended to send a message to the new administration in Washington, reported CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-first-potential-target-is-taiwan-says-us-commander-101615514879266.html

The country reported 488 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the highest in three weeks.South Korea has so far reported a total of 94,686 infections, with 1,662 deaths.The Prime Minister warned of the constant risk of cluster infections in greater Seoul area, where the third wave began. Over 60% of infections were recorded in the capital and neighbouring areas, according to the KDCA."We are aware that the citizens are getting weary of drawn-out social distancing," said Chung. "A retreat from virus-prevention measures could lead to a fourth wave of infections."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-extends-covid-19-social-distancing-rules-amid-vaccination-drive-101615513173109.html
12-03-2021||World||All Covid restrictions lifted from New Zealand's Auckland||All remaining restrictions in New Zealand's largest city Auckland have been lifted after no locally transmitted cases of coronavirus were reported for two weeks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday.Ardern imposed a seven-day lockdown on the city of 1.7 million after a cluster of cases were detected domestically. The lockdown was eased earlier this month but some restrictions were retained, including limits on large public gatherings under an alert level 2 setting.Ardern said the city will now join the rest of the country in alert level 1, which has no restrictions on gatherings or activity."I know everyone in Auckland will be looking forward to a weekend with fewer restrictions," Ardern said at a news conference.Swift public health measures combined with aggressive contact tracing, border closures and compulsory quarantine for travellers have been credited with making New Zealand highly successful in keeping the pandemic from spreading.The country has had about 2,000 cases and 26 deaths linked to coronavirus so far.New Zealand started its national rollout of vaccines last month and expects to inoculate its entire population by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-covid-restrictions-lifted-from-new-zealand-s-auckland-101615509797704.html
12-03-2021||World||White House says no export prohibitions on Covid-19 vaccines||The Biden administration on Thursday ruled out that it has imposed any kind of restrictions on export of Covid-19 vaccines, amidst reports that European Union has been told by the US that they cannot expect any AstraZeneca shipments anytime soon."We don't purchase AstraZeneca supplies. So there's no export prohibitions and all vaccine manufacturers in the United States are free to export their products while also fulfilling the terms of their contracts with the US government," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference.Vaccine manufacturers in the United States are free to export their products while also fulfilling the terms of contracts with the United States. There are supplies that they are producing for the United States but they can also work with other countries, she said in response to a question.These companies can work with other countries on selling their products, she said."We have conveyed privately what we've conveyed publicly which is our focus is on ensuring the American people are receiving the vaccine and that we are vaccinating the American public," she said."That's our first priority. But we are also engaging with and working with the global community to figure out how we can get the global pandemic under control together. Whether that's through financial contributions or through you know, navigating with them how we can work together to address it. But we'll continue to evaluate as more vaccines become available in the United States. AstraZeneca isn't even approved at this point," Psaki said.She said any company can work with any country around the world on the purchase of vaccine supply. "And certainly, that wouldn't be something the US government would be directly engaged with. But in terms of the supply we have purchased our first focus, our primary focus is on vaccinating the American people. That is what we've conveyed publicly and privately as well," Psaki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-no-export-prohibitions-on-covid-19-vaccines-101615509812668.html
12-03-2021||World||US condemns Beijing's move to overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system||The United States has condemned China's national legislature approving a resolution to drastically overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system to ensure only 'patriots' can rule the city, a move which is feared to further clamp down on opposition voices in the city."We condemn the People's Republic of China (PRC's) continuing assaults on democratic institutions in Hong Kong," US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price said during a press briefing."The changes approved by the National People's Congress today, on March 11, are a direct attack on Hong Kong's autonomy, its freedom and democratic processes limiting political participation, reducing democratic representation, and stifling political debate in order to defy the clear will of people in Hong Kong and deny their voices in their own governance," he added.The National People's Congress (NPC) on Thursday passed the resolution by a near-unanimous vote, paving the way for the biggest shake-up to the city's electoral system since its return to China in 1997, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).A total of 2,895 delegates voted in favour of the proposal, which will authorise its standing committee to finalise the details of the electoral reform process and applauded for the longest period after the Hong Kong electoral proposal was passed.Under the new electoral system, NPC members and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body, will be part of the Election Committee in the selection process of the city's leader next year, reported Xinhua news agency.Less than a year after imposing the draconian National Security Law, China last week had launched a legislative process for drastic electoral system reform in Hong Kong, which could benefit the pro-establishment camp and further quash the political opposition in the city.The Election Committee will be expanded to add these 300 Beijing loyalists and the Legislative Council will also be expanded to 90 seats from 70.Although Chinese officials have insisted that the measures are necessary to establish a 'democratic electoral system with Hong Kong characteristics', critics have warned that it would limit the space for the opposition in the city and roll back years of effort to liberalise the system, reported SCMP.Ahead of the NPC's vote on the electoral measures, Britain said the proposed changes to Hong Kong's electoral system would be another attack on the former British colony's rights and freedoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-condemns-beijing-s-move-to-overhaul-hong-kong-s-electoral-system-101615508599842.html
12-03-2021||World||WHO assessing reports on risks related to AstraZeneca's vaccine against Covid-19||A spokesperson for the World Health Organization (WHO) told Sputnik that its Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) was carefully assessing the reports on risks related to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19.A number of European states have suspended vaccination with the AstraZeneca drug as a precaution after reports on severe side-effects, including blood clots, that were allegedly triggered by the vaccine, Sputnik reported.The European Medicines Agency said there was currently no indication that the reported negative effects had been caused by the vaccination."The GACVS is carefully assessing the current reports on the AstraZeneca vaccine. As soon as WHO has gained a full understanding of these events, the findings and any changes to current recommendations will be immediately communicated to the public," the spokesperson said on late Thursday as quoted by Sputnik.The WHO representative stressed that the global health body was aware of some EU countries' decisions to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine."The information available so far indicates that the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than that seen in the general population. The Committee further noted that the vaccine can continue to be administered while the investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing," the spokesperson added.The World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To date, more than 118.34 million people have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, with over 2.62 million fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-assessing-reports-on-risks-related-to-astrazeneca-s-vaccine-against-covid19-101615508282268.html

12-03-2021||World||Biden will order states to make US adults eligible for Covid-19 vaccine by May 1||President Joe Biden will announce that he is directing states to make all US adults eligible for coronavirus vaccinations by May 1 in a prime-time address on Thursday, further accelerating the government’s effort to end the pandemic.Biden will say in the speech that if the US can reach its vaccination goals, it will be possible for Americans to gather in small groups to celebrate July 4, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters ahead of the president’s remarks.They asked not to be identified on the condition of participation in the briefing.Biden has previously said the administration expects to have enough vaccine by the end of May to vaccinate all US adults, though officials have warned that actually administering shots will take more time.Biden’s address will mark the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. At about the same time, Americans began to adopt social-distancing practices that would lead to the temporary collapse of the economy, throwing millions out of work.The president said Wednesday that his speech would outline “the next phase” of the government’s response to the pandemic. In addition to setting the May 1 and July 4 vaccination goals, he will announce that his administration will begin distributing vaccines to 700 more community health centers, to reach underprivileged communities and that it will double the number of retail pharmacies receiving shots directly from the federal government, the officials said.The president’s also expected to laud his signing earlier Thursday of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. Eligible Americans can expect to begin receiving government payments of as much as $1,400 as soon as this weekend, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-will-order-states-to-make-us-adults-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine-by-may-1-101615507082858.html
12-03-2021||World||US President Joe Biden signs $1.9 trillion relief bill before speech to nation||Marking a year of loss and disruption, President Joe Biden on Thursday signed into law the $1.9 trillion relief package that he said will help the U.S. defeat the coronavirus and nurse the economy back to health.The signing came hours before Biden delivers his first prime-time address since taking office. He's aiming to steer the nation toward a hungered-for sentiment — hope — as he marks one year since the onset of the pandemic that has killed more than 529,000 Americans.“This historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country," Biden said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBiden originally planned to sign the bill on Friday, but it arrived at the White House more quickly than anticipated."We want to move as fast as possible,” tweeted White House chief of staff Ron Klain. He added, “We will hold our celebration of the signing on Friday, as planned, with congressional leaders!”Previewing his remarks, Biden said he would “talk about what we've been through as a nation this past year, but more importantly, I'm going to talk about what comes next.”Biden's challenge Thursday night will be to honor the sacrifices made by Americans over the last year while encouraging them to remain vigilant despite “virus fatigue” and growing impatience to resume normal activities given the tantalizing promise of vaccines. Speaking on the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization's declaration of a pandemic, he'll mourn the dead, but also project optimism about the future.“This is a chance for him to really beam into everybody's living rooms and to be both the mourner in chief and to explain how he's leading the country out of this,” said presidential historian and Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley.“This is a big moment,” Brinkley added. “He's got to win over hearts and minds for people to stay masked and get vaccinated, but also recognize that after the last year, the federal government hasn't forgotten you.”Biden's evening remarks in the East Room are central to a pivotal week for the president as he addresses the defining challenge of his term: shepherding the nation through the twin public health and economic storms brought about by the virus.On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released initial guidance for how vaccinated people can resume some normal activities. On Wednesday, Congress approved the president's $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan,” aimed at easing the economic impact of the virus on tens of millions of people. And the nation was on pace to administer its 100 millionth dose of vaccine as soon as Thursday.Also Read: Will share Covid-19 vaccine if it has surplus, says US President Joe BidenBiden said he would focus his remarks on what his administration plans to deliver in the coming months, but also reiterate his call for Americans to continue to practice social distancing and wear face coverings to hasten the end of the pandemic.“I'm going to launch the next phase of the COVID response and explain what we will do as a government and what we will ask of the American people,” he said.He added: “There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year. There is real reason for hope.”Almost exactly one year ago, President Donald Trump addressed the nation to mark the WHO's declaration of a global pandemic. He announced travel restrictions and called for Americans to practice good hygiene but displayed little alarm about the forthcoming catastrophe. Trump, it was later revealed, acknowledged that he had been deliberately “playing down” the threat of the virus.For Biden, who has promised to level with the American public after the alternate reality of Trump's virus talk, the imperative is to strike the correct balance “between optimism and grief,” said Princeton history professor and presidential scholar Julian Zelizer.“Generally, the country likes optimism, and at this particular moment they're desperate for optimism, but you can't risk a Mission Accomplished' moment,'” he said, warning against any premature declaration that the threat has been vanquished.Fifty days into his presidency, Biden is experiencing a polling honeymoon that his predecessor never enjoyed. Yet public sentiment remains stubbornly polarized and fewer people among his critics seem willing to say they'll give him a chance than was the case for earlier presidents. Overall, he has earned strong marks on his handling of the pandemic.According to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released last week, 70 per cent of Americans back the Democratic president's handling of the virus response, including 44 per cent of Republicans.The White House hopes that as Biden assumes the role of cheerleader for the virus relief package, the elements of the USD 1.9 trillion bill that are popular with Republicans will boost his support even further.Brinkley said Biden's decision to deliver a speech aimed directly at the nation before he makes the traditional presidential address to a joint session of Congress signals that it is as much an “introduction” of the president and his administration to the American people as a status report on his first 50 days in office.Presidential addresses to Congress “tend to be a series of soundbites,” Brinkley said. “This way, he can make his case directly.”Still, the prime-time speech is in many ways an anachronism, better suited for an era when Americans had vastly fewer television options and in which a presidential address could reframe the national conversation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-signs-1-9-trillion-relief-bill-before-speech-to-nation-101615493592860.html
12-03-2021||World||Quad nations to boost India’s vaccine output||The race between India and China to provide Covid-19 vaccines to more countries across the world has moved into high gear, with efforts to ramp up delivery of doses to developing countries expected to be a key item on the agenda of the first Quad leaders’ summit on Friday.As of Wednesday, India had shipped more than 58 million doses to 66 countries, ranging from Mongolia to Sao Tome & Principe. This includes nearly eight million doses provided as grants to small and developing countries, and 16 million doses from India’s contribution to the Covax global vaccine sharing scheme of WHO.China has donated or is donating vaccines to 69 developing countries and exporting doses to 43 more countries. Unlike India, China has no publicly available official data on vaccine supplies, though officials have said the country also plans to provide 10 million doses to Covax.When leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad – which includes India, Australia, Japan and the US – meet virtually for their maiden summit on Friday, they will discuss ways to ramp up vaccine manufacturing by India, the world’s largest producer, and measures to get doses speedily to more developing countries in Asia and Africa, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Several options are expected to be on the table – including forming a group or fund with financial support from Australia, Japan and the US to procure vaccines from Indian manufacturers for developing countries, the people said. Another option is using India as a hub for supplying vaccines procured with the Quad’s support to South and South-east Asian countries, the people said.Japan is expected to help with establishing cold storage facilities for storing vaccines before they are shipped to countries in South and South-east Asia. Discussions are still on among officials of the four countries to firm up contours of the plan and financial contributions of the Quad members before the leaders meet on Friday evening, the people added.The Quad Summit plans to announce financing agreements to back an increase in vaccine manufacturing capacity in India, an unnamed senior US administration official told Reuters. These agreements will focus on companies and institutions in India manufacturing vaccines for American drug majors Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, the official said. Novavax has a manufacturing arrangement with Pune’s Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest maker of vaccines. Johnson & Johnson has a similar arrangement with Biological E Ltd.The initiative’s aim is to reduce manufacturing backlogs, speed up vaccination and defeat Coronavirus mutations, the official said. “The idea is that the quicker you can vaccinate, the more that you can defeat some of these mutations. So this is a capacity that will come online later this year, and it will substantially increase our capacity, collectively,” he added.Indian manufacturers such as Serum Institute of India (SII), Biological E, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cadila Healthcare and Bharat Biotech have a combined capacity of billions of doses. SII, the world’s largest manufacturer, is producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as Covishield and will begin making the Novavax vaccine soon. India also plans to provide at least 200 million doses to Covax.The people said all these moves are aimed at countering China’s vaccine diplomacy, which initially couldn’t match India’s roll-out of doses since January 21 but has appeared to be catching up in recent days.“Ramping up production will help roll out more doses as assistance and also meet the commercial needs of countries across the Indo-Pacific,” one of the people cited above said.Vaccines from Chinese firms have rolled out in countries such as Pakistan, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has also supplied doses to the armies of Pakistan, Cambodia, Mongolia and the Philippines.The reluctance of China’s pharmaceutical companies to share details of their trials has raised concerns about effectiveness of the vaccines and lack of public confidence in several countries. Shots by Sinovac, Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics were approved for use in some countries without the publication of comprehensive Phase 3 clinical trial results.Human Rights Watch, in a report issued on March 4, said more than a dozen vaccines developed in China are in clinical trials, with about half of them in phase III trials or large-scale studies to assess the vaccine’s level of protection. “At the time of writing, only one Chinese vaccine has received emergency approval from what WHO identifies as a ‘stringent’ regulatory authority. None of the vaccines have received full regulatory approval or released phase 3 trial data,” the report said.In Cambodia, where Prime Minister Hun Sen has received the first shot of the made-in-India Covishield, authorities had to briefly suspend vaccinations at state-run facilities due to a clamour among people for Indian vaccines.When Cambodia’s health ministry issued a notification on March 5 asking people above the age of 60 to get inoculated, large numbers of people of all ages gathered at hospitals in Phnom Penh. “The stir caused the health ministry to suspend AstraZeneca vaccines temporarily as hospitals were overwhelmed with crowds,” the Khmer Times reported on Wednesday.Another of the people cited above said, “The people are asking for Indian-made vaccines as they don’t have much trust in China’s Sinopharm.”Though a close ally of China, Cambodia has sought one million doses from India. India has cleared a proposal to provide 100,000 doses to Cambodia while 324,000 doses of Indian-made vaccines were supplied to the country last week from the Covax facility. China donated 600,000 doses to Cambodia last month.Chinese officials have sought to play down the issue of vaccine diplomacy. “A number of vaccines are now available around the world. It is up to each country to decide which one to choose. Whether it is a Chinese vaccine or not, it is a good vaccine so long as it is safe and effective,” Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told a recent news conference.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said India’s vaccine efforts shouldn’t be seen solely in the context of competition with China.“India has a track record of mass production of critical drugs. Look at the work done by India in providing the anti-AIDS cocktail at competitive prices to African countries. India also has had a reputation as a first responder since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami,” he said.“India has financial constraints and if the other members of Quad join hands, every dollar can go that much further. If the Quad shows it cannot only deliver on security issues but also on critical issues like health care, then it will establish its credentials as a more significant player in crisis management and tackling regional and global issues,” Prakash added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-developing-nations-to-be-key-issue-at-quad-meet-101615385797322.html
