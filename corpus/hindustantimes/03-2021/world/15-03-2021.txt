We strongly condemn such barbaric acts. We strongly urge the Myanmar side to stop these kinds of crimes, punish the perpetrators and compensate Chinese factories for the losses,” the tabloid said in an article.Separately, self-ruled Taiwan has advised Taiwanese companies operating in the country to fly the island’s flag and hang signs stating they are from Taiwan to avoid being confused with China, after Chinese-financed factories were set ablaze, a Reuters report said from Taipei.Though Beijing says it doesn’t interfere in Myanmar’s internal affairs, China is viewed as being supportive of the junta that took power in Myanmar, overthrowing the government of Aung San Suu Kyi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-factories-burnt-down-in-myanmar-beijing-worried-about-its-citizens-101615829511014.html

15-03-2021||World||Germany, Italy, France hit pause on AstraZeneca amid safety fears, disrupting EU shots||Germany, France and Italy said on Monday they would hit pause on AstraZeneca Covid-19 shots after several countries reported possible serious side-effects, throwing Europe's already struggling vaccination campaign into disarray.Denmark and Norway stopped giving the shot last week after reporting isolated cases of bleeding, blood clots and a low platelet count. Iceland and Bulgaria followed suit and Ireland and the Netherlands announced suspensions on Sunday.The moves by some of Europe's largest and most populous countries will deepen concerns about the slow rollout of vaccines in the region, which has been plagued by shortages due to problems producing vaccines, including AstraZeneca's.Germany warned last week it was facing a third wave of infections, Italy is intensifying lockdowns and hospitals in the Paris region are close to being overloaded.German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that although the risk of blood clots was low, it could not be ruled out."This is a professional decision, not a political one," Spahn said adding he was following a recommendation of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Germany's vaccine regulator.France said it was suspending the vaccine's use pending an assessment by the EU medicine regulator due on Tuesday. Italy said its halt was a "precautionary and temporary measure" pending the regulator's ruling.Austria and Spain have stopped using particular batches and prosecutors in the northern Italian region of Piedmont earlier seized 393,600 doses following the death of a man hours after he was vaccinated. It was the second region to do so after Sicily, where two people had died shortly after having their shots.The World Health Organization appealed to countries not to suspend vaccinations against a disease that has caused more than 2.7 million deaths worldwide."As of today, there is no evidence that the incidents are caused by the vaccine and it is important that vaccination campaigns continue so that we can save lives and stem severe disease from the virus," WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said.Read | These countries have suspended AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine useThe United Kingdom said it had no concerns, while Poland said it thought the benefits outweighed any risks.The EMA has said that as of March 10, a total of 30 cases of blood clotting had been reported among close to 5 million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca shot in the European Economic Area, which links 30 European countries.Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said the decisions by France, Germany and others looked baffling."The data we have suggests that numbers of adverse events related to blood clots are the same (and possibly, in fact lower) in vaccinated groups compared to unvaccinated populations," he said, adding that halting a vaccination programme had consequences."This results in delays in protecting people, and the potential for increased vaccine hesitancy, as a result of people who have seen the headlines and understandably become concerned. There are no signs yet of any data that really justify these decisions.”'Unusual' symptomsAstraZeneca's shot was among the first and cheapest to be developed and launched at volume since the coronavirus was first identified in central China at the end of 2019 and is set to be the mainstay of vaccination programmes in much of the developing world.Thailand announced plans on Monday to go ahead with the Anglo-Swedish firm's shot after suspending its use on Friday but Indonesia said it would wait for the WHO to report.The WHO said its advisory panel was reviewing reports related to the shot and would release its findings as soon as possible. But it said it was unlikely to change its recommendations, issued last month, for widespread use, including in countries where the South African variant of the virus may reduce its efficacy.The EMA has also said there was no indication the events were caused by the vaccination and that the number of reported blood clots was no higher than seen in the general population.The handful of reported side-effects in Europe have upset vaccination programmes already under pressure over slow rollouts and vaccine scepticism in some countries.The Netherlands said on Monday it had seen 10 cases of possible noteworthy adverse side-effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine, hours after the government put its vaccination programme on hold following reports of potential side-effects in other countries.Denmark reported "highly unusual" symptoms in a 60-year-old citizen who died from a blood clot after receiving the vaccine, the same phrase used on Saturday by Norway about three people under the age of 50 it said were being treated in hospital."It was an unusual course of illness around the death that made the Danish Medicines Agency react," the agency said in a statement late on Sunday.One of the three health workers hospitalised in Norway after receiving the AstraZeneca shot had died, health authorities said on Monday, but there was no evidence that the vaccine was the cause.AstraZeneca said earlier it had conducted a review covering more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and the UK which had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.Investigations into potential side-effects are complicated as the history of each case and circumstances surrounding a death or illness are examined. Austrian authorities have said their review of the AstraZeneca batch will take about two weeks.Long-awaited results from AstraZeneca 30,000-person US vaccine trial are currently being reviewed by independent monitors to determine whether the shot is safe and effective, a top US official said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-italy-france-hit-pause-on-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-amid-safety-fears-101615828633765.html
15-03-2021||World||US transport secy upbeat on summer travel as vaccines rolled out||US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg gave an upbeat assessment about summer travel prospects on Monday as a growing number of Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19.Touring a UPS facility just outside Washington, Buttigieg got a first-hand look at how it is shipping Covid-19 shots, while some airlines are reporting a rise in leisure bookings as more Americans get vaccinated."I'm looking forward to summer travel. Of course, it's got to be based on conditions. We've got to make sure that we're getting folks vaccinated," Buttigieg said.Wes Wheeler, president of Global Healthcare and Life Sciences at UPS, said the courier has delivered 80 million US vaccine doses and about 110 million worldwide."We'll be at 100 million in the United States by the end of this month," Wheeler told Reuters. Between UPS and Fedex , the companies will have delivered 200 million doses in the US by the end of March, he added.Travel demand was hard hit by Covid-19 in 2020 as U.S. air travel fell 60% and the US travel sector shed millions of jobs.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that tens of millions of Americans who have been vaccinated for Covid-19 should not travel, a blow to the airline and travel industries that have been battered by the pandemic.Buttigieg said people should follow CDC recommendations, but added that he hopes for a "safe return to travel" by July 4."The process of easing restrictions, when we're ready to do that, will be a little more complicated than the process of applying them," Buttigieg said.Many Americans are not heeding the CDC advice. The Transportation Security Administration said more than 1.35 million people were screened at US airports Friday, the single busiest air travel day since March 2020.Buttigieg declined to say when US President Joe Biden's administration will release its infrastructure plans, but noted a Sept. 30 deadline to get surface transportation reauthorized.With a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package finally passed, Biden's next big spending push is on the horizon, repairing the nation's ailing bridges, roads and airports and investing billions in new projects like broadband internet.Biden may sketch the outline of the plan in a joint address to Congress this month and provide details in April, giving lawmakers several months to work on the bill before an August recess, people familiar with the White House plans said."We've got a clock on everything we're doing," Buttigieg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-transport-secy-upbeat-on-summer-travel-as-vaccines-rolled-out-101615828462604.html

She has had to go to the police herself, they have a report," Birch said. “Her life has been turned upside down.”The cheerleading team expressed sympathy for the families involved and said the team has a “very strict anti-bullying policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cheerleaders-mom-accused-of-making-deepfakes-of-rivals-101615821019711.html
15-03-2021||World||2 charged in assault of Capitol officer who died after riot||US officials have arrested and charged two men with assaulting US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick with bear spray during the Jan. 6 riot, but they do not know yet whether it caused the officer's death.George Tanios, 39, of Morgantown, West Virginia, and Julian Khater, 32, of Pennsylvania, were arrested Sunday. They were expected to appear in federal court Monday.The idea that Sicknick died after being sprayed by a chemical irritant has emerged in recent weeks as a new theory in the case.Investigators initially believed that Sicknick was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, based on statements collected early in the investigation, according to two people familiar with the case. But as they’ve collected more evidence, the theory of the case has evolved and investigators now believe Sicknick may have ingested a chemical substance — possibly bear spray — that may have contributed to his death, officials have said.Khater is the man in a video obtained by the FBI that showed him spraying Sicknick and others with bear spray, according to court papers. The act hasn’t been directly tied to Sicknick’s death.“Give me that bear (expletive), Khater said to Tanios on the video, according to court papers. Sicknick and other officers were standing guard near metal bike racks, the papers say.Khater then says, “they just (expletive) sprayed me," as he's seen holding a white can with a black top that prosecutors said ”appears to be a can of chemical spray."Sicknick died after defending the Capitol against the mob that stormed the building as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden’s electoral win over Donald Trump. It came after Trump urged supporters on the National Mall to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat.The circumstances surrounding Sicknick’s death remain unclear, and a final cause of death has not been determined. Capitol Police have said he died after he was injured “while physically engaging with protesters” and the agency’s acting chief said officials consider it a line-of-duty death.Sicknick collapsed later on and died at a hospital on Jan. 7. The Justice Department opened a federal murder investigation into his death, but prosecutors are still evaluating what specific charges could be brought in the case, the people said.The medical examiner’s report on Sicknick’s death is incomplete. Capitol Police say they were awaiting toxicology results.The FBI has already released about 250 photos of people being sought for assaulting federal law enforcement officers during the riot. Some have already been arrested, and the Justice Department said about 300 people have been charged with federal offenses related to the riot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-charged-in-assault-of-capitol-officer-who-died-after-riot-101615824255491.html

The transcript did not provide further details on how visa applications would be simplified.Travellers "should abide by China's relevant regulations on quarantine and observation after entering China," Zhao said, adding that China was willing to carry out mutual recognition of vaccination with other nations.The Chinese embassy in the Philippines said earlier on Monday China would return to pre-pandemic visa requirements for those fully vaccinated with Chinese vaccines. On Saturday China announced streamlined visa procedures for vaccinated foreigners entering Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.China has been exporting its vaccines mostly to emerging countries. This outreach prompted the United States, Australia, Japan and top global vaccine producer India to announce plans to distribute vaccines in Asia in a competition that has become known as "vaccine diplomacy".China has largely brought the coronavirus under control at home since it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. The country recorded just five new infections on Sunday, all imported cases.To stave off the risk of imported cases causing a resurgence in local infections, China restricts entry by foreign nationals to certain purposes, such as work, and those that are allowed in still have to undergo quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-eases-visa-rules-for-recipients-of-its-covid-19-vaccines-101615821666291.html

15-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Grand Princess cruise ship passengers recall deaths, confusion, quarantine||The last vacation Margrit and Lucio Gonzalez took together began with an ominous delay: a medical emergency on the cruise ship they were set to board.After a four-hour wait, the couple of 51 years got on the Grand Princess on Feb. 11, 2020, for a round-trip voyage from San Francisco to the Mexican Riviera, a decision Margrit Gonzalez came to regret.“I wish we had come back home. He would still be alive,” the 82-year-old said.Within weeks, the Grand Princess had captured the world’s attention and made the coronavirus real to millions in the United States when thousands of passengers on a subsequent trip were quarantined as the ship idled off the California coast.A year later, some of those who traveled on the Grand Princess remember the pain that followed, others the frustration of shifting directives as they were confined to their rooms. They now realize they had a front-row seat to a historic moment.Ultimately, more than 100 people who were on the ship were infected with the coronavirus. At least eight died.One was Lucio Gonzalez, an athletic 73-year-old who had worked maintaining trails in the California Parks system for 25 years. On the sunny afternoon they boarded, the Gonzalezes thought only of their high-seas adventure. But a few days after the trip ended, Lucio Gonzalez started feeling ill. Eventually, he went to the hospital.“They put him on a ventilator for three weeks and two days, and after that he died,” his widow said. “I never saw him alive again.”Hours after the Gonzalezes disembarked on Feb. 21 in San Francisco, a new group boarded for a 10-day trip to Hawaii. The Grand Princess was headed for a stopover in Ensenada, Mexico, when officials ordered it to reroute to California on March 4 after a 71-year-old Rocklin man who had been on the same trip as the Gonzalezes died of Covid-19.Worried about the virus, officials blocked the ship carrying 2,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members from anchoring at its home port of San Francisco. President Donald Trump said he didn't want the passengers to disembark on American soil “because I like the numbers being where they are,” but that he would yield to health officials' advice.On the ship, Laurie Miller, her friend Karen Schwartz Dever and their husbands shared the dinner table and talks of their Hawaii adventures with fellow travelers Steven and Michele Smith.Soon, they were ordered to quarantine in their cabins. Meals were delivered to their rooms, where they watched their ship, and at times themselves, on television newscasts.The sight of four California Air National Guard members rappelling from a helicopter to drop off test kits made the coronavirus real for Miller. Until then she had thought of it as something happening far away in Asia.Even after the ship anchored in Oakland on March 9, the ordeal was not over. Transferring passengers to military bases for quarantine took days, and they were in packed buses for hours. Once at the bases, many crowded together for meals and updates, despite the Centers for Disease Control advising people to keep 6 feet (2 meters) between them.“There was so much inconsistent information from day-to-day that it felt like we were guinea pigs,” said Miller, of San Jose.Steven and Michele Smith's plan for a 10-day break from overseeing the construction of homes in Paradise, California, decimated by wildfire in 2018, turned into a five-week event that Steven Smith said put them “in a sort of exclusive club of people in ground zero of the corona crisis.”The three couples have stayed in touch through a Facebook group, where passengers recall not just the stress they went through, but the champagne fountains, four-course meals and black-tie nights. More recently, the conversation has turned to future cruises.Miller and Schwartz Dever, who met on a cruise, have booked one for next year to the Great Lakes. The Smiths bought stock in Carnival Cruise Line after seeing talk about people itching to get back.“You can’t live your life based on something that might happen once every 100 years,” Steven Smith said. “You live your life in anticipation of good times and adventures ahead.”Schwartz Dever, like her friends, doesn’t blame Princess Cruises for how the ship outbreak was handled.“The people running the cruise were doing exactly what the government told them to do,” she said.Lucio Gonzalez’s family disagrees. They are suing Princess Cruises and owner Carnival Corp. for negligence and wrongful death — one of dozens of lawsuits by passengers and surviving relatives. Carnival declined to comment on pending litigation.Princess Cruises said in a statement that its response to the pandemic was based on “the directives of governments and public health authorities and consistent with industry standards.

They didn’t take any special precautions to protect the passengers, they didn’t warn them about the virus.

15-03-2021||World||China bristles at Quad summit, says ‘it will end up nowhere’ and get no support||China on Monday said the four-member Quad “will end up nowhere” if it does not abandon its ideological bias and cold war mentality, underscoring its opposition to the bloc. Beijing described the Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, as a clique based on an ideology which, it said, “detrimental to the international order”.The Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia, and Japan, has been revitalised following the grouping’s first and high-profile top leader-level online summit last Friday.Also Read: The rationale and future of QuadThe summit, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison, US President Joe Biden and Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, was closely monitored and critiqued by Beijing. The consensus in Beijing was that the four countries came together to counter China’s increasing influence and muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region.Also watch | Quad meet: What PM Modi, Joe Biden said on China; Australia PM's 'namaste'﻿﻿China was also riled at the US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s remarks that the four leaders discussed at the summit the challenge posed by China and that the four-member security grouping believed that the four democracies could outcompete “autocracy.”Asked to respond, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the China threat is exaggerated.“For some time, some countries have been exaggerating the so-called China threat, (or) China challenges, to drive a wedge among regional countries to sow a discord between their relations with China,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.Also Read: Quad leaders made history at summit. Expect pushback from China“What they have done is against the trend of times, which is peace, development and win-win cooperation and runs counter to the common aspirations of people in the region.”“They will gain no support and will end up nowhere,” the spokesperson said, repeating the same words later in the press conference to another question.Zhao said that state-to-state exchanges and cooperation should be conducive for improving mutual understanding and trust among the countries and should not be targeted against and undermine the interests of third parties.“Relevant countries should abandon the cold war mentality and ideological bias, do not form exclusive cliques and act in a way conducive to solidarity, unity, regional peace, and stability,” he added.Responding to a separate question on US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin saying that the US and its allies have the capabilities to deter China, Zhao said: “In the era of globalisation, it is the practice of forming cliques against specific countries based on ideology, which is detrimental to the international order”.“They will gain no support and end up nowhere,” Zhao repeated.China’s response to the Quad has gone through a diplomatic tonal shift, apparent from State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s statements.In 2018, Wang said: “They are like the seafoam in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate”.By 2020, Wang came around to acknowledging that the Quad had become a “security threat” and a so-called Indo-Pacific “New NATO”.Noting that the US’ Indo-Pacific strategy was a “big underlying security risk”, he said: “What it pursues is to trumpet the Cold War mentality and to stir up a confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-bristles-at-quad-summit-says-some-countries-exaggerate-china-threat-101615814917562.html

15-03-2021||World||These countries have suspended AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine use||Italy on Monday became the latest European country to suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) following a similar announcement from Germany and France, despite the European Union medicines regulator’s advice that its benefits still outweigh risks. Several EU members temporarily halted the use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as a precautionary measure while the health authorities investigate the reports of some patients developing blood clots after receiving the shot, including one case in Denmark where a person died.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) released a statement last Thursday, saying it was aware of Denmark’s decision to pause its vaccination campaign, but insisted there was no indication that vaccination has caused blood coagulation. “The position of EMA’s safety committee PRAC is that the vaccine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,” EMA’s statement read.Here’s the list of countries that have suspended the use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine:Denmark: The Danish authorities suspended vaccinations on March 11 for two weeks as a “precautionary measure” following the death of one person who received the shot.Norway: The Nordic country decided to pause vaccinations on March 11 following reports of death in Denmark.Iceland: Although there were no reports of patients in the country developing blood clots, the island nation chose to halt the vaccine on March 11.Bulgaria: Bulgarian government suspended inoculations using the AstraZeneca vaccine on March 12, urging EMA to send a written statement dispelling all doubts about the vaccine's safety.Ireland: On March 14, the European nation decided to temporarily suspend its use to "maintain confidence" in its vaccine program, according to the chairperson of its National Immunisation Advisory Committee.The Netherlands: The Dutch government said it would halt the use of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for two weeks “as a precautionary measure and pending further investigation.”Germany: German health ministry said that it is suspending the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine as a “precaution” and on the advice of the national vaccine regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, which called for further investigation of the cases.France: French President Emmanuel Macron said that the country will stop administering the vaccine pending an assessment by the EMA due on Tuesday. He added that the decision has been taken out of precaution in the hope that the inoculations could resume quickly if the regulator "gives the green light."Apart from these European nations, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Latvia have also suspended the use of a particular batch of their AstraZeneca vaccine supply.Read | 10 reports of possible side effects after AstraZeneca vaccine: Dutch watchdogAstraZeneca said that a “careful review” of all available data on vaccination of 17 million people in the EU and the UK has shown no evidence of “an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia”. As of March 9, at least 22 cases of thromboembolic events, marked by the formation of blood clots, has been reported among 3 million people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.“This is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines,” the British-Swedish company added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-countries-have-suspended-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-use-101615815056123.html
15-03-2021||World||Concerns rise over Sri Lanka's move to ban burqas and madrassas||A Pakistani diplomat and a UN expert have expressed concerns over Sri Lanka’s proposed move to ban the wearing of burqas.Sri Lanka announced plans over the weekend to ban the wearing of burqas — garments worn by some Muslim women that cover the body and face — and also said it would close more than 1,000 Islamic schools known as madrassas, citing national security.Pakistan's ambassador to Sri Lanka, Saad Khattak, tweeted on Monday that the ban would "only serve as injury to the feelings of ordinary Sri Lankan Muslims and Muslims across the globe.”The United Nations' special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Ahmed Shaheed, tweeted that the “burqa bans are incompatible with int’l law guarantees of the right to manifest one’s religion or belief & of freedom of expression.”On Saturday, Sri Lanka’s minister of public security, Sarath Weerasekara, called the burqa a sign of religious extremism and said it has a direct impact on national security. Weerasekara signed a paper on Friday seeking the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to ban burqas.The wearing of burqas in Sri Lanka was temporarily banned in 2019 soon after the Easter Sunday bomb attacks on churches and hotels that killed more than 260 people in the Indian Ocean island nation. Two local Muslim groups that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group have been blamed for the attacks at six locations — two Roman Catholic churches, one Protestant church and three top hotels.Sri Lanka also plans to ban more than 1,000 Madrassas, saying they are not registered with the authorities and do not follow the national education policy.The decision to ban burqas and madrassas is the latest move affecting Sri Lanka's minority Muslims.Muslims make up about 9% of the 22 million people in Sri Lanka, where Buddhists account for more than 70% of the population. Ethnic minority Tamils, who are mainly Hindus, comprise about 15% of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerns-rise-over-sri-lanka-s-move-to-ban-burqas-and-madrassas-101615814005942.html
15-03-2021||World||EU launches legal case against UK over changes to Northern Ireland trade pact||The European Union launched legal action on Monday against unilateral British changes to Northern Irish trading arrangements that Brussels says breach the Brexit divorce deal agreed with London.The bloc sent a letter of formal notice to kick-start an "infringement procedure", which could lead to fines being imposed by the EU's top court, although that could be at least a year off, leaving time for a solution to be found.Maros Sefcovic, the top EU official in charge of UK relations, has also sent a separate letter to his British counterpart, David Frost, calling for Britain to refrain from this measure, but also seeking talks on the issue.The British government earlier this month unilaterally extended a grace period until October 1 for some checks on food imports to Northern Ireland. The period initially ran until the end of March.The EU's executive European Commission promised to respond with the legal means established by the Brexit divorce deal and the trade agreement to what it said was Britain's second threat to breach international law.Britain says it has not violated the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.Last September, Britain did acknowledge its Internal Market Bill would break international law by breaching parts of the Withdrawal Agreement treaty it signed in January 2020, when it formally left the EU. However, it dropped certain contentious clauses in December, two weeks before the two sides struck a trade deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-launches-legal-case-against-uk-over-changes-to-northern-ireland-trade-rules-101615814405401.html
15-03-2021||World||Facebook to label, add Information to posts on Covid-19 vaccine||Facebook Inc., trying to counteract the spread of false information about vaccines, is planning to label posts about Covid-19 shots with a link to information from medical authorities including the World Health Organization.On Facebook-owned Instagram, which already has information labels on some posts, the wording will become clearer on messages from users seeking to discourage people from getting shots. For example, the company plans to say on some posts that “Covid-19 vaccines go through many tests for safety and effectiveness before they’re approved.”Facebook and Instagram have been used for years to spread fear about vaccines, because information with the potential to scare others and spark emotions has a better chance of getting shared and commented on, boosting it into more feeds on the platforms. The company, seeing the rise in vaccine hesitancy during the Covid-19 pandemic, has started to take stronger measures, banning repeat offenders who spend false information and directing users to a central Covid-19 information center. It announced the new labels Monday in a blog post.The strategy is similar to the one Facebook used around the U.S. presidential election, when any post trying to deny Joe Biden’s win was labeled with a link to accurate information.The company said it also wants to assist users in booking vaccine appointments directly through Facebook, Instagram and Facebook-owned WhatsApp, with a goal of helping 50 million users do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-label-add-information-to-posts-on-covid-19-vaccine-101615814186680.html
15-03-2021||World||Britain imposes fresh sanctions on 6 members of Syrian regime||Britain said Monday it was imposing new sanctions on Bashar al-Assad’s regime, including asset freezes and travel bans on the Syrian dictator’s close allies.The announcement came on the 10th anniversary of the start of the Syrian uprising. The six sanctioned individuals include Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Miqdad, presidential adviser Luna al-Shibl, and two military generals who Britain said were responsible for the violent repression of civilians by troops under their command.The Foreign Office said they also include two prominent businessmen, one of whom, Yassar Ibrahim, allegedly “acts as a front" for the “personal hold on the Syrian economy” wielded by Assad and his wife, Asma, while millions of Syrians go without food.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the Assad regime for subjecting the Syrian people “to a decade of brutality for the temerity of demanding peaceful reform.”“Today we are holding six more individuals from the regime to account for their wholesale assault on the very citizens they should be protecting,” Raab said in a statement.The sanctions were the first against the Syrian leadership under Britain’s new autonomous sanctions regime after Brexit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-imposes-fresh-sanctions-on-6-members-of-syrian-regime-101615813273248.html
15-03-2021||World||Suspension of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine could delay Europe's vaccination goal||The suspended rollout of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine in some European Union countries over concerns about possible side effects could delay a goal of immunizing three-quarters of their populations against the resurgent coronavirus by as much as a month.Limiting the use of the AstraZeneca shot as a precautionary measure could push back efforts to hit that threshold by at least a couple of weeks and potentially longer -- to September instead of August -- according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.While the European Union is relying heavily on the AstraZeneca-University of Oxford inoculation, it has a number of weapons at its disposal in the race to escape the pandemic. Those include vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE, as well as Moderna Inc. The bloc last week cleared Johnson & Johnson’s shot, too, though it’s not yet available for use.The bloc will need all of those supplies as it seeks to make up for a sluggish start to its immunization campaign. Beginning in the second quarter of the year, other shots are expected to take on more of the burden from the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, which have accounted for most of the injections given so far.Now the suspensions, along with continued production delays for the AstraZeneca vaccine, threaten to slow the pace of immunizations further, at least in the short term. Meanwhile, infections are rising again in a number of EU countries, including Italy and France, and some face renewed restrictions.Europe is still on track to meet vaccine supply targets as increased output from Pfizer offset any shortages in AstraZeneca shots, EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton said on Europe 1 radio over the weekend.At the current average rate of 1.26 million doses per day, it would take 16 months for the European Union to cover 75% of its population with two-dose vaccines, compared with five months for the U.S. and seven months for the U.K., according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. Airfinity’s estimates assume that the daily rate of shots will increase as supplies grow, speeding up progress toward that key threshold.The Netherlands joined about a dozen places, including northern Italy and Ireland, in deciding to suspend AstraZeneca’s shot amid reports of serious blood clotting. But regulators from Europe to Asia said there was no indication of any direct link with the vaccine.AstraZeneca said more than 17 million doses had been administered in Europe and the UK, with no evidence that the shot increased the risk of blood clots. As of March 8, there had been 15 reports of clots in the legs, called deep vein thrombosis, and 22 cases where they reached the lungs, known as pulmonary embolism. The company said it is continually monitoring safety.Denmark’s medicines regulator said Monday that a 60-year-old woman who died after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine suffered from an “unusual” combination of symptoms that are now being thoroughly investigated by the European Medicines Agency and other authorities.Supply woes and questions about the initial trials that extend to the shot’s efficacy against novel variants have hit the AstraZeneca vaccine. Even as some countries suspend its use, others like the US are moving to protect their own stockpiles, blocking efforts to redistribute the shot’s supply to places with urgent needs.There are a number of factors that could affect the pace of the immunization campaign in Europe and elsewhere over the coming months. But if doubts grow and people are slow to get vaccinated across the continent, the European timelines could be pushed back even further, according to Airfinity.The EMA is scheduled to evaluate data on the AstraZeneca shot on Thursday, Marco Cavaleri, chair of the regulator’s vaccine evaluation team, told Italy’s Radio24.The regulator sees “no reason to stop using” the injection, he said. “Still, we understand the position of member states which, as a precautionary measure, prefer to wait until we complete our investigations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspension-of-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-could-delay-europe-s-vaccination-goal-101615811322573.html
15-03-2021||World||UK accused of racism over treatment of 'IS bride' Shamima Begum||A lawyer for the family of Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her citizenship after joining the Islamic State group, on Monday accused Britain of racism over her treatment, calling her a "tragic scapegoat".Begum was just 15 when she and two other schoolgirls from east London travelled to Syria to join the jihadists, and was later tracked down in a refugee camp.She had her citizenship revoked in 2019 on national security grounds, after an outcry led by right-wing newspapers.But the UK's highest court last month ruled she could not return to Britain to appeal the decision.Begum's family lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, and the sculptor Anish Kapoor said she was "the tragic scapegoat of a punitive unforgiving government intent on harsh retribution"."What happened to Christian forgiveness? Does it not apply to a woman -- and a dark-skinned one at that? It seems that different rules apply," they said in a joint statement."Is it perhaps that some of us are more British than others of us? Shamima is of Bangladeshi descent, does that change her right to British nationality?"I am tempted to think it does especially in the light of the Supreme Court's judgment."Kapoor, best known for his conceptual art installations, and Akunjee called the government's stance "a disgraceful indictment of our national conscience".They suggested "four young white schoolgirls" from a less ethnically diverse area outside London would "no doubt" be treated differently."This is 'divide and rule', the horror that sustained the British Empire for 200 years. Have we regressed to now practising this on home turf?" they asked.Begum married a Dutch IS fighter shortly after crossing into the militant group's territory from Turkey. She had three children, but they all died.The Sunday Telegraph last weekend published pictures of Begum wearing Western clothing -- sunglasses, a T-shirt and a zip-up sweater -- at the Al Roj camp where she has been for the last two years.She has previously been seen in a black niqab mandated by IS.She agreed to being photographed, but she and others who came from Britain detained in the camp declined to be interviewed on the basis of legal advice, the weekly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-accused-of-racism-over-treatment-of-is-bride-shamima-begum-101615809954115.html
15-03-2021||World||Trump’s December call recording located in trash folder of Georgia investigator's device: Report||A recently released call recording of former US president Donald Trump to Georgia’s chief elections investigator was found in the trash folder of the official’s device, according to CNN. Last week, the Georgia secretary of state’s office, while responding to a public records request, released a six-minute-long audio recording from December 23 in which Trump was heard encouraging the lead elections investigator, Frances Watson, to uncover “dishonesty” in her probe.“The people of Georgia are so angry at what happened to me. They know I won, won by hundreds of thousands of votes. It wasn’t close,” Trump told Watson, according to the call recording. “When the right answer comes out, you’ll be praised.” he said, later telling the investigator that she had the “most important job” in the country at that time. “Whatever you can do, Frances, it would be - it’s a great thing. It’s an important thing for the country. So important. You’ve no idea. So important. And I very much appreciate it,” Trump added.The Washington Post had first reported on the substance of the call in January, detailing how the then-president pressured Watson to help him overturn the results of the presidential election. Georgia officials had earlier said that they didn’t believe a recording of the call existed. The Washington Post and CNN, citing people familiar with the matter, have now reported that the recording was located on a trash folder on Watson’s device while the officials were responding to a public records request.Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis had sent letters to state officials last month, asking them to preserve all relevant documents related to alleged election interference. The call recording could form a part of Willis’ investigation. While it is not clear why Watson moved the recording to the trash folder, the investigator told a WSB-TV reporter that she didn’t perceive any pressure from the phone call.Georgia officials are also investigating Trump for his attempts to overturn state election results, particularly his phone call to secretary of state Brad Raffensperger. Trump was caught on tape pressurising Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn President Joe Biden’s win. During the phone call, Trump repeatedly argued that the state official could change the certified results.“All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” said Trump. “Because we won the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-call-recording-located-in-trash-folder-of-georgia-investigator-s-device-101615806147294.html
15-03-2021||World||Where climate scientists see danger, Russia sees an opportunity||Russia, the world’s fourth-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, is bearing witness to one of the most obvious effects of climate change: rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic. The region is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, altering weather patterns as far south as Texas. Home to more than a fifth of the planet’s forests, Russia has suffered two consecutive years of record-breaking wildfires that released emissions equivalent to those of a mid-sized country such as Spain. Permafrost, the frozen ground that covers about half of Russian land, is thawing fast, damaging infrastructure, houses and industrial installations at a cost of up to $2.3 billion a year. The Siberian tundra stores an estimated 1,700 gigatons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, twice the amount currently in the atmosphere. Much of it could be released as the ground unfreezes.But Russia is also home to the world’s largest reserves of liquified natural gas, and melting ice in the Arctic means it can ship more of its most valuable export to other countries. It could also potentially increase oil production. Warnings from climate experts that both activities could accelerate global warming haven’t deterred Russia’s leaders. “Moving north and east is a job Russia has been doing for four and a half centuries —we know weather and nature are challenging up there” Aleksey Chekunkov, Russia’s minister in charge of developing the Arctic, said in an interview. “We will be living, working and developing our north in all scenarios.”LNG burns cleaner than coal or oil, though it still releases emissions. Russia is betting that demand will rise over the coming decades as more countries move to replace coal in order to lower their carbon footprints. The Northern Sea Route, which links northern Europe and Russia to China through the Arctic seas, used to be blocked by ice most of the year, with navigation only possible in summer months, from June to October. This year, record-low sea ice and an increasingly powerful Russian fleet of icebreakers meant the season was the longest ever, from May to February. “We believe navigation can be made year-round and we’re not waiting until it happens climate-wise,” Chekunkov said. “We’re building the most powerful fleet of nuclear icebreakers in the world.” All-year navigation could be a reality by mid-century, he said.By then, the world will be a much different place if humans haven’t drastically cut emissions. Much of the Earth’s ice will have melted, sea levels will have risen, and coral reefs and forests will have shrunk significantly. The planet will be hotter and more humid, leading to more extreme weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires. Moscow is aware of the dangers. Chekunkov’s ministry has a team of 68 scientists and developed a digital model of the Arctic economy and ecology with about 10,000 different parameters, 800 of which can be tweaked to simulate different scenarios.Yet the country is not doing enough to slow global warming. Russia’s climate plan is rated “critically insufficient” by the nonprofit Climate Action Tracker. If all countries followed its approach, global temperature rise from pre-industrial times would exceed 4ºC by the end of the century—the worst-case scenario outlined by scientists. “We need to be realistic about the size of the country,” Chekunkov said. “Building a grid for a land that has on average one person per square kilometer is not always economic.' Solar power is not an option for Arctic regions where the sun doesn’t shine for more than half of the year, and where wind energy is not constant. “Unless we see a major breakthrough in the technology of batteries and on moving power from one place to another, I believe LNG is the best possible solution,” he said. In the meantime, Russia will do its best to profit from the opportunities unveiled by the melting ice, even as it struggles to deal with the impacts of climate change in its own territory.“The Arctic is warming faster than the continent—this has a very negative potential, but also a very positive one,” said Chekunkov.Laura Millan writes the Climate Report newsletter about the impact of global warming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-climate-scientists-see-danger-russia-sees-an-opportunity-101615807274336.html
15-03-2021||World||Germany’s future could hinge on Greens after successes in states||Germany’s Green party is positioning itself to be the kingmaker after September’s national election with its hand strengthened by a strong showing in Sunday’s state votes.The Greens cemented their decade-long hold on Baden-Wuerttemberg with a third straight victory in the industrial southwest and also saw the biggest gains in neighboring Rhineland-Palatinate. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, by contrast, suffered its worst ever results in both states.A national alliance between the CDU and the Greens remains the most likely outcome of September’s vote, but Greens co-leader Annalena Baerbock is playing up the chances of an alternative coalition as well. If there’s a realistic chance that Merkel’s CDU-led bloc could be left out for the first time in 16 years, that will give the Greens more leverage when it comes to negotiating a program for governing.“There are now many different parties that can be in government,” Baerbock said at a press conference on Monday in Berlin. “What is possible in the heartland of Germany’s industry can also be possible at a federal level.”Sunday’s results are a sign of the long-term challenges facing Merkel’s party once the chancellor steps aside after the federal election. Both regions used to be strongholds for the CDU but support for the party has been slipping for decades and frustration over the government’s handling of the pandemic and the slow pace of vaccinations has deepened its problems.In Baden-Wuerttemberg, the Greens -- led by popular state premier Winfried Kretschmann -- won 32.6%, a gain of 2.3 points, according to official preliminary results. The CDU’s support slumped by 2.9 points compared with the last election in 2016 to 24.1%.The two parties are in coalition there, but the results could prompt the Greens to explore other alternatives potentially setting a precedent for what could happen after September’s national vote.The CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, lead the Greens by about 12 percentage points in national polls but those numbers mask a number of uncertainties as the parties look toward the campaign.The CDU is yet to decide on its candidate for chancellor and it’s longtime coalition partner, the Social Democrats, has seen its support slump and has indicated it won’t support another CDU-led administration. That leaves the Greens as the CDU’s most likely partner, but the Greens could have other options for forming a majority if the declines suffered by the CDU in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate were replicated on a national level.The SPD would consider working as a junior partner in a government with the Greens, the Social Democrats Co-Leader Saskia Esken said Monday on ARD television.“We don’t rule anything out, this is not what this is about,” she said, adding that Merkel’s junior coalition partner is still hopeful of claiming the chancellery itself despite its trailing poll numbers. “A good victory means that we will be able to take the formation of a government into our own hands.”The SPD is the only major party to name a chancellor candidate. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz was out of the gates early in order to help the party make up lost ground after years suffering in Merkel’s shadow.In Rhineland-Palatinate, The Social Democrats got 35.7% of the vote, defending its position as the state’s strongest party despite losing 0.5 points. The Greens climbed 4 points to 9.3%, with the CDU shedding 4.1 points to 27.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-future-could-hinge-on-greens-after-successes-in-states-101615806502801.html

Hossein Salami as saying that cruise and ballistic missiles will empower the force's navy even more. The TV report showed footage of scores of missiles in an enclosed space resembling an underground corridor. It did not say where the facility is located nor how many missiles are stored there.Since 2011, Iran has boasted of underground facilities across the country as well as along the southern coast near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Iran claims to have missiles that can travel 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), placing much of the Middle East, including Israel, within range.The US and its Western allies see Iran’s missile program as a threat, along with the country’s nuclear program — particularly after Tehran gradually breached its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, following the Trump administration's withdrawal from the deal in 2018.Last July, the Guard launched underground ballistic missiles as part of an exercise involving a mock-up American aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz, highlighting its network of subterranean missile sites.Since Iran's bloody 1980s war with Iraq, which saw both nations fire missiles on cities, Iran has developed its ballistic missile program as a deterrent, especially as a UN arms embargo prevents it from buying high-tech weapons systems. The underground tunnels help protect those weapons, including liquid-fueled missiles that can only be fueled for short periods of time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-inaugurates-new-underground-missile-facility-report-101615806912651.html

A possible contender to succeed her said Monday that the center-right needs to raise its game to keep the country's top job.Final results showed that Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union was handily defeated in Sunday’s elections by two popular incumbent state governors: the Green party’s Winfried Kretschmann in Baden-Wuerttemberg and the center-left Social Democrats’ Malu Dreyer in Rhineland-Palatinate.While the CDU always faced an uphill battle against the pair, the results were painful. It lost the two states — both of which were once strongholds, but have long since slipped from its grasp — by about eight percentage points. It won 24.1% of the vote in Baden-Wuerttemberg and 27.7% in Rhineland-Palatinate, its worst post-World War II showing in both states.Merkel’s federal government faces discontent over a slow start to Germany’s coronavirus vaccination drive, while most restrictions remain in place and infections are rising again. And her center-right bloc has been hit over the past two weeks by allegations that a few lawmakers profited from deals to procure masks early in the coronavirus pandemic.In both states that voted Sunday, the results make three-way coalitions between the Greens, Social Democrats and pro-business Free Democrats possible — highlighting the possibility, though it has seemed a long shot so far, of such an alliance at national level.So far, the Union bloc of Merkel's CDU and Bavaria's Christian Social Union leads polls by a distance from the Greens and Social Democrats, despite softening support. But it can't count on a popular incumbent in the Sept. 26 election for the new German parliament, since Merkel isn't seeking a fifth term after nearly 16 years in power.CSU leader Markus Soeder, the governor of Bavaria and one of two serious contenders to be the center-right candidate to replace Merkel, described the results as a “wake-up call.”“One thing is clear since yesterday evening: theoretically, there are majorities beyond the Union,” Soeder said. “So the belief or hope that 1 or 2% more or less doesn't matter, that the Union will have the chancellor in any case, is no longer 100% certain since yesterday evening.”“That means we won't be able to get through the federal election in September in the sleeping car,” he added. “We need a clear direction, a clear strategy.”He called for vaccinations to be speeded up and for the center-right “to line ourselves up more broadly than just with corona.”Sunday’s results aren’t helpful for new CDU leader Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, who was elected in January. He has said that he and Soeder, who hasn't officially declared his ambitions, plan to make a decision in April or May on who will seek the chancellorship.The state elections gave the environmentalist and traditionally left-leaning Greens new confidence for the national election campaign, in which they are expected to make their first bid for the chancellery. Co-leader Annalena Baerbock said a decision on the candidate will be made “in the coming weeks.”The Greens' general secretary, Michael Kellner, noted that this is the first time since West Germany's first election in 1949 that there is no incumbent seeking re-election. “The race is open and that gives us a huge opportunity,” he told ARD television.The elections gave some comfort to the Social Democrats, who have been struggling with dismal federal poll ratings.The Social Democrats’ candidate for chancellor, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, said the results showed that “forming a government is possible without the CDU.”One party that didn’t benefit from discontent was the far-right Alternative for Germany, which has opposed coronavirus restrictions and is in a court standoff with the domestic intelligence agency over whether it can be put under observation as a “suspected case” of right-wing extremism.The party lost about a third of its support compared with strong showings in 2016, taking 9.7% of the vote in Baden-Wuerttemberg and 8.3% in Rhineland-Palatinate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-chancellor-merkel-s-party-faces-election-wake-up-call-101615805462759.html
15-03-2021||World||Money, talent flowing into mRNA research after Covid-19 success||The success of Covid-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) is smoothing the way for using the novel technology not only in other vaccines, but possibly as treatments for cystic fibrosis, cancer and other hard-to-treat diseases.Scientists say mRNA has the potential to target diseases that cannot be reached by conventional drugs.US emergency authorisation of the vaccines - one from Moderna Inc and another from partners Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE – and their gene-based manufacturing processes has shown that the Food and Drug Administration is open to broader use of the previously unproven technology, according to interviews with eight top experts in the field of mRNA.Billions of dollars in capital have flowed into mRNA-focused companies based on these raised expectations – hundreds of millions in the last few months alone. And with FDA acceptance, the field is attracting top scientific talent, experts said."There is more attention and focus on mRNA now that it has proven to be a technology that works," said Glenn Hunzinger, U.S. pharmaceutical and life sciences leader at consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.Regulatory authorization of the vaccines "accelerates the process" for other mRNA therapies, providing real-world evidence that it is possible to secure fragile mRNA components during manufacturing and distribution, said Josh Kellar, co-lead of Boston Consulting Group's Covid-19 team.The technology is often likened to the operating system on a computer, allowing drugmakers to alter their target by inserting new genetic code into a manufactured form of mRNA, a natural chemical messenger that instructs the body to produce specific proteins.Its advantage in vaccines is versatility and speed compared to standard technology requiring long lead times to produce and purify proteins and create a vaccine.Treatments Reach Human TestingIn 2020, given the urgent need created by the coronavirus pandemic, more than $5.2 billion was invested in companies engaged in developing mRNA vaccines and therapeutics - up from $596 million in 2019, according to India-based research firm Roots Analysis.In just the last three months, mRNA company CureVac NV raised $518 million, Arcturus Therapeutics Holding raised $150 million and Gilead Sciences Inc agreed to a therapeutic HIV vaccine deal worth up to $785 million to mRNA company Gritstone Oncology.Over 150 mRNA vaccines and therapeutics are in development globally, Roots Analysis said. Most are still in early animal testing, but more than 30 have reached human testing.mRNA can be very difficult to work with, making future successes with treatments uncertain.Instructions from mRNA are fleeting and non-specific about where in the body it goes, which works well when directing cells to make a harmless fragment of the coronavirus to trigger an immune response. It is more difficult to send those orders to a specific tissue, like the lungs or heart muscle, which requires different delivery methods or encapsulation to protect the fragile mRNA molecule. Most of last year's funding went to Covid-19 projects but enabled companies to also push forward with other disease categories.Moderna, for instance, is working on treatments for heart disease, cancer, and rare diseases. Its most advanced non-Covid program is a vaccine for cytomegalovirus, the leading cause of birth defects in the United States.Translate Bio Inc may be the first to market with an mRNA treatment if its inhaled drug for cystic fibrosis is shown to succeed at delivering instructions to make a protein known as CFTR to the lungs, according to Chief Executive Ron Renaud.The company expects to have interim results from a mid-stage trial in the second quarter of this year. If safety and efficacy results are encouraging, it would conduct a larger trial and then potentially apply for US approval.People with cystic fibrosis, a life-shortening lung disease, have mutations in the CFTR gene that cause the protein to malfunction or not be made at all, leading to a buildup of thick mucus, which causes lung infections and other serious health complications."Most drugs treat the downstream effects of disease ... mRNA is in the business of replacing what's missing," said Joe Payne, CEO of Arcturus, which is working to develop mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 and influenza, as well as medicines for liver disease and cystic fibrosis.Dr. Drew Weissman, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, is one of the two scientists credited with a groundbreaking 2005 discovery of how to alter the molecular structure of mRNA to keep it stable enough to get past the body's defences.In the past nine months, Weissman said 20 companies working in the field of mRNA have asked him to join their boards of directors, and the number of labs asking to collaborate with Penn on mRNA work has nearly tripled.As fields like cell therapy start to mature, scientists angling for cutting-edge jobs are reaching out to mRNA companies, said Jacob Becraft, CEO at Strand Therapeutics, which is working on technology to control the activity of mRNA therapies."A lot of those people are inbounding to my inbox," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/money-talent-flowing-into-mrna-research-after-covid-19-success-101615804715900.html
15-03-2021||World||Joe Biden eyes first major tax hike since 1993 in next economic plan||President Joe Biden is planning the first major federal tax hike since 1993 to help pay for the long-term economic program designed as a follow-up to his pandemic-relief bill, according to people familiar with the matter.Unlike the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, the next initiative, which is expected to be even bigger, won’t rely just on government debt as a funding source. While it’s been increasingly clear that tax hikes will be a component -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said at least part of the next bill will have to be paid for, and pointed to higher rates -- key advisers are now making preparations for a package of measures that could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners.With each tax break and credit having its own lobbying constituency to back it, tinkering with rates is fraught with political risk. That helps explain why the tax hikes in Bill Clinton’s signature 1993 overhaul stand out from the modest modifications done since.For the Biden administration, the planned changes are an opportunity not just to fund key initiatives like infrastructure, climate and expanded help for poorer Americans, but also to address what Democrats argue are inequities in the tax system itself. The plan will test both Biden’s capacity to woo Republicans and Democrats’ ability to remain unified.“His whole outlook has always been that Americans believe tax policy needs to be fair, and he has viewed all of his policy options through that lens,” said Sarah Bianchi, head of US public policy at Evercore ISI and a former economic aide to Biden. “That is why the focus is on addressing the unequal treatment between work and wealth.”While the White House has rejected an outright wealth tax, as proposed by progressive Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, the administration’s current thinking does target the wealthy.The White House is expected to propose a suite of tax increases, mostly mirroring Biden’s 2020 campaign proposals, according to four people familiar with the discussions.The tax hikes included in any broader infrastructure and jobs package are likely to include repealing portions of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law that benefit corporations and wealthy individuals, as well as making other changes to make the tax code more progressive, said the people familiar with the plan.The following are among proposals currently planned or under consideration, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private:An independent analysis of the Biden campaign tax plan done by the Tax Policy Center estimated it would raise $2.1 trillion over a decade, though the administration’s plan is likely to be smaller. Bianchi earlier this month wrote that congressional Democrats might agree to $500 billion.The overall program has yet to be unveiled, with analysts penciling in $2 trillion to $4 trillion. No date has yet been set for an announcement, though the White House said the plan would follow the signing of the Covid-19 relief bill.An outstanding question for Democrats is which parts of the package need to be funded, amid debate over whether infrastructure ultimately pays for itself -- especially given current borrowing costs, which remain historically low. Efforts to make the expanded child tax credit in the pandemic-aid bill permanent -- something with a price tag estimated at more than $1 trillion over a decade -- could be harder to sell if pitched as entirely debt-financed.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...“The next major legislative initiative, infrastructure investment, could provide the sort of durable economic gains that not only support higher pay, but promote diffusion of those gains across demographic lines and political persuasions.”--Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger, U.S. economistsDemocrats would need at least 10 Republicans to back the bill to move it under regular Senate rules. But GOP members are signaling they are prepared to fight.“We’ll have a big robust discussion about the appropriateness of a big tax increase,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said last month, predicting Democrats would pursue a reconciliation bill that forgoes the GOP and would aim for a corporate tax even higher than 28%.Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways & Means Committee, said, “There seems to a be a real drive to tax investment of capital gains at marginal income rates,” and called that a “terrible economic mistake.”While about 18% of the George W. Bush administration’s tax cuts were allowed to expire in a 2013 deal, and other legislation has seen some increases in levies, 1993 marks the last comprehensive set of increases, experts say. That bill passed on a two-vote margin in the House and required the vice president to break a tie in the Senate.“I don’t think it is an understatement to say the current partisan environment is more severe than 1993” said Ken Kies, managing director of the Federal Policy Group, a former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “So you can draw your own conclusions” about prospects for a deal this year, he said.Still, there could be some tax initiatives Republicans could get behind. One is a shift from a gasoline tax to a vehicle-miles-traveled fee to help fund highway projects.Another is more money for Internal Revenue Service enforcement -- a way to boost revenue without raising rates. Estimates have found that for every additional $1 spent on IRS audits, the agency brings in an additional $3 to $5.Democrats are also looking to revise tax laws that they say don’t do enough to stop U.S. companies from shifting jobs and profits offshore as another way to raise revenue, one aide said. Republicans could potentially support incentives, though it’s unclear whether they’d back penalties.White House officials including deputy director of the National Economic Council, David Kamin -- who wrote a 2019 paper on “Taxing the Rich” -- are in the process of fleshing out the Biden tax plans.As for timing, if passed, tax measures would likely take effect in 2022 -- though some lawmakers and Biden supporters outside the administration have argued for holding off while unemployment remains high due to the pandemic.Lawmakers have their own ideas for tax reforms. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden wants to consolidate energy tax breaks and require investors to pay taxes regularly on their investments including stocks and bonds that have unrealized gains.“A nurse pays taxes with every single paycheck. A billionaire in an affluent suburb on the other hand can defer paying taxes month after month to the point where their paying taxes is pretty much optional,” Wyden told Bloomberg in an interview. “I don’t think that’s right.”Warren has pitched a wealth tax, while House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters has said she would like to consider a financial-transaction tax.Democratic strategists see the next package as effectively the last chance to reshape the U.S. economy on a grand scale before lawmakers turn to the 2022 mid-term campaign.“Normally, the party in power gets one or two shots to do major legislative packages,” said Chuck Marr, senior director of Federal Tax Policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “This is the next shot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-eyes-first-major-tax-hike-since-1993-in-next-economic-plan-101615805202739.html
15-03-2021||World||Better Covid vaccines are coming, WHO’s chief scientist says||New Covid-19 vaccines, including ones that don’t require needles and can be stored at room temperature, may be ready for use later this year or next year, the World Health Organization’s top scientist said.Six-to-eight new immunizations may complete clinical studies and undergo regulatory review by the end of the year, Soumya Swaminathan, the Geneva-based agency’s chief scientist, said in an interview Saturday.New vaccines will add to the 10 already shown to work within a year of Covid-19 being declared a pandemic. The world needs more immunizations, especially as the virus’s continuous circulation spawns dangerous new variants and drugmakers struggle to meet orders. Only 122 countries have started immunizing people, according to data collected by Bloomberg.“We’re thrilled with the vaccines that we have,” said Swaminathan, an Indian pediatrician best known for her research on tuberculosis and HIV. But “we can improve further,” she said. “I think, well into 2022, we’re going to see the emergence of improved vaccines.”The current crop of experimental vaccines use alternative technologies and delivery systems, and include more single-shot inoculations, and vaccines that are administered orally, via a nasal spray, and through the skin using a type of patch. These could bring immunizations that are better suited to specific groups, such as pregnant women, according to Swaminathan.More than 80 candidate vaccines are being studied in people, though some are still in the early stages of testing and may not be successful. Companies with Covid-19 vaccines already in use have also begun testing updated version designed to thwart variants of the coronavirus that have emerged in recent months.Booster Shots“We need to continue to support the research and development of more vaccine candidates, especially as the need for ongoing booster immunization of populations is still not very clear at this point,” Swaminathan said. “So we need to be prepared for that in the future.”The WHO’s strategic advisory group of experts on immunization is reviewing whether people who have been infected with Covid-19 need to have two doses of vaccine. Some research indicates that a natural infection works to prime the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, much as a first dose would, making a second injection unnecessary.Giving only one dose of vaccine to Covid-19 survivors could free up more supplies, Swaminathan said, though it could present “practical and logistical challenges in many countries” if blood tests are needed to measure patients’ antibody levels before deciding if a second jab is warranted.The roll out of safe and effective vaccines is also raising questions about how to efficiently and ethically conduct clinical trials of experimental vaccines, she said. Placebos will be replaced with a “gold standard” vaccine in a so-called non-inferiority design when it’s no longer ethical to use a placebo, Swaminathan said.Global TrialOne approach the WHO is exploring is to compare three or four candidate vaccines simultaneously with a placebo. A similar study design was used to test the efficacy of drug therapies for Covid-19, and would mean trial participants would have an 80% chance of receiving an experimental vaccine and only a 20% chance of getting placebo.“We are in discussions now with several companies with vaccines in development to see if we could launch something like this on a global trial platform,” Swaminathan said, adding that she’s optimistic such a study may begin in the first half of 2021.A global trial involving a wide pool of people and countries offers several advantages, she said. Testing vaccines in diverse ethnicities, age groups, and people with different medical conditions makes the results more generalizable, and when the epidemic wanes in some parts of the world it’s often still active in others, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/better-covid-vaccines-are-coming-who-s-chief-scientist-says-101615804709068.html
15-03-2021||World||South Korean province orders Covid testing for foreign workers||South Korea's most populous province has ordered all of its foreign workers to be tested for Covid-19 by March 22, sparking complaints of long lines and logistical problems, as well as of implicit xenophobia in government messaging.Last week, Gyeonggi province issued a sweeping administrative order mandating all international workers be tested after at least 275 foreigners tested positive, many in outbreaks at manufacturing plants.The province says the order covers roughly 85,000 registered foreigners as well as an unknown number of potential undocumented workers, while those who don't comply could face fines of up to 3 million won ($2,640).Social media lit up with complaints from foreign residents: poor communication by the government, hours-long waits at testing centres where it was difficult to maintain distancing, and other challenges.At one centre in the city of Ansan on Monday, hundreds of people were lined up in a queue that stretched for around 100 metres."I agree that everyone should get tested for Covid, but it is so exhausting to wait for hours," Jin Dianshun, a 65-year-old restaurant worker from China who said she had been standing in line for four hours, after already having stood in line for hours on Saturday before being turned away."I am sure Koreans would have protested if this was done the same way for them."One health worker at the site, who asked not to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media, said the temporary centre usually handled about 100 people per day, but surged to an average of 1,400 people after the order."The problem is that already by 7am there can be more than 2,000 people waiting in line," the worker said.As of Sunday, 120,310 foreigners had been tested, with 120 testing positive, a provincial official told Reuters.Derval Mambou, a car parts maker from Cameroon, said he welcomed the testing regime."They want people living here in Korea to be safe from the coronavirus, even foreigners," he said as he stood in line.Some people took the order itself as an invasion of human rights, however."I’ve lived in Korea for years, pay a mortgage, run a business, have a family, pay tax," John, a graphic designer from the United Kingdom who owns his own business and has lived in South Korea for 10 years, told Reuters by online messenger, asking to be identified only by his first name. "Yet they are treating us like we are the problem because of coronavirus. Feels xenophobic and racist."Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) Director Jeong Eun-kyeong said on Monday that the rate of infections among foreign workers was a high-risk situation."We don't think this is to discriminate or stigmatise foreign workers, and it shouldn't be accepted that way," she said.Jeong said the KDCA would work with local governments to improve testing capabilities to resolve the long waits.One American university professor who has worked in South Korea for 15 years said it made no sense to test people like her - who have been teaching online for almost a year and rarely go out - rather than fixing the workplace safety at factories that had outbreaks."There is no reasoning behind forcing foreign workers to take this test," she said in an email.In Ansan, some locals denied that there was any racial animosity, but admitted they were reassured by the campaign."Since there are a lot of foreigners here, every time a foreigner comes in, it would worry me," said Hwang Mi-sun, a clothes shop owner. "Now that they are filtering out everyone, it gives me a sense of assurance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-province-orders-covid-testing-for-foreign-workers-101615803739275.html

South Korea authorised the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for that age group last week.More than 95% of the nearly 590,000 who were inoculated as of midnight on Sunday have received the AstraZeneca vaccine and the remainder the Pfizer vaccine, KDCA data showed.The government has secured enough supplies to cover 79 million people. It has procured COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Novavax, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and the COVAX global distribution scheme.The KDCA reported 382 new cases as of Sunday, raising the total caseload to 96,017, with 1,675 deaths.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-expand-covid-19-vaccination-to-quarter-of-population-by-june-101615795586315.html

So there is a bigger chance of success," Zee said.His method uses a high-resolution camera with new computer software which analyses a combination of factors including fibre layers and blood vessels in the eye.The technology can be used to identify children at risk of autism and get them into treatment programmes sooner, said Zee.Seventy children were tested using the technology, 46 with autism and a control group of 24. The technology was able to identify the children with autism 95.7 percent of the time. The average age tested was 13, with the youngest being six.Zee's findings have been published in EClinicalMedicine, a peer-reviewed medical journal.Autism specialists welcomed his findings but said there remained a huge stigma, with parents often reluctant to believe their children have autism even when there are clear signs."Many times, parents will initially be in denial," said Dr Caleb Knight, who runs a private autism therapy centre."If you had a medical test or biological marker like this, it might facilitate parents not going into denial for longer periods and therefore the child would get treatment more quickly."Children with autism have to wait around 80 weeks to see a specialist in the public medical sector, according to an emailed statement from Hong Kong's government.Zee told Reuters that his research is intended to be a supplemental tool to a professional assessment by licensed healthcare professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-scientist-develops-retinal-scan-technology-for-early-childhood-autism-101615772309396.html

Traffic was snarled and more than 400 flights out of the capital's two main airports were canceled amid high winds and low visibility.The National Meteorological Center said Monday's storm had developed in the Gobi Desert in the Inner Mongolia Region, where schools had been advised to close and bus service added to reduce residents' exposure to the harsh conditions.Such storms used to occur regularly in the springtime as sand from western deserts blew eastwards, affecting areas as far as northern Japan.Massive planting of trees and bushes in fragile areas has reduced the effects on other parts of the country in recent years, but the expansion of cities and industries, along with strip mining and overgrazing, has put constant pressure on the environment throughout China. With its mix of desert and grassy steppe, Inner Mongolia is particularly prone to extreme weather resulting from resource exploitation.Like Covid-19, which is believed to have spread from bats and other wild animals, sandstorms are a reminder of the need to respect nature, said Zhou Jinfeng, secretary general of the conservation group China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.“Together with the pandemic, that’s another big lesson we should take and we should change our behavior," Zhou said.The National Meteorological Center forecasted the sand and dust would affect 12 provinces and regions from Xinjiang in the far northwest to Heilongjiang in the northeast and the eastern coastal port city of Tianjin.“This is the most intense sandstorm weather our country has seen in 10 years, as well as it covering the broadest area," the center said in a post on its website.It wasn't clear if the storm was related to a recent general decline in air quality despite efforts to end Beijing's choking smog.The ruling Communist Party has pledged to reduce carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 18% over the next five years. Environmentalists say China needs to do more to reduce dependency on coal that has made it the world's biggest emitter of climate changing gasses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flights-canceled-during-china-s-worst-sandstorm-in-a-decade-101615802785283.html

But I also want to be clear: There is still a question of the truth. I did not do what has been alleged, period,” Cuomo said on a call with reporters.Asked if he ever had consensual romantic relationships with any of the women, Cuomo said he never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable, and was sorry if he did.On Sunday, Democratic U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to join the call for Cuomo's resignation, telling ABC's "This Week" program the allegations must be investigated."What these women have said must be treated with respect. They are credible and serious charges," Pelosi said. "The governor should look inside his heart - he loves New York - to see if he can govern effectively."New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, often at odds with Cuomo, told CBS' “Face the Nation” he did not think the governor would resign quickly."I think an impeachment proceeding will begin, and I think he will be impeached and perhaps right before that he'll decide to resign," the Democratic mayor said. "He should resign right now because he's holding up our effort to fight Covid-19. He's literally in the way of us saving lives right now."Republican Governors Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Larry Hogan of Maryland also both declined in separate appearances on Sunday news programs to call for Cuomo's resignation, but said the allegations needed to be investigated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-declines-to-call-on-ny-guv-andrew-cuomo-to-resign-awaits-probe-outcome-101615801562939.html

Three of us in this room for 10 days won't work," said Nicholas Worley, whose wife Kylie and 15-month-old son, Hunter, attended the playgroup.The quarantine rooms in Penny's Bay that accommodate Worley and many others are 18 sq. m. (194 sq. ft) in size and lack refrigerators, cooking facilities or baby amenities.While staff there did their best to assist, the facility is not designed for families, the residents said.Worley, who heads consultancy Bain's public relations in Asia, said hazards in the room, such as sharp nails and edges, fuelled additional concern over his son's safety. The trauma and psychological impact on families is intense, said a 40-year-old man in quarantine with his two young children."It's an absolute nightmare, it is just such a mess," said the man, who sought anonymity. On Sunday a class of 35 nine-year-olds from the city's Harbour School were told they needed to enter quarantine, its managing director, Dan Blurton, told Reuters."Parents and the school have strongly requested for alternative arrangements that are more humane, with regards to the treatment of young children," he added.Legal experts said there were no set guidelines regarding family separations, with each case being handled individually. Hong Kong barrister Kirsteen Lau said that legally health officers had wide discretion to grant or deny permission for a child or parent to enter a place of isolation.However, this meant that regulations "give very little guidance as to what circumstances would allow a parent and child to stay together," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-covid-19-rules-see-babies-isolated-families-cramped-in-tiny-spaces-101615802021246.html

15-03-2021||World||Time running out for US to revive nuclear deal: Iran||The United States should act quickly to revive Iran's nuclear deal, because once Iran's presidential election period kicks off it is unlikely much will happen until later this year, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Monday.Speaking at the European Policy Centre think tank, Zarif repeated Tehran's longstanding demand that Washington return first to compliance by lifting sanctions.Former US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, known as the JCPOA, under which Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. Since then, Washington has reimposed sanctions and Tehran has responded by violating some of the conditions of the deal.President Joe Biden aims to restore the deal, but Tehran and Washington each want the other side to comply first."The Europeans are used to compromise. Iran and the United States are not. The Americans are used to imposing, and we are used to resisting," Zarif said. "So now is the time to decide will we both compromise and go back to the JCPOA, or will we go back to our own paths?"Zarif said that he had seen no change between the Biden administration and the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure to force Iran back to the negotiating table. He said he saw no reason to hold preliminary talks, because the US was making "extraneous" demands."There is a time constraint and that is once we go to our election it is a lame duck government and (it) will not be able to do anything serious and then we will have a waiting period of almost six months," he said, referring to a presidential election due on June 18."It is advisable for the United States move fast and moving fast requires them not be shy, but takes measures that they need to take."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-running-out-for-us-to-revive-nuclear-deal-iran-101615797683762.html
15-03-2021||World||10 reports of possible side effects after AstraZeneca vaccine: Dutch watchdog||The Netherlands has seen 10 cases of noteworthy adverse side effects from AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, a Dutch drug watchdog said on Monday, hours after the government put its vaccination programme on hold following reports of possible unexpected side effects in other countries.The Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb said in a statement that 10 cases of reported side effects seen with the vaccine in the Netherlands included cases of possible thrombosis or embolisms, but none of the cases also included a lowered number of platelets, as has been reported reported in Denmark and Norway.The Dutch government announced shortly before midnight on Sunday that it was halting use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Its decision came hours before the Dutch began casting votes in a national election seen as a referendum on the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The decision meant 43,000 vaccination appointments would be cancelled at short notice, the country's health authorities said.European vaccination programmes have been upset in the last two weeks by reports that recipients of the AstraZeneca inoculation have suffered blood clots.The European Medicines Agency has said there is no indication that the events were caused by the vaccination, a view that was echoed by the World Health Organization on Friday.The Dutch vaccination programme got off to a slow start, but hoped to catch up using the Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna vaccines, and later the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. AstraZeneca, however, was to have accounted for 30% of 4.3 million vaccinations through April 15.The Dutch health ministry said it hoped to resume vaccinations with AstraZeneca within several weeks, describing the halt as a "pause" taken only as a precaution."I hope (the halt will last) no longer than a couple of weeks, because we need vaccines to be able to put this nasty period behind us," Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said on an early morning talk show.The move follows a report that health workers in Norway who had recently received the vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.The Netherlands has pre-ordered 12 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine.AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of people vaccinated with its Covid-19 vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.Denmark, Norway, Ireland, Iceland and Thailand have halted use of AstraZeneca's vaccine over blood clotting concerns. Italy's northern region of Piedmont on Sunday said it would stop using a batch of AstraZeneca vaccines after a teacher died following his vaccination on Saturday, while Austria also stopped using a particular batch last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-reports-of-possible-side-effects-after-astrazeneca-vaccine-dutch-watchdog-101615800276339.html

ADB's investments must meet the highest standards of sustainable development and deliver real results that help countries realise the vision set out in strategy 2030 and rebuild for the SDGs."2020 was to be the start of a decade of action to accelerate progress on SDGs but the Covid-19 pandemic has threatened the region's prospects for achieving the goals. Asia and the Pacific were already off track to meet these ambitious goals before the pandemic began.The ensuing crisis is estimated to have pushed 162 million people in the region back into poverty and economic growth in developing Asia contracted for first time in 60 years.At the same time, there has been limited progress on SDGs that protect environment and the region is at the front lines of climate change crisis. There is a huge financing gap to make SDGs a reality.A green, resilient, inclusive and sustainable recovery from Covid-19 that aligns with SDGs will be imperative, said the report.The report explains ADB's institutional approach to integrating 17 SDGs and their associated targets into its strategies, programs and financing under its long-term strategy in 2030 through its seven operational priorities. ADB's corporate results framework is fully aligned with SDGs.ADB projects and programmes that help countries achieve the SDGs like in Indonesia, ADB has helped government establish institutions to coordinate SDGs and develop a road map for SDG implementation, while also supporting the national infrastructure finance company PT SMI to establish the SDG one fund.In Kazakhstan, ADB helped the government establish platforms for donor coordination in support of national implementation of SDGs.The ADB ventures platform established in 2020 deploys venture capital investments and technical assistance to support early-stage technology businesses that address SDGs.It also partners with the United Nations and others to support knowledge and policy dialogue that enables developing member countries to implement SDGs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-by-asian-development-bank-says-new-focus-on-sdgs-needed-by-countries-to-rebuild-covid-19-pandemic-101615800322684.html
15-03-2021||World||2 key US Cabinet members visit Japan for China-focused talks||Shared worry about China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region will take center stage when President Joe Biden's defense chief and secretary of state visit Japan for their first in-person talks with their Japanese counterparts.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived Monday, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken to join him later in Tokyo for meetings meant to reaffirm America's commitment to the region and to the two nations' alliance following former President Donald Trump's more confrontational approach.The two secretaries are holding so-called “two plus two” diplomatic and security talks on Tuesday with their Japanese counterparts, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi.“The United States is now making a big push to revitalize our ties with friends and partners — both in one-to-one relationships and in multilateral institutions — and to recommit to our shared goals, values, and responsibilities,” Blinken and Austin said in a piece published Monday in The Washington Post.The US and others share the values and principles of keeping an open Indo-Pacific region, but China is “all too willing to use coercion to get its way,” the two ministers said. “Here again, we see how working with our allies is critical."The US will lead with diplomacy, maintain America's military might “and renew our alliances and ensure they're fit for purpose to address the threats and opportunities of our time," Blinken and Austin wrote. Together they can hold China accountable for its human rights abuses and other problems in Xinjiang, Tibet, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan, they said.In a move meant to signal his intention for the US to return to the Asia-Pacific region, Biden on Friday held a first summit of the leaders from Australia, Japan, India and the US known as the “Quad” virtually and emphasized Washington's commitment to the region.Motegi said in a parliamentary session Monday that he expected China to be the topic he and Blinken discussed most and that Japan being the first destination of their foreign travel signaled “the US emphasis on the Japan-US alliance.”Motegi said he hoped to “show the rest of the world an unshakable unity” in the alliance and hoped to discuss how Japan and the US, through their alliance, can step up their deterrence and response capability in answer to China.“Japan, together with the US, will resolutely respond to China's unilateral attempt to change the status quo,” Motegi said. “But at the same time, China is the world's No. 2 economy and it is important to firmly encourage that country to act responsibly based on international rules.”Japan is in a delicate diplomatic situation because its economy, like those of other countries in the region, heavily depends on China.But it also considers China's growing presence in the region a security threat. Beijing has built militarized manmade islands in the South China Sea and is pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea's key fisheries and waterways. Japan is concerned about China's claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea and its increased activity in the disputed area.China has denied it is expansionist and said it is only defending its territorial rights.On the Biden administration’s first Cabinet-level trip abroad, Blinken and Austin are also expected to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and climate change, as well as the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and the situation in Myanmar after its military coup.While in Tokyo, they plan to have virtual meetings with business leaders, civil-society members, business leaders and others while in Tokyo before heading on Wednesday to South Korea, another key ally in the region.China is not on Blinken’s itinerary, but he is set to meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington. Austin will go from Seoul to New Delhi for meetings with Indian leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-key-us-cabinet-members-visit-japan-for-china-focused-talks-101615799059588.html
15-03-2021||World||US consulate in Hong Kong closes after staff test positive for Covid-19||The United States temporarily closed its consulate in Hong Kong on Monday after two staff members tested positive for the coronavirus during a new outbreak that has rippled through the city's well-heeled "expat" community.The two cases emerged during an "ambush lockdown" -- a tactic used by Hong Kong authorities to descend overnight on apartment blocks where they suspect there may be cases and test everyone inside."We have closed the Consulate General to perform a deep disinfection and cleaning while contact tracing is conducted," the consulate said in a statement after it was informed of the cases on Monday.Hong Kong has managed to keep infections low thanks to some of the strictest quarantine measures in the world.It has recorded some 11,000 infections and 200 deaths since the pandemic began.In recent days, a new cluster that was first traced to an upmarket gym has swept through wealthier districts favoured by the white-collar immigrants who staff the city's finance industries and consulates.The gym infection has ballooned to more than 100 confirmed infections while some 750 people deemed "close contacts" have been sent to mandatory government-run quarantine camps.The US consulate infections were first reported by Dot Dot News, an online news outlet operated by the largest pro-Beijing state media group in Hong Kong.Their report claimed the two consulate staff invoked diplomatic immunity and refused to be quarantined.That prompted a call from Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing political party to protest outside the consulate, but the gathering was moved to a different district and only a handful showed up.Hong Kong health authorities said the pair were being placed on a hospital isolation ward.And the US consulate said staff "have abided by all Hong Kong government requirements for the arrival, testing, and quarantine of all diplomatic personnel and their family members."In a separate statement, the consulate said it was aware that some US citizens in Hong Kong had concerns about the city's mandatory quarantine and hospitalisation procedures "particularly in regard to the possible separation of children from their parents".Hong Kong places people deemed to be close contacts with a coronavirus patient in camps for two weeks, including some children and babies.Youngsters have previously been sent to the facilities, but scrutiny and opposition have become more vocal since the current wave hit wealthy international schools and neighbourhoods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-consulate-in-hong-kong-closes-after-staff-test-positive-for-covid19-101615799199826.html
15-03-2021||World||Covid-19: China administered 65 million doses of vaccine to citizens so far||A Chinese official says the country has administered almost 65 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to its citizens amid plans to immunize up to 80% of its entire population of 1.4 billion.Teams have been dispatched nationwide to oversee vaccinations and are working with targeted groups according to a schedule, Vice Chairman of the National Health Commission Li Bin told reporters at a news conference on Monday.China has been slower in its vaccination campaign than many other countries, including the US, while committing roughly 10 times more doses abroad than it has distributed at home. The lack of urgency is partly due to the near elimination of locally spread cases.With four approved vaccines, China plans to vaccinate 900 million to 1 billion people by the summer of 2022, seeking to establish herd immunity to stop the uncontrolled spread of an infectious disease like Covid-19.China announced on Friday that it would waive a Covid-19 test and health form requirement for foreigners applying for visas to the mainland from Hong Kong if they have been vaccinated with a Chinese-made vaccine.Also last week, the Foreign Ministry launched an international travel health certificate that includes a Covid-19 test and serum antibody results, as well as vaccination and other health information. It is unclear how it will be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-administered-65-million-doses-of-vaccine-to-citizens-so-far-101615797894795.html
15-03-2021||World||Explainer: Myanmar using martial law to 'legitimise' tactics||Myanmar's ruling junta on Monday imposed martial law in parts of the country's biggest city, a day after at least 38 people were killed in the bloodiest crackdown yet on resistance to last month's military coup.NOT THE FIRST RESTRICTIONSAfter the Feb 1 coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, the military declared a nationwide state of emergency and gave itself broad powers. It also put in place similar but milder restrictions to martial law in dozens of townships across the country.Those earlier measures used Section 144 of the penal code and the main impact was a ban on gatherings of more than five people — which was generally ignored — and an 8 pm to 4 am curfew, which protesters last week began defying in large numbers.MARTIAL LAW TRUMPS ALL ELSEMartial law basically supersedes all other law, allowing the military total authority over the specified area, including administrative, judicial and law enforcement functions.The imposition of martial law in six townships in Yangon in legal terms legitimizes actions that the military had already been taking to suppress the protests. The immediate trigger appeared to be escalating violence — mostly on the part of the security forces but with increasing signs that at least some demonstrators are starting to take active self-defense measures including burning tires at makeshift barricades.The official order issued Monday said martial law was imposed “to take more effective measures for the security, rule of law and community peace and tranquility.”Violators of orders issued by the military can now be tried by military courts and could face punishments as harsh as death or life imprisonment, according to local news outlet Eleven Media. The minimum punishment, it said, was three years in prison with hard labor and a fine.Eleven Media appeared to be basing its report on times martial law was declared in 1989 and 1974. Martial law remained in place for three years after it was declared in 1989 in the wake of a failed popular uprising against a military dictatorship.PROTECTING BUSINESS INTERESTSThe first two places martial law was declared were two Yangon townships that are industrial zones home to garment factories, a major source of export earnings for Myanmar. One of those townships, Hlaing Thar Yar, was the scene of Sunday's worst violence, with at least 22 protesters killed. Later the order was extended to another heavily industrial Yangon township as well as three other townships in the city.The declaration follows reports that at least two factories that have Chinese ownership were set on fire Sunday night. It was not clear who set the fires.A Chinese Embassy statement issued Sunday said several Chinese-owned factories were burned and multiple Chinese employees were injured and trapped.“China requires Myanmar to take further effective measures to stop all violent acts, investigate and deal with relevant perpetrators in accordance with the law, and ensure the safety of the lives and property of Chinese enterprises and personnel in Myanmar,” the statement said.Many factories in Myanmar have Chinese ownership or partners. China's political and economic clout in Myanmar is a point of great resentment among many Myanmar people, who accuse China of exploiting their country for its natural resources and protecting the military from international consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-myanmar-using-martial-law-to-legitimise-tactics-101615797134920.html
15-03-2021||World||Italy under Covid-19 lockdown, AstraZeneca shots face resistance in Europe||Coronavirus restrictions were reimposed across much of Italy on Monday, while Ireland and the Netherlands became the latest countries to suspend AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shots over blood clot fears despite the firm and the WHO insisting there is no risk.More than 350 million vaccine doses have been administered globally so far, and the AstraZeneca shot -- among the cheapest available -- is crucial to roll-outs in poorer parts of the world.Despite immunisation programmes gathering pace, surges in infections remain a threat and Italian authorities reimposed restrictions on three-quarters of the country until April 6 to suppress an outbreak fuelled by the variant first detected in Britain.Health Minister Roberto Speranza said Sunday the government hoped these strict measures and ongoing vaccinations would allow a relaxation of curbs later."Each dose of vaccine injected is a step in the direction of the way out of the crisis," he added.Schools, restaurants, shops and museums will close, including in Rome and Milan, with residents told to stay home except for work, health or other essential reasons.And while France was hoping to avoid another national lockdown, it was facing a hospital crisis with intensive care beds in the Paris region running out.The coronavirus has killed more than 2.6 million people around the world, with much of humanity going through varying levels of Covid-19 restrictions.People have been growing weary of the economically painful curbs, however.The Netherlands -- under tight restrictions including an overnight curfew -- began three days of voting on Monday in a popularity test of the government's coronavirus policies.Prime Minister Mark Rutte was set to win another term in office, but opposition to the restrictions was on display on the eve of the vote in The Hague Sunday as police used water cannon to clear an anti-government protest.AstraZeneca worriesAs they battle virus surges, health authorities in Italy and France have backed the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, as several countries suspended use of the shot over fears it causes side effects such as blood clots.Ireland and the Netherlands stopped giving out the shot on Sunday, joining Denmark, Norway and Bulgaria.But the World Health Organization, Europe's medicines watchdog, AstraZeneca and experts have stressed that the jab is safe and that there is no evidence linking it to the clots.The AstraZeneca shot forms the bulk of doses being sent to poorer countries under the WHO-backed Covax scheme, which aims to ensure vaccines reach all parts of the world.The United States, meanwhile, has ramped up its vaccination programme after a stumbling start, with more than 107 million doses administered.The world's worst-hit nation gave more than two million shots a day on average last week, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control, with 21% of the population getting at least one dose.The top US pandemic adviser Anthony Fauci said authorities were considering cutting social distancing rules to three feet (one metre), from the widely accepted six-foot global guideline.CDC experts were examining a study that found "no substantial difference" in cases at schools observing six-foot and three-foot separations, Fauci told a CNN show.New York -- the American city most bereaved by the virus -- marked the one-year anniversary of the pandemic with a tribute Sunday to its 30,258 dead, with candles lit on the famous Brooklyn Bridge.'It's hard for the poor'Distancing requirements are a core issue in discussions around the world on reopening schools, with many claiming the six-foot requirement makes it difficult to resume classes without adding portable classrooms or shortening the school day.Many teachers' unions have also insisted on six-foot distancing.Remote learning through the internet has been one option, but it has proved difficult to implement in less wealthy nations where many families do not have internet access or devices such as computers, smartphones and tablets."The rich have everything they need," said Maria Fe Morallos, a 10th-grade student in the Philippines who cannot afford a smartphone."It's hard for the poor because we don't have a gadget or the money to buy it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-under-covid-19-lockdown-astrazeneca-shots-face-resistance-in-europe-101615793512552.html

15-03-2021||World||Biden to name Gene Sperling to lead Covid-19 relief plan: Official||US President Joe Biden will name Gene Sperling to lead implementation of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan signed into law last week, an administration official said on Sunday.Sperling, a top economic official in the administrations of former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, was ideally suited for the job because of his experience, the official added."There’s no one who knows how the federal government works better than Gene Sperling, and there’s no one better qualified to take charge of the implementation of the rescue plan and make sure it delivers for the American people," the official said.Sperling did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A White House announcement could come as early as Monday, according to Politico, which first said Sperling was being considered for the job earlier on Sunday.The relief program Biden signed into law on Thursday provides $400 billion for direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, aid of $350 billion to state and local governments, an expansion of the child tax credit and more funds to distribute vaccines.Passage of the legislation would speed the recovery of the U.S. economy, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had said in a statement.Sperling, who served as an economic adviser for Biden's presidential campaign, is the only person who headed the White House National Economic Council under two presidents - Obama and Clinton.From 2009 to 2011, he served as a counsel to then Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, as the Obama administration responded to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis."He has a track record of translating complex policies into tangible results for working and middle-class families," said the administration official.Sperling had helped both administrations create jobs and boost economic growth following tough economic downturns, he added.In his new role, Sperling will work with the heads of the White House policy councils and leaders of federal agencies to ensure swift adoption of the relief package, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-name-gene-sperling-to-lead-covid-19-relief-plan-official-101615782232894.html
15-03-2021||World||Indonesia offers aggressive tax benefits for electric vehicles||Indonesia, a top supplier of a key battery metal, will aim to boost sales of electric vehicles with a new regulation that will cut tax breaks for hybrid cars.Battery-powered electric vehicles will retain their 0% luxury tax rate, while plug-in hybrid vehicles will see their tariff increase to 5% from 0%, according to a draft regulation issued by the finance ministry on Monday. Full and mild hybrid types will be taxed at a rate of 6%-12%, compared with a previous range of 2%-12%.The new rates will apply only to locally-produced vehicles.This is the latest in a series of initiatives that Indonesia has unveiled to meet its ambition to become a global EV battery hub. The country wants to expand its role as a major source of nickel -- used in the batteries -- to also producing other components as demand for greener transport skyrockets across markets like the U.S., China, Japan and Europe.World’s Top Nickel Producer Sets Out End-to-End Battery AmbitionHigher rates will kick in in two years after the battery-powered EV sector realizes investments of 5 trillion rupiah ($347 million), or when it starts commercial production with an investment of the same amount. After this, plug-in hybrids will be taxed at a rate of 8%, while other hybrids will see a tariff of 10%-14%, the draft rules showed.While Southeast Asia’s largest economy has caught the attention of the world’s major battery makers, the government is also keen to prop up the usage of electric vehicles in the fossil-fuel dependent country, especially where traditional and hybrid cars remain cheaper. Only 120 electric vehicles were sold there in 2020, about a tenth of the sales of hybrids, industry data showed.Indonesia, among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, has shown renewed focus on reducing its carbon emissions, with the government weighing incentives for clean-energy use and expanding its renewables sector.The transport sector accounts for nearly 30% of the country’s total emissions, with land transport comprising bulk of it. Indonesia has committed to reduce its emissions by at least 29% by 2030 under the Paris Agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-offers-aggressive-tax-benefits-for-electric-vehicles-101615790157140.html
15-03-2021||World||'Republic of Queues': 10 years on, Syria is a hungry nation||The lines stretch for miles outside gas stations in Syrian cities, with an average wait of five hours to fill up a tank. At bakeries, people push and shove during long, chaotic waits for their turn to collect the quota of two bread packs a day per family.On the streets in the capital of Damascus, beggars accost motorists and passers-by, pleading for food or money. Medicines, baby milk and diapers can hardly be found.As Syria marks the 10th anniversary Monday of the start of its uprising-turned-civil war, President Bashar Assad may still be in power, propped up by Russia and Iran. But millions of people are being pushed deeper into poverty, and a majority of households can hardly scrape together enough to secure their next meal.With Assad preparing to run for a fourth seven-year presidential term in the spring, some have questioned whether he can survive the sharp economic deterioration and anger in areas under his control. Poverty levels are now worse than at any point throughout the 10-year conflict.“Life here is a portrait of everyday humiliation and suffering,” said one woman in Damascus. Her husband lost his job at an electronics store last month, and now the family is drawing on meager savings that are evaporating fast. The woman said she had taken up teaching part-time to help make ends meet. Like others, she spoke on condition her identity remains hidden, fearing arrest.With two kids and an elderly father to care for, she said life had become unbearably difficult and she is gripped by anxiety for the future. Until recently, she could smuggle in her father’s medicines from Lebanon, but now Lebanon has its own meltdown and shortages.“I go to the souk and really have to think of priorities, buying only the bare necessities for cooking. I try not to look at the other stuff my children might like,” she said.The decade of war has wreaked unfathomable destruction on Syria. Nearly half a million people have been killed and more than half the pre-war population of 23 million displaced, whether inside or outside the country's borders, the world’s worst displacement crisis since World War II. Infrastructure is in ruins.Through most of the conflict, Assad was able to shield Syrians in government-held territory from unbearable economic pain. Even if barely sometimes, the state kept fuel, medicine and other supplies coming and the currency propped up.Now he has gained a decisive upper hand in the war with Russia and Iran’s help, his grip on areas under his control is unquestioned, and the rebellion is largely crushed.But the economy has fallen apart with startling swiftness. It was hit by a double blow of new, far-reaching US sanctions imposed last year and the financial meltdown in Lebanon, Syria’s main link with the outside world. That proved too much, on top of the strains of war, government corruption, other Western sanctions in place for years and the coronavirus pandemic.The United Nations says more than 80% of Syrians now live in poverty, and 60% are at risk of hunger. The currency has crashed, now at 4,000 Syrian pounds to the dollar on the black market, compared to 700 a year ago and 47 at the beginning of the conflict in 2011.“When you put all of these things together, there is no surprise that we are seeing rising food insecurity, rising hunger," said Arif Hussein, chief economist at the U.N. World Food Program. "Not only in the breadth, meaning lots and lots of people, but also in the depth, meaning people are closer to starvation today than ever before.”Residents of government-held areas who spoke to The Associated Press paint a grim picture. Prices go up several times a day. Families now rely on electronic “smart cards” to secure subsidized and rationed goods that include fuel, gas canisters, tea, sugar, rice and bread. To collect them, they wait in long lines, often pushing, shoving and fighting.At gas stations, some park their cars at night to claim a place in line and come back early in the morning to fill their cars. Residents carpool or walk whenever possible, to avoid wasting fuel.REPUBLIC OF QUEUES“It is the ‘Republic of Queues,’” said Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian journalist based in London who covers Syrian affairs for the Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.Despite the rising discontent, Assad’s rule is not threatened, because people are too busy with their own survival, he said. "They don’t have time to think about anything political. They have no time to think about transition, or the constitution or reforms, because they are busy all the time.”Food prices have risen 230% the past year, and many Syrians say they are consumed with searching for essential goods that are no longer available. Many families go without meat and fruits for months. At vegetable markets, people often buy a single piece, because they can’t afford more. The monthly salary of a state employee is now worth $15-$20, compared to around $170 a year ago.In the main cities, many plan their day around the electricity schedule, since power is cut four hours for every two it’s on, sometimes longer. Unlike in Lebanon, where neighborhood generators have been institutionalized, only well-off people can afford them in Syria.In winter, with gas bottles in short supply, many resorted to using toxic old wood heaters for warmth, with children seen rummaging through trash for anything to burn.The simultaneous crises in Lebanon and Syria have fed off each other. Where Lebanese once traveled to Damascus to buy cheaper, good quality medicine, textiles and other goods, now Lebanon’s subsidized goods, including fuel and medicine are smuggled to Syria, exacerbating Lebanon’s economic crisis.A Syrian media activist who goes by the pseudonym of Omar Hariri said rations of bread, gasoline, cooking gas and diesel barely cover 10% of people’s needs. Waiting in line for hours has become “a way of life,” he said.“I have a relative who got his turn for gasoline in January after two months of cold had passed, and he was forced to buy from the black market at a much higher price,” he said.WALLS OF FEARSyrian economist Samir Seifan said the collapse of Lebanon's banking system, the US sanctions, and the pandemic are all “factors that exploded at the same time.” Now the regime has no more sources of income, so they are printing money and fueling inflation, he said.Frustration is voiced even among Assad's most loyal supporters. One lawmaker questioned recently why Iran and Russia were not helping by sending oil and wheat.The government has cracked down, detaining at least nine people in the last six weeks, including a prominent state TV anchor for social media posts deemed critical.“The regime is trying to rebuild the walls of fear, to remind people that even if you are loyalists you cannot criticize us,” Hamidi said.Assad blames the U.S., calling its sanctions economic terrorism that seeks to starve the people. Shifting regional dynamics are boosting his confidence; some Gulf Arab countries that supported the Syrian opposition now openly criticize the sanctions.“In 10 years of war, the (Syrian) regime did not offer a single concession. There is a general feeling that things can only get worse,” Hamidi said.“There is no horizon, no hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republic-of-queues-10-years-on-syria-is-a-hungry-nation-101615791535110.html
15-03-2021||World||Facebook to label all posts about Covid-19 vaccines||Facebook Inc, which has been criticized by lawmakers and researchers for allowing vaccine misinformation to spread on its platforms, said on Monday it has started adding labels to posts that discuss the safety of the shots and will soon label all posts about the vaccines.The social media company said in a blog post it is also launching a tool in the United States to give people information about where to get Covid-19 vaccines and adding a Covid-19 information area to its photo-sharing site Instagram.False claims and conspiracies about the coronavirus vaccines have proliferated on social media platforms during the pandemic.Facebook and Instagram, which recently tightened their policies after long taking a hands-off approach to vaccine misinformation, remain home to large accounts, pages and groups that promote false claims about the shots and can be easily found through keyword searches.Facebook's Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in an interview that the company had taken viral false claims "very seriously" but said there was "a huge gray area of people who have concerns...some of which some people would call misinformation and some of which other people would call doubt.""The best thing to do in that huge gray area is just to show up with authoritative information in a helpful way, be a part of the conversation and do it with health experts," he added.The company said it was labeling Facebook and Instagram posts that discuss the safety of COVID-19 vaccines with text saying the vaccines go through safety and effectiveness tests before approval.In the blog post, it also said that since expanding its list of banned false claims about the coronavirus and vaccines in February, it has removed an additional 2 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram. Facebook said it had also implemented temporary measures including reducing the reach of content from users who repeatedly share content marked false by fact-checkers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-label-all-posts-about-covid-19-vaccines-101615791911184.html

15-03-2021||World||No evidence of increased blood clot risk from Covid-19 vaccine: AstraZeneca||Amid the rising concern over thrombotic (blood clots) events, pharma major AstraZeneca issued a statement on Monday saying a review of 17 million people administered its Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine suggested it was entirely safe.“AstraZeneca would like to offer its reassurance on the safety of its Covid-19 vaccine based on clear scientific evidence. Safety is of paramount importance and the company is continually monitoring the safety of its vaccine,” said the company in a statement. “A careful review of all available safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union (EU) and UK with Covid-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia, in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country,” it added. So far across the EU and UK, there have been 15 events of deep vein thrombosis and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those given the vaccine, based on the number of cases the company has received as of March 8. This is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines. The monthly safety report will be made public on the European Medicines Agency website in the following week, in line with exceptional transparency measures for Covid-19. Also Read | Ireland, Netherlands halt AstraZeneca Covid-19 jabs as Italy gets set for curbsFurthermore, in clinical trials, even though the number of thrombotic events was small, these were lower in the vaccinated group. There has also been no evidence of increased bleeding in over 60,000 participants enrolled. Chief medical officer of AstraZeneca, Ann Taylor, said: “Around 17 million people in the EU and UK have now received our vaccine, and the number of cases of blood clots reported in this group is lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population. The nature of the pandemic has led to increased attention in individual cases and we are going beyond the standard practices for safety monitoring of licensed medicines in reporting vaccine events, to ensure public safety.” “In terms of quality, there are no confirmed issues related to any batch of our vaccine used across Europe, or the rest of the world. Additional testing has been, and is being conducted by ourselves and independently by European health authorities and none of these re-tests have shown cause for concern. During the production of the vaccine, more than 60 quality tests are conducted by AstraZeneca, its partners and by more than 20 independent testing laboratories. All tests need to meet stringent criteria for quality control and this data is submitted to regulators within each country or region for independent review before any batch can be released to countries,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-evidence-of-increased-blood-clot-risk-from-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-101615790930334.html
15-03-2021||World||Thousands of women across Australia march against sexual violence, gender inequality||Tens of thousands of women protested across Australia against sexual violence and gender inequality on Monday, as outrage grew over rape allegations that have convulsed the conservative government.The #March4Justice rallies were held in more than 40 Australian cities and towns, with a major demonstration in Canberra following allegations of sexual assault in the nation's parliament.Dressed mostly in black, the crowd gathered outside Parliament House holding aloft placards with slogans including "You're Not Listening", "How Many Victims Do You Know?" and "I Believe Her".Protester Kathryn Jamieson, who travelled from Melbourne to take part, said she was "fuming with rage"."I wanted to be at the heart of the matter, I've completely had enough," she told AFP. "We need immediate change -- I'm sick of women not being believed."Former government staffer Brittany Higgins alleged publicly last month that she had been raped by a colleague in a minister's office in 2019.And earlier this month, Attorney-General Christian Porter vigorously denied swirling accusations he had raped a 16-year-old girl in 1988 when they were both students.The controversy has placed growing pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who critics say has fumbled the government's response to the scandals.The latest gaffe came Monday when he told parliament: "Not far from here such marches, even now, are being met with bullets, but not here in this country" -- drawing furious interjections from opposition politicians and stunned reactions online."The prime minister thinks women should be grateful that we weren't shot for rallying for our own safety," Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young tweeted.Public anger at Morrison's government was reflected in a new opinion poll Monday showing voter support has fallen to levels not seen since 2019 when he vacationed in Hawaii while massive bushfires were raging in Australia.The government has ordered an independent inquiry into parliament's workplace culture and established new staff support services but activists say systemic change is now needed -- not just in politics but across Australian society.Higgins told the crowd in Canberra her story was "a painful reminder to women that it can happen in Parliament House, and can truly happen anywhere"."We fundamentally recognise the system is broken, the glass ceiling is still in place," she said."We are here because it is unfathomable that we are still having to fight this same stale, tired fight."'Toxic' workplace cultureNo senior government ministers attended Monday's rallies and organisers refused Morrison's offer to speak in private, saying a closed-door meeting would be "disrespectful" to alleged victims."I think the prime minister, if he really cared about women, really cared about our voices... he (could) open the door, walk across the forecourt and come and listen to us," organiser Janine Hendry told the ABC.An estimated 10,000 joined the protest in Melbourne, with thousands more in major cities including Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane. Several thousand also rallied in Porter's hometown of Perth on Sunday."Evil thrives in silence," sexual abuse survivor and Australian of the Year Grace Tame told a crowd in the Tasmanian capital, Hobart."Behaviour unspoken, behaviour ignored, is behaviour endorsed."The #March4Justice is demanding a raft of measures including independent investigations into all cases of gendered violence, a boost in public funding for prevention and the implementation of recommendations from a 2020 national inquiry into sexual harassment at work.Australia's parliament has been repeatedly criticised for a "toxic" workplace culture that has allegedly spawned persistent bullying, harassment and sexual assault.The ruling coalition has been accused of not doing enough to support female party members, including after a spate of women quit parliament ahead of the 2019 election, with several citing bullying as a factor.Local media also reported that women in the opposition Labor party had recently set up a Facebook page that details alleged sexual harassment by male colleagues and politicians.A group of independent and minor-party female politicians on Monday announced they would attempt to amend a "loophole" in legislation that shields members of parliament and the judiciary from liability for workplace sexual harassment."It seems crazy that we would be, in 2021, having to present an amendment to a legislation that is vital to ensure all workplaces in Australia are safe and secure and respectful," independent MP Zali Steggall said.On Monday, Porter launched defamation proceedings against public broadcaster ABC, which first published the allegations against an unnamed senior minister, with lawyers saying the attorney-general was "easily identifiable" in the article and has since been subjected to "trial by media".Porter remains on medical leave in the wake of the allegations, as does Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, who is accused of mishandling the Higgins case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-women-across-australia-march-against-sexual-violence-gender-inequality-101615789485200.html
15-03-2021||World||Missile strike in northern Syria 'targeted' civilian settlements: Turkey||A missile strike in Turkish-controlled northern Syria wounded several civilians, Turkey's defence ministry and a monitoring group said Monday.Officials said the ballistic missiles were fired from the Kuweires airbase in Aleppo, under the control of the Syrian government, and struck Al-Bab and Jarablus towns in the north of the war-torn country.The strike "targeted civilian settlements and fuel tankers... civilians were wounded," the ministry said in a tweet, accompanied by a video appearing to show several lorries on fire.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said its sources on the ground heard loud explosions near Jarablus "caused by rocket attacks of unknown origin."Several civilians and workers had been wounded, it added.In March, missile strikes on oil refineries in the same area left four dead and 24 wounded.The facilities have been the subject of repeated attacks in recent months, although neither Damascus nor ally Moscow -- which has troops in Syria -- have claimed the strikes.Ankara had contacted Russian troops to demand a halt to the firing, the defence ministry said Monday, adding its troops in the region had been "alerted."Turkey launched the "Euphrates Shield" operation in 2016, taking control of a swathe of territory in northern Syria.The operation allowed Syrian rebels supported by Turkey to control several towns -- including Jarablus and Al-Bab.Syria's war has killed more than 387,000 people and displaced millions since starting in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missile-strike-in-northern-syria-targeted-civilian-settlements-turkey-101615788696433.html
15-03-2021||World||Hong Kong activists say democracy fight to continue abroad||Hong Kong democracy activists have launched a new push to continue their fight among residents living abroad in the wake of a sweeping crackdown by Beijing and changes to the the semi-autonomous Chinese city's electoral system aimed at shutting out opposition voices.In a letter titled the “2021 Hong Kong Charter," the activists stated that, “Numerous Hongkongers have no choice but to leave in exile, while those remaining in their city are living with the constant fear of being politically persecuted on any day."“The 2021 electoral reform imposed by the Chinese Communist Party further annihilated the democratic elements in our elections, putting the last nail in the coffin for “One Country, Two Systems,” the letter said, citing the framework for running the city after its handover from British colonial rule in 1997.The letter, cosigned by eight prominent opposition figures, calls for international support to counter what they called the “global aggression” of China's ruling Communist Party, along with reforms to the government and police force and the abolishment of a sweeping national security law imposed last year. Dozens of activists including former lawmakers have been charged under the law, prompting many to seek asylum abroad.“Under such high pressure from China, the diaspora from Hong Kong have more responsibility than ever to speak out and ensure we continue to draw international concern,” Nathan Law, who now resides in the UK, said during an online news conference Sunday. “We hope our overseas communities can continue to fight until the day we can elect our own leaders.”Hong Kong was rocked by months of antigovernment protests in 2019 that were met with increasingly repressive measures by security forces and the authorities in Beijing.China's legislature this month approved changes to election rules in the city that will virtually eliminate the influence of any political opposition, bringing strong criticism from the US and the UK, which ruled Hong Kong as a colony for 156 years. The changes tighten Beijing's control over the selection of Hong Kong's leader, along with the makeup of its legislative council.China had pledged to allow the city to retain freedoms not permitted elsewhere in the country for 50 years, but its recent steps are seen as a betrayal.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday said Beijing’s decision to “impose radical changes to restrict participation in Hong Kong’s electoral system ... is part of a pattern designed to harass and stifle all voices critical of China’s policies.”Raab said the moves amount to the third breach of a 1984 agreement between the sides that Britain hoped would protect Hong Kong's freedoms after the handover of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activists-say-democracy-fight-to-continue-abroad-101615788276227.html
15-03-2021||World||US ministers' Japan visit under Biden to focus on China concerns||Concerns about China's growing influence in the region is expected to be a main focus when two ministers of President Joe Biden's administration visits Japan for their first in-person talks with their Japanese counterparts.US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are on their way to Tokyo to meet their counterparts and other top officials as they try to reaffirm America's commitment to the region and their alliance following Donald Trump's temperamental approach.The two secretaries are holding so-called “two plus two” diplomatic and security talks with their Japanese counterparts, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi on Tuesday.“The United States is now making a big push to revitalize our ties with friends and partners — both in one-to-one relationships and in multilateral institutions — and to recommit to our shared goals, values, and responsibilities,” Blinken and Austin said in a piece published Monday in the Washington Post.Despite the US and others that share the values and principles to keep an open Indo-Pacific region, China is “all too willing to use coercion to get its way,” the two ministers said. “Here again, we see how working with our allies is critical."The US will lead with diplomacy, while maintaining America's military might “and renew our alliances and ensure they're fit for purpose to address the threats and opportunities of our time," Blinken and Austin wrote. Together they can hold China accountable for its human rights abuses and other problems in Xinjiang, Tibet, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan, they said.Signaling the US return to the Asia-Pacific region, Biden on Friday held a first summit of the leaders from Australia, Japan, India and the US known as the “Quad” virtually and emphasized Washington's commitment to the region.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on Monday welcomed the outcome of the talks as “a good opportunity for the four countries to confirm their strong commitment as a driving force to achieve ‘a free and open Indo-Pacific.'" Kato praised the “quad” summit held early in the Biden administration.Japan considers China's growing presence in the region a security threat. Beijing has built militarized manmade islands in the South China Sea and is pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea's key fisheries and waterways.

15-03-2021||World||Biden, Harris and others organise roadshow to promote relief plan's benefits||President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses are opening an ambitious, cross-country tour this week to highlight the benefits of his $1.9 trillion plan to defeat the coronavirus and boost the economy.The road show — dubbed the “Help is Here” tour by the White House — begins Monday with Harris heading to a Covid-19 vaccination site and a culinary academy in Las Vegas, and first lady Jill Biden touring a New Jersey elementary school.The president will have more to say about the plan Monday at the White House, and he plans to visit a small business in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. He and Harris are slated to appear together in Atlanta on Friday.Harris will meet with small-business owners in Denver on Tuesday. Wednesday sees Jill Biden in Concord, New Hampshire, and Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.The stops at vaccination sites, businesses, schools and more are meant to educate the public about different aspects of the giant American Rescue Plan and how it will help people get to the other side of the pandemic.Biden has said President Barack Obama's administration, in which Biden was vice president, failed to adequately educate the public about the benefits of its economic recovery plan. He said he wants to do a better sales job this time around on the details of his first big legislative victory.One of the plan's key features is direct payments of $1,400 for a single taxpayer, or $2,800 for a married couple filing their taxes jointly, plus 1,400 per dependent — for a total of $5,600 for a married couple with two children. The payments phase out for those with higher incomes.An extension of federal unemployment benefits will continue through September 6 at $300 a week. There's $350 billion for state, local and tribal governments, $130 billion for K-12 schools and about $50 billion to expand Covid-19 testing, among other measures.Restaurants and bars that were forced to close or limit service will take advantage of a new multibillion-dollar grant program, and the plan also has tens of billions of dollars to help people who have fallen behind on their rent and mortgage payments.The bill cleared Congress without any backing from Republicans, despite polling that found broad public support for the plan. Republicans argued the bill was too expensive. Democrats provided the votes and Biden signed it into law last week.The “Help is Here” tour is taking Harris on her first domestic trip as vice president. She'll be accompanied by her husband, the nation's first “second gentleman,” who plans to break off for separate events in Las Vegas on Monday and New Mexico on Wednesday.Since taking office, Harris has presided over swearing-in ceremonies for members of Biden's Cabinet. She has stood with the president at his speeches, delivered remarks of her own, spoken by telephone with assorted world leaders and made appearances in the Washington area, including at funeral services for Washington power broker Vernon Jordan.Harris also cast three tie-breaking votes in the 50-50 Senate in her role as president of the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-harris-and-others-organise-roadshow-to-promote-relief-plan-s-benefits-101615784964569.html
15-03-2021||World||China's factories, consumers drive recovery into 2021||China's factory and retail sector activity surged in the first two months of the year, beating expectations, as the economy consolidated its brisk recovery from the coronavirus paralysis of early 2020.While the impressive set of numbers released on Monday were heavily skewed by the very low base from last year's massive slump, analysts said they nonetheless showed China's strong rebound remained intact.Industrial output rose 35.1% in the first two months from a year earlier, up from a 7.3% on-year uptick seen in December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, stronger than a median forecast for a 30.0% surge in a Reuters poll of analysts.Retail sales increased 33.8%, also faster than a forecast 32% rise and marking a significant jump from 4.6% growth in December and a 20.5% contraction for January-February of 2020."We have a positive outlook for exports and manufacturing investment this year," said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics and Oxford Economics. "And we expect household consumption to become a key driver of growth from Q2 onwards as confidence improves and the government’s call to reduce travel is toned down."China's ability to contain the coronavirus pandemic before other major economies were able to do so has allowed it to rebound faster.In 2020, it was the only major economy to report positive annual growth, with an expansion of 2.3%.The recovery has been driven by robust trade, pent-up demand and government stimulus.Export growth hit a record pace in February while factory gate prices posted their biggest expansion since November 2018.China’s economic activity is normally distorted in the first two months because of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February in 2021.MODEST EXPECTATIONSDespite the statistical noise in the latest data, other measures show a broad-based recovery with industrial output up 16.9% and retail sales growing 6.4% compared with the first two months of 2019.However, Liu Aihua, an NBS spokeswoman, warned that while positive factors for China's economy are increasing, the foundation for the recovery is not yet solid."Covid-19 is still spreading around the world and global economic conditions are complex and severe; domestically the imbalances of the recovery are still quite obvious," Liu told a briefing in Beijing.The country saw scattered Covid-19 outbreaks re-emerge earlier this year, but brought them under control by early February.Surveyed urban unemployment reversed a steady decline and rose to 5.5% in February from 5.2% in December, indicating increasing pressure on China's job market.While millions of workers normally travel home over the Lunar New Year holiday, many stayed put this year due to Covid-19 fears. That kept factories humming over the period, but it also had some impact on consumer spending.Seasonally adjusted month-on-month data showed retail sales growth actually fell in January-February, likely due to both travel restrictions but also elevated unemployment, analysts at Capital Economics said in a note.Fixed asset investment increased 35% in the first two months from the same period a year earlier, slower than a forecast 40.0% jump. That compared with 2.9% on-year growth in 2020, and a 24.5% plunge in January-February last year.Investment grew 3.5% compared with the first two months of 2019.Private-sector fixed-asset investment, which makes up 60% of total investment, rose 36.4% in January-February, versus a 1.0% increase for the full year of 2020.Beijing this month set a modest annual economic growth target, at above 6%, well below analysts' consensus forecast of more than 8% this year.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last week the focus for growth this year is on consolidating the economic recovery.Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management, said the recovery seen in month-on-month indicators may have already peaked, a sign momentum is slowing.However, he expects infrastructure to receive a boost from still accommodative fiscal policy while exports are likely to maintain growth as the world economy opens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-factories-consumers-drive-recovery-into-2021-101615783931725.html
15-03-2021||World||Ireland, Netherlands halt AstraZeneca Covid-19 jabs as Italy gets set for curbs||Ireland and the Netherlands on Sunday became the latest countries to suspend their rollouts of AstraZeneca jabs over concerns about post-jab blood clots despite the firm insisting there was no risk, as most Italians were bracing for a new round of restrictions.Vaccinations are a key tool to end the worst of a pandemic that has killed more than 2.6 million people since it emerged in China in late 2019.So far more than 350 million doses have been doled out across the world, but countries including Denmark, Norway and Bulgaria suspended the rollout of jabs from the Anglo/Swedish pharma giant this week after reports of blood clots developing in patients who had received the shot.The World Health Organization, Europe's medicines watchdog, governments and experts have stressed that no causal link has been established between the vaccine and blood clotting and insisted that the shot is safe.An AstraZeneca spokesman said it had found no evidence of increased risk of blood clot conditions after analysing reported cases from more than 17 million doses."In fact, the reported numbers of these types of events for COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca are lower than the number that would have occurred naturally in the unvaccinated population," said the spokesman.AstraZeneca's shot is among the cheapest available and forms a bulk of deliveries to poorer nations under the WHO-backed Covax initiative, which aims to ensure vaccines get to all parts of the globe.- 'We must have confidence' -A spokesman for Ireland's health ministry told AFP that the rollout had been "temporarily deferred" after the country's advisory panel recommended a suspension because of concerns raised by Norwegian officials.The Dutch health ministry similarly said it was suspending the rollout as a precaution.Norwegian officials said on Saturday the country had reports of people "bleeding under the skin" and "severe cases of blood clots or brain haemorrhages in younger people" who had received the shot.AstraZeneca became embroiled in a bitter row with European leaders earlier in the year when it announced it would not be able to supply the number of doses it had promised.Since then, European leaders have bitterly criticised the company and cast doubt on the vaccine's efficacy while at the same time blocking some exports of doses to destinations outside the European Union.French Prime Minister Jean Castex, however, defended his country's decision to carry on with the AstraZeneca jab saying on Sunday France had found no reason to suspend the rollout."At this stage, we must have confidence in this vaccine," he said, highlighting instead the danger of leaving large sections of the population unprotected from Covid.France is facing a hospital crisis with intensive care beds in the Paris region running out and patients having to be taken to other parts of the country.- 'Vulnerable family' -While France is hoping to avoid being plunged back into a national lockdown, neighbouring Italy is set to reimpose restrictions across most of the nation on Monday -- a year after it became the first European nation to face a major outbreak.Schools, restaurants, shops and museums will close with Health Minister Roberto Speranza saying he hoped the measures and vaccination programme would allow restrictions to be relaxed in the second half of spring."Each dose of vaccine injected is a step in the direction of the way out of the crisis," he said on Sunday.Across the world, businesses and families are still counting the cost of the lockdowns and other measures that have left millions without jobs -- and forced others to carry on working even if they feel they are lacking protection.Matt Valentin in the US told AFP his job in a Michigan state cafe became an increasingly anxiety-ridden environment."It went from 'get these drinks and orders done as fast as possible' to 'do all of that, and try not to bring a deadly virus home to your vulnerable family,'" the 21-year-old told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-netherlands-halt-astrazeneca-covid-19-jabs-as-italy-gets-set-for-curbs-101615777276417.html
15-03-2021||World||Myanmar: Aung San Suu Kyi to face court, day after 'deadliest' anti-coup unrest||Myanmar's ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi is to appear in court on Monday, after one of the country's bloodiest days since the February 1 coup.At least 38 protesters were killed on Sunday as security forces cracked down on anti-coup protesters, taking the total death toll to more than 120, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group.Protesters demanding the release of Suu Kyi and the restoration of democracy have taken to the streets across Myanmar every day for around six weeks despite the junta's increasingly forceful attempts to quell the dissent.Sunday -- the joint deadliest day of unrest along with March 3 -- saw violent clashes between security forces and protesters and the torching of several Chinese-owned factories in a textile-producing district of Yangon, as many protesters believe Beijing to be supportive of the coup.State-run television confirmed on Monday that a police officer was shot dead in the city of Bago during a protest.The Yangon court hearing for Suu Kyi -- who spent more than 15 years in house arrest under previous military rule -- is expected to start by video link around 10 am (0330 GMT), her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told AFP.The Nobel laureate faces at least four charges: possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies, violating coronavirus restrictions, breaching telecommunications laws and intent to cause public unrest.Military authorities have also accused her of accepting illegal payments of $600,000 in cash as well as a large quantity of gold -- allegations her lawyer says are "groundless"."The ruling junta has showed its teeth and taken its mask off... they are showing their true self," Khin Maung Zaw said of Sunday's violence.Khin Maung Zaw has complained he has not been allowed to meet Suu Kyi, who has been in custody since the coup, though he said the 75-year-old appeared in good health at her last court appearance, by video link, on March 1.Chinese factories attackedThe international community is growing ever more alarmed at the bloodshed, but so far the generals have shown no signs of heeding calls for restraint.The UN's top rights expert on Myanmar Tom Andrews tweeted that he was "heartbroken/outraged" at Sunday's events."Junta leaders don't belong in power, they belong behind bars," he wrote."Their supply of cash & weapons must be cut now. I appeal to UN member states to heed my call to action."On Sunday night state media announced that Yangon's massive Hlaing Tharyar township and the neighbouring Shwepyitha township were being put under martial law.The move came after protesters and security forces clashed violently and five factories -- several of them Chinese-owned -- in Hlaing Tharyar, a garment-producing district, were razed.Security forces opened fire on demonstrators wielding sticks and knives and using cut-out trash cans as shields.Beijing's embassy in Myanmar issued a statement condemning the actions of "destroyers" and urging police to "guarantee the security" of Chinese businesses.The declaration of martial law means anyone arrested in the two townships faces trial by a military tribunal rather than civilian courts, with sentences ranging from three years' hard labour to execution.The UN envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener strongly condemned Sunday's bloodshed, while the former colonial power Britain said it was "appalled" by the use of force "against innocent people."Last week Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on rights in Myanmar, said there was growing evidence that the junta was engaging in crimes against humanity -- including murder, forced disappearances and torture.The human rights campaign group Amnesty International has also accused the military of using battlefield weapons on unarmed protestors and carrying out premeditated killings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-to-face-court-day-after-deadliest-anti-coup-unrest-101615782920193.html
15-03-2021||World||‘Everyone liked it a great deal,’ says Joe Biden on first Quad summit||US President Joe Biden is expectedly pleased with the outcome of the historic first summit-level meeting of the Quad last Friday, one of his most significant foreign policy initiatives since taking office less than two months ago. “It went very well,” Biden told reporters when asked how the Quad summit was. “Everyone seemed to like it a great deal.”Biden and his counterparts - Prime Ministers Narendra Modi of India, Scott Morrison of Australia and Yoshihide Suga of Japan - made history by getting together virtually for the first summit of the four-nation grouping, which they have described as a “flexible group of like-minded partners”.They also announced a major vaccine initiative to battle Covid-19 in Indo-Pacific countries facing acute shortage of vaccines; and set up working groups on coronavirus vaccines, climate and emerging technologies that clearly set up mechanisms for long-term and open-ended engagement. And they signed off on a joint statement and a factsheet.The day after, they lent their bylines to a joint op-ed in The Washington Post portraying their partnership as a “spark of hope”. They explained in detail what they did last Friday and what they intend to do going forward. They assured the rest of the world they are not an exclusive club and that they will “work with all of those who share” their goals, chiefly, a free and open Indo-Pacific.Work began on the summit early February, according to people familiar with its planning and execution, and continued at a frenetic pace since even as their respective nations fought the deadly Covid-19 pandemic at home.“These last few weeks were complete madness, and unending series of meetings and exchange of notes and documents,” said one of those involved.Negotiations and discussion were conducted across three continents and multiple time zones – 7.51am in New Delhi, for instance, is 1.21pm in Canberra, 11.21am in Tokyo and 10.22 pm in Washington, DC.The US had set high a high bar for the summit – and cleared it. A senior Biden administration official who previewed the summit outcomes for reporters singled out the Vaccine Initiative for a glowing mention. He called it “historic deliverable… unprecedented… complex… deeply strategically significant, and… timely”. India will use it vast pharma manufacturing capabilities to produce an estimated 1 billion does of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022-end under the initiative, which will be financed by the US and Japan. Australia will fund the last-mile distribution of the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/everyone-liked-it-a-great-deal-says-joe-biden-on-first-quad-summit-101615780789578.html

In Cheyenne, Wyoming, about 26 inches (65.5 cm) of snow had fallen by noon, the National Weather Service reported, setting a new two-day record for the city."STAY HOME. YOU WILL BE STRANDED!" the agency's Cheyenne office posted on Twitter.In eastern Colorado, wind gusts of 45 miles per hour (72 km per hour) prompted the National Weather Service on Sunday afternoon to issue a blizzard warning for about a 90-mile (145 km) stretch of the state's urban corridor along Interstate 25, from Fort Collins to Castle Rock.The warning extended to the Denver metropolitan area, where about a foot (30 cm) of snow had fallen by midday, with another 8 inches (20 cm) likely before the storm wanes by nightfall, said Frank Cooper, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Boulder, Colorado."The wind has really become an issue," Cooper said.The deteriorating conditions forced Denver International Airport, the nation's fifth-busiest airport, to close all six of its runways, officials said. The airport recorded more than 19 inches (48 cm) of snow by lunchtime.The closure will have minimal impact on airport operations, as more than 2,000 weekend flights were already canceled, including 1,346 on Sunday, officials said.The heavy and wet snow was threatening trees and power lines. More than 57,000 customers were without power in Colorado, according to an outage tracker maintained by utility Xcel Energy.Interstates 70 and 25, Colorado's the main roadways, were shut down as of Sunday afternoon. Interstate 80, which runs east-west across Wyoming, was also closed.The system bringing blizzards to the Rockies was also responsible for severe thunderstorms in Texas, including reports of multiple tornadoes on Saturday in the Texas Panhandle.

Morrison’s net approval rating fell 4 points to +28% as preferred leader, although he remains ahead of opposition leader Anthony Albanese on +1%.Morrison is backing his Attorney-General Christian Porter to remain as Australia’s first law officer after police earlier this month said they couldn’t proceed with an investigation into an allegation the Cabinet minister raped a teenage girl in 1988.The prime minister has resisted calls to hold an inquiry into the matter, magnifying scrutiny about his handling of women’s issues. This initially came under the spotlight last month when former government media adviser Brittany Higgins said she was raped in 2019 by a fellow staffer in a minister’s office.Thousands of women are expected to rally in Australia’s major cities on Monday, including outside Parliament House in Canberra. A march in Perth on Sunday drew about 5,000 people.Parliament will be suspended for 90 minutes from midday so lawmakers are able to attend the march. Several members of the Labor opposition indicated they will attend.One of the organizers for the marches, Janine Hendry, said in an Australian Broadcasting Corp. interview on Monday that Morrison’s office indicated he would not attend, but had offered to meet a delegation in his office.The protesters declined the offer, saying that the prime minister would attend “if he really cared about women, really cared about our voices,” Hendry said.Not attending parliament on Monday will be Porter, who has been on leave to address mental-health issues after denying the charges in a press conference on March 3. Also absent to address health issues will be Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, who has come under pressure from Morrison for not informing him the details of Higgins’ incident when it came to light two years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rape-scandals-hit-australian-pm-morrison-in-polls-as-women-march-on-parliament-101615772431057.html
15-03-2021||World||'Look inside his heart': Pelosi, Biden sidestep calling on Cuomo to resign||US President Joe Biden sidestepped questions Sunday on whether New York Governor Andrew Cuomo should resign over sexual misconduct allegations, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the state leader should "look inside his heart" to decide if he can govern.The pair stopped short of joining a growing list of other politicians, including many fellow Democrats, in demanding Cuomo's resignation.Exiting Marine One Sunday, Biden told a reporter that "the investigation is underway and we should see what it brings us."Eight women have come forward since last month to denounce what they said were inappropriate words and gestures from Cuomo. One former employee said he slipped his hand under her blouse in an incident last year.New York's senior senator, Chuck Schumer, now the majority leader in the US Senate, is among those who have explicitly called for the governor to step down.Cuomo's accusers, most of them women who worked in the state government with him, "must be treated with respect," Pelosi said in carefully worded comments on ABC's "This Week" program earlier Sunday, adding that "they are credible and serious charges."She added: "The governor should look inside his heart -- he loves New York -- to see if he can govern effectively."Cuomo, who at 63 has been governor for the last 10 years, has repeatedly denied acting in any way he considered "inappropriate."He has shrugged off the calls to resign, asking people to wait for the results of several investigations, including one being led by the state's attorney general, Letitia James.Pelosi told ABC she had "zero tolerance for sexual harassment" and said Cuomo's accusers should be listened to.But she said both the women and Cuomo "deserve to hear the results of these investigations," adding that she had confidence in the state's attorney general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/look-inside-his-heart-pelosi-biden-sidestep-calling-on-cuomo-to-resign-101615771271453.html
15-03-2021||World||Anthony Fauci says Donald Trump should urge his followers to get vaccinated||Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday he wishes former President Donald Trump would use his popularity among Republicans to persuade more of his followers to get the Covid-19 vaccine.In a round of interviews on the morning news shows, the government's top infectious disease expert lamented polling showing that Trump supporters are more likely to refuse to get vaccinated, saying politics needs to be separated from “commonsense, no-brainer” public health measures.Fauci said it would be a “game changer” for the country's vaccine efforts if the former president used his “incredible influence” among Republicans.“If he came out and said, Go and get vaccinated. It's really important for your health, the health of your family and the health of the country,' it seems absolutely inevitable that the vast majority of people who are his close followers would listen to him,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday.”There was no immediate comment from the former president's office Sunday.Trump has urged people to get vaccinated, doing so again two weeks ago at a conservative political gathering in Florida.But he hasn't been among former presidents and other public officials who have been vaccinated on camera to encourage others to get the shot. It was revealed only recently that he was vaccinated in private at the White House before leaving office in January.Trump did not appear in a new public service campaign for the COVID-19 vaccine that included former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.Polls have shown Republicans joining Black people and other groups in expressing greater skepticism than others about the safety of the vaccine.Fauci said he doesn't understand the resistance.“What is the problem here? This is a vaccine that is going to be lifesaving for millions of people,” he said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” He added: “I mean, I just can't comprehend what the reason for that is when you have a vaccine that's 94-95% effective and it is very safe. I just don't get it.”The number of vaccine doses distributed and administered each day in the U.S. is rising, with more than 2.5 million daily shots in arms on average in the last week.About 1 in 5 Americans have received at least one dose, with about 1 in 9 fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The coronavirus is blamed for over 530,000 deaths in the United States. Deaths and newly confirmed infections per day have tumbled over the past two months. But cases are running at a still-troubling average of about 55,000 a day.Fauci repeatedly warned against pulling back on public health measures too early, saying the virus could come surging back, endangering the goal of getting the country closer to normal by early July.He pointed to Europe as a cautionary tale. Rising virus cases this winter followed rollbacks on restrictions on the continent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-donald-trump-should-urge-his-followers-to-get-vaccinated-101615768747152.html

15-03-2021||World||Decoding the boom in visual art and NFTs||On March 11, Christie’s auctioned a JPG file for $69 million, catapulting its creator – digital artist Mike Winkelmann, who goes by the name of Beeple, to instant worldwide fame. The auction house said in a tweet that the first purely digital artwork’s auction places Beeple among the top three most valuable living artists.Behind this record is the story of the rise of virtual art, how it is valued and, possibly, the future of fine art collecting. The technology is known as non-fungible token (NFT).What is it? To understand NFTs, it is crucial to look at two concepts separated by the ages — the economic principle of fungibility (which derives its name from medieval Latin ‘fungibilis’) and the modern-day information standard known as blockchain.A fungible is any asset that holds the same value and interchanged with another of its kind – for instance, currency. A piece of art, however, is unique – the original creation will always have a different value than, say, a copy or another piece of art perhaps even by the same creator. Hence, it is non-fungible.The blockchain is a distributed ledger over a vast computer network, storing information, such as transactions, as an open database that is duplicated in a manner that the record becomes immutable. It has several uses (most famously known for currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) due to its virtue of being authentic as well as decentralised.Also Read | After outcry, Israeli museum calls off sale of Islamic artAs useful as it is to make an authentic record of cryptocurrency (a fungible) transactions, the blockchain can also serve as an authentic, digital database of non-fungible assets. And this has been done, since at least 2014, by NFTs.To put it simply, an NFT is the formalisation of digital ownership, in a way that the information is decentralised and distributed, which makes its authenticity undebatable. It is the digital equivalent of establishing the Louvre owns the Mona Lisa, although its copies are ubiquitous around the world and mean little in terms of value.The history NFTs have existed since at least 2014. But they really began to gain popularity in 2017, particularly when people began creating and trading digital cats known as cryptokittens. Some more sought-after kitten avatars would go on to be traded for hundreds or thousands of dollars.Over the past year, a company called NBA Top Shot has been selling officially licensed digital collectibles, similar digital trading cards. The most valuable NFT sold by it yet was in mid-February, when a video of a user paid $208,000 to acquire a clip of a Lebron James slam dunk.The explosion NFTs have been in mainstream news since February. It began with the auction of the Nyan Cat gif – a 12-frame animation of a cat, with a pop-tart for a torso, flying through space leaving what can only be described as a rainbow-colour contrail. The winning bid was $587,000, making it one of the most expensive pieces of digital art sold, on February 19.But that record fell quickly. On February 21, it was shattered by a $6.6 million sale of a 10-second video, which was made by Beeple but owned and then sold by a Miami-based art collecter who originally bought it for $66,666 in October.The explosion is such that according to nonfungibles.com, $204 million worth NFTs have been traded in the last month alone. This is almost half of the $417 mn it has tracked since June 2017.Why the boom now? The year 2021 appears to have brought the inflection point for NFTs even though they existed for years (and went through a largely unnoticed boom in 2017). There are several theories for why this has happened now.Digital culture watchers believe that some of this is linked to the rise of cryptocurrencies (using which NFTs are traded at present), with crypto HNIs not just more willing to acquire more assets, but artists and musicians opening up to the idea as well.Also Read | Lagerfeld’s art, furniture collections to be auctioned in Monaco in autumnThe Covid-19 pandemic dried up traditional sources of incomes, halting exhibitions and concerts. When some musicians (the first success stories are by Grimes and 3LAU earlier this year) began raking in top dollars, others followed. Rock band Kings of Leon, for instance, released their latest album as an NFT in early March, bundling several real-world perks as well, such as front-row tickets for life.The future, or a passing fad? On the face of it, the sudden explosion resembles the rapid build-up that has often been the hallmark of a bubble. Critics have pointed to how social media may be fuelling a speculative frenzy, not unlike what was seen in “meme stocks” mayhem last month. GameStop went from $20 per share in mid-January to over $480 within a month, before coming back down to the 50s, bringing major gains to those who got out on time and leading to heavy losses to that didn’t.But NFTs are also unmatched in their utility in two crucial areas - they allow for exclusivity in a digital era and can monetise new forms of internet-birthed art, such as gifs, memes and even tweets. The March 11 auction by a major auction house will be seen as a significant endorsement, even if it lasts temporarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decoding-the-boom-in-visual-art-and-nfts-101615532138744.html
