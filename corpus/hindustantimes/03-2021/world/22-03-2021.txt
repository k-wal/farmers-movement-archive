22-03-2021||World||Afghan foreign minister on 3-day visit to Delhi for talks on peace process||Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar arrived in New Delhi for a three-day visit on Monday, days ahead of a crucial regional meeting on Afghanistan that is expected to be attended by the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan. Atmar will hold talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and other senior officials during the visit. His discussions are expected to focus on bilateral relations, economic and security cooperation and the Afghan peace process. The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are expected to participate in the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on March 30. However, it is still not clear whether the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers will hold a bilateral meeting in Dushanbe. Heart of Asia, a regional initiative launched by Kabul and Ankara in November 2011, is one of the rare forums focused on Afghanistan that includes both India and Pakistan. The initiative includes 15 countries, including China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Central Asian states such as Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Atmar is visiting India close on the heels of a meeting of the “extended troika” on Afghanistan convened by Russia on March 18, and the trip will provide him an opportunity to exchange notes on recent developments related to the troubled peace process with Jaishankar, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Afghan foreign minister also spoke with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi on March 19 and stressed the need for close cooperation between the two countries for building on the outcomes of peace efforts in Doha and Moscow. Atmar also discussed the upcoming Heart of Asia meeting in Dushanbe, he said in a tweet. A statement issued by the Afghan foreign ministry on Monday said the purpose of Atmar’s visit is to “discuss bilateral relations, strengthen regional and international consensus on the Afghan peace process, and enhance cooperation in security, economic, political and cultural areas”. Atmar will also meet former Indian ambassadors of Afghanistan, students, businessmen, representatives of Afghan Hindus and Afghan refugees living in India, the statement said. The Heart of Asia meeting is also expected to figure in Atmar’s talks with Jaishankar, the people cited above said. The past few weeks have witnessed a flurry of Afghanistan-related developments against the backdrop of a fresh US initiative to find a political settlement in the war-torn country. These developments followed US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s letter to President Ashraf Ghani, outlining the next steps in the peace process and a draft “peace agreement”, which were first accessed by Afghanistan’s Tolo News channel. The US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke to Jaishankar on phone on March 7 and visited Islamabad the following day. Khalilzad also attended the “extended troika” meeting in Moscow on March 18 that was joined by officials from the US, Russia and China – the members of the troika – and officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan, members of the Afghan High Council for National Reconciliation, leading Afghan politicians and representatives of the Taliban. A joint statement issued after the Moscow meeting ruled out the restoration of the Taliban’s “Islamic Emirate” and called on the militant group not to launch a spring offensive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-foreign-minister-on-3-day-visit-to-delhi-for-talks-on-peace-process-101616432751557.html
22-03-2021||World||Germany's Curevac to include virus variants in vaccine trials||German group Curevac said Monday it will broaden its mRNA Covid vaccine trials to include new virus variants as it aims to file for EU approval in the second quarter.The decision was taken because of the "rapid distribution of new variants" in European and Latin American countries where phase three trials have been in progress since late 2020, according to a statement.The aim is to "determine efficacy of the vaccine candidate for select variants", the company said."Our goal is to offer the public and especially the vulnerable older age groups the best possible protection," said Ulrike Gnad-Vogt, interim chief development officer for Curevac.The company is discussing the expansion of trials with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is already evaluating the vaccine, it said.Curevac also reaffirmed its intention "to file for formal marketing authorisation within the second quarter", or from April through June.Curevac said earlier this month it has signed a deal with Novartis for the Swiss pharmaceutical giant to help in its production of its vaccine.The Swiss giant will make up to 50 million doses of the mRNA vaccine by the end of 2021 and up to 200 million doses in 2022.Curevac also has a separate agreement with German chemicals giant Bayer to make the vaccine from 2022.The European Commission has signed a contract for up to 405 million doses of the mRNA vaccine.The EU has approved four vaccines so far: mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson's so-called viral vector vaccines.It started a rolling review of the Curevac jab in February and is also examining Novavax's protein-based vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-curevac-to-include-virus-variants-in-vaccine-trials-101616428501847.html
22-03-2021||World||EU imposes sanctions on 4 Chinese officials over abuses against Uyghurs||The European Union imposed Monday sanctions on four Chinese officials accused of responsibility for abuses against Uyghur Muslims, part of a raft of measures targeting alleged human rights offenders around the world and provoking retaliation from Beijing. The four are senior officials in the northwest region of Xinjiang.The sanctions involve a freeze on the officials' assets and a ban on them travelling in the bloc. European citizens and companies are not permitted to provide them with financial assistance.China at first denied the existence of camps for detaining Uyghurs in Xinjiang but has since described them as centres to provide job training and to reeducate those exposed to radical jihadi thinking. Officials deny all charges of human rights abuses there.Xinjiang had been a hotbed of anti-government violence, but Beijing claims its massive security crackdown brought peace in recent years.China’s Foreign Ministry responded immediately, denouncing the sanctions as “based on nothing but lies and disinformation” and issuing its own retaliatory measures.The ministry announced sanctions against 10 individuals and four institutions that it said had damaged China’s interests and “maliciously spread lies and disinformation.” They and their family members would be barred from entering mainland China, Hong Kong or Macao and cut off from financial dealings with those areas, the ministry said.Among those targeted was Adrian Zenz, a U.S.-based German scholar who has publicized abuses against minority groups in China’s western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China has said companies and individuals have petitioned to sue Zenz, but it wasn’t clear who the plaintiffs were or how they would pursue legal action across borders.Others targeted for sanctions include five members of the European Parliament: Reinhard Butikofer, Michael Gahler, Raphael Glucksmann, Ilhan Kyuchyuk and Miriam Lexmann.The ministry did not say what specific measures would be taken against the organizations. They were listed as the Political and Security Committee of the Council of the European Union, where the 27 national envoys decide foreign and security policy; the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights; the German-based Mercator Institute for China Studies; and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation in Denmark.Last week, China’s ambassador to the EU, Zhang Ming, had warned that Beijing would retaliate.“We want dialogue, not confrontation. We ask the EU side to think twice. If some insist on confrontation, we will not back down, as we have no options other than fulfilling our responsibilities to the people in our country,” he said.The new EU sanction system is similar to the Magnitsky Act — Obama-era legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction those it sees as human rights offenders, freeze their assets and ban them from entering the United States.EU foreign ministers, as part of Monday's move, also imposed sanctions over repression in North Korea, “extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in Libya, torture and repression against LGBTI people and political opponents in Chechnya in Russia, and torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings in South Sudan and Eritrea," a statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-imposes-sanctions-on-4-chinese-officials-over-abuses-against-uyghurs-101616425869638.html
22-03-2021||World||Russian president Vladimir Putin to get Covid-19 vaccine shot tomorrow||President Vladimir Putin said he will get a coronavirus vaccine shot on Tuesday, several months after widespread vaccination was started in Russia.Kremlin opponents have criticized Putin for not getting vaccinated amid a comparatively slow rollout of the shot in Russia, arguing that his reluctance is fueling the already extensive hesitance about the vaccine. Russia, where only 4.3% of the 146-million population have received at least one dose, lags behind a number of countries in terms of the vaccination rate.Putin told a meeting with government officials on Monday that he will get his shot “tomorrow,” without specifying which coronavirus vaccine out of the three approved for use in Russia he will take. According to the Russian president, 6.3 million people in Russia have already received at least one shot, and more than 4.3 million have had two doses.“Today we can confidently say ... that the Russian vaccines are absolutely reliable and safe,” Putin said. “It is an absolute success of our scientists and specialists.”Despite scepticism about Russia’s hasty introduction of the vaccine, which was rolled out before it had completed late-stage trials, the vaccine appears to be safe and effective. According to a study published in the Lancet, Sputnik V is 91% effective and appears to prevent inoculated individuals from becoming severely ill with COVID-19, although it’s still unclear if the vaccine can prevent the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-vladimir-putin-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-shot-tomorrow-101616421375310.html

He said at least four units of firefighters were struggling to control the blaze due to its rapid spread.Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, said in an email that fire services, rescue and response teams and volunteers were at the scene.“So far the fire has affected shelters, health centres, distribution points and other facilities. Volunteers are supporting those affected,” she said.No casualties were immediately reported, but deaths and injuries were feared. No details on the missing could be confirmed. Two Rohingya refugees told The Associated Press at the scene that the fire had spread very quickly and continued to rage into the night Monday.Several videos posted on social media showed clouds of smoke billowing from the camp.Bangladesh has sheltered more than a million Rohingya Muslims, the vast majority having fled Myanmar in 2017 in a major crackdown by Myanmar's military. The U.N. has said the crackdown had a genocidal intent, a charge Myanmar rejects.Bangladesh has hosted the refugees in crowded refugee camps and is eager to begin sending them back to Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Several attempts at repatriation under a joint agreement failed because the Rohingya refused to go, fearing more violence in a country that denies them basic rights including citizenship.In January, another fire destroyed hundreds of shanty-like homes in the camp, leaving thousands without shelter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-guts-rohingya-refugee-camp-in-bangladesh-hundreds-of-shelters-destroyed-101616420850433.html

22-03-2021||World||Saudi oil giant Aramco reports 30% drop in payments to state||Saudi Arabia’s state-backed oil giant Aramco paid the Saudi government 30% less in taxes in 2020, the company reported Monday, as the region’s largest economy grapples with the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices.Saudi Arabian Oil Co, the kingdom’s largest taxpayer, transferred $110 billion to the government in 2020, down from nearly $159 billion the year before. The kingdom's 2021 budget plans to spend $263 billion, showing the significance of Aramco's payments to state coffers.The state-controlled company’s public figures offer key insight into the financial health of the kingdom, which relies on the energy sector for 80% of its exports and two-thirds of its financial revenues. That's despite Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious efforts to diversify the economy away from oil.The firm stuck to its promise to pay out $75 billion in dividends for the year. Still, the decline came as its royalties and income taxes more than halved. Nearly all of the dividend money goes to the Saudi government, which owns more than 98% of the company.Aramco announced on Sunday that its profits fell some 44% in 2020 to $49 billion, amid turmoil in global energy markets unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic. As virus-induced lockdowns slashed oil demand, the price of international benchmark Brent crude plummeted to all-time lows in April of last year.Despite Aramco’s steep losses, the company managed to keep its dividend pledge to shareholders by taking on a ballooning amount of debt. Aramco’s net debt to equity ratio more than doubled — to 55% in 2020 from 26% in 2019.The Saudi-based asset management firm Jadwa Investment reported that the kingdom’s fiscal deficit hit $79 billion in 2020, or 12% of gross domestic product, far surpassing previous estimates. The budget deficit has widened each year since oil prices dropped in 2014, prompting the government to borrow heavily and accelerate its shift away from oil largess. The kingdom has cut back some subsidies, tripled the value-added tax to 15% and accelerated its search for non-oil revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-reports-30-drop-in-payments-to-state-101616414396020.html

Police said the number of arrests would likely increase in coming days as officers study closed circuit television footage.The violence, which also saw several police vehicles damaged, was branded as “unacceptable” by Britain's interior minister, Priti Patel.“Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,” she said.What started as a peaceful demonstration of around 3,000 people on College Green in the heart of the city in western England turned violent after hundreds of protesters descended on the New Bridewell police station.Many demonstrators donned face masks and carried placards criticizing the legislation, such as “Say no to U.K. police state” and “Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy.”The protesters were ostensibly venting their anger at the government’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is currently going through parliament. Under the terms of the legislation, which covers England and Wales, police will be handed new powers to tackle demonstrations.Sue Mountstevens, police and crime commissioner for the Avon and Somerset region, said seven people have been arrested but that there would be “many more” detained.“It’s disgraceful and outrageous," she said. “Police officers went to work yesterday and some have returned home via hospital battered and bruised.”Protesters attempted to smash the windows of the glass-fronted police station and damaged 12 vehicles, including two that were set on fire.Andy Marsh, chief constable of Avon and Somerset Police, said 12 police vehicles were damaged and “significant damage” was caused to the New Bridewell police station.“Officers were pelted with stones and missiles and fireworks and it was a terrifying situation for them to deal with," he said.“I believe the events of yesterday were hijacked by extremists, people who were determined to commit criminal damage, to generate very negative sentiment about policing and to assault our brave officers," he added.Two of the police officers injured were treated in hospital after suffering broken ribs and an arm. Both have since been discharged.Bristol mayor Marvin Rees, who said he had “major concerns” about the bill, condemned the violence and said the unrest would be used to justify the legislation.One of the reasons why the British government has pushed through new legislation on the police's powers over protests relates to last summer's anti-racism protests, including the toppling of a statue of slave trader, Edward Colston, in Bristol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-in-english-city-of-bristol-leave-20-police-injured-101616413452347.html

The Kremlin has denied any role in his illness and said it has seen no proof he was poisoned.After recovering in Germany and returning to Russia, Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed last month for around two and a half years over parole violations he called trumped up.His allies had asked Russian law enforcement authorities to open criminal cases into his poisoning and had filed a legal complaint against what they said was the authorities' unacceptable inaction.But a Moscow military court on Monday rejected their appeal, Vyacheslav Gimadi, the head of the legal department at Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on Twitter as did the Navalny Team's official Twitter account.The court ruled that state investigators' refusal to look into the matter formally, a decision they said was justified by what they said was a lack of evidence that a crime had taken place, was lawful, Russian news agencies reported.Navalny's team said it planned to appeal the ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-uphold-decision-not-to-investigate-navalny-s-poisoning-lawyer-101616411736470.html
22-03-2021||World||Merkel seeks longer, tighter lockdown in German pandemic setback||Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed extending and tightening Germany’s lockdown after Covid-19 contagion rates nearly doubled in a month, highlighting Europe’s struggles to contain the pandemic.The plan would prolong current curbs through April 18 and calls for new measures in hard-hit areas, according to a chancellery draft seen by Bloomberg. Merkel and regional leaders will discuss the proposals on Monday as infections reach levels that would trigger more stringent measures on Europe’s biggest economy.Just weeks after the chancellor laid out a plan to gradually reopen shops and restaurants, the move would be a blow to pandemic-weary Germans, who opinion polls suggest have become increasingly disgruntled with the government’s handling of the crisis.Amid sputtering vaccination programs across Europe, lockdowns have been reimposed in Italy and France in the past week. In Austria, the government will meet on Monday with health officials and opposition parties as rising infection rates force it to reconsider plans to ease curbs on parts of the economy.Europe’s sluggish pace of immunizations has sparked a spat with the U.K. over possibly blocking vaccine exports. The effort was further complicated last week after Germany and other countries temporarily suspended using AstraZeneca Plc’s shot over blood-clotting concerns.The European Union has administered doses covering 6.4% of the population, less than a third of what the UK has managed, according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.With Easter holidays starting at the end of March, Merkel’s chancellery is proposing mandatory quarantines and Covid tests for travelers returning to Germany, while allowing family visits within the country. A number of proposals haven’t yet been agreed on, indicating tense discussions will be needed to reach a deal.For hard-hit areas in Germany, other possible curbs include nightly curfews until 5 a.m. and closures of schools and child care if teachers and pupils can’t get tested twice a week.Cases in Germany are rising again after authorities began to relax restrictions in late February and set out a plan to gradually unwind the remaining curbs -- including the partial closing of non-essential stores and the shutdown of hotels, restaurants and gyms, as well as cultural venues.That plan was dependent on the infection trend, but after the recent jump in cases, officials want to stop further easing measures and roll back some of the previous opening steps.Revelations that members of Merkel’s conservative bloc profited from the pandemic threatens to hamper implementation of the virus strategy. Questions have also been raised in the media about Health Minister Jens Spahn’s links to face-mask deals, dealing another to blow public trust.The Robert Koch Institute health agency reported on Monday that the national seven-day rate of infections per 100,000 people rose to 107.3. After dropping to 56.8 on Feb. 19, the figure exceeded the so-called “emergency brake” level of 100 for the second straight day. The provision allows authorities to tighten lockdown measures, and the threshold has been crossed in ten out of 16 states.The resurgent pandemic has prompted some health experts to warn that intensive care units risk being overwhelmed within a few weeks if the exponential growth in cases continues. On Monday, the number of Covid-19 patients in German ICUs rose to 3,117, the highest in more than a month.“We expect a drastic increase in the number of patients in the next few weeks,” said Gernot Marx, president of the German organization for intensive and emergency care.Regional leaders and members of Merkel’s cabinet disagree on what to allow for the upcoming Easter holidays. The premiers of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony want to allow citizens to go on holiday within their own states, while Finance Minister Olaf Scholz warned against a “big wave of travel” that will jeopardize the summer holidays.“Many people are really corona weary, and we have to take that into account in our decisions,” Stephan Weil, premier of Lower Saxony, said in an interview with ZDF television on Monday. Public acceptance of the restrictions is “a very serious problem because we’re dealing with a really powerful wave while people are feeling demoralized.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-seeks-longer-tighter-lockdown-in-german-pandemic-setback-101616409897220.html

EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting this week to discuss a ban on Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine exports to the UK as it tries to secure its own supplies of the vaccine for EU citizens.The European Commission president says the EU can "forbid" vaccines made on the continent from being sent to the UK. Meanwhile, Johnson is expected to put up a resistance to the EU's proposed move, the BBC reported. The latest row appears to revolve around doses of the Oxford University vaccine made in a Dutch factory.The UK is pushing for "strictly controlling" the risk of travellers importing new variants of the deadly virus into the country. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said yesterday that a spike in coronavirus cases in neighbouring European countries could put gains from the vaccination programme at risk.The country is also warning citizens against booking summer holidays abroad at the moment, PTI reported. The EU has encountered production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, which is being related to timings of when contracts were signed for these deliveries.It comes into sharp focus as much-anticipated results from a US trial of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs involving more than 32,000 volunteers revealed that the vaccine is “safe and highly effective”.Several European leaders paused the rollout of the vaccine amid concerns of a possible link with blood clots, which is since being lifted as UK and EU regulators had said there was no evidence the vaccine causes blood clots.On Sunday, the UK recorded another 5,312 coronavirus cases, taking the total tally to 4,296,583. Also, 33 deaths were reported, taking the UK's total to 126,155.Also, more than 27.6 million people in the UK - more than half the adult population - have now received at least one dose of a vaccine.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-call-on-eu-make-a-case-for-not-banning-covid-19-vaccine-export-101616405703292.html

Defendants Tang Kai-yin and Quinn Moon, who were sentenced to three and two years, respectively, remain in Shenzhen.Two minors who were among the 12 pleaded guilty to illegally crossing the border and were returned to Hong Kong in December.During the detention of the 12 in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, mainland authorities denied their families and lawyers access, insisting they be represented by officially appointed lawyers, provoking criticism from rights groups.Pro-democracy activists began fleeing Hong Kong for democratic Taiwan from the early months of the protests in 2019, most of them legally by air, but some by boat, activists in Taipei have told Reuters.Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly.Democracy activists complain that Communist Party rulers in Beijing are whittling away at those freedoms, a charge China rejects.Since Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, scores of democracy campaigners have been arrested, some elected legislators have been disqualified and others have fled overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-hong-kong-democracy-activists-set-to-return-from-china-after-jail-terms-101616403252670.html

22-03-2021||World||Malaysia sets up compensation fund for Covid-19 vaccinations||Malaysia on Monday announced it had established a $2.4 million compensation fund to provide cash assistance for any Covid-19 vaccine recipients who suffer severe reactions due to inoculations.The Southeast Asian country has inoculated nearly 430,000 frontline workers, with the majority having received the first of two jabs of the vaccine jointly developed by U.S. company Pfizer and German partner BioNTech.Under the new fund, individuals requiring extended hospitalisation due to a vaccine reaction will be eligible for 50,000 ringgit ($12,171), or if this results in permanent disability or death 500,000 ringgit, Health Minister Adham Baba said.Adham said health authorities had recorded 20 instances of adverse reactions to vaccination as of March 18, with symptoms ranging from itching to shortness of breath and palpitations."There have not been any deaths linked to the vaccine," Adham told a news conference, without specifying the type of vaccine he was referring to.Malaysia's vaccination drive began on Feb. 23 using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with authorities only starting to administer the vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech on March 18.Malaysia will also scrap a plan to reserve a second shot of the Pfizer vaccine for those who had already received their first dose, in a bid to speed up its vaccination drive.Malaysia has reported just over 330,000 coronavirus cases and 1,233 deaths after keeping infection rates relatively low for much of last year until a spike of infections from October that peaked in early February.Science Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the government is confident that Pfizer will be able to provide the 32 million doses secured by Malaysia.Last week, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the government will almost double its COVID-19 immunisation budget to 5 billion ringgit to speed up its target of vaccinating 80% of its 32 million population by December, instead of February 2022.

22-03-2021||World||New Zealand searches for fix as housing prices soar||New Zealand is set to unveil measures on Tuesday to counter a rampant rise in property prices that has pushed younger and lower income buyers out of the market, and poses a major challenge for the government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.The country's success in combating the coronavirus has made it a safe haven for returning Kiwis and investors, who have parked their funds in real estate, pushing house prices up 23% in just 12 months, far ahead of wage growth.Billions of dollars in government stimulus and historically low interest rates have further inflamed the market, while housing affordability has fallen back to its equal lowest in nearly 20 years, making it the least affordable amongst the 36 wealthy Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations.Finance Minister Grant Robertson has said publicly that he is looking at moves to restrict loans to investors and dampen potential returns, while supporting other types of investments, but analysts warn there is no easy fix."The finance minister will need to throw the entire kitchen sink at this problem," said Brad Olsen, senior economist at Wellington-based economic consultancy firm Infometrics."The conversation happening in Kiwi households during summer was not COVID-19, but housing. So he doesn't need a silver bullet ... he needs to fire every damn bullet at it."House prices have doubled over the last decade and successive governments in the country of 5 million have struggled for years to find solutions.Almost 1% of New Zealand’s population is ranked as homeless or "severely housing deprived", the highest rate amongst OECD nations, and almost twice that of neighbouring Australia.While Ardern's government was easily returned to power last year after virtually eliminating COVID-19 domestically and a string of domestic successes, the scrapping in 2019 of its flagship KiwiBuild project to build 100,000 affordable homes was a notable failure.HOUSING DIVIDEArdern said on Monday the government will outline a suite of urgent and longer term measures to tip the balance in favour of first home buyers and improve housing supply."It is, I believe, a plan that will start to make a difference in this complex problem," she said.Mooted changes include restrictions on high debt-to-income and interest-only mortgage lending to investors, along with extending the holding time of investment properties from 5 years to 10 to win tax offsets and lowering tax rates on investments outside of housing.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has already tightened mortgage lending rules, and has been asked to consider housing while setting policies.These demand side measures will have some impact, but don't address the central problem - a clear lack of affordable homes, said Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr."I'm worried the focus will be too much on the demand side ... I don't believe speculation is the problem, but it's an easy one to focus on," said Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr."The issue we have here is a chronic housing shortages and anything government can do to boost supply of dwellings will go a long way in solving this crisis," he said.Another headache for the government is upsetting investors and home owners who are sitting on tidy profits from the housing boom."Housing is the most divisive issue at the moment," said Infometrics' Olsen."While there's an understanding that prices need to go down, there are also a lot of Kiwis who don't want their investments to go into the red."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-searches-for-fix-as-housing-prices-soar-101616386399936.html

The results of the trial also showed that no safety concerns were found regarding the development of blood clots after receiving the vaccine. The results come amid rising concerns over numerous blood clot events reported in many European Union countries for the past two weeks. AstraZeneca, the British-Swedish pharmaceuticals company, also issued a statement after the reports of blood clots, saying that a review of 17 million people who were administered its Covid-19 vaccine suggested that it was entirely safe for use.Read more: Explained: Why have some countries suspended use of AstraZeneca vaccine?Here are the key things we know about the trial:1. The trial in the United States was run by experts at Columbia University and University of Rochester in collaboration with AstraZeneca in which 32,449 people participated, accruing 141 symptomatic cases of Covid-19. Approximately 60 per cent of the participants had comorbidities that are associated with an increased risk for progression of severe Covid-19 infection.2. The randomisation ratio of vaccine to placebo in the trial was 2:1 and the vaccine was given to the participants in two doses which were done four weeks apart.Read more: WHO panel gives nod to AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, has 'tremendous potential'3. Around a fifth of the volunteers who participated in the trial were over 65 years and in this group, the vaccine was found to be 80 per cent effective.4. The trial found that there was 100 per cent efficacy against severe or critical disease and hospitalisation in the participants.5. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) identified no safety concerns with regards to events of blood clotting/ thrombosis in the trial among 21,583 participants who received at least one dose of vaccine.Read more: Covid-19: Oxford study hint AstraZeneca vaccine effective against Brazil variant6. The vaccine was found to be as effective in the younger age group as it was in the older which implied that the comparable efficacy result of the vaccine across age was 80 per cent.7. The comparable efficacy result was also similar across ethnicity.8. Evidence showed that the administration of the second dose when done with an interval longer than four weeks could increase the efficacy of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-found-79-effective-in-us-trials-key-points-101616405337903.html
22-03-2021||World||Taiwan loses two fighter jets in apparent collision||Two Taiwanese fighter jets crashed on Monday in the third such incident in the past half year, at a time when the Beijing-claimed island's armed forced are under increasing pressure to intercept Chinese aircraft on an almost daily basis.While Taiwan's air force is well trained and well equipped, mostly with US-made equipment, it is dwarfed by China's. Beijing views the democratic island as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control.Taiwan's National Rescue Command Centre said two air force F-5E fighters, each with one pilot aboard, crashed into the sea off the island's southeastern coast after they apparently collided in mid-air during a training mission.An air force helicopter, coast guard and other rescue ships have been scrambled to look for the pilots, it added.Taiwan's Defence Ministry said it was working on a statement, and provided no other immediate comment. The official Central News Agency said the air force had now grounded the F-5 fleet that operates from the Chihhang air base, where the aircraft are based.The US-built F-5 fighters first entered service in Taiwan in the late 1970s and have been mostly been retired from front-line activities, though some are still used for training and as a back-up for the main fleet.Another F-5 crashed in October, killing the pilot. The following month a much more modern F-16 crashed off Taiwan's east coast, whose pilot also died.In January of last year, Taiwan's top military official was among eight people killed after a helicopter carrying them to visit soldiers crashed in a mountainous area near the capital Taipei.The incidents have raised concern about both training and maintenance, but also the pressure the air force is under to respond to repeated Chinese flights near the island.Taiwan's Defence Ministry has warned Chinese aircraft, including drones, are flying repeatedly in Taiwan's air defence identification zone, seeking to wear out Taiwan's air force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-loses-two-fighter-jets-in-apparent-collision-101616406607229.html
22-03-2021||World||Taiwan kicks off Covid-19 vaccination drive with AstraZeneca shot||Health care workers received the first shots in Taiwan's Covid-19 vaccination drive Monday, beginning a campaign that won't use supplies from China amid uneven distribution of the vaccines globally.Taiwan has on hand 117,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which it is distributing to healthcare workers across 57 hospitals.Taiwanese premier Su Tseng-chang launched the drive by receiving the first shot at National Taiwan University Hospital in the capital Taipei. “After 30 minutes of rest, there's no signs of any discomfort,” he said.The rest period is for monitoring recipients for any adverse reactions.Last week, more than a dozen nations suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a few dozen people among the millions who've received the vaccine developed blood clots. The European Union’s drug regulatory agency concluded after a review it couldn't rule out a direct link but the benefits of using the vaccine outweigh the possible risks.Taiwan has signed contracts securing 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, 5.05 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, and 4.76 million doses of vaccines through COVAX.Currently, Taiwan has recorded 1,006 confirmed cases of COVID-19, most of those from visitors coming from abroad. It has been one of the most successful places in the world in the battle against the pandemic, owing to strict public health and border control measures.The island is planning to administer its full initial supply to 117,000 individuals to ensure the broadest protection. The first dose provides an efficacy rate of 71% and the second dose — meant to be given eight weeks later — boosts its effectiveness to 81%, authorities have said previously.Taiwan has yet to announce a vaccination campaign for the public.Countries around the world are scrambling for vaccines, which have been distributed unevenly with rich countries buying up a majority of the doses. China has stepped in to offer hundreds of millions of doses of its own vaccines across the developing world, but Taiwan has refrained from buying them.Taiwanese law bans import of Chinese vaccines made for human use. The island's health minister had said in February there were no considerations to amending the law and no experts have made a special recommendation for Chinese vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-kicks-off-covid-19-vaccination-drive-with-astrazeneca-shot-101616390284110.html

22-03-2021||World||Netanyahu says he made Israel a 'vaccination nation'. But will it vote for him?||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed victory over Covid-19 by making Israel a "vaccination nation". Even that may not be enough when voters wearing mandatory masks cast their ballots in an election on Tuesday.Netanyahu, who turned Israel's world-leading rollout of vaccines into a showcase of his campaign in the country's fourth national poll in two years, gave a measured assessment of his chances after the latest opinion polls pointed to a close race."I'm still missing a (parliamentary) seat or two to achieve a stable government," he said on Army Radio on Sunday, in what could have been a strategic bid to rally supporters of his right-wing Likud party to turn out to vote.Opinion polls showed an uptick for Likud in the campaign's home stretch, giving a Netanyahu-led coalition of conservative and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties around 60 seats, still short of a majority in the 120-member parliament.But the surveys indicated that a potential, though perhaps unlikely alliance of left-wing, centre and rightist factions, possibly led by Netanyahu's strongest rival in the polls - centrist Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party - is also near 60.No one party has ever won a parliamentary majority on its own in an Israeli election. In a close contest, election night results may only be a starting point, with backroom coalition talks determining whether "King Bibi" will still rule.Gone this time were Netanyahu's giant billboards featuring a handshake with ally Donald Trump, defeated in the U.S. presidential election in November.And with Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, there was little prospect of U.S. diplomatic moves that could help Netanyahu's election chances.Israel's longest-serving leader, 71, focused instead on highlighting his role in turning high-tech Israel into what he dubbed a "vaccination nation".About half of the population has been inoculated at a pace that drew international praise for Netanyahu but also calls for Israel to do more to ensure Palestinians in territories it occupies receive vaccines."We are the world champions in handling the coronavirus ... I have brought millions of vaccine doses and will bring millions more," Netanyahu said on the stump, pacing the stage in multiple campaign rallies each day and in a slew of media interviews as election day neared.Political opponents say he mishandled the pandemic from the start, pointing to the need for three national lockdowns and accusing him of turning a blind eye to violators within the ultra-Orthodox community that provides a power base for his key coalition partners.'Obsession'For Netanyahu, public praise from Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, Israel's main vaccine supplier, was campaign gold. The prime minister, Bourla told Israel's Channel 12 TV, phoned him 30 times to secure a supply deal - even at 3 a.m."Just like I was obsessive about the vaccines, I'll be obsessive about our economy," Netanyahu said on Army Radio, promising more cash stipends for all Israelis and ailing businesses.But after three inconclusive elections, voters have had plenty of time to make up their minds about Netanyahu, in a ballot being held almost a quarter of a century to the day after he won his first term as prime minister.Despite corruption charges he denies, weekly street protests over his alleged graft, a trial scheduled to gain speed after the ballot and elections in April and September 2019 and last March, Netanyahu has managed to stay at Israel's helm.This time, much could depend on potential kingmaker Naftali Bennett, who heads the ultranationalist Yamina party and once served as Netanyahu's defence minister.Without Bennett's backing, neither a Netanyahu-led coalition nor an anti-Bibi alliance would have enough seats in parliament for a governing majority, polls showed.And Arab voters might also tip the balance, six years after Netanyahu, drawing allegations of racism, said on election day that they were "heading to the polling stations in droves" to wreck his chances for a right-wing government.Now, he peers down from Arabic-language Likud billboards and has campaigned in several Arab towns. Looking at their country's messy political mix, many Israelis simply wonder whether a fifth election is on the cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-says-he-made-israel-a-vaccination-nation-but-will-it-vote-for-him-101616403599424.html

Myanmar we are going to take sanctions against 11 persons involved in the coup and the repression of the demonstrators," Borrell said, adding the situation in the country was deteriorating.Reuters reported on March 8 that the EU was preparing the measures. The names of the individuals are expected to be made public once the sanctions are formally decided by ministers.Stronger measures are expected soon as the bloc moves to target the businesses run by the military.EU diplomats have told Reuters that parts of the military's conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), are likely to be targeted, barring EU investors and banks from doing business with them.The conglomerates are spread throughout the economy from mining and manufacturing to food and beverages to hotels, telecoms and banking. They rank among the country's biggest taxpayers and sought partnerships with foreign companies as Myanmar opened up during its democratic liberalization.A U fact-finding mission in 2019 recommended sanctions against the two companies and their subsidiaries, saying they gave the army extra sources of revenue that could finance human rights violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-sanction-11-people-involved-in-myanmar-coup-foreign-policy-chief-says-101616402861933.html

Phase two is expected to begin in July, with results by year-end.The Thai vaccine candidate modifies the avian Newcastle Disease virus with a Covid-19 spike protein and is replicated using egg-based technology, the GPO said.Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the vaccine would give Thailand more options with less constraints."Even though we can produce vaccines in the country, it is from technology transfer and under management of brands," he told the news conference."But today, if we are successful we can set our own direction."Another homegrown vaccine is being developed by Chulalongkorn University and uses Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. It is expected to start human trials soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thaideveloped-covid-19-vaccine-starts-human-trials-101616400787384.html
22-03-2021||World||Journalist freed in Myanmar as anti-coup protests continue||A BBC journalist held in Myanmar has been freed, the broadcaster said on Monday, as demonstrators took to the streets for fresh anti-coup protests against the military.Myanmar's junta has unleashed deadly violence on protesters who have risen against the military's ousting of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month.More than 2,600 people have been arrested and 250 killed, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a local monitoring group that has warned fatalities could be even higher.Aung Thura, a journalist with the BBC's Burmese service, was detained by men in plain clothes while reporting outside a court in the capital Naypyidaw on Friday.The broadcaster confirmed on Monday in a news story on its website that he had been freed but gave no further details.Scores of people, including teachers, marched on Monday through the pre-dawn streets of Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, some carrying placards calling for UN intervention in the crisis.Mandalay has seen some of the worst violence of the crackdown and recorded eight more deaths on Sunday, a medical source told AFP, adding that as many as 50 people were injured.Machine guns rang out late into the night across the city of 1.7 million."People were really scared and felt insecure the whole night," a doctor told AFP by phone.To protest the brutality of the crackdown, a group of doctors in Mandalay staged a "placard only" demonstration by lining up signs in the street, Voice of Myanmar reported.A group of monks staged a similar "monkless" protest.There were also early morning protests in parts of Yangon, the commercial capital and largest city, where drivers honked their horns in support of the anti-coup movement.Residents in Yangon's Hlaing township released hundreds of red helium balloons with posters calling for a UN intervention to stop atrocities, according to local media.One man was also killed during daytime clashes with security forces in the central city of Monywa Sunday and hundreds turned out to protest a day later, local media reported.- EU sanctions -International concern has been growing over the junta's brutal approach as the death toll climbs, with a senior UN expert warning the military is likely committing "crimes against humanity".But so far the generals have shown little sign of heeding calls for restraint as they struggle to quell the unrest.In a fresh bid to step up pressure, the European Union is expected on Monday to hit 11 junta cadres with sanctions -- in the form of travel bans and asset freezes.The United States and Britain have already taken similar steps.Myanmar's regional neighbours have also weighed in, with Indonesia and Malaysia calling for an emergency summit of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations to discuss the crisis.Following the call, Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan embarked on a whistle-stop diplomatic tour including meetings in Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia.On the commercial front, French energy giant EDF announced that a $1.5-billion hydropower dam project in Myanmar had been suspended in response to the coup.Australia and Canada have confirmed they are providing consular assistance to two business consultants detained in Myanmar.It is understood that Matthew O'Kane and Christa Avery, a dual Canadian-Australian citizen, are under house arrest after trying to leave the country on a relief flight Friday.The couple run a consultancy business in Yangon.The Canadian and Australian foreign ministries have refused to comment further on the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalist-freed-in-myanmar-as-anti-coup-protests-continue-101616403253184.html

22-03-2021||World||Two Americans accused of aiding Ghosn escape indicted in Japan||Two Americans accused of helping former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn jump bail and escape from Japan were indicted on Monday and face up to three years in prison.The father-son pair arrived in Japan earlier this month from the United States after losing their battle to avoid extradition.Both Michael Taylor and his son Peter face a single charge of helping a criminal escape.The pair, along with a third man still at large, is believed to have masterminded the operation that saw former international jet-setter Ghosn packed into an audio-equipment case and onto a private jet to jump bail in December 2019.Ghosn is now beyond the reach of Japanese justice in Lebanon, which does not have an extradition treaty with Tokyo.But the Taylors were arrested in the US last year after Japan issued a warrant for them.They sought to block Tokyo's extradition request by claiming they would face torture-like conditions while in custody in Japan, but the US Supreme Court struck down their appeal in February.'Brazen and well-orchestrated escape'Ghosn was a global business superstar and head of an auto alliance joining Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors before his career came crashing to an abrupt end in November 2018, when Tokyo investigators stormed his private jet to arrest him.The French-Lebanese-Brazilian national was eventually charged with four counts of financial misconduct over claims he hid compensation and misused Nissan funds.Having spent months in detention, Ghosn was out on bail awaiting trial on the charges -- which he denies -- when he fled the country in what Japanese prosecutors termed "one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history".Having spent months in detention, Ghosn was out on bail awaiting trial on the charges -- which he denies -- when he fled the country in what Japanese prosecutors termed "one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history".The details of his escape proved embarrassing to Japanese authorities -- with the former tycoon allegedly having boarded a train to Osaka before evading security checks at Kansai airport by boarding a private jet packed into an oversized box that was not scanned.After his arrival in Lebanon, Ghosn claimed that he had been forced to escape because he feared he would not get a fair hearing.While Ghosn remains at large, the repercussions of both the original case against him and his escape from Japan continue.In Tokyo, his former close aide at Nissan, Greg Kelly, is currently on trial for his alleged role in underreporting Ghosn's income. Nissan itself faces charges in the case and has pleaded guilty.And a Turkish court has sentenced two pilots and another employee of a small private airline to four years and two months in prison for their role in Ghosn's escape.Ghosn transited in Turkey, switching planes on his way to Lebanon, and the three Turks were charged with involvement in conspiracy to smuggle a migrant.Two other pilots and two flight attendants on trial in Turkey were acquitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-americans-accused-of-aiding-ghosn-escape-indicted-in-japan-101616398958500.html
22-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine found to be 79% effective in US trial||The Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford was 79% effective in preventing the disease in a US trial, paving the way for the shot’s potential approval.The UK drugmaker published the first data from a study of more than 30,000 volunteers on Monday. The results are good news for older adults, who made up about a quarter of the tests, after trials last year failed to provide conclusive data for that age group due to a lack of participants over the age of 65.The vaccine was also shown to be 100% effective at preventing severe disease, death and hospitalization.The findings should go some way to bolstering confidence in the shot globally after confusion over the true efficacy of the vaccine and the best dosing regimen has impacted take-up, particularly in Europe.Trials in the U.K. and Brazil last year produced a range of readings due to different dosing amounts and regimens used, and at least 10 countries in the European Union only approved the shot for under-65s initially. Many have since reversed that decision after more data from real world use showed the shot was highly effective in older people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazenecaoxford-covid-19-vaccine-79-effective-in-us-trial-101616397087453.html
22-03-2021||World||Explained: As Israel heads to elections, Netanyahu's future hangs in balance||Israel will hold its fourth election in two years on Tuesday as the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party hopes to bank on the country’s success in the Covid-19 vaccination rollout. But 71-year-old Netanyahu, who is the longest-serving leader in the history of the country, faces corruption allegations that led to massive protests in the country ahead of the elections. He also faces the challenge of securing the majority in the elections so that the country can move forth from the past two years of political paralysis and lack of a stable majority.How are elections in Israel conducted?Voting in elections in Israel is done for parties and not for individual candidates. The 120 seats in Knesset, the country’s parliament, are distributed among parties as per their share of the national vote, thus making it difficult for any single party to win a majority (61 seats). Therefore, forming alliances post-election is the norm.What are the major challenges that Netanyahu faces?Israel is said to have raced out of the pandemic with the vast majority of the country’s population already being inoculated and millions in the country receiving the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine. Since the vaccination began in the country in December last year, new Covid-19 infections are as low as 3 per cent and restrictions that were put in place owing to the pandemic have largely been removed in the country.Even though Netanyahu’s government has made significant strides in managing the coronavirus pandemic, he faces major challenges. Netanyahu faces allegations of corruption as his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach has already begun and will resume after the elections. He also faces the challenge of reviving the country’s economy which, like other nations in the world, has been hit hard by the pandemic.Who are Netanyahu’s main rivals in these elections?Netanyahu’s main challenger from the previous election Benny Gantz is not much of a force to reckon with in these elections. Gantz, who is a former general, joined Netanyahu in a coalition after the previous elections, saying that he was doing so as there was a need for a national unity government. This resulted in the loss of Gantz popularity in the country and polls expect his Blue and White party to not win any seats in these elections.Netanyahu faces a major challenge from Yair Lapid, who is a former finance minister and TV host who leads the centre-left Yesh Atid party. Gideon Saar, who was a cabinet minister in the government and later quit the Likud party to set up his own New Hope party, is also a serious contender in the polls as his party has the same political interests as that of the Likud. Naftali Bennett, a former aide of Netanyahu and a cabinet minister as well as a high-tech millionaire, is also in the race with his ultra-right Yamina party.What do the opinion polls say?The opinion polls have predicted that there will be no clear winner in the elections. In Knesset, most opinion polls predict that Netanyahu’s Likud is expected to emerge as the single biggest party.What happens if Netanyahu’s party does not emerge as the single-largest party?Likud will need to emerge as the single-largest party in order to be the driving force of a coalition government. Although, the formation of a coalition government will be difficult as was in the case in the previous three elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-as-israel-heads-to-elections-netanyahu-s-future-hangs-in-balance-101616393885002.html
22-03-2021||World||Investors with $2 trillion urge EU to make agriculture greener||The European Union’s flagship agricultural policy risks undermining the bloc’s net-zero climate targets because it supports high-polluting food industries, according to a group of investors and policy experts.Reforms to the Common Agriculture Policy don’t go far enough to address climate change and biodiversity, investors managing 2 trillion euros ($2.4 trillion) of assets said Monday. The policy will give farmers of high-emitting commodities like beef bigger subsidies for producing more, the group said. It urged the inclusion of climate targets in the distribution of the payments, which make up one-third of the EU budget.Greening agriculture is one of the biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. The EU is decarbonizing its economy, but agriculture, the third-largest contributor of greenhouse gases, has seen little reduction in the past 15 years.“Some of the main barriers for further improvements in sustainability have to be resolved by policymakers,” Peter van der Werf, senior engagement specialist at Robeco Institutional Asset Management BV, said in a statement. Reform in the agriculture policy is important “to ensure that any subsidies provide the right incentives for farmers to align with the Paris Agreement,” he said.The change will be crucial for climate mitigation, reversing emissions and long-term environmental resilience, said the group which includes Legal & General Investment Management and Brunel Pension Partnership.Its recommendations include shifting incentives from prioritizing yields to those that put a value on sustainable agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/investors-with-2-trillion-urge-eu-to-make-agriculture-greener-101616391805262.html
22-03-2021||World||Australian parliament debates motion on rights abuses in China's Xinjiang||Australia's parliament debated on Monday a motion to condemn "systematic breaches" of human rights by China, saying other legislatures had described as genocide its actions towards Uighurs in the far western region of Xinjiang.Parliaments in Canada and the Netherlands drew rebukes from Beijing after they passed non-binding motions in February that said the treatment of China's Uighur Muslim minority constituted genocide."The most egregious, systematic abuse of human rights in the world is occurring in Xinjiang," said Kevin Andrews, a lawmaker of Australia's ruling Liberal party, moving a private member's motion that drew support from members of all major parties.The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China denies any human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Andrews cited large-scale internment camps and accusations of forced labour among the reasons for the condemnation from the Dutch and Canadian parliaments, as well as Britain's upper house and U.S. Secretaries of State Mike Pompeo and Antony Blinken.Many have said, or questioned if, the ruling Chinese Communist Party's programme contravened the United Nations' genocide convention of 1948, he added.Andrews' motion urges Australia to enforce laws against modern slavery and identify supply chains that use forced labour. It was not immediately clear when it would be put to a vote.A Labor MP said many of the 3,000 Uighurs in Australia lived in her electorate, and were desperate and anxious."Most Australian Uighurs know someone who has disappeared or not been heard of for many years," Anne Stanley, who represents Werriwa in western Sydney, told parliament."Those here don't know whether they are alive or dead."China initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centers and are designed to combat extremism. Late in 2019, it said all people in the camps had "graduated".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-parliament-debates-motion-on-rights-abuses-in-china-s-xinjiang-101616390111348.html
22-03-2021||World||Myanmar: Army uproots ethnic villagers amid anti-coup protests||In the jungles of southeast Myanmar, the army was shooting and otherwise oppressing civilians long before last month’s military coup.This largely unseen repression continues even now. In the country’s remote southeast, an army offensive has driven as many as 8,000 ethnic Karen people to flee their homes in what aid groups say is the worst upheaval there for nearly 10 years.They’re now living in the jungle, with fears growing for their health and security, and no prospect of an early return.This crisis in the borderlands has been overshadowed by the deadly crackdown on the mass movement protesting the military’s takeover of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.But it also is a reminder of the brutal force Myanmar's army has long used against civilians, and in particular the country's ethnic minorities.The Karen National Union, the leading political body for the Karen, for now is shouldering all of the displaced people’s basic needs for food, shelter and security.But in the long run, that will be a challenge for the group, said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, head of the KNU’s foreign affairs department, in an email interview.“Therefore the international community should reach out with humanitarian assistance to these people who are in need as soon as possible,” he said.The Karen are among more than a dozen ethnic groups that have been seeking greater autonomy from the central government since Myanmar, then known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948.At times the ethnic groups’ guerrilla forces have engaged in full-on armed conflict with the government; in recent years, many have reached an uneasy cease-fire. Their talks with Suu Kyi's government failed to reach a comprehensive political resolution before it was deposed by the coup.The army, meanwhile, has aggressively expanded its reach in at least two districts in Karen state since 2017, building new bases and roads to try to dominate an area that doesn’t want it there.In the last few months, troop numbers and activity have scaled up dramatically, according to relief organizations active there.The Karen’s own armed force, the Karen National Liberation Army, has fought back. In retaliation, the army has increased its attacks and shelled surrounding villages.Relief agencies say the 8,000 or so people who abandoned their homes for the privations of the jungle are safe and are adapting as well as they can, building bamboo shelters and holding school classes in the open.But no one knows when they can return or whether their villages will still be standing when they do. Meanwhile, the fields where their crops would grow are untended, threatening food supplies later in the year.A humanitarian group, the Free Burma Rangers, has been bringing in aid since the attacks began and documenting the Karens' plight. The group was formed in the late 1990s during intense attacks that displaced more than 100,000 Karen people.Its founder and director, Dave Eubank, is a former member of the U.S. Special Forces who combines evangelical activities with well-disciplined forays by Karen volunteers to deliver medical aid to villagers.In a recent interview with The Associated Press via satellite phone from the affected area, Eubank spoke of what the displaced Karen desperately need.He said that stopping attacks by Myanmar troops — “security and survival” — is the top priority.Food comes next. “As they get displaced they’ve got to eat,” he said. “They can’t go back and start their crops. They can’t prepare for the next fields, they can’t look after the animals,” he said.Medical care and shelter are also essential, Eubank said.In 2012, the Karen National Union signed a cease-fire with the government, which it hoped would end decades of military aggression. But Myanmar’s army has repeatedly breached it. This is the worst breach yet, aid groups say.Hsa Moo from the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network has just returned from the affected area. A former refugee herself, she says it’s heartbreaking.“This is not a good time for us. This is after the cease-fire; but we thought the cease-fire can help them, but actually not. So they have to flee and they have to hide, so it is very difficult for them to hide in the jungle,” she said.The Karen long ago learned the brutal nature of the military, independent analyst David Mathieson told The Associated Press.“What’s interesting about Karen state is a lot of people there see the fighting and now the coup and the civil disobedience movement as intricately linked,” he said. “It’s like ‘Look, we’ve been telling you for years that the enemy is the military.’"“For all those people who wanted to accommodate the military, when you live in these areas of ongoing armed conflict you know exactly who you are dealing with and you know that you can’t trust them,” he explained.The lesson he takes from the army's actions in the cities and in the hinterlands: "This is the military trying to subjugate the entire country once again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-army-uproots-ethnic-villagers-amid-anti-coup-protests-101616389089686.html

22-03-2021||World||Europe can achieve herd immunity by July: EU commissioner||Europe could have herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, a European Union commissioner has said, as incoming jabs are expected to speed up the continent's sluggish vaccine rollout.The note of optimism comes even as several European countries have started reimposing restrictions as they contend with surging coronavirus infections, and after mixed messaging on the safety of a key jab."Let's take a symbolic date: by July 14, we have the possibility of achieving immunity across the continent," Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for the internal market told French broadcaster TF1."We're in the home stretch, because we know that to beat this pandemic there's just one solution: vaccination. The vaccines are arriving," he said.More than a third of France's population is now under renewed lockdown, while frustrations over virus curbs spilled into weekend demonstrations in Germany, Amsterdam, Bulgaria and Switzerland.Europe's battle to prevent a deadly third wave of infections has been complicated by a patchy vaccine drive that included several nations temporarily halting AstraZeneca's shots in response to isolated cases of blood clots.Most have since resumed using the vaccine after the European Medicines Agency found it "safe and effective".But AstraZeneca has delivered only 30 percent of the 90 million doses it promised the EU for the first quarter.Breton said he was confident more vaccines will arrive soon, with 300-350 million doses expected between March and June.He added that 55 factories would now be producing vaccines in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-can-achieve-herd-immunity-by-july-eu-commissioner-101616386541732.html
22-03-2021||World||A transgender Islamic school in Pakistan breaks barriers||A long white shawl on her head, Rani Khan gives daily Koran lessons at Pakistan's first transgender-only madrasa, or Islamic religious school, which she set up herself using her life savings.The madrasa is an important milestone for the LGBTQ community in the overwhelmingly fundamental Muslim country, where transgender people face ostracism, even though there is no official restriction on them attending religious schools or praying at mosques."Most families do not accept transgender people. They throw them out of their homes. Transgender people turn to wrongdoing," Khan, 34, said, as other transgender people, their heads similarly covered, swayed back and forth behind her, reciting Koran verses."At one time, I was also one of them."Holding back tears, Khan recalled how she was disowned by her family at 13 and forced into begging.At 17, she joined a transgender group, dancing at weddings and other functions, but quit it to connect with her religion after a dream in which a deceased transgender friend and fellow dancer pleaded with her to do something for the community.Khan studied the Koran at home, and attended religious schools, before opening the two-room madrasa in October."I'm teaching the Koran to please God, to make my life here and in the hereafter," Khan said, explaining how the madrasa offered a place for transgender people to worship, learn about Islam and repent for past actions.She says the school has not received aid from the government, although some officials promised to help students find jobs.Along with some donations, Khan is teaching her students how to sew and embroider, in hopes of raising funds for the school by selling clothing.Pakistan's parliament recognised the third gender in 2018, giving such individuals fundamental rights such as the ability to vote and choose their gender on official documents.Nonetheless, the transgender remain on the margins in the country, and often have to resort to begging, dancing and prostitution to make a living.The madrasa could help trans people assimilate into mainstream society, Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat told Reuters."I'm hopeful that if you replicate this model in other cities, things will improve," he said.A religious school for transgender people has opened in Dhaka, the capital of nearby Bangladesh, and last year a Christian transgender group started its own church in Pakistan's bustling southern port city of Karachi.Pakistan's 2017 census recorded about 10,000 transgender people, though trans rights groups say the number could now be well over 300,000 in the country of 220 million."It gives my heart peace when I read the Koran," said one madrasa student, Simran Khan, who is also eager to learn life skills."It is much better than a life full of insults," the 19-year-old added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-transgender-islamic-school-in-pakistan-breaks-barriers-101616377041561.html
22-03-2021||World||Turkish lira plunges after Erdogan sacks hawkish central bank chief||Turkey's lira plunged 15% to near its all-time low after markets opened following President Tayyip Erdogan's shock weekend decision to oust a hawkish central bank governor and install a like-minded critic of high interest rates.The appointment of Sahap Kavcioglu, a former banker and ruling party lawmaker, in the early hours on Saturday marked the third time since mid-2019 that Erdogan has abruptly fired a central bank chief.Kavcioglu had sought to ease concerns over a sharp selloff in Turkish assets and a pivot from rate hikes to cuts in a 90-minute call on Sunday, in which he told bank CEOs he planned no immediate policy change, a source told Reuters.The currency tumbled to as weak as 8.4850 versus the dollar, from 7.2185 on Friday, back to levels touched in early November when it reached an intraday record of 8.58. It last changed hands at 8.0749."The lira is being smashed by investors fearing that the custodian of its value does not share their hopes for a stable currency underpinned by positive real interest rates," said Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow, adding that the lira may not yet have found a bottom."The real test will be when the volume comes in in Europe," he said.Goldman Sachs and others had expected a sharp dive in the lira and Turkish assets given the new governor's dovish and even unorthodox views, and what was seen as the latest damage to the bank's credibility amid years of policy interference that has dogged the major emerging market economy.The weekend overhaul could soon reverse the hawkish steps taken by predecessor Naci Agbal, analysts said, and nudge Turkey toward a balance of payments crisis given its depleted buffer of FX reserves.One possible scenario would see the lira swing as much as 15% in both directions in Monday's European session as "TRY sets off on a roller-coaster ride driven by capital flight, central bank interventions and bargain hunters," SEB Research wrote in a client note.Erdogan fired Agbal two days after a sharp rate hike that was meant to head off inflation of nearly 16% and a dipping lira.In less than five months on the job, Agbal had raised rates by 875 basis points to 19% and regained some policy credibility as the lira rallied from its nadir. But the currency gave back most of those gains in less than 10 minutes as the week's trade began."It is going to be a dark and long day on Monday," said one Turkish fund manager.Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities, predicted a 10%-15% lira depreciation over the coming days.The overhaul "demonstrates the erratic nature of policy decisions in Turkey, especially with regard to monetary matters (and risks) looser, unorthodox, and eventually mostly pro-growth policies from now on," he said.On the call with Turkish bankers, Kavcioglu said any policy change would depend on lowering inflation, which he said was the primary goal, the source familiar with the call said.Kavcioglu said the current policy approach would continue, the source added. The central bank did not immediately comment.In a statement on Sunday, Kavcioglu said the bank would focus on permanently lowering inflation, which has been stuck in double digits for most of the last four years.A former member of parliament for Erdogan's AK Party (AKP), Kavcioglu has espoused the unorthodox views shared by the president. He wrote high rates "indirectly cause inflation to rise," in a newspaper column last month.WEEKEND OF QUESTIONSAgbal's latest rate hike was 200 basis-points on Thursday which sparked a more than 3% lira rally.His hawkish stance dramatically cut Turkey's CDS risk gauges and started to reverse a years-long trend of funds abandoning local assets.But after Erdogan ousted Agbal, investors told Reuters they had worked through the weekend to predict how quickly and sharply Kavcioglu might cut rates - and how much the currency would retreat.The heads of some local treasury desks had estimated offers up to 8.00 on Monday. At Istanbul's Grand Bazaar on Saturday, one trader said a dollar bought 7.80-7.90 of the local currency.Wall Street bank Goldman told clients it was reviewing investment recommendations and predicted a "discontinuous" drop in the lira, and a "front-loaded" rate-cutting cycle.The overhaul meant capital outflows appeared likely and a rapid adjustment in the current account may be necessary since markets would shy away from funding Turkey's chronic deficits, it said.Concerns over central bank independence have exacerbated Turkey's boom-and-bust economy and record dollarisation, and prompted last year's unorthodox and costly policy of FX interventions, economists say.The lira has lost half its value since a 2018 currency crisis.Kavcioglu said in the statement that policy meetings will remain on a monthly schedule, suggesting any rate cuts may wait until the next planned meeting on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-lira-plunges-after-erdogan-sacks-hawkish-central-bank-chief-101616382084772.html
22-03-2021||World||Myanmar protests: Doctors join 'civil disobedience' movement against coup||Health care workers marched through Myanmar's second-biggest city Sunday as part of a broad civil disobedience movement against last month's coup. While their protest was left alone, security forces used violence elsewhere and shot dead at least one person.About 100 doctors, nurses, medical students and pharmacists, wearing long white coats, lined up on a main road in Mandalay to chant slogans and voice their opposition to the Feb. 1 coup that toppled the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Mandalay has been a major center of opposition to the takeover, and later in the day engineers there held what has been dubbed a “no-human strike,” an increasingly popular tactic that involves lining up signboards in streets or other public areas as proxies for human protesters.Video recorded in Mandalay showed a motorcyclist apparently being shot off his motorbike by police on an empty street.As the people who recorded the video shout “He’s been hit! He’s been hit! Go and rescue him!” police quickly appear and swarm around him just after he slumps to the ground. Police led him away on foot while another officer rides off on the motorbike. It isn’t clear how badly he was hurt or what happened to him.The civil disobedience movement has used widespread boycotts, strikes and other actions with the aim to restore civilian government and return Myanmar to its slow march toward democracy that began nearly a decade ago after a half-century of military rule.In recent weeks, street protests have faded as a tactic in the face of rising deaths as police and soldiers have shot live fire into crowds and indiscriminately detained people. The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners had verified 247 deaths nationwide but says the actual total, including cases where verification has been difficult, is probably much higher.At least one protester was shot dead Sunday in Monywa, another central Myanmar city, according to the online news site Myanmar Now and numerous social media posts.Myanmar Now, citing a doctor in Monywa, identified the victim as Min Min Zaw, who was shot in the head as he was helping assemble barricades for a protest. Virtually all the dead since the coup have been shot, many of them in the head.Elsewhere, students, teachers and engineers marched in Dawei, a city in southeastern Myanmar that has become a hotspot for opposition and has seen at least five killings by security forces.On Sunday, protesters broke into small groups and varied the timings of their marches in an effort to avoid confrontations.In a more rural outlying area, protesters from several villages in Launglone Township held their protest on motorbikes.In Yangon’s Thaketa neighborhood, a funeral was held Sunday for 15-year-old high school student Aung Kaung Htet, who was killed a day earlier, Myanmar Now reported.According to posts on social media, Thaketa was one of several areas where police fired their guns Sunday, the others including Tachileik and Taunnggyi in Shan State in eastern Myanmar, and Gangaw, a town in Magway Division in the west-central part of the country.The protesters' cause over the weekend received support from demonstrations in several places abroad, including Tokyo, Taipei in Taiwan and on Times Square in New York City.In addition to deaths since the coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has confirmed 2,345 people have been arrested or charged since the coup, with 1,994 still detained or sought for arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-doctors-join-civil-disobedience-movement-against-coup-101616383956496.html
22-03-2021||World||Miami Beach extends curfew, emergency powers to control spring break crowds||Miami Beach officials voted on Sunday to extend an 8pm curfew and emergency powers for up to three weeks to help control unruly and mostly maskless crowds that have converged on the party destination during spring break.Thousands of people have packed the city's Art Deco Cultural District causing bedlam and lawlessness in recent days when university students typically celebrate spring break, leading some businesses to close voluntarily out of concern for public safety.Mayor Dan Gelber told an emergency meeting of the city commission that all manner of out-of-town and out-of-state visitors, not just college students, were filling the streets since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Feb. 26 called the state an "oasis of freedom" from coronavirus restrictions. "It looked like a rock concert. All you could see was wall to wall people," Interim City Manager Raul Aguila told the commission."This is not a typical spring break crowd. ... These are individuals coming into the city ... to engage in lawlessness and anything goes party attitude," Aguila said.Aguila said he noticed a surge on Friday night and imposed emergency powers on Saturday. That included authorities setting a curfew and closing streets in the area, citing in an emergency declaration "multiple fights, brawls, melees, and other public displays and disturbances of the peace."Officials also restricted eastbound traffic on the three main causeways connecting the city with downtown Miami.The commission on Sunday agreed to grant Aguila the authority to extend the measures for up to three more seven-day periods as needed, starting on Tuesday.Video and photos posted on social media showed thousands of spring breakers, many eager to let off steam after a year of COVID-19 lockdowns, packed together and dancing in the streets as police struggled to enforce the curfew, firing pepperballs at the crowd.Police said they had arrested more than 50 people and confiscated eight firearms since Friday, according to a Twitter post on Sunday afternoon.Hundreds of people reconvened on Sunday night, attempting to recreate the party atmosphere, but police dispersed the crowd, images on social media showed. There were no reports of mass arrests or major confrontations, the Miami Herald reported.The Miami Beach Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.Gelber said the mass crowds gathered at a time when the surrounding county was experiencing 1,000 new infections of Covid-19 each day and with 50 to 100 people being hospitalized each day.Many Miami Beach locals took to social media to blame out-of-towners for the chaos."Don't blame Miami for those crowds on South Beach. Nobody who's from Miami goes to South Beach," one Twitter user named Silas P. Silas wrote, eliciting approval from fellow residents.Concerns over public safety prompted some businesses to close their doors voluntarily during what would normally be among their most profitable days of the year and after months of hardship caused by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/miami-beach-extends-curfew-emergency-powers-to-control-spring-break-crowds-101616384082739.html
22-03-2021||World||China denies foreign diplomats access to Canada's Michael Spavor trial||Chinese authorities refused diplomats from more than 20 countries access to the Beijing trial of jailed Canadian Michael Kovrig, in the latest international dispute over the high-profile spying case.Kovrig, an analyst for International Crisis Group, appeared Monday at the Beijing No. 2 People’s Intermediate Court to face allegations of spying on state secrets. The group of diplomats, led by Jim Nickel, the charge d’affaires at the Canadian Embassy, were refused access, in a repeat of what happened Friday at the related spying trial of Canadian Michael Spavor.“Michael Kovrig has been arbitrarily detained for more than two years now, precisely 833 days,” Nickel told reporters. “This is completely unacceptable, as is the lack of transparency in these court proceedings.”China detained the two Canadians in December 2018 after Canada detained Huawei Technologies Co. executive Meng Wanzhou in response to a US extradition request. The pair were then charged in June last year.Spavor, who organized trips to North Korea, went on trial on Friday in the northeastern city of Dandong on charges of stealing and illegally providing state secrets to other countries. No verdict was announced after two hours of proceedings.Individuals convicted of serious violations of parts of the law cited by Chinese authorities face 10 years to life in prison. Diplomats attempting to attend the proceedings Monday included representatives from the US, the UK, the European Union and numerous European countries.China has closely tied the cases of the two men to Meng’s, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian telling reporters last year that halting her extradition “could open up space for resolution to the situation of the two Canadians.”The US is seeking the extradition of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, to try her on fraud charges. Her extradition case is pending in Canadian courts.Canada has criticized China’s handling of the two men’s cases. Foreign Minister Marc Garneau said his country is “deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding these proceedings.” On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the situation “completely unacceptable.”The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa disputed those comments, with an unnamed spokesperson saying in a statement posted on the embassy website: “This is just fact-distorting.”“On the one hand, the Canadian side claims that it upholds the rule of law, but on the other hand, it makes irresponsible remarks with regards to China’s handling relevant cases in accordance with law,” the embassy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-foreign-diplomats-access-to-canada-s-michael-spavor-trial-101616380894450.html

"Xenophobia is real in America and always has been. Sexism too." she said.Biden' statement, issued on Sunday night, marks the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, created in the 1970s to mark a 1960 massacre in South Africa."Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It should have no safe harbor anywhere in the world. We must join together to make it stop," Biden said in the statement.He said his administration would speak out against racial discrimination around the world, including the "horrific" mistreatment of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar and the Uighurs in China."One of the core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans is standing against hate and racism, even as we acknowledge that systemic racism and white supremacy are ugly poisons that have long plagued the United States," he said. "We must change the laws that enable discrimination in our country, and we must change our hearts."Biden's statement came amid mounting pressure on law enforcement authorities to treat last week's deadly shooting in Atlanta of eight people - including six women of Asian descent - as a hate crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blunt-joe-biden-says-us-facing-issues-with-racism-xenophobia-and-nativism-101616374446998.html
22-03-2021||World||Europeans' confidence in AstraZeneca jab falls after clotting fears: Poll||Trust in AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine in many European countries has plunged following controversy around the jab in recent weeks, according to a new survey unveiled Monday by British pollsters YouGov.A majority of people in the biggest European Union member states, including Germany, France, Spain and Italy, now see the inoculation as unsafe, the recent poll found.However, views of the Anglo-Swedish pharma giant's jab remain overwhelming positive in Britain, where two-thirds of respondents said it is safe, compared to just nine percent believing it is not.The findings come at a tumultuous time for the AstraZeneca vaccine and the EU's troubled inoculation campaign, as a third virus wave on the continent prompts renewed social restrictions.Meanwhile, Britain and the bloc are embroiled in an increasingly acrimonious war of words over supplies, with Brussels warning it may halt AstraZeneca vaccine exports.The drop in Europeans' faith in the jab, developed in partnership with Oxford University in the UK, follows weeks of turmoil on the continent over safety fears.Earlier this month several EU countries suspended its use, pending a review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) after dozens of isolated cases of blood clots and brain haemorrhages.The EMA last week declared the AstraZeneca jab "safe and effective", with the WHO and Britain's drugs watchdog issuing similar endorsements.That led European countries to resume administering the vaccine, but not before severely damaging confidence in it. 'Undoubtedly suffered' In its mid-March survey, YouGov found 55 percent of Germans now say the vaccine as unsafe -- a 15 point rise in a month -- compared to 32 percent viewing it as safe.In already more vaccine-hesitant France, 61 percent of respondents said it was unsafe, while Italy and Spain both saw a 27-point monthly jump in the number of people saying they did not trust the jab.No similar increases in safety fears were seen for rival vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, YouGov said.The pollsters interviewed 2,024 Germans, and around 1,000 adults in each of the other countries between March 12 and 18."After concerns about its protection and potency were raised by leaders across Europe, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has undoubtedly suffered damage to its reputation for safety on the continent," said Matt Smith, lead data journalist at YouGov."With a third wave of infections potentially emerging now across the Channel, officials everywhere will be worried if ongoing rows about AstraZeneca's vaccine ends up damaging the rollout."Even prior to its recent woes in Europe, the jab -- which is among the cheapest available, relatively easy to store and billed as the vaccine of choice for poorer nations -- had suffered several setbacks.They include South Africa asking to send back one million doses after researchers found it had failed to prevent mild and moderate cases of a more contagious virus variant there.Confidence in the vaccine has also been hit by mixed messaging.French President Emmanuel Macron said at the end of January the vaccine was "quasi-ineffective for people over 65", despite the EMA approving its use for all ages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europeans-confidence-in-astrazeneca-jab-falls-after-clotting-fears-poll-101616372892528.html
22-03-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine battle with UK heats up as EU ready to halt shipments||The European Union is ready to start withholding Covid-19 shots from the UK, risking a sharp deterioration in relations with London in a bid to turn around its lackluster vaccination campaign.The EU will start reviewing, and likely rejecting, export authorization of AstraZeneca Plc coronavirus vaccines to the UK until the drugmaker fulfills its delivery obligations to the 27-nation bloc, according to a senior EU official.The EU has contracts with the company that aren’t being respected, and any vaccines and ingredients produced in European factories will be reserved for local deliveries, said the official, who asked not to be named because the decisions are under consideration and haven’t been made public.The conflict between the EU and the UK has been growing since Astra informed Brussels it wouldn’t deliver the number of shots it had promised for the first quarter. Both sides have blamed each other for export curbs and nationalism, posing a risk to the fragile post-Brexit trade relationship agreed on only in December.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke last week and a new round of high-level diplomacy is expected among leaders ahead of a summit in Brussels.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said last week that it would restrict exports of vaccines to countries that don’t reciprocate or that already have high vaccination rates. The UK is the largest recipient of doses made in the EU, receiving 10 million of 42 million shots from the bloc so far.EU leaders meeting this week will discuss the plan, and will ultimately have to decide if they should follow through with the proposed restrictive measures. Countries including Italy and France said they were open to exploring the export ban while others, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, urged caution and warned about the impact on European companies, according to a diplomatic note seen by Bloomberg.“All options are on the table -- we are in the crisis of the century,” von der Leyen said last week. “We have to make sure that Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible.”Johnson and von der Leyen spoke by telephone hours after the vaccine restriction plan was floated, according to two people familiar with the call.Johnson has called EU leaders about the dispute in recent days, including Dutch premier Mark Rutte and Alexander De Croo, his Belgian counterpart, and is prepared for more conversations before this week’s summit, a person familiar with the matter said.Slow RolloutAstra is now expected to deliver 30 million shots to the EU in the first quarter, less than half of what it initially committed to. The Astra vaccine is one of four approved in the EU.The EU is struggling to overcome a slow start to its inoculation campaign and has pledged to immunize 70% of adults by the end of September. The bloc has administered 12 doses per 100 people, less than a third of what the UK has managed, according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. The EU expects 360 million deliveries from all providers in the second quarter, almost four times as many as in the first three months of the year.The EU isn’t alone in facing supply issues. The UK is facing a “significant” four-week cut to the supply of Covid-19 vaccines from late March, according to a letter sent to local health-service groups last week. A delayed shipment of the Astra vaccine from India and a batch requiring re-testing are behind the disruption.UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News on Sunday that the EU should allow Astra to keep supplying Britain and warned the bloc would pay a heavy price if it tried to interfere with those shipments.‘Political Pressure’“The commission knows deep down that this would be counterproductive,” he said. “They’re under tremendous political pressure at the European Commission. It would damage the EU’s relations globally.” A spokesperson for Johnson’s office declined to comment and referred back to Wallace’s remarks.It’s not the EU’s responsibility to help Astra deliver on its commitments to the UK, according to the EU official.Still, a spokesman for Pfizer Inc. warned that the free movement of supplies between the UK and the EU is critical to the production of its vaccine. Manufacturing of lipids -- the fatty substance used to deliver the genetic material at the heart of the vaccine Pfizer makes with its German partner BioNTech SE -- takes place at a secret location in the U.K. before shipping to the EU where the shots are completed.The EU official added that there are no outstanding requests for UK exports from Astra’s production facility in the Netherlands, but should such a request be made, it will likely be rejected. A production plant in the Netherlands and one in Belgium produce ingredients for the Astra shot.“The Netherlands in principle allows exports to continue until told otherwise by the European Commission,” a Dutch spokesman said on March 21. “It is of paramount importance that Brussels, London and AstraZeneca reach a deal promptly on the vaccines produced by the company in facilities falling under both contracts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-battle-with-uk-heats-up-as-eu-ready-to-halt-shipments-101616372313503.html
22-03-2021||World||Joe Biden says he plans to visit US-Mexico border ‘at some point’||President Joe Biden says he plans to visit the US-Mexico border “at some point” for a first-hand look at conditions as the entry of migrants seeking refugee status in the US rises sharply.The comment, made to reporters at the White House on Sunday, came after the US Homeland Security secretary said he’s not worried about setting a precedent on open borders by allowing thousands of unaccompanied minors to enter the country.“At some point I will, yes,” Biden said about a border visit. Asked if he wanted to see first-hand what’s happening at overcrowded migrant processing centers, he added, “I know what’s going on in those facilities.”The President’s schedule for the coming week, released by the White House, shows no plans for a border visit through Thursday.The influx of crossings at the US-Mexico border has become a political liability for the two-month-old Biden administration, which reversed many of former President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies. Republicans blame Biden’s approach for encouraging a new wave of migrants while the administration says Trump left behind an inhumane and inadequate system that can’t keep up.Alejandro Mayorkas, the US Homeland chief, spoke on four Sunday talk shows as pressure mounts over what many see as deteriorating conditions on the border.“The border is closed,” Mayorkas said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” adding that immigration authorities are expelling families and single adults, but not children who cross the border alone.“We will not expel into the Mexican desert, for example, three orphan children whom I saw over the last two weeks,” Mayorkas said.A major focus for the Biden administration, he said, is rebuilding “orderly systems” in Mexico and Central America to discourage would-be migrants from traveling to the US border.“It takes time, because the entire system was dismantled” by the prior administration, he said on “Fox News Sunday.” Biden also referred to re-establishing “what existed before.”“We are elevating our messaging, so that the individuals do know that they cannot come to the border,” Mayorkas said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”On Friday, Mayorkas traveled to El Paso, Texas, with two Democratic and two Republican senators to view first-hand the processing and housing for unaccompanied minors.That closed out a week in which the White House heard from members of both parties describing the US southwest border situation as a mess.‘Wide Open’Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican hardliner on immigration, blamed the border surge on the new administration’s move to end Trump policies that sent families, children and other border crossers back to Mexico or flown to their home countries.“The border right now is wide open because the Biden administration dismantled the very effective policies of the Trump administration and the agreements we had with Mexico and other Latin American countries,” Cotton said on “Fox News Sunday.”GOP Representative Michael McCaul of Texas also urged the administration to revisit Trump’s Migration Protection Protocols. Asked about abuses of would-be migrants kept away from the US border under those deals, he said: “It’s a good policy because it deterred.”Republican lawmakers are streaming to the southwest border to highlight the problems, including Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who planned to visit an Arizona border outpost on Sunday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already made the trip with a group of GOP colleagues.One of the two Republicans who traveled with Mayorkas on Friday, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, tweeted about “dismantling” the Trump administration’s policies with no thought to the ramifications.Democrat Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, tweeted that he “fought back tears” from what he saw on the trip.“The Biden Administration is trying their best to uphold the rule of law with humanity. They have a ton of work ahead to clean up the mess Trump left them, but their intentions are true,” tweeted Murphy.Mayorkas refused during an appearance Wednesday before the House Committee on Homeland Security to agree that the problems had reached the level of “a crisis,” aggravating some Republicans.The US has seen a dramatic spike in the number of people encountered by border officials in recent weeks. That includes 18,945 family members encountered in February alone, an increase of 168% from January, according to the Pew Research Center.Officials are looking for ways to boost capacity to house and care for migrants now in federal custody.Axios reported Saturday that the Biden administration has awarded an $86 million contract for hotel rooms near the border to hold about 1,200 migrant family members. The Washington Post reported that customs officials are considering flying migrants to states near the Canadian border for processing.Asked about the report, Mayorkas said on CNN that “we don’t have those plans in place now. But what we are doing is, we are putting all options on the table, as it is our responsibility to do.”The biggest challenge faced by Biden’s administration is that of unaccompanied children. They’re allowed to enter the country in the custody of Customs and Border Protection, even as most adults and families are sent away. More than 9,600 entered the US in February, triple the number who arrived in February 2020, according to data released earlier this month.On CNN, Mayorkas said three facilities had been established in the last week to help move children out of border patrol stations.McCarthy told reporters on Thursday, “This entire crisis is created simply by Joe Biden’s actions and words.” On Saturday he tweeted that Democrats need to “DO SOMETHING.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-he-plans-to-visit-us-mexico-border-at-some-point-101616366916321.html
