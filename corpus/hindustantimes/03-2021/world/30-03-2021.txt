"These attacks are wrong, un-American, and must stop."The measures come after a shooting in Atlanta earlier this month left eight people dead, six of them Asian-American women.The shooting stoked fears among those in the Asian-American Pacific Islander community, which has reported a spike in hate crimes since March 2020 when then-President Donald Trump began referring to the novel coronavirus as the "China virus."Biden's new steps include $49.5 million of pandemic relief funds for "community based, culturally specific services and programs for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault" as well as a new task force dedicated to countering xenophobia against Asians in healthcare.The Justice Department is also planning new efforts to enforce hate crime laws and report data on racial crimes, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-announces-new-measures-to-counter-anti-asian-violence-101617124283893.html
30-03-2021||World||Chicago hospital CEO suspended after improper vaccinations||A Chicago hospital's CEO has been suspended for two weeks following a series of Covid-19 vaccination events involving alleged favoritism, including one in which ineligible Trump Tower workers were vaccinated.The unpaid suspension of Loretto Hospital's president and CEO, George Miller, is on hold until the hospital finds a new chief operating officer and chief financial officer, a hospital spokeswoman said late Monday.Dr. Anosh Ahmed, who had been Loretto's COO and CFO, resigned last week, days after he and Miller were reprimanded by its board of directors following news reports that hospital executives provided Covid-19 vaccines to some people who weren’t yet eligible.The Associated Press left a message seeking comment from Miller at the hospital Tuesday.There have been at least six alleged incidents in which Loretto Hospital vaccinated people connected to the hospital’s executives, including to employees at downtown Chicago's Trump Tower — where Ahmed owns a condo — Cook County judges and their spouses, as well as Miller’s suburban church, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.A hospital spokeswoman disclosed the latest of those incidents Monday in a statement.According to that statement, Dr. Ali Ahmed, the president and CEO of Affinity Health — which oversees Loretto Hospital's Covid-19 clinical trials — “requested 10 vaccinations for 10 individuals he identified as eligible under city guidelines, one of whom was terminally ill."The statement notes that Ahmed is not a Loretto Hospital employee, but says that on Jan. 29 “the 10 vaccinations were provided to Dr. Ali Ahmed and then administered to these individuals.”“While information provided at the time deemed that these individuals were eligible per city vaccination guidelines, Loretto is no longer approving off-site visits that aren’t either hosted by the hospital or community partners and organizations,” according to the statement.Loretto Hospital is located on Chicago’s West Side and largely serves Black and Latino people. It was chosen last year to administer Chicago’s ceremonial first Covid-19 vaccination as part of the city’s efforts to encourage residents in West Side neighborhoods to get vaccinated.Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Monday that Loretto is a “safety net hospital” that is pivotal to Chicago and that she is “committed to helping Loretto get it right because they’re so important to the West Side community.”“Obviously, they deviated from what I think is their core mission and what should have been the focus during this critical time period, which is driving vaccine exclusively to that West Side population that’s so in need and where we still have a lot of work to do to boost the numbers on the West Side," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chicago-hospital-ceo-suspended-after-improper-vaccinations-101617123496812.html
30-03-2021||World||Asian American woman, 65, assaulted in New York; mayor de Blasio condemns attack||An Asian American woman was attacked in New York City by a man who repeatedly kicked her as two people nearby who appeared to be security guards did not intervene, according to surveillance footage released by police.The 65-year-old woman was walking in midtown Manhattan a few blocks from Times Square on Monday afternoon when a man approached her and kicked her in the stomach, knocking her to the ground, police said. The man then stomped on the woman's face several times while shouting anti-Asian insults at her, police said. He later casually walked away, the footage shows.The attack comes amid a national spike in anti-Asian hate crimes, and happened just weeks after a mass shooting in Atlanta that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent. The NYPD says there have been 33 hate crimes with an Asian victim so far this year, news outlets reported.Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video “absolutely disgusting and outrageous” and said it was “absolutely unacceptable” that witnesses did not intervene.“I don’t care who you are, I don’t care what you do, you’ve got to help your fellow New Yorker,” de Blasio said Tuesday at his daily news briefing.“If you see someone being attacked, do whatever you can," he said. “Make noise. Call out what’s happening. Go and try and help. Immediately call for help. Call 911. This is something where we all have to be part of the solution. We can’t just stand back and watch a heinous act happening.”Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the attack “horrifying and repugnant." He ordered the state police's Hate Crimes Task Force to offer its assistance to the NYPD. The NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the attack and has asked anyone with information to contact the department. No arrests have been made.The woman was hospitalized with serious injuries. She was in stable condition on Tuesday, a hospital spokesperson said.According to video footage of the New York City assault, the two people who appeared to be security guards walked into the frame and one of them closed the building door as the woman was on the ground.The property developer and manager of the building, Brodsky Organization, wrote on Instagram that it was aware of the assault and said staff members who witnessed it were suspended pending an investigation.The head of the union representing building workers disputed allegations that the door staff failed to act. He said the union has information that they called for help immediately.“Our union is working to get further details for a more complete account, and urges the public to avoid a rush to judgment while the facts are determined,” SEIU 32BJ President Kyle Bragg said in a written statement. He condemned the attack as “yet another example of the unbridled hate and terror" against Asian-Americans.Police Commissioner Dermot Shea called Monday's attack “disgusting."“I don’t know who attacks a 65-year-old woman and leaves her on the street like that," Shea said Tuesday on TV station NY1.Shea recently said the agency would increase its outreach and patrols in predominantly Asian communities.According to a report from Stop AAPI Hate, more than 3,795 incidents were reported to the organization from March 19, 2020, to Feb. 28. The organization, which tracks incidents of discrimination, hate and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S., said that number is “only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-american-woman-65-assaulted-in-new-york-mayor-de-blasio-condemns-attack-101617123285286.html
30-03-2021||World||Myanmar insurgents sense growing conflict, call for international intervention||One of Myanmar's main ethnic minority rebel groups warned of a growing threat of major conflict on Tuesday and called for international intervention against a military crackdown on opponents of last month's coup.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army ousted an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, detaining her and reimposing military rule after a decade of tentative steps towards democracy.While cities and towns across the country have been consumed by protests against the military, fighting has also flared between the army and insurgents in frontier regions and refugees are spilling over borders.The Karen National Union rebel group, which operates in the east along the border with Thailand, said it was bracing for a major government offensive."Now, thousands of Burma military ground troops are advancing into our territories from all fronts," the group said in a statement."We have no other options left but to confront these serious threats posed by the illegitimate military junta's army in order to defend our territory."The group urged the international community, Thailand in particular, to help Karen people fleeing the "onslaught" and for countries to cut ties with the junta to stop the violence against civilians.A spokesman for the Myanmar junta did not answer calls seeking comment.Opponents of the coup have called for a united front with insurgent groups to help those standing up to the military.Rebels have battled the government for decades for greater autonomy in remote border regions. The military has justified its long grip on power by saying it is the only institution capable of ensuring national unity.Military aircraft bombed KNU fighters on the weekend, sending some 3,000 villagers fleeing to neighbouring Thailand.Thailand denied accusations from activists that refugees were being forced back but a Thai official on the border said the army was sending most people back because it was deemed safe on the Myanmar side.A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency said it was concerned about reports people were being sent back and it was seeking information from Thailand.Fighting has also flared in the north where ethnic Kachin insurgents battle government forces.A border state in India withdrew an order to refuse refugees food and shelter after the measure drew fierce public criticism.'Unacceptable'The military seized power saying that November elections won by Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the election commission.At least 512 civilians had been killed in nearly two months of protests against the coup, 141 of them on Saturday, the bloodiest day of the unrest, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group.Despite the surge in violence, thousands of protesters came out to march in several towns on Tuesday, according to media and photos on social media.Security forces shot and killed one man in the southernmost town of Kawthaung, the Mizzima news portal reported, and one person was killed in Myitkyina in the north, a relative of the 23-year-old victim told Reuters.A civil disobedience campaign of strikes has paralysed parts of the economy and protesters stepped it up by asking residents to leave rubbish at intersections in the main city of Yangon.Western countries have condemned the coup and the violence and called for Suu Kyi's release, and some have imposed limited sanctions.Asian neighbours have been more guarded, though Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have spoken out, and Indonesia did so again on Tuesday while renewing an offer to help."Indonesia strongly denounces this kind of act. It is unacceptable," its foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, said while on a visit to Japan, referring to the surge in violence.Indonesia has led efforts by members of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is a member, to encourage a negotiated solution, despite an old agreement not to comment on each other's problems."While continuously respecting the non-interference principle, since the very beginning ASEAN offers are assistance to Myanmar," Retno said.She said the safety and well-being of the Myanmar people were paramount, adding: "Dialogue should be pursued to bring democracy, peace and stability back in Myanmar."The Philippines issued its strongest comment on the crisis, saying it was dismayed by the "excessive and needless" force against protesters."We reiterate our call for security forces in Myanmar to exercise restraint and desist from resorting to disproportionate force against unarmed citizens," the Philippine foreign ministry said.Thailand asked for the violence to be "reduced". It said Myanmar had acknowledged the message but had said it would depend on the situation.Traditionally, foreign criticism and Western sanctions have failed to sway the generals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-insurgents-sense-growing-conflict-call-for-international-intervention-101617121333838.html

30-03-2021||World||Suez Canal races to clear shipping backlog at crucial maritime trade route||The Suez Canal expects 140 ships to pass on Tuesday after the freeing of a container ship stranded for nearly a week allowed it to reopen, but disruptions to global shipping and at ports could take months to resolve, experts warned.The blockage threw global supply chains into disarray, threatening costly delays for firms already wrestling with COVID-19 restrictions, and nearly doubled rates for oil product tankers.Shipping convoys through the canal resumed on Monday evening after tugs pulled the 400-metre-long (430-yard) Ever Given container carrier free from the spot where it became wedged amid high winds on March 23.The Ever Given's grounding across a southern section of the canal forced a halt to all traffic, leading to a build-up of 422 ships at either end of the canal and along its course.Suez Canal Authority chairman Osama Rabie said 95 ships would pass by 1900 local time (1700 GMT) on Tuesday and a further 45 by midnight, reasserting that he hoped a backlog caused by the blockage would be cleared in three to four days.However, knock-on effects to global shipping and at ports could take much longer to resolve.Though the build-up around the Suez Canal might be cleared in four to five days, it could take several months to deal with backlogs at ports, Jan Hoffmann, a UNCTAD expert on logistics, told a briefing.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the Ever Given's grounding had drawn attention to the importance of the waterway for global trade."We didn't hope for something like this, but fate was doing its work. It showed and reaffirmed the reality and importance" of the canal, Sisi said as he greeted staff on a visit to the Suez Canal Authority in Ismailia."We want to reaffirm in a clear message to the world that everything is back to the way it was," he later told reporters from a platform on the canal, as container ships passed behind him.Shipping group Maersk has said the knock-on disruptions to international shipping could take weeks or months to unravel.Rabie has said the SCA will look at giving discounts to shippers affected by the stoppage."We need to study it in the right way because the number of ships is large, including ships that waited for one day, ships that waited for two days, and ships that waited for three days or four days -- not all of them will take the same percentages," he told a press conference late on Monday.The Japanese owner of the Ever Given said it had not received any claims or lawsuits over the blockage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-races-to-clear-shipping-backlog-at-crucial-maritime-trade-route-101617121048704.html
30-03-2021||World||'I witnessed a murder': Onlooker testifies in trial over George Floyd's death||A man who was among the onlookers shouting at a Minneapolis police officer to get off George Floyd last May testified Tuesday that he called 911 after paramedics took Floyd away, “because I believed I witnessed a murder."Donald Williams, a former wrestler who said he was trained in mixed martial arts, including chokeholds, returned to the witness stand a day after describing seeing Floyd struggle for air and his eyes roll back into his head. He said he watched Floyd “slowly fade away ... like a fish in a bag.”Prosecutor Matthew Frank played back Williams’ 911 call, on which he is heard identifying officer Derek Chauvin by his badge number and telling the dispatcher that Chauvin had been keeping his knee on Floyd’s neck despite warnings that Floyd’s life was in danger. She offers to switch him to a sergeant.As he is being switched, Williams can be heard yelling at the officers, “Y’all is murderers, bro!”On Monday, Williams said he thought Chauvin used a shimmying motion several times to increase the pressure on Floyd. He said he yelled to the officer that he was cutting off Floyd’s blood supply. Williams recalled that Floyd’s voice grew thicker as his breathing became more laboured, and he eventually stopped moving.During cross-examination Tuesday, Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson sought to show that Chauvin and his fellow officers found themselves in an increasingly tense and distracting situation, with the crowd of onlookers getting agitated over Floyd's treatment.Nelson pointed out that Williams seemed to grow increasingly angry at police on the scene, swearing at and taunting Chauvin with “tough guy,” “bum” and other names, then calling Chauvin expletives, which the defense attorney repeated in court.Williams initially admitted he was getting angrier, but then backtracked and said he was controlled and professional and was pleading for Floyd's life but wasn't being heard.Williams said he was stepping on and off the curb, and at one point, Officer Tou Thao, who was controlling the crowd, put his hand on Williams’ chest. Williams admitted under questioning that he told Thao he would beat the officers if Thao touched him again.Williams was among the first witnesses as Chauvin, 45, went on trial on charges of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. The death of the Black man after he was held down by the white officer touched off sometimes-violent protests around the world and a reckoning over racism and police brutality.Prosecutors led off their case by playing the part of the harrowing bystander video of Floyd's arrest. Chauvin and three other officers were fired soon after the footage became public.Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell showed the jurors the video after telling them that the number to remember was 9 minutes, 29 seconds — the amount of time Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the pavement “until the very life was squeezed out of him.”Nelson countered by arguing: “Derek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career.”The defense attorney also disputed that Chauvin was to blame for Floyd’s death, as prosecutors contend.Floyd, 46, had none of the telltale signs of asphyxiation and had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system, Nelson said. He said Floyd’s drug use, combined with his heart disease, high blood pressure and the adrenaline flowing through his body, caused a heart rhythm disturbance that killed him.“The evidence is far greater than 9 minutes and 29 seconds,” Nelson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-witnessed-a-murder-onlooker-testifies-in-trial-over-george-floyd-s-death-101617120373872.html
30-03-2021||World||'Go big': US President Joe Biden to launch sweeping infrastructure plan||It is a mantra that Joe Biden repeats at every opportunity: "Go big."And this week, the US leader launches the second big offensive of his fledgling presidency: a massive infrastructure investment project, to be accompanied by tax hikes that remain to be defined but already have his political opponents up in arms.In a sign of the importance he attaches to the issue -- which could be a central plank of his presidency -- he will speak Wednesday from the city of Pittsburgh, where he launched his campaign two years ago.His predecessor Donald Trump tried to label him "Sleepy Joe," portraying him as a man lacking inspiration, but Biden wants to show he has a bold and reformist agenda.Having already pushed an almost $2 trillion pandemic recovery plan through Congress, the figures being bandied about for his infrastructure plan reach as high as $3 or even $4 trillion.The aim of the huge package is to "rebuild our economy and create better-paying jobs for American workers," said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.The project revolves around a pledge Biden repeated a thousand times on the campaign trail to "Build Back Better:" a promise to modernize ageing infrastructure across the country, to meet the challenge of competing against China and to tackle the key issue of climate change.The White House has remained tight-lipped so far about the details -- fueling speculation about the projects and how much they will cost -- but also about political strategy itself.But one thing is certain: the Pittsburgh speech will be just the starting point for a bitter battle in Congress, with a very unpredictable outcome.The Democratic Party's majority there is razor thin, and negotiations promise to be formidable, testing Biden's negotiating skills and his decades of expertise as a Washington insider.Buttigieg on the front lineThe idea of repairing or building roads, bridges, railways, ports and airports is appealing to the general public, especially since much of US infrastructure dates back to the 1950s and is generally considered to be dilapidated.But beyond the constant refrain that "this is a subject on which Democrats and Republicans can agree," building a political consensus is no easy task.Biden's two predecessors, Trump and Barack Obama, also had catchy slogans and made great promises, but the issue remained a dead letter.And it keeps coming back to the same question: how to pay for it?Biden's new transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who ran against him in the Democratic primaries, will be on the front lines of this battle, trying to ensure that this time, the stars are all aligned."I think that there's a tremendous opportunity now to have bipartisan support for a big, bold vision on infrastructure," the youthful politician said."Americans don't need a lot of selling to know that we've got to do big things when it comes to our infrastructure and the truth is, you can't separate the climate part from this vision because every road we fix, every bridge we build, we can either do it in a way that's better for the climate, or worse for the climate," he said.Even if his enthusiasm is real, the task promises to be daunting. DJ Gribbin, an expert at the Brookings Institution who served as an adviser to Trump on infrastructure, said Biden would do well to learn from the mistakes of his predecessors.The first step is to precisely define the role of the federal government, which in the overwhelming majority of cases does not own the infrastructure, Gribbin said.At the same, there is the danger of the project becoming overly "technical" for the taste of most Americans, who tend to focus more on "tangible" questions, such as what will be the impact on their commute times, and will the potholes on their roads be fixed?Unless he refines his approach, Biden's plan could face insurmountable odds in Congress -- and he, too, risks failure, said Gribbin."And the tradition of future presidential candidates wishfully promising trillion-dollar solutions to our nation's infrastructure problems will continue," he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/go-big-us-president-joe-biden-to-launch-sweeping-infrastructure-plan-101617119689066.html
30-03-2021||World||Imran Khan responds to PM Modi, seeks ‘enabling environment’ for dialogue||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for creating an enabling environment for a “constructive and result-oriented dialogue” in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.Khan, who is recovering from Covid-19, sent the letter on Monday in response to Modi’s message of greetings on the occasion of Pakistan Day on March 23. The contents of Khan’s letter were confirmed by people familiar with developments in Islamabad.“The people of Pakistan also desire peaceful, cooperative relations with all neighbours, including India. We are convinced that durable peace and stability in South Asia is contingent upon resolving all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, in particular the Jammu & Kashmir dispute,” Khan wrote.“Creation of an enabling environment is imperative for a constructive and result-oriented dialogue,” he added.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Khan’s letter.In his letter sent to Khan, Modi had said that an atmosphere of trust and devoid of terrorism is “imperative” for better relations between the two sides.“As a neighbouring country, India desires cordial relations with the people of Pakistan. For this, an atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is imperative,” Modi’s letter had said.Modi also referred to the impact of Covid-19 as a “difficult time for humanity”, and conveyed his best wishes to Khan and the people of Pakistan “for dealing with the challenges” of the pandemic.In his response, Khan thanked Modi for conveying his greetings on Pakistan Day and conveyed Pakistan’s “best wishes for the people of India in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic”.President Ram Nath Kovind had also sent a separate message to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi on the occasion of Pakistan Day.People familiar with developments in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity, had described Modi’s letter as a routine message sent to heads of government or state on national days.After it recently emerged that Khan had tested positive for Covid-19, Modi had tweeted: “Best wishes to Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI for a speedy recovery from Covid-19.”The exchange of letters came against the backdrop of a perceived thaw in India-Pakistan relations, which had suffered a major blow in the wake of a military standoff in early 2019 and New Delhi’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status the same year.The Indian and Pakistani armies began strictly adhering to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two countries.Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa also said recently that the time has come for the two countries to “bury the past and move forward”, though he cautioned that any peace process would be susceptible to disruption without the resolution of the Kashmir issue.Bajwa made the conciliatory remarks just a day after Khan said India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-responds-to-pm-modi-s-letter-seeks-enabling-environment-for-dialogue-101617117949690.html

Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today," he added.The rocket, SN11, launched from the company's South Texas facility around 1300 GMT and began its ascent to 10 kilometres (six miles), experiencing some video glitches.It was descending to the surface when the feed was lost once again."We lost the clock at T plus five minutes, 49 seconds," said announcer John Insprucker, meaning the amount of time that had passed after lift-off."Looks like we've had another exciting test of Starship Number 11," he added, dryly.SN11 is the 11th prototype of Starship, which SpaceX hopes will one day be able to fly crewed missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond.It was the fourth to conduct a test flight attempting to return to the ground for a soft vertical landing.SN8 and SN9, which launched in December and February respectively, crash-landed and exploded, while SN10 successfully landed then blew up a few minutes later during its test on March 3.Despite the previous failures, analysts say SpaceX is gathering valuable data that will help it to accelerate its development timeline.Eventually, SpaceX plans to combine the Starship spaceship with a Super Heavy rocket, creating a fully reusable system.This final version will stand 394 feet (120 meters) tall and will be able to carry 100 metric tonnes into Earth orbit -- the most powerful launch vehicle ever developed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-starship-rocket-prototype-failed-yet-again-confirms-elon-musk-101617114242515.html
30-03-2021||World||Germany to discuss AstraZeneca vaccine shots after brain disorder reports||German leaders will discuss the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, after several states said they would stop giving the shot to people under the age of 60 following further reports of a rare brain blood disorder.Health Minister Jens Spahn will talk with his regional counterparts at 1800 CET (1600 GMT), a ministry spokesman said.The meeting follows further reports by Germany's vaccine regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), of cases of blood clots known as cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT).Germany's vaccine committee, known as STIKO, will recommend using the Anglo-Swedish shot only in people over 60, the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper reported citing a draft decision by STIKO.PEI said it had registered 31 cases of CSVT, which resulted in nine deaths, out of some 2.7 million people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. With the exception of two cases, all reports involved women aged between 20 and 63.It did not comment on the possible consequences and only said it was actively working with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). EU regulators plan to issue an updated recommendation on the AstraZeneca shot next week.Several German states, including Berlin and Brandenburg, as well as the city of Munich, said they would stop giving the shot to people under 60.State hospital groups Charite and Vivantes suspended vaccinations in female staff aged under 55, citing further cases of CSVT."Although no complications have occurred at the Charite after vaccinations with AstraZeneca, the Charite wants to take precautionary action here and wait for final assessments," a spokeswoman said.Because use of the vaccine in Germany was initially limited to those under 65, the shot has been administered among younger women, particularly medical staff and teachers.Many European countries briefly stopped using the Anglo-Swedish firm's vaccine earlier this month while investigating rare cases of blood clots.Both the EMA and the World Health Organization said this month the benefits of AstraZeneca's vaccine outweighed the risks.An EMA review covering 20 million people who took the AstraZeneca shot in Britain and the European Economic Area found seven cases of blood clots in multiple blood vessels and 18 cases of CVST.AstraZeneca says its vaccine is safe and effective, citing extensive trial data. Millions of doses have been safely administered around the world.Nearly all countries have since resumed use of the vaccine. But France broke with guidance from the EMA and said on March 19 it should only be given to people aged 55 or older. France said the decision was based on evidence that the clotting affected younger people.Canadian Health Officials said on Monday they would stop offering AstraZeneca's shot to people under 55 and require a new analysis of the shot's benefits and risks based on age and gender.Some 19,000 people work at the Charite hospitals and 17,000 at Vivantes, which operates clinics as well as care homes.Tagesspiegel, which first reported the decision, said that around two thirds of staff at Charite have been vaccinated so far, and 70% of those workers have received one shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder criticised the "back and forth" around the vaccine, saying all recommendations showed that the danger of severe illness from the coronavirus outweighed any side-effects linked to the shot."At some point we have to be able to administer it freely and say, 'he who wants it and he who dares should be able to get it'," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-discuss-astrazeneca-vaccine-shots-after-brain-disorder-reports-101617112929271.html

Where it starts is with each one's seeing, yes, mine and yours," Francis wrote."We are not going to get out of crises like climate or Covid-19 by hunkering down in individualism but only by 'being many together', by encounter and dialogue and cooperation," he added in the preface to the 30-page study released on Tuesday.Conservatives in the Church, many aligned with conservative political forces, are climate change sceptics and contest the majority scientific opinion that global warming is mostly caused by people.Francis appeared to be appealing to such sceptics."When people are driven out because their local environment has become uninhabitable, it might look like a process of nature, something inevitable," Francis wrote."Yet the deteriorating climate is very often the result of poor choices and destructive activity, of selfishness and neglect, that set humankind at odds with creation, our common home," he said.The pope criticised former US President Donald Trump when he withdrew the United States from the 2015 Paris accord to limit global warming. The Vatican has welcomed President Joe Biden's return to the accord.At the Climate Adaptation Summit hosted by the Netherlands in January, leaders were told that climate change could depress global food production by up to 30%, while rising seas and greater storms could force hundreds of millions in coastal cities out of their homes."We really seem to be at the point of deciding, actively and passively, whether we are going to take care of the one home we have or destroy it," Cardinal Michael Czerny, under-secretary of the Vatican development office, said at a news conference presenting the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-using-shakespeare-makes-climate-change-appeal-criticises-trump-for-withdrawing-from-paris-accord-101617109802659.html
30-03-2021||World||UN calls for unhindered access to Xinjiang over gross human rights violations||The United Nations human rights experts have expressed serious concerns over the continuous crackdowns on the Uyghur community residing in Xinjiang, calling for unhindered access to the country to conduct fact-finding missions and urging global and domestic companies to closely scrutinise their supply chains.According to a news release by the UN Human Rights Special Procedures dated Monday, several experts appointed by the Human Rights Council said they had received information that connected over 150 domestic Chinese and foreign domiciled companies to serious human rights abuses against Uyghur workers."We are deeply concerned by these allegations which, if proven, would constitute grave human rights abuses," stated the Working Group on Business and Human Rights, one of eight UN independent human rights mandates to raise their concerns over treatment of members of the Uyghur minority."We stand ready to strengthen our dialogue with the Government of China at the earliest opportunity and welcome the Government's prompt response to these allegations as well as its willingness to continue the constructive engagement with us. As independent experts appointed by the Human Rights Council, of which China is a State Member, we consider that an official visit to China (including the Xinjiang region) would be the ideal opportunity for such dialogue and to assess the situation for ourselves based on free and unhindered access," they added.Uyghur workers have been subjected to exploitative working and abusive living conditions that may constitute arbitrary detention, human trafficking, forced labour and enslavement by the use of forced labour. Hundreds of thousands of members of the Uyghur minority have been held in so-called "re-education" facilities. Many have also reportedly been forcibly transferred to work in factories in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and in other Chinese provinces."Uyghur workers have allegedly been forcibly employed in low-skilled, labor-intensive industries, such as agribusiness, textile and garment, automotive and technological sectors," stated Dante Pesce, Chairperson of the Working Group, as quoted by the statement."While the Government of China justifies its actions relating to the treatment of Uyghurs by combatting terrorism and violent extremism, poverty alleviation or development purposes, we nevertheless respectfully urge the Government to immediately cease any such measures that are not fully compliant with international law, norms and standards relating to human rights, including the rights of minorities," continued Pesce.The statement noted that the UN experts have written to the Government of China as well as private businesses, both inside and outside of China that may be implicated in the alleged abuses. They have also written to governments of 13 countries where the businesses are domiciled or headquartered, recalling the obligations of home States under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to ensure that businesses under their territory and/or jurisdiction respect all human rights throughout their operations."Many businesses are also implicated in these allegations, either directly or through their supply chains. Businesses must not turn a blind eye to this and must conduct meaningful human rights due diligence in line with the UN Guiding Principles to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for human rights abuses caused, contributed to or directly linked to their operations, products or services in Xinjiang and in other Chinese provinces," said Surya Deva, Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group."At the same time, the Chinese Government must create an environment conducive for all businesses operating in China to conduct human rights due diligence in line with international standards," noted Deva.The global body's concerns come as international condemnation is growing against Beijing's crackdowns against the Uyghur community.Last week, EU foreign ministers included four Chinese citizens and one organisation on the sanctions list over alleged human rights violations and what they perceive as persecution of the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. Beijing responded by imposing sanctions on 10 European officials and four organisations.The US, Canada and the UK later also joined in on the sanctions against China. In response, China sanctioned the chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, Gayle Conelly Manchin, Vice Chair Tony Perkins, and the Canadian member of parliament Michael Chong.However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Western sanctions were "based on rumors and misinformation."China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.The US Department of State under then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the crackdown on Uyghurs as 'genocide'. Beijing has been restricting information flow from the area to scrub evidence, leading countries to make determinations as best as they can.Surveillance and censorship have long hindered a full view of conditions in Xinjiang. However, last year, Beijing locked-down borders, citing the coronavirus; expelled foreign journalists who reported on Xinjiang; and scrubbed information off websites across the region, reported Washington Post.The designation of genocide would become an indelible stain on President Xi Jinping's legacy and further boost European nations to join the United States in imposing economic sanctions and calls to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.The US Department of State under then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the crackdown on Uyghurs as 'genocide'.

Some regions have already begun easing some curbs."Unfortunately, the incidence rate and the progression of the disease allow us to speak of a third wave of coronavirus infections," TASS news agency quoted Deputy Health Minister Tatiana Semyonova as saying.Russia started a mass vaccination campaign in December. Putin said last week that 4.3 million people in the country of around 145 million had so far received two shots of a vaccine.Russia on Tuesday reported 8,277 new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours, including 1,291 in Moscow. The country also reported 409 deaths, raising the official toll to 98,442.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-covid-19-wave-emerging-in-russia-state-health-official-101617107691896.html

The only thing that should matter is whether the vaccine is effective and safe, and not where it comes from."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-in-talks-to-buy-one-million-sputnik-v-vaccine-doses-101617105783760.html
30-03-2021||World||The moment vaccine skepticism went mainstream, 'became political'||In early 2015, as news broke that a significant measles outbreak had started at Disney, Carl Krawitt found himself outraged. Krawitt’s son Rhett had been battling leukemia since he was two-and-a-half. That meant his immune system was too weak to handle routine childhood vaccines. Something like measles could be extremely dangerous for Rhett, so it was crucial that others around him be vaccinated. But Rhett had recently started kindergarten in Marin County, a county with triple the vaccine exemptions of the California average. Measles requires more than 95% of kids to be vaccinated in order to prevent outbreaks. Krawitt was blown away by the fact that they couldn’t take peanut butter to school because some kids had allergies, but putting his son’s life at risk by forgoing vaccination was totally allowed. The Krawitts began speaking out about this, and Rhett became the face of a bill that sought to tighten vaccine laws in the state. The bill passed. Vaccination rates went up. But that wasn’t the only outcome of the bill.“The anti-vaxxers came out,” Krawitt recalls. “They threatened us, they threatened my kid. They told lies. And it was scary.”The Disneyland measles outbreak was a tipping point. The outbreak made clear that number of people opting out of vaccination was significant. But it also changed the people protesting vaccines. Before that, activists speaking out about vaccines had mainly been parents concerned about the safety of their kids. The push to get rid of vaccine exemptions changed the conversation. It became political. It became about choice and freedom and democracy.“This is where we really saw this coalescence around the idea of vaccination as a civil liberties issue,” says Amelia Jamison, a doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University who studies health misinformation.In the third episode of Doubt, a new series from the Prognosis podcast that explores vaccine hesitancy, we look at this moment in time, and how it would foreshadow what we’re living through now, a moment in which millions of Americans feel they do not trust the government when it comes to public health policy.“The anti vaxxers kind of felt endangered or in peril,” says Jamison. “And then they started to mobilize and help organize themselves in ways that they could protest this bill.” The aftermath of the Disneyland outbreak was the moment when this group of people would really become a movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-moment-vaccine-skepticism-went-mainstream-became-political-101617105353676.html
30-03-2021||World||Thailand denies forcing fleeing villagers back to Myanmar||Thailand’s prime minister denied Tuesday that his country’s security forces forced villagers back to Myanmar who had fled from military airstrikes, saying they returned home on their own accord.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, nevertheless, said his country is ready to shelter anyone who is escaping fighting, as it has done many times in recent decades. His comments came a day after humanitarian groups said Thailand has been sending back some of the thousands of people who have fled a series of Myanmar military airstrikes.“There is no influx of refugees yet. We asked those who crossed to Thailand if they have any problem in their area. When they say no problem, we just asked them to return to their land first. We asked, we did not use any force,” Prayuth told reporters.“We won’t push them back,” he said. ’If they are having fighting, how can we do so? But if they don’t have any fighting at the moment, can they go back first?”The weekend strikes, which sent ethnic Karen people to seek safety in Thailand, were another escalation in the violent crackdown by Myanmar’s junta on protests against its Feb. 1 takeover.At least 510 protesters have been killed since the coup, according to Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which says the actual toll is likely much higher. It says 2,574 people have been detained. Protests continued Tuesday despite the deaths of more than 100 people on Saturday alone.The coup that ousted the government of Aung San Suu Kyi reversed the country's progress toward democracy since her National League for Democracy party won elections in 2015 after five decades of military rule.At Thailand’s Mae Sam Laep village along the Salween River, which forms the border with Myanmar, paramilitary Thai Rangers on Tuesday twice waved off a boat that had come from the other side carrying seven people, including one lying flat and another with a bandage on his head. But ambulances soon arrived on the Thai side and it landed anyway.Thai villagers helped medical staff carry the injured people on stretchers to a small clinic at a nearby checkpoint. One man had large bruises on his back with open wounds, an injury one medical staffer said could have been caused by an explosion.An elderly woman in the group had small cuts and scabs all over her face. Thai nurses in protective gear to guard against Covid-19 attended to her, giving her and others tests for the coronavirus.Another villager from the boat, 48-year-old Aye Ja Bi, said he had been wounded by a bomb dropped by a plane. His legs were hit by shrapnel and his ears were ringing, he said, but he was unable to travel to get help until Tuesday.The airstrikes appeared to be retaliation for an attack by guerrillas of the Karen National Liberation Army on a government military outpost, in which they claimed to have killed 10 soldiers and captured eight. The group is fighting for greater autonomy for the Karen people.Thai authorities, who claimed weeks ago to be preparing for an influx of refugees, have responded inconsistently. A group of 2,500-3,000 refugees crossed into Thailand on Sunday, according to several humanitarian aid agencies who have long worked with the Karen.They said on Monday, however, that Thai soldiers had begun to force people to return to Myanmar.“They told them it was safe to go back even though it is not safe. They were afraid to go back but they had no choice,” said a spokesperson for the Karen Peace Support Network, a group of Karen civil society organizations in Myanmar.Two other people confirmed that refugees were being sent back to Myanmar. All three spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue.Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said in a statement Monday night that claims some Karen were being forced to return to Myanmar were inaccurate and “cite information solely from non-official sources without confirming the facts from official sources on the ground.”“In fact, the Thai authorities will continue to look after those on the Thai side while assessing the evolving situation and the needs on the ground,” he said.The army has restricted journalists’ access to the area where the villagers crossed the border.Myanmar’s government has battled Karen guerrillas on and off for years — along with other ethnic minorities seeking more autonomy — but the airstrikes marked a major escalation of violence.Political organizations representing the Karen and Kachin in northern Myanmar have issued statements in recent weeks warning the government against shooting protesters in their regions and threatening a response.They were joined Tuesday by the Three Brothers Alliance, which represent the guerrilla armies of the Rakhine, Kokang and Ta-ang -- also known as Palaung -- minorities.The alliance condemned the killing of protesters and said if it did not stop immediately, they would abandon a self-declared cease-fire and join with other groups to protect the people.Their statement, like those of the Karen and Kachin, seemed to suggest that any military response by them would be in their home areas, not in the cities of central Myanmar where the protests and repression have been the strongest.Supporters of the protest movement are hoping that the ethnic armed groups could help pressure the junta. Protest leaders in hiding say they have held talks, but there have been no commitments.The United States on Monday suspended a trade deal with Myanmar, also known as Burma, until a democratic government is restored in the Southeast Asian country.The office of the US Trade Representative said the country was immediately suspending “all US engagement with Burma under the 2013 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement.″ Under the agreement, the two countries cooperated on trade and investment issues in an effort to integrate Myanmar into the global economy, a reward for the military’s decision to allow a return to democracy — a transition that ended abruptly with last month’s coup.The announcement Monday doesn’t stop trade between the two countries. Last week, the United States restricted American dealings with two giant Myanmar military holding companies that dominate much of that country’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-denies-forcing-fleeing-villagers-back-to-myanmar-101617104325795.html
30-03-2021||World||Google Maps to start using 'eco-friendly' routes to tackle climate change||Google's Maps app will start directing drivers along routes estimated to generate the lowest carbon emissions based on traffic, slopes and other factors, the company announced on Tuesday.Google, an Alphabet Inc unit, said the feature would launch later this year in the U.S. and eventually reach other countries as part of its commitment to help combat climate change through its services.Unless users opt-out, the default route will be the "eco-friendly" one if comparable options take about the same time, Google said. When alternatives are significantly faster, Google will offer choices and let users compare estimated emissions."What we are seeing is for around half of routes, we are able to find an option more eco-friendly with minimal or no time-cost tradeoff," Russell Dicker, a director of product at Google, told reporters on Monday.Google said it derives emissions relative estimates by testing across different types of vehicles and road types, drawing on insights from the U.S. government's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). Road grade data comes from its Street View cars as well as aerial and satellite imagery.The potential effect on emissions from the feature is unclear. But in a study of 20 people at California State University, Long Beach, university researchers last year found participants were more inclined to consider carbon emissions in route selection after testing an app that showed estimates.Google's announcement included additional climate-focused changes. From June, it will start warning drivers who are about to travel through low emissions zones where some vehicles are restricted in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K.In the coming months, Maps app users will be able to compare car, biking, public transit and other travel options in one place instead of toggling between different sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-maps-to-start-using-eco-friendly-routes-to-tackle-climate-change-101617103698375.html

All of the cases were linked to two distinct virus clusters, one related to a doctor and the second to a nurse, authorities said."The fact that we have these cases that are linked is good news," Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters. "Do we expect to see more cases? Probably. Probably, we will see more."Brisbane, the state capital, has been placed under a three-day lockdown until Thursday, requiring more than 2 million city residents to stay home except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise.The restrictions upended holiday plans for thousands as the lockdown is scheduled to end just a day before the Easter long weekend and the school term break in Australia, a popular time for vacations.Several states closed their borders with Queensland, while others will require travelers from the virus hotspots to self-isolate for two weeks on their return.Brisbane Airport forecast a steep drop in the number of domestic travelers passing through the airport by the weekend compared with its pre-lockdown expectations."This week we had forecast 35,000 to 40,000 per day. However, today this number was closer to 15,000 and we anticipate this may drop to under 10,000 per day by the weekend," a spokeswoman told Reuters.Lockdown and border controls could put the state's businesses under more strain as the government's A$90 billion ($69 billion) job subsidy scheme ended on Sunday.Neighbouring New South Wales (NSW) state, Australia's most populous, is also on alert after two of the Queensland cases, a nurse and her sister, travelled while unknowingly infectious to Byron Bay, a tourist town just south of the Queensland border and home to Hollywood A-listers such as Chris Hemsworth.Health alerts have been issued for a hotel, cafe and restaurant exposed to the virus as officials urged patrons to test and isolate."I hope that we do not have any cases emerge in New South Wales, but I won't be surprised if we did. So, we need to brace ourselves," NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.Snap lockdowns, social distancing rules and speedy contact tracing systems have helped Australia to contain fresh clusters in recent months. It has reported just under 29,300 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-queensland-warns-of-more-covid-19-cases-easter-travel-plans-on-hold-101617076315921.html

The process came to be affected by the constitutional crisis in October 2018 when the then prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was sacked and later reappointed.The provincial councils were added to the Sri Lankan statutes as a result of a direct Indian intervention in Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority issue.India proposed province based devolution in terms of the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord of 1987 under the then Indian Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi.On the electoral system reform, Chandrasena said most parties favoured the first past the post system for provincial councils discarding the current proportional representation system.

But while more than 30 million British adults have had at least one dose, take-up is significantly lower in Black and Asian communities, raising the risk of ongoing illness and death in some of the country’s most ethnically diverse and underprivileged areas.Official data released on Monday revealed that just 59% of Black African adults in England aged over 70 have received at least one shot, compared to about 91% of White people and a rate below 75% in England’s Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The figures back up analysis of health records by OpenSafely, a doctor-led data project, which shows that gaps in coverage have narrowed only slightly since January.Personal experience of poor treatment, combined with historic abuse and discrimination by the medical establishment, have led to mistrust, experts say. There are questions over potential side effects and language barriers, while misinformation has also sowed doubt, ranging from unfounded safety concerns to falsehoods suggesting that vaccines contain traces of alcohol or meat products. Some people may be willing to have the vaccine, but face access hurdles.“It’s a really complicated story that has many layers,” said Winston Morgan, a researcher at the University of East London who talks with Black pastors, nursing students and others to address concerns. “All of these things you have to overcome.” The situation is worrying local health officials in some of England’s most ethnically diverse areas, where two waves of Covid-19 have crashed over the past year. A Bloomberg analysis of government data shows that death rates tend to be higher — and vaccination rates lower — in areas where fewer than 60% of people are White.The UK government hit an early goal of offering a first dose to anyone aged 70 and older back in mid-February. Yet overall vaccination rates for people in their 70s remain below 90% in 10 London health-care districts, according to NHS data, and 24 districts across England have vaccinated less than 90% of people aged 80 or over. Many of those areas include some of England’s poorest, most multi-racial communities.If the pattern of low take-up in deprived, diverse areas persists it would allow the coronavirus to keep circulating even as it is driven out of more affluent places, leaving Black and Asian communities at risk of infection longer than much of the rest of the UK New and potentially dangerous variants could prolong the pain.Persuading people to embrace the vaccine depends on faith in both the government and the health service, said Morgan. “In a lot of communities described as hesitant they don’t have that trust.”Black British celebrities are now stepping in: An open letter from actor Lenny Henry was signed by stars including Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandie Newton. The letter acknowledged people’s “legitimate worries and concerns,” adding: “We know change needs to happen and that it's hard to trust some institutions and authorities.”In districts such as Newham, in east London, which suffered almost 456 deaths per 100,000 people over the past 12 months — the highest in England and more than twice the national average — vaccines are seen as a way to avert even more agony. Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities make up roughly three-quarters of Newham’s population.“If we want to stop transmission altogether we need to aspire to have the highest vaccine rates in places like this, not accept that they will be a bit lower,” said Jason Strelitz, Newham’s public health director.“Nationally the vaccine strategy so far is a huge success. But to get it right in the next phase we’ll need to put additional resources and effort into areas of low take-up.”Local community organizations and the government are trying to narrow the gaps as lockdowns ease. That means transforming places like the Redeemed Christian Church of God, in the Newham neighborhood of Stratford, into local vaccine clinics. One day last week more than two dozen people were booked to receive the shot at the boxy, white-brick building, known as the Sanctuary, near the site of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.Providing Covid shots at places of worship, which play a central role in many communities and are close to peoples’ homes, is part of an effort to raise confidence. Like other boroughs, Newham has opened pop-up centers in churches, mosques, Sikh gurdwaras and Hindu temples.While some are keen, others in the Black community are “watching and waiting,” said Olufemi Daramola, a local doctor and congregant at the Stratford church helping with the vaccinations. “My worry is that more people will catch it,” he said of the coming weeks and months. “But this might help boost uptake.”The pandemic has already had a disproportionate impact on Black and South Asian people in particular. Cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Black African or Black Caribbean communities have been running at about double the rate for White communities, government data show.Earlier this year, the UK committed more than 23 million pounds ($32 million) to help expand vaccine access in areas of higher risk, targeting minority communities and areas of deprivation in particular. The government has pointed to initiatives, including WhatsApp groups sharing messages from religious figures and “vaccine buses” that bring shots to harder-to-reach areas.“We’ve had two tsunamis — short, sharp and devastating,” said Adeola Agbebiyi, a Newham public health consultant who is part of the vaccination drive. “For our population who have experienced many bereavements and much trauma because of Covid over the past year, it’s important. Demographically they’re more likely to be exposed and to die. So individual-level protection is huge.”Across the city, in northwest London, Raja Amjid Riaz oversees a regular clinic to administer the AstraZeneca Plc and University of Oxford vaccine at the Central Mosque of Brent. While generally positive, Riaz said take-up has been “very poor” in groups including the local Afghan, Somali and Black African communities.About two-thirds of the population in Brent are from Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups. Brent had the highest Covid-19 death rate between March and June last year, followed by Newham, as people with lower-paid jobs, poor housing and health conditions suffered the most.“Covid highlights a major issue in UK society — unfortunately it has hit the poor and Black and minority ethnic communities quite badly,” Riaz said. “The major way out of the pandemic now is through vaccination.”Sapna Chadha, a volunteer at the brick mosque on the edge of the train line in Willesden Green, said she worries about pockets of people at the local level who are still susceptible to the virus while the UK succeeds nationally.“We’ve got to be very careful,” she said. “Covid is here to stay.”There’s a lot at stake for Britain, which faced intense criticism for missteps earlier in the pandemic but has moved swiftly in securing and distributing vaccines. The U.K. has given more than 45% of its total population at least one dose, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. That compares with about 29% for the U.S. and 10% for the European Union.As the coronavirus continues to circulate, the more chance it has to mutate and evade the immunity provided by vaccines or a past infection. Getting to a level at which enough people are immune that the virus can no longer spread will depend on ensuring all groups have access. That “herd immunity” mark could be at around 70% to 85% of the population, though the exact level is unclear.Just as communities start to see progress, they’ve been hit by other factors beyond their control. The UK is involved in an ongoing tussle over vaccine supply with the European Union; separately, the country faces a looming four-week supply crunch. That “massively” changed the plan for April, making it difficult to predict how many doses Newham will receive, said Strelitz, the health director. Some people also canceled appointments after concerns about blood clots prompted a string of European nations to temporarily suspend immunizations using the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said.When the doses begin to flow again, getting younger adults to roll up their sleeves will be another challenge. Some in that generation see themselves as less vulnerable, or are less confident in vaccines, Strelitz said. Others will have work commitments that make it harder to book appointments, he added.Morgan, the east London academic, specializes in toxicology and also studies factors that contribute to poor medical outcomes. The UK vaccine system may be overlooking people who disregard text message invites or consider unsolicited letters as spam, especially if they don’t regularly see a doctor, he said. Some may want a personal invitation.The gaps between ethnic groups appear to be narrowing slowly, though not as fast as everyone wants. “People still aren’t getting the information they need,” Morgan said.“They’re not totally against taking the vaccine. They just want to be reassured, and that reassurance has to come from people they know and trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-vaccination-rates-struggle-in-places-worst-hit-by-virus-101617099569028.html
30-03-2021||World||Vietnam sentences flight attendant for spreading coronavirus||A court in Vietnam handed a two-year suspended jail term to a Vietnam Airlines flight attendant on Tuesday after finding him guilty of breaking COVID-19 quarantine rules and spreading the virus to others, police said.Duong Tan Hau, 29, was convicted of "spreading dangerous infectious diseases" at the one-day trial at the People's Court of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security said in a statement.Vietnam has been praised for its efforts to contain the virus through mass testing and tracing and strict centralised quarantining. It has recorded fewer than 2,600 COVID-19 infections and only 35 deaths due to the disease.Hau breached the country's 14-day quarantine regulations and met 46 other people following his flight from Japan in November, according to the indictment posted on a police ministry website.Hau had mingled with other people during a stint in state quarantine and according to the indictment visited cafes, restaurants and attended English classes while he was supposed to be self-isolating. He tested positive for COVID-19 on Nov. 28.Hau's violations resulted in the quarantine and testing of around 2,000 other people in the city at a cost of 4.48 billion dong ($194,192), the indictment said.State media said he had infected at least three other people."Hau's violation was serious, put society in danger and endangered the safety of the community," the statement said.Reuters could not immediately reach his lawyer for comment.In December, Vietnam sentenced the head of the Hanoi Center for Disease Control and Prevention to 10 years in prison after finding him guilty of wrongdoing linked to the procurement of equipment intended to help tackle the COVID-19 outbreak.

30-03-2021||World||Day 1 of Derek Chauvin's trial, police officer accused of killing George Floyd||Opening statements were made on Monday in one of the most closely-watched trials in decades in the US as the murder trial began for Derek Chauvin, one of the four police officers facing charges with respect to the death of George Floyd. Floyd died after Chauvin pressed his knee onto the 46-year-old Black man’s neck on May 25, 2020. His death led to massive protests across the world under the “Black Lives Matter” movement. The trial on Monday included the prosecution’s opening remarks centred on a bystander video of Floyd’s death. Protesters also gathered outside the courthouse showing the interest that people had in the trial which is being recorded. Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family, told supporters on Monday that “the whole world is watching.”Charges against Derek ChauvinThe charges against Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer, include manslaughter and unintentional second-degree murder. Similar charges will also be faced by the other three officers—Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng.Second-degree murder means that the murder was not planned and happened due to the “offender’s reckless conduct”. It carries a maximum sentence of 40 years. Manslaughter refers to the unlawful killing of an individual without malice and can be both voluntary and involuntary in nature. It carries a maximum sentence of not more than 10 years or payment of a fine of not more than $20,000 or both.The trialThe opening statements in the trial were based on the video of Floyd’s arrest. The video, which was taken by a bystander was about 9 minutes and 30 seconds long and was shown by the prosecuting attorney Jerry W Blackwell.“You can believe your eyes, that it’s homicide — it’s murder,” Blackwell said. Chauvin’s lawyers on the other hand said that the jurors must consider “heaps of evidence” outside of the video itself. Eric Nelson, a lawyer for Chauvin, said that the case “is clearly more than about 9 minutes and 29 seconds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/day-1-of-derek-chauvin-s-trial-police-officer-accused-of-killing-george-floyd-101617098384003.html
30-03-2021||World||EU, UN hold talks to find 'credible solution' to Syria conflict||Dozens of nations and international organisations were holding virtual talks on Tuesday to help tackle the humanitarian crisis deepening in Syria and neighbouring countries as the civil war there entered its 11th year without a political solution in sight.The annual pledging event is co-hosted by the United Nations and the European Union.“The overarching objective of the Brussels Conferences is to continue supporting the Syrian people and mobilize the international community in support of a comprehensive and credible political solution to the Syria conflict," organizers said.The decade of bloodshed in Syria has killed more than a half-million people and sparked a refugee exodus that has destabilized neighbouring countries and impacted Europe.According to the UN, 13.4 million people in Syria, more than half the country's pre-war population, need assistance. That's a 20% increase from last year.Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the humanitarian situation has worsened. The local currency has crashed and food prices have soared — increasing by 222% from last year.Nine out of 10 people live below the poverty line and in northwestern Syria, an area that is held by the rebels, close to three-quarters of the 4.3 million residents are food insecure.“It has been 10 years of despair and disaster for Syrians," UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said. “Now plummeting living conditions, economic decline and COVID-19 result in more hunger, malnutrition and disease. There is less fighting, but no peace dividend."The UN and other aid groups are seeking more than USD 4 billion for aid within Syria at this year's conference, their biggest appeal yet. Another USD 5.8 billion are requested for nearly 6 million Syrian refugees who fled their homeland.Over the years, pledges have typically fallen short. The humanitarian appeal for 2020 was 45% below its USD 3.82 billion target — nearly a 14% drop from the year before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-un-hold-talks-to-find-credible-solution-to-syria-conflict-101617095167714.html
30-03-2021||World||Trump's heir? Mike Pence reemerges, lays groundwork for 2024 run||When former President Donald Trump was asked to list those he considers the future leaders of the Republican Party, he quickly rattled off a list of names, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz. Conspicuously absent from the list: Mike Pence.The former vice president is steadily reentering public life as he eyes a potential run for the White House in 2024.He's joining conservative organizations, writing op-eds, delivering speeches and launching an advocacy group that will focus on promoting the Trump administration's accomplishments.But Trump's neglect in mentioning Pence during a podcast interview earlier this month signals the former vice president's unique challenge.For someone who built a reputation as one of Trump's most steadfast supporters, Pence is now viewed with suspicion among many Republicans for observing his constitutional duty in January to facilitate a peaceful transfer of power to the Biden administration, a decision that still has Trump fuming.To prevail in a Republican presidential primary, Pence may have to reinforce his loyalty to Trump while defending his decisions during the final days of the administration when the president falsely alleged widespread voter fraud, contributing to a deadly riot at the US Capitol. If anyone can achieve this awkward balance, some Republicans say, it's Pence.“Anybody who can pull off an endorsement of Ted Cruz and become Donald Trump's vice presidential nominee should not be counted out," said Republican strategist Alice Stewart, who worked for Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign when Pence endorsed him. “He has a way of splitting hairs and threading the needle that has paid off in the past."Pence aides generally brush off talk of the next presidential election. They insist he is focused on his family and next year's midterm elections, when Republicans are well positioned to regain at least one chamber of Congress. Allies argue that, over time, the anger will subside.“I think 2024's a long time away and if Mike Pence runs for president he will appeal to the Republican base in a way that will make him a strong contender," said Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee and has already endorsed a Pence 2024 run.“If and when Mike Pence steps back up to the plate, I think he will have strong appeal among Republicans nationwide.”Pence declined to comment for this story. For their part, Trump aides warn against reading too much into the omission during the podcast interview.“That was not an exclusive list,” said Trump adviser Jason Miller. Still, Trump continued to deride Pence in the interview, falsely claiming Pence had the authority to unilaterally overturn the results of the election, even though he did not.Trump has not said whether he will seek the White House again in 2024. If he doesn't, other Republicans are making clear they won't cede the race to Pence. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for instance, is already visiting the critical primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire.Since leaving office in January, Pence, who served as Indiana's governor and a member of Congress before being tapped as Trump's running mate, has kept a lower profile.He's pieced together a portfolio aimed at maintaining influence, paying the bills and laying the groundwork for an expected presidential run.He's forged a partnerships with the conservative Heritage Foundation and has even been discussed as a potential president of the organization, according to two people familiar with the discussions.He's joined the Young America's Foundation and a top speakers' bureau, penned an op-ed for the Daily Signal in which he perpetuated falsehoods about the 2020 election, and recently toured a Christian relief organization in North Carolina.He will make his first public speech since leaving office next month at the Palmetto Family Council's annual fundraiser in South Carolina, another crucial primary state.Pence has also discussed writing a book, according to aides, has been in continued conversation with his evangelical allies, and plans to spend much of the next two years helping Republican candidates as they try to reclaim House and Senate majorities in 2022.He's also planning to launch an advocacy organization that aides and allies say will give him a platform to defend the Trump administration's record and push back on the current president's policies as he tries to merge the traditional conservative movement with Trumpism.“He's doing what he needs to be doing to lay the groundwork in the event he wants to set up an exploratory committee,” Stewart said.“You have to make money, lay the groundwork, gauge the support and then pull the trigger."Pence's allies see him as the natural Trump heir, someone who can keep his base engaged while winning back suburban voters who left the party in droves during the Trump era.“Obviously Mike Pence has a very different persona, a very different tone. That probably is an understatement,” said former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a longtime friend who now leads the Young America's Foundation."As long as he can still talk about the things that Trump voters care about, but do so in a way that's more reflective of kind of a Midwesterner, that I think ... would be attractive to those voters.”Skeptics, meanwhile, see another old, milquetoast white man saddled with Trump's baggage, but without his charisma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-heir-mike-pence-reemerges-lays-groundwork-for-2024-run-101617090880652.html
30-03-2021||World||Syria says Assad, his wife have recovered from coronavirus||Syrian President Bashar Assad and his wife have recovered from COVID-19 and returned to their regular duties on Tuesday, three weeks after they had tested positive for the coronavirus, the president's office said.According to the statement, Syria's first couple had their PCR tests and the results were negative, and the mild symptoms of the virus that they had experienced before were now gone.Assad, 55, and his wife, Asma, who is 10 years younger and had announced her recovery from breast cancer in 2019, had isolated themselves since testing positive on March 8.Syria is witnessing a sharp increase in cases. Earlier this month, state media has reported that intensive care units in state hospitals in the capital of Damascus were full and that medical staff have been called to stay on alert to deal with coronavirus patients.Syria has been mired in civil war for 10 years since anti-government protests that began as part of Arab Spring uprisings turned into an insurgency in response to a military crackdown. A decade of fighting has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.Syrian authorities have so far registered more than 18,000 cases of the coronavirus and 1,247 deaths in government-held parts of the country, where the first case was reported in March last year.According to the World Health Organization, there are nearly 21,000 cases in the last rebel stronghold in Syria’s northwest along the border with Turkey, as well as some 9,000 cases in areas controlled by US-backed Kurdish-led fighters in the northeast.The real numbers are believed to be much higher, as testing is limited. Many Syrians cannot afford PCR tests amid the country’s severe economic crisis.The pandemic, which has severely tested even developed countries, has been a major challenge for Syria’s health care sector, already depleted by 10 years of conflict. The conflict has killed more than half a million people and displaced half of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million.WHO said last week it will oversee a coronavirus vaccination campaign in Syria that is expected to start in April, with the aim of inoculating 20% of the population by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syria-says-assad-his-wife-have-recovered-from-coronavirus-101617090131048.html
30-03-2021||World||Asian countries scramble for vaccine supplies after India export curbs||Several Asian countries scrambled to find alternative sources for Covid-19 inoculations on Tuesday after export restrictions by manufacturer India left a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine sharing programme short of supplies.South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines are among countries to be hit by shipment delays to vaccines they have been promised under the COVAX programme, which was created mainly to ensure supplies for poorer countries."Our planned increase in daily vaccinations will be affected," Carlito Galvez, Philippines' vaccination chief, told reporters.India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, put a temporary hold on exports of AstraZeneca's vaccine being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), as officials focus on meeting rising domestic demand.The Serum Insitute was due to deliver 90 million vaccine doses to COVAX over March and April and, while it was not immediately clear how many would be diverted for domestic use, programme facilitators warned that shipment delays were inevitable.South Korea confirmed it would only receive 432,000 doses of the 690,000 it had been promised and delivery of those would be delayed until around the third week of April."There's uncertainty over global vaccine supplies but we're working on a plan to ensure no disruptions in the second quarter and making efforts to secure more vaccines," Kim Ki-nam, head of South Korea's Covid-19 vaccination task force team. Officials said they were in talks with AstraZeneca to accelerate shipments procured through a separate deal.Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte loosened government restrictions on private sector imports of vaccines, pleading with companies to obtain supplies no matter the cost, as his country battles a resurgence of the pandemic.In Vietnam, officials have similarly asked the private sector to step in after their COVAX supplies were slashed by 40% to 811,200 doses and shipments were pushed back by weeks.In Indonesia, health ministry official Siti Nadia Tarmizi told Reuters that 10.3 million doses from COVAX were likely delayed until May.India has not provided details on the length of its export curb but UNICEF, a distributing partner of COVAX, said at the weekend that deliveries are expected to resume by May.India's decision is the latest in a series of setbacks for the COVAX facility, relied on by 64 poorer countries, after production glitches and a lack of funding contribution from wealthy nations.China and RussiaChina and Russia are primed to step into the breach."We have good diplomatic relations with China and Russia and we are asking if we can have access to their vaccines in April," the Philippines' Galvez said.Both the Philippines and Indonesia are currently relying heavily on vaccines from China's Sinovac Biotech to run their inoculation drives. The Philippines and Vietnam have both approved Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, along with more than 50 other countries, mainly developing nations. The Philippines expects to receive its first batch of Sputnik V in April.Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm, meanwhile, plans to produce its Covid-19 vaccine at a new plant in the United Arab Emirates.The spate of export curbs is also being felt by wealthier countries that are reliant on foreign manufacturing, including Japan, where the national vaccine rollout has been slow due to the limited number of Pfizer vaccines shipped from Europe."Some people are using vaccines for diplomacy, some people are trying to prioritize. Some people are buying like three to five times as many vaccines compared to their population. That's unnecessary," Japan's vaccine minister, Taro Kono, told Reuters on Monday in an interview."We really need to have the global leaders sit down and think this is a global issue, not the domestic issue, and try to solve this together."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-countries-scramble-for-vaccine-supplies-after-india-export-curbs-101617088147403.html
30-03-2021||World||Covid-19 origin study points to Bats, animal hosts as pathway||The coronavirus probably spread from bats to humans via another animal, according to the long-awaited results of a joint World Health Organization-China study into the origins of Covid-19.The authors suggest that the most productive research would be to find such an animal link, saying the hypothesis of lab leaks was extremely unlikely, according to a draft of the report, which was obtained by Bloomberg News before it’s due to be published Tuesday. The scientists suggested future studies take a wider geographical approach, including Southeast Asia, and investigate susceptible animal species more closely.The findings mirror what researchers said last month, at the end of their mission to Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the first Covid cases emerged at the end of 2019, and in their subsequent public comments. Possible host species include mink, pangolins, rabbits and ferret badgers, the report said.The hunt for the virus’s origin has been shrouded in controversy since the start of the pandemic, with China criticized for delaying access to scientists and both Beijing and Washington pushing alternative theories about how Covid began. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday all hypotheses are on the table and warrant complete and further studies. The expert team will brief member states on Tuesday and will then publish the report to the public.The Associated Press published comments from the report earlier. It was conducted by a team made up of both international and Chinese experts. The WHO has repeatedly said the report’s conclusions are independent and belong to the authors.Pandemic PreventionWhile the search has become highly politicized, governments and scientists agree that deciphering the virus’s creation story is key to reducing the risk of future pandemics. The research was aimed at galvanizing efforts to trace the origin of the virus that touched off the worst pandemic in more than a century, as well as its route of transmission to humans and the possible role of an intermediate animal host.A spillover from bats via another animal is the most likely scenario in the report, followed by direct spillover. Introduction through frozen food was deemed possible, and a laboratory accident considered extremely unlikely.Still, the report noted that the Wuhan CDC laboratory moved in early December to a location near the Huanan market, and “such moves can be disruptive for the operations of any laboratory.”However, the research center didn’t report any disruptions or incidents that would have been caused by the move, and it wasn’t storing or testing coronaviruses or bat viruses ahead of the outbreak, the report said. The authors also said that the three laboratories working in Wuhan on coronaviruses and vaccines had high biosafety levels and there was no evidence of Covid spreading among workers there.The U.S. government has questioned whether the WHO-convened experts were given enough access to reach a reliable conclusion. Top Biden administration officials on Sunday expressed concern about the way the WHO-China report was crafted, including the possibility that the Chinese government had a hand in writing it.The U.S. has “real concerns about the methodology and the process” of the report, including that the Chinese government “apparently helped to write it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CNN.China has been trying to deflect criticism of its handling of the pandemic amid growing scrutiny over the pathogen’s origins, including speculation promoted by the former Trump administration that the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab.Beijing has suggested the virus may have arrived in China through refrigerated goods and has urged the WHO to carry out investigations in other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-study-points-to-bats-animal-hosts-as-pathway-101617084548249.html
30-03-2021||World||WHO to release long-awaited expert report on Covid-19 origin today||The long-awaited report on the origin of the coronavirus (Covid-19) will be released on Tuesday by the World Health Organization (WHO). Speaking at a news conference on Monday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed receiving the full mission report over the weekend. "All hypotheses are on the table and warrant complete and further studies," he said during the briefing.The report has been drafted by a team of international experts appointed by the WHO who visited China's Wuhan city earlier this year. The seafood market in Wuhan was the Covid-19 cluster of human cases in December 2019. Since then, the infection has now spread to almost all the countries killing more than 2.7 million people.According to the preliminary information on the study, the researchers have found that Covid-19 most likely transmitted to humans via animals. However, the report offers no conclusive answers to the origin questions.The report is being closely watched by scientists around the world as the findings can help them prevent future pandemics.What are the findings?The researchers have listed four possible scenarios through which Covid-19 could have transmitted to humans, various news agencies reported. The reasons are mentioned in order of likelihood and a possibility of Covid-19 transmission from bats through another animal tops the list.Direct spread from bats to humans is listed as likely in the report, while the possibility of Covid-19 spreading through the packaging of “cold-chain” food products is "unlikely".The report listed a possibility of the virus' leakage from the laboratory under the "extremely unlikely" category.The team has proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis. It also said the role played by a seafood market where human cases were first identified was uncertain.Doubts remainThe expert report has a troubled past. From delay in publication to China's resistance to giving access to diplomats, all of these hurdles have raised questions about whether the Chinese side was trying to skew its conclusions.Emphasizing more information is required to ascertain the origin of Covid-19, Matthew Kavanagh of Georgetown University said, "It is clear that that the Chinese government has not provided all the data needed and, until they do, firmer conclusions will be difficult," news agency AP reported.United States' Secretary of States, Anthony Blinken also raised concerns regarding the methodology and the process of the investigation. "We’ve got real concerns about the methodology and the process that went into that report, including the fact that the government in Beijing apparently helped to write it," Blinken was quoted as saying by CNN.The top expert of infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci said he would like to read the report first then decide about its credibility. "I want to read the report first and then get a feel for what they really had access to - or did not have access to," AP quoted Fauci as saying."I’d also would like to inquire as to the extent in which the people who were on that group had access directly to the data that they would need to make a determination,” he also said as per an AP report.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-to-release-long-awaited-expert-report-on-covid-19-origin-today-101617079839152.html
30-03-2021||World||Probe underway, day after cargo ship freed in Suez Canal||Experts on Tuesday boarded a colossal container ship that had been stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal before it was freed as questions swirled about the grounding that had shaken the global shipping industry and clogged one of the world's most vital waterways.The Ever Given was anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, after salvage teams succeeded in finally freeing the skyscraper-size vessel on Monday afternoon. The ship, stuck sideways in a narrow stretch of the canal, had halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.A senior canal pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to journalists, told The Associated Press the experts were looking for signs of possible damage and trying to determine the cause of the vessel's grounding.Engineers were examining the engines of the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship hauling goods from Asia to Europe to determine when exactly it can sail to its destination in the Netherlands, he said without elaborating.Ships stacked with containers could be seen from the city of Suez, sailing in the north-bound part of the waterway. Suez Canal service provider Leth Agencies said that over three dozen vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed, have already exited the canal into the Red Sea since the waterway was reopened for navigation at 6 p.m. on Monday.The shipowner, Shoei Kisen, said Tuesday that it will be part of the investigation, which would also include other parties, though it did not identify them by name. It also refused to discuss possible causes of the accident, including the alleged high speed and other errors, saying that it cannot comment on the investigation that is still going on.The company added that any damage to the ship was believed to be mostly on the bottom. Shoei Kisen said it was not immediately known whether the vessel will be repaired on site in Egypt or elsewhere, or whether it will eventually head to its initial destination of Rotterdam. That is a decision to be made by its operator, rather than the shipowner, the company said.On Monday, a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of Ever Given from the canal’s sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged since March 23. The tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule.Analysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end of the Suez Canal.The Ever Given had crashed last Tuesday into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That created a massive traffic jam that held up $9 billion a day in global trade and strained supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic.At least 367 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, had backed up to wait to traverse the canal. Dozens of others have taken the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip — a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.The canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Monday's events after days of silence about the blockage.“Egyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis,” he wrote on Facebook, “despite the massive technical complexity.”The crisis over the Ever Given had cast a spotlight on the vital trade route that carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the world’s oil. Over 19,000 ships ferrying Chinese-made consumer goods and millions of barrels of oil and liquified natural gas flow through the artery from the Middle East and Asia to Europe and North America.The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, has prompted new questions about the shipping industry, an on-demand supplier for a world under pressure from the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/probe-underway-day-after-cargo-ship-freed-in-suez-canal-101617084479020.html

It was not immediately clear what weapon it was but it was believed to be some type of grenade launcher.State television said security forces used "riot weapons" to disperse a crowd of "violent terrorist people" who were destroying a pavement and one man was wounded.A South Dagon resident said on Tuesday security forces had been cracking down in the area overnight, raising concern of more casualties."There was shooting all night," said the resident who declined to be identified.Residents found a badly burned body on a street in the morning, the resident said, adding it was not known what had happened to the person and the military took the body away.Police and a junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Myanmar's generals to stop the killings and repression of demonstrations.In a new tactic, protesters sought to step up a civil disobedience campaign by asking residents to leave garbage at main road intersections."This garbage strike is a strike to oppose the junta," read a poster on social media. "Everyone can join."Pictures posted on social media showed piles of rubbish building up in Yangon.The campaign comes in defiance of calls issued via loudspeakers in some neighbourhoods of Yangon on Monday urging residents to dispose of garbage properly.'Unacceptable'At least 510 civilians had been killed in nearly two months of opposition to the ouster of an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and the return of military rule after a decade of tentative steps towards democracy, according to a tally by the AAPP advocacy group.The total killed on Saturday, the bloodiest day of the protests, had risen to 141, its figures showed.One of the main groups behind the protests, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities, called on Monday in an open letter for ethnic minority forces to help those standing up to the "unfair oppression" of the military.In a sign that the call may be gaining more traction, three groups - the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army (AA) and Ta’ang National Liberation Army - called in a joint statement on Tuesday for the military to stop killing protesters and resolve political issues.If not, they said they would cooperate with all ethnic groups "who are joining Myanmar's spring revolution" to defend themselves."This kind of brutal killing of innocent civilians is unacceptable," AA spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters in an audio message.Insurgents from different ethnic groups have battled the central government for decades for greater autonomy. Though many groups have agreed to ceasefires, fighting has flared in recent days between the army and forces in both the east and north.Heavy clashes erupted on the weekend near the Thai border between the army and fighters from Myanmar's oldest ethnic minority force, the Karen National Union (KNU), which has also denounced the coup.About 3,000 villagers fled to Thailand when military jets bombed a KNU area after a KNU force overran an army outpost and killed 10 soldiers, an activist group and media said.Thai authorities denied accounts by activist groups that more than 2,000 refugees had been forced back, but a Thai official said it was government policy for the army to block them at the border and deny access to outside aid groups.Myanmar's military has for decades justified its grip on power by saying it is the only institution capable of preserving national unity. It seized power saying that November elections won by Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the election commission.US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the United States was suspending all trade engagement with Myanmar until the return of a democratically elected government.But foreign criticism and Western sanctions have failed to sway the generals and Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also in custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-launch-garbage-strike-as-death-toll-tops-500-101617079070318.html

The total killed on Saturday, the bloodiest day so far, had risen to 141, figures showed.The White House condemned the killings of civilians as an "abhorrent" use of lethal force and renewed a call for the restoration of democracy, while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Myanmar's generals to stop the killings and repression of demonstrations.Monday's dead included at least eight in the South Dagon suburb of Myanmar's main city, Yangon, the AAPP said.Security forces there fired a much heavier-calibre weapon than usual to clear a barricade of sand bags, witnesses said and a video clip showed. It was not immediately clear what type, although a community group posted a picture of a soldier with a grenade launcher.State television said security forces used "riot weapons" to disperse a crowd of "violent terrorist people" who were destroying a pavement and one man was wounded.Police and a junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.Two people were also killed in shooting in the central town of Myingyan, student leader Moe Myint Hein told Reuters.Despite the violence, crowds turned out in towns across the country, according to media and social media posts.One of the main groups behind the protests, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities, called in an open letter on Facebook for ethnic minority forces to help those standing up to the "unfair oppression" of the military."It is necessary for the ethnic armed organisations to collectively protect the people," the group said.'HEARTLESS ACT'Insurgents from different ethnic groups have battled the central government for decades for greater autonomy.

It seized power saying that November elections won by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the election commission.Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also in custody.When asked for his message to Myanmar's generals, Guterres told reporters: "Stop the killings, stop the repression of the demonstrations, release the political prisoners, and return power to those that have legitimate right to exercise it."U.N. Special Rapporteur for Myanmar Tom Andrews said the army was carrying out "mass murder". U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the United States was suspending all trade engagement with Myanmar until the return of a democratically elected government.But foreign criticism and Western sanctions have failed to sway the generals.China and India have declined to condemn the coup and Russia has maintained its close ties with a visit by a Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin and a pledge to beef up military ties.

The move followed a recommendation from the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (NACI).Health Canada said in a statement the action came in the light of information being reported from Europe about additional cases of “very rare adverse events” of “thrombosis (blood clots) with thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) occurring after immunisation with the AstraZeneca vaccine”.Canada has so far received 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, all manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) under the Covishield brand name. The vaccines had arrived in the country on March 3, part of a larger two-million-dose deal that had come into effect after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had requested his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for Covid-19 vaccine supplies during a telephone conversation on February 9. Canada has so far utilised over 60% of that tranche, which comes to more than 300,000 doses, according to health authorities. Health Canada, however, clarified that till date “no cases of these events (side effects such as possible blood clots) have been reported in Canada”.Health Canada is issuing “additional terms and conditions” to SII and its Canadian partner Verity Pharmaceuticals in the Greater Toronto Area. “These will include a requirement that the manufacturers conduct a detailed assessment of the benefits and risks of the vaccine by age and sex in the Canadian context,” the agency said in a statement. The information sought will “support the ongoing evaluation of these rare blood clotting events” and allow Health Canada to “determine if there are specific groups of people who may be at higher risk”.Health Canada said it is in discussion with AstraZeneca on this “evolving issue”. “We need to take a pause and look and examine the evolving nature of what’s happening in Europe,” Canada’s deputy chief public health officer Dr Howard Njoo told reporters.Health Canada also said it “will assess this information when it is received and will determine if additional regulatory actions are necessary”.Njoo said those who were vaccinated 20 days earlier and didn’t suffer any adverse reaction were safe, but if those more recently administered with the AZ jab suffered such side effects, they should immediately contact their healthcare provider. NACI said symptoms to be “vigilant” about included shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, neurological symptoms including sudden onset of severe or persistent worsening headaches or blurred vision and skin bruising other than at the site of vaccination.In its recommendation announced earlier in the day, NACI said the vaccine “should not be used in adults under 55 years of age at this time while the safety signal of Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) following vaccination with AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is investigated further”.Cases identified in this regard, it pointed out, “have been primarily in women under the age of 55 years; although cases in men have also been reported and have mostly occurred between four and 16 days after receipt of vaccine”.NACI said that based on information from the European Medicines Agency on March 18, it had earlier been estimated at about 1 per 1 million people, but a higher rate of 1 per 100,000 was reported by the Paul-Ehrlich Institut in Germany this month.“Decisions” about the administration of a second dose of the AZ vaccine to those below 55 “will be determined based on the latest evidence and research”, the committee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-suspends-use-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-those-under-55-101617079548293.html

Spendthrift!!!" Li Yang tweeted on Sunday.This comes a day after China had announced sanctions against two American religious-rights officials and a Canadian MP in response to western countries' sanctions on Beijing over the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.Those targeted by the new sanctions by China include Gayle Manchin, chairwoman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, and its vice-chairman Tony Perkins; Canadian MP Michael Chong and members of the Canadian Commons subcommittee on international human rights, South China Morning Post reported.However, the United States condemned China's sanctions and said that Beijing's attempt to silence criticism of human rights abuse in Xinjiang invites international scrutiny.Taking to Twitter, US Secretary Antony Blinken said, "We condemn the People's Republic of China's sanctions on two members of the independent and bipartisan @USCIRF (US Commission on International Religious Freedom). Beijing's attempt to silence criticism of serious human rights abuse in Xinjiang only contributes to growing international scrutiny."Recently in a press briefing, Trudeau slammed China's treatment of two of its nationals there, saying it threatens both 'respect for the rule of law' and Beijing's relationships with Western nations."China needs to understand that it is not just about two Canadians. It is about the respect for the rule of law and relationships with a broad range of Western countries that is at play with the arbitrary detention and the coercive diplomacy they have engaged in," said Trudeau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-consul-general-slams-trudeau-calls-canada-running-dog-of-us-101617079141438.html
30-03-2021||World||'Deadly serious': Biden, CDC director warn of virus rebound if nation lets up||President Joe Biden and a top health official warned that too many Americans are declaring virus victory too quickly, appealing for mask requirements and other restrictions to be maintained or restored to stave off a “fourth surge” of Covid-19. The head of the CDC said she had a feeling of “impending doom” if people keep easing off.The double dose of warnings on Monday came even as Biden laid out hopeful new steps to expand coronavirus vaccinations, with all adults to become eligible over the next five weeks. Biden announced plans to expand the number of retail pharmacies that are administering vaccines, and investments to help Americans get to vaccination sites. But the optimism was tempered by stark warnings about the potential for another wave of cases.“This is deadly serious,” Biden said, urging governors to reinstate mask mandates and other restrictions that some states have been easing.Hours earlier, during a virtual White House health briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, grew emotional as she reflected on her experience treating Covid-19 patients who are alone at the end of their lives.“We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope," she said. "But right now, I'm scared.”“I'm going to lose the script, and I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom."Cases of the virus are up about 10% over the past week from the previous week, to about 60,000 cases per day, with both hospitalizations and deaths ticking up as well, Walensky said. She warned that without immediate action the US could follow European countries into another spike in cases and suffer needless deaths.“I have to share the truth, and I have to hope and trust you will listen,” she said.Later Monday, Biden addressed the nation from the White House, declaring, “If we let our guard down now, we can see the virus getting worse, not better. People are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing.”Biden delivered a direct appeal to governors, state and local leaders to reinstate mask-wearing requirements if they have lifted them, and said he encouraged leaders to pause plans to further ease virus-related restrictions.“Please, this is not politics, reinstate the mandate if you let it down," he said.Biden announced that by April 19 at least 90% of the adult U.S. population would be eligible for vaccination — and would have access to a vaccination site within 5 miles of home. Quick vaccination would still depend on supply.Biden had previously directed that all states make all adults eligible for vaccination by May 1, but many have moved to lift eligibility requirements sooner in anticipation of supply increases.Meanwhile, the White House is moving to double the number of pharmacies participating in the federal retail pharmacy program — it has emerged as among the most efficient avenues for administering vaccines — and increase the number of doses for them to deliver. Retail pharmacies are located relatively close to most Americans and have experience delivering vaccines like flu shots.Biden announced that the US is expecting delivery of 33 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine this week — including 11 million of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot.More than 1 in 5 adults and nearly 50% of senior American are fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC. On Thursday, the UD set new single-day record for shots in arms: more than 3.2 million.“Now is not the time to let down," Biden said. “Now's not the time to celebrate. It is time to do what we do best as a country: our duty, our jobs, take care of one another.""Fight to the finish,” he added. "Don't let up now.”Walensky and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, appealed to elected officials, community leaders and everyday Americans to maintain social distancing measures and mask wearing."We are doing things prematurely,” Fauci said, referring to moves to ease up on restrictions. Walensky appealed to Americans, “Just please hold on a little while longer.”She added: “We are not powerless, we can change this trajectory of the pandemic."Walensky pointed to an uptick in travel and loosening virus restrictions for the increase in cases. “People want to be done with this. I, too, want to be done with this,” she said."We've seen surges after every single holiday,” she reiterated: “Please limit travel to essential travel for the time being.”The White House, meanwhile is ruling out the creation of a national “vaccine passport” for Americans to verify their immunization status, saying it is leaving it to the private sector to develop a system for people show they've been vaccinated. Some other countries are establishing national databases to allow vaccinated people to resume normal activities.“We do know that there is a segment of the population that is concerned that the government will play too heavy-handed of a role in monitoring their vaccinations," said White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt. He said officials are worried that “it would discourage people” from getting vaccinated if the federal government was involved.The administration, instead, is developing guidelines for such passports, touching on privacy, accuracy and equity, but the White House has not said when those guidelines will be ready.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-serious-biden-cdc-director-warn-of-virus-rebound-if-nation-lets-up-101617078104862.html
30-03-2021||World||China's parliament approves Hong Kong electoral system reform plan||Beijing approved a sweeping overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system on Tuesday, a senior politician who works with China's parliament on matters relating to the former British colony's mini-constitution, told Reuters.The measures are part of Beijing's efforts to consolidate its increasingly authoritarian grip over the global financial hub following the imposition of a national security law in June, which critics see as a tool to crush dissent.Maria Tam said Hong Kong's election committee, in charge of selecting the city's chief executive, will pick 40 representatives of the city's legislature as part of the reforms approved by the National People's Congress Standing Committee.The number of directly elected representatives to the city's legislature will fall to 20 from 35 as part of the reforms, Tam added. The size of the legislature will increase to 90 from 70 currently.Beijing will also increase the size of the electoral committee from 1,200 to 1,500, as part of the restructuring.Chinese authorities have said the shake-up is aimed at getting rid of "loopholes and deficiencies" that threatened national security during anti-government unrest in 2019 and to ensure only "patriots" run the city.The measures are the most significant overhaul of Hong Kong's political structure since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and alter the size and composition of the legislature and electoral committee in favour of pro-Beijing figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-parliament-approves-hong-kong-electoral-system-reform-plan-101617075101664.html
30-03-2021||World||Mediator, France’s biggest modern health scandal, explained||A Paris court on Monday found pharmaceutical giant Servier guilty in a case which involved Mediator, said to be a medicine for diabetes and weight loss. The case is one of the biggest health scandals in France and involved thousands of plaintiffs ever since the trial opened in September 2019. With nearly 400 lawyers and thousands of defendants taking part in the trial, it was spread across five rooms in the Paris courthouse.The company Servier, which is headquartered in a Paris suburb and employs nearly 22,000 people worldwide, generated around 4.6 billion euros in revenue in 2020. It was accused of prioritising profits over the lives of patients. Jacques Servier, the company's CEO and founder, was indicted early in the trial but died in 2014.What happened in the scandal?The Mediator drug which is at the heart of the scandal was in the market for 33 years and is said to have been used by around 5 million people, according to a study in 2010. Originally a medication for diabetes, the drug was also widely prescribed for reducing weight as it was considered an appetite suppressant. The drug is suspected to have caused 1,000-2,000 deaths as doctors linked it to heart and lung problems.Read more: A statement by Nike, H&M on Uighurs. One year later, a backlash by BeijingWhen were the first concerns raised?In France, the drug was flagged as early as 1998 by a doctor. Servier also faced questions about the side effects of the drug from the medical authorities in Switzerland, Spain and Italy which led to the company withdrawing the drug in those markets between 1997 and 2004. In France, which was the main market of the drug, the company suspended sales in 2009; 10 years after the first cases came to light. This was prompted by an independent investigation into the side effects of the drug.What happened in the trial?Servier was accused of manslaughter, involuntary injury, fraud and influence trading in the trial along with colluding with the national medicines agency and hiding the dangers of the drug. Although, lawyers for Servier argued that the company was not aware of the risks that Mediator posed before 2009. The company also reiterated that it never said that Mediator could be used as an appetite suppressant.What did the court rule?The court found Servier guilty of “aggravated fraud” and “involuntary manslaughter” and fined the company €2.7 million (approximately $3.2 million) over the scandal. France’s medicines regulator ANSM (L’Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé) was also fined €303,000 (approximately $356,000) and the company’s former deputy boss, Jean-Philippe Seta, was handed a prison sentence of four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mediator-france-s-biggest-modern-health-scandal-explained-101617078561403.html
30-03-2021||World||Pfizer, Moderna Covid-19 vaccines highly effective after first shot: Study||Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc reduced risk of infection by 80% two weeks or more after the first of two shots, according to data from a real-world US study released on Monday.The risk of infection fell 90% by two weeks after the second shot, the study of nearly 4,000 US healthcare personnel and first responders found.The results validate earlier studies that had indicated the vaccines begin to work soon after a first dose, and confirm that they also prevent asymptomatic infections.Some countries dealing with limited vaccine supplies have pushed back schedules for second doses with the hope of getting some protection to more people. US public health officials, however, continue to recommend two doses be given on the schedule authorized by regulators based on clinical trials.The study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluated the vaccines' ability to protect against infection, including infections that did not cause symptoms. Previous clinical trials by the companies evaluated their vaccine's efficacy in preventing illness from Covid-19, but those studies would have missed asymptomatic infections.The findings from of the real-world use of these messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines also confirm the efficacy demonstrated in the large controlled clinical trials conducted before they received emergency use authorizations from the US Food and Drug Administration.The study looked at the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines among 3,950 participants in six states over a 13-week period from Dec. 14, 2020 to March 13, 2021. About 74% had at least one shot, and tests were conducted weekly to catch any infections without symptoms."The authorized mRNA Covid-19 vaccines provided early, substantial real-world protection against infection for our nation's healthcare personnel, first responders, and other frontline essential workers," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.The new mRNA technology is a synthetic form of a natural chemical messenger being used to instruct cells to make proteins that mirror part of the novel coronavirus. That teaches the immune system to recognize and attack the actual virus.The CDC study comes weeks after real-world data from Israel suggested that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infections.Britain and Canada were among the countries that have allowed extended gaps between doses of up to three or four months. UK authorities said in January that data supported its decision for a 12-week gap between doses.Pfizer and its German partner have warned that they had no evidence to prove that. In their pivotal trials, there was a three-week gap between Pfizer shots and four weeks for the Moderna vaccine.The CDC said the study results on Monday provide reassurance that people start to develop protection from the vaccine two weeks after their first dose, although the agency reiterated that the greatest protection was seen among those who had received both recommended doses of the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-highly-effective-after-first-shot-study-101617071651194.html

They are living in squalor, they are living like nobody has ever seen," Trump said, referring to conditions on the border.Since Biden took office, a surge of migrants including unaccompanied minors has tried to cross into the US.Trump's administration drew criticism for dividing families at the border and keeping children in what some critics described as "cages."He also referenced the November election, once again raising questions as to the integrity of the result even though he lost by seven million votes and all his attempts to challenge the outcome failed.At the end of the former president's speech, he praised the newlyweds."You are a great and beautiful couple," the 74-year-old businessman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/miss-me-yet-trump-talks-about-self-in-speech-at-couple-s-wedding-101617072351772.html
30-03-2021||World||Jurors shown video at ex-officer's trial in George Floyd's death||The video of George Floyd gasping for breath was essentially Exhibit A as the former Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on the Black man’s neck went on trial Monday on charges of murder and manslaughter.Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell showed the jurors the footage at the earliest opportunity, during opening statements, after telling them that the number to remember was 9 minutes, 29 seconds — the amount of time officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the pavement last May.The white officer “didn’t let up" even after a handcuffed Floyd said 27 times that he couldn’t breathe and went limp, Blackwell said in the case that triggered worldwide protests, scattered violence and national soul-searching over racial justice.“He put his knees upon his neck and his back, grinding and crushing him, until the very breath — no, ladies and gentlemen — until the very life was squeezed out of him,” the prosecutor said.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson countered by arguing: “Derek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career.”Floyd was fighting efforts to put him in a squad car as the crowd of onlookers around Chauvin and his fellow officers grew and became increasingly hostile, Nelson said.The defense attorney also disputed that Chauvin was to blame for Floyd’s death.Floyd, 46, had none of the telltale signs of asphyxiation and he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system, Nelson said. He said Floyd’s drug use, combined with his heart disease, high blood pressure and the adrenaline flowing through his body, caused a heart rhythm disturbance that killed him.“There is no political or social cause in this courtroom,” Nelson said. “But the evidence is far greater than 9 minutes and 29 seconds.”Blackwell, however, rejected the argument that Floyd’s drug use or any underlying health conditions were to blame, saying it was the officer's knee that killed him.Chauvin, 45, is charged with unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The most serious charge, the second-degree murder count, carries up to 40 years in prison. This is the first trial ever televised in Minnesota.Bystander Donald Williams, who said he was trained in mixed martial arts, including chokeholds, testified that Chauvin appeared to increase the pressure on Floyd's neck several times with a shimmying motion. He said he yelled to the officer that he was cutting off Floyd's blood supply.Williams recalled that Floyd’s voice grew thicker as his breathing became more labored, and he eventually stopped moving. He said he saw Floyd’s eyes roll back in his head, likening the sight to fish he had caught earlier that day.Williams said he saw Floyd “slowly fade away ... like a fish in a bag.”Earlier, Minneapolis police dispatcher Jena Scurry testified that she saw part of Floyd's arrest unfolding via a city surveillance camera and was so disturbed that she called a duty sergeant. Scurry said she grew concerned because the officers hadn’t moved after several minutes.“You can call me a snitch if you want to,” Scurry said in her call to the sergeant, which was played in court. She said she wouldn't normally call the sergeant about the use of force because it was beyond the scope of her duties, but “my instincts were telling me that something is wrong.”The video played during opening statements was posted to Facebook by a bystander who witnessed Floyd being arrested after he was accused of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. The footage caused revulsion across the U.S. and beyond and prompted calls for the country to confront racism and police brutality.Jurors watched intently as the video played on multiple screens, with one drawing a sharp breath as Floyd said he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin sat calmly during opening statements and took notes, looking up at the video periodically.“My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts,” Floyd says in the video, and: “I can’t breathe, officer.” Onlookers repeatedly shout at the officer to get off Floyd, saying he is not moving, breathing or resisting. One woman, identifying herself as a city Fire Department employee, shouts at Chauvin to check Floyd’s pulse.The prosecutor said the case was “not about split-second decision-making” by a police officer but excessive force against someone who was handcuffed and not resisting.Blackwell said the Fire Department employee wanted to help but was warned off by Chauvin, who pointed Mace at her.“She wanted to check on his pulse, check on Mr. Floyd’s well-being,” the prosecutor said. “She did her best to intervene. ... She couldn’t help.”The timeline differs from the initial account submitted last May by prosecutors, who said Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds. The time 8:46 soon became a rallying cry in the case. But it was revised during the investigation.Fourteen jurors or alternates are hearing the case — eight of them white, six of them Black or multiracial, according to the court. Only 12 will deliberate; the judge has not said which two will be alternates.Before the trial began, Floyd family attorney Ben Crump blasted the idea that the trial would be a tough test for jurors."We know that if George Floyd was a white American citizen, and he suffered this painful, tortuous death with a police officer’s knee on his neck, nobody, nobody, would be saying this is a hard case,” he said.After the day's proceedings, a few hundred protesters gathered outside the courthouse. Speakers called for justice for Floyd and others whose lives were lost in encounters with police. One speaker, Jaylani Hussein, screamed: “Police officers are not above the law!”The downtown Minneapolis courthouse has been fortified with concrete barriers, fences and barbed and razor wire. City and state leaders are determined to prevent a repeat of the riots that followed Floyd’s death, with National Guard troops already mobilized.Chauvin’s trial is being livestreamed over the objections of the prosecution. Judge Peter Cahill ordered that cameras be allowed largely because of the pandemic and the required social distancing, which left almost no room for spectators in the courtroom.Three other former officers go on trial in August because Cahill ruled there wasn't enough space to try all four at once.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jurors-shown-video-at-ex-officer-s-trial-in-george-floyd-s-death-101617070201521.html
30-03-2021||World||North Korea's Kim Yo Jong calls South's president 'a parrot raised by America'||North Korea called South Korea’s president “a parrot raised by America” Tuesday, resuming its trademark derisive rhetoric against its rivals amid renewed animosities on the Korean Peninsula.Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, issued the latest verbal salvo after South Korean President Moon Jae-in criticized the North’s ballistic missile launches last week. She said Moon’s “illogical and brazen-faced” comments echoed the US stance.“We can hardly repress astonishment at his shamelessness,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by the North's state media. “He cannot feel sorry for being ‘praised’ as a parrot raised by America.”The United States, South Korea and the United Nations all condemned the North's missile launches, the first of their kind in a year, as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.On Saturday, Ri Pyong Chol, a top deputy to Kim Jong Un, called President Joe Biden’s criticism of the North’s missile tests a provocation and encroachment on the North’s right to self-defense. Ri said it was “gangster-like logic” for Washington to criticize the North’s launches while the U.S. freely tested intercontinental ballistic missiles.North Korea has a history of using colorfully harsh insults against rivals.Before entering now-stalled nuclear talks with the United States in 2018, Kim Jong Un called then President Donald Trump “the mentally deranged US dotard” after Trump called him a “little rocket man.”In 2019, North Korea called Biden, then a presidential hopeful, a “rabid dog” and a “fool of low IQ” when it criticized his comments about its leadership.Some experts say North Korea’s recent missile launches and tough language are meant to increase pressure on the Biden administration as it’s shaping its policy on North Korea. They say North Korea eventually wants the United States to relax sanctions on the North while accepting it as a nuclear weapons state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-yo-jong-calls-south-s-president-a-parrot-raised-by-america-101617068557441.html
30-03-2021||World||'Self-promoters': Trump lashes out at Covid experts including Anthony Fauci||Former US president Donald Trump on Monday lashed out at two of the country's leading figures in the coronavirus battle after they criticized his handling of the pandemic.In an angry statement, Trump described Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx as "two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations, which I fortunately almost always overturned."Trump accused Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, of trying to take credit for vaccine development, and "moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible."The former president added that Birx, who was his coronavirus task force coordinator, was "a proven liar with very little credibility left."The bitter outburst came after Fauci told CNN how shocked he had been when Trump last April called for states to "liberate" themselves as experts pleaded with Americans to obey shutdown orders.Birx said in an interview that -- while working at the White House -- she had received a "very uncomfortable" phone call from Trump after speaking publicly about the rapid spread of Covid-19.She also said "the federal government did not provide consistent messaging to the American people and that is fault number one."The interviews with Fauci and Birx were part of a CNN documentary on the pandemic.Birx retired after a bruising time at the White House that tarnished her once stellar reputation.Fauci, 80, is now the White House's top pandemic advisor under President Joe Biden after Trump's election defeat."Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx moved far too slowly, and if it were up to them we'd currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression," Trump said.He also attacked Fauci's ability to throw a baseball, described him as "king of the flip-flops," and said "Birx was a terrible medical advisor, which is why I seldom followed her advice."Trump, who makes a habit of strong counter-attacks to any criticism, has kept a relatively low profile since leaving the White House and moving to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.Under Trump, the number of Covid-19 deaths in the United States soared to by far the world's highest toll as he resisted face masks, shutdowns and other measures to contain the pandemic.Biden has quickly ramped up vaccine distribution but also warned that the pandemic, which has killed 549,000 people in the US, remains a major threat as data shows another potential surge in infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/selfpromoters-trump-lashes-out-at-covid-experts-including-anthony-fauci-101617068266998.html
30-03-2021||World||Another woman accuses Governor Cuomo of sexual misconduct||An upstate New York woman said Monday that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo grabbed her face and kissed her cheek at her home during a visit to inspect local flood damage, becoming the latest woman to accuse the embattled governor of inappropriate behavior.Sherry Vill made the allegations during a Zoom news conference with attorney Gloria Allred, describing a spring 2017 visit to her Rochester-area home after flooding near Lake Ontario.Cuomo kissed her cheek in front of family members while inspecting her flood-damaged home in what Vill, who has been married for decades, felt was a “highly sexual manner.” He kissed her cheek again outside her home in a “very aggressive manner,” Vill said."I felt like I was being manhandled,” said Vill, now 55. Vill, who is about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, said the governor towered over her.There was no immediate comment from the Cuomo administration.A series of women, some who worked for Cuomo, have accused him of making inappropriate comments about their looks, giving them unwanted hugs or kisses, or making comments they interpreted as gauging their interest in an affair. Among his accusers are two aides who still work in the governor’s office. One, who has yet to speak publicly, reportedly said the governor groped her at the Executive Mansion last summer.Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately but said he’s sorry if he made anyone uncomfortable. The Democratic governor has brushed off widespread calls for his resignation and asked that people wait for the results of an investigation overseen by state Attorney General Letitia James.Allred said Vill would cooperate with James' investigation.The state Assembly is conducting a separate investigation into whether there are grounds to impeach the governor.The accusation Monday has similarities to allegations made by Anna Ruch, who told The New York Times that Cuomo touched her face and back and asked to kiss her moments after they met at a wedding reception.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-woman-accuses-governor-cuomo-of-sexual-misconduct-101617064490453.html
30-03-2021||World||Now, Ghislaine Maxwell charged with sex-trafficking a 14-year-old||Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, faces two new criminal counts and a new accuser who prosecutors say was about 14 when she was groomed as a victim of the duo’s alleged sex-trafficking scheme.The revised indictment raises the already steep stakes for Maxwell, 59, who could spend decades in prison if convicted. Her lawyers have argued that the government’s case is weak because it’s based on decades-old allegations from three women. On Monday, prosecutors added more heft to it, expanding the time frame of the alleged crimes from a few years in the 1990s to a decade and directly accusing Maxwell of sex trafficking of minors stretching into 2004.They had already accused her of engaging in a conspiracy with Epstein by helping recruit and groom victims and of participating in some of the alleged abuse. The new sex trafficking charge alone carries a maximum statutory prison sentence of 40 years.The girl, identified as Minor Victim-4, brought other girls to Epstein to provide him with sexualized massages, and Maxwell and other Epstein employees paid them hundreds of dollars, according to the new indictment. The government says some of the alleged crimes occurred at Maxwell’s London townhouse.Maxwell, who is fighting the charges, is scheduled to go on trial on July 12. Her lawyer Laura Menninger didn’t reply to an email seeking comment on the revised indictment.‘Normalizing’ behaviorProsecutors have said Maxwell played a critical role in “normalizing” the activity by undressing in front of the girls and taking them shopping and to the movies. Minor Victim-4 was about 14 when she met Epstein and Maxwell in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2001, prosecutors say. They claim Maxwell groomed her for sexual encounters with Epstein over a three-year period.The other new charge is sex trafficking conspiracy, for a total of eight counts, including enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts.Read the new indictment hereLast week Maxwell, who is in a federal lockup in Brooklyn, New York, lost a third attempt to be released from jail, on a $28.5 million bond and an offer to relinquish her French and British citizenship. She has been in custody since her July 2 arrest in Bradford, New Hampshire, after the judge in her case concluded that she’s a flight risk.Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan federal jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on his own sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.The case is US v. Maxwell, 20-cr-00330, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-ghislaine-maxwell-charged-with-sex-trafficking-a-14yearold-101617062661093.html
30-03-2021||World||Brazil: President Jair Bolsonaro overhauls cabinet amid Covid-19 surge||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro overhauled his government Monday, changing six cabinet members including the foreign, defense and justice ministers, as the far-right leader faced mounting pressure over a deadly surge of Covid-19.Bolsonaro, who comes up for re-election in October 2022, has drawn backlash with his handling of the pandemic in hard-hit Brazil, where the average daily death toll has nearly quadrupled since the start of the year to more than 2,600, pushing hospitals to breaking point.The shake-up comes the week after Bolsonaro replaced former health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an army general with no medical experience, with cardiologist Marcelo Queiroga, his fourth health minister of the pandemic.While speculation had been swirling that Bolsonaro was about to fire foreign minister Ernesto Araujo, who faced criticism for the government's problems securing more Covid-19 vaccines, many of the other changes came as a surprise.The president named army General Luiz Eduardo Ramos as his new chief of staff, career diplomat Carlos Franca as his new foreign minister, General Walter Souza Braga Netto -- the outgoing chief of staff -- as defense minister, and police commander Anderson Torres as justice minister.He also appointed a new attorney general, outgoing justice minister Andre Mendonca, and government secretary, Congresswoman Flavia Arruda -- the third woman in his 22-member cabinet.'Administration in crisis'Two of the former cabinet members -- defense minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva and foreign minister Araujo -- had been in their posts since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019.Azevedo e Silva's exit was unexpected, and speculation swirled over the reason.Bolsonaro has been on a purge, amid growing dissatisfaction -- including from allies in the business sector -- over his handling of a pandemic that has now claimed more than 312,000 lives in Brazil, the second-highest death toll worldwide, after the United States."The government is extremely fragile, as demonstrated by the instability at the top," said professor Mauricio Santoro of Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ)."It's safe to say there is a crisis in the administration, beyond one or two ministries."Vaccine row Bolsonaro, who has long defied expert advice on Covid-19, now appears to fear his attacks on lockdowns, face masks and particularly vaccines could be a liability heading into next year's campaign.Brazil is struggling to deal with an explosion of infections, blamed partly on a local variant that is believed to be more contagious, at a time when vaccines are finally helping some other countries bring the pandemic under control.Vaccine shortages have put the government far off pace to meet the health ministry's target of immunizing the full adult population by the end of the year.Araujo, a key member of the government's so-called "ideological wing," admired former US president Donald Trump, and shared his hardline supporters' disgust with "globalism.""Globalists," he said last October, "are taking a disease caused by a virus, Covid, and trying to turn it into a huge prescriptive apparatus to reform and control the entire planet's social and economic relations."His vaccine diplomacy, or lack thereof, had come under attack, including during an appearance before Congress last week.The administration faces questions over its rejection of an offer last August to buy 70 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- which Bolsonaro joked could "turn you into an alligator" -- and its tense relations with Brazil's top trade partner, China.Chinese-developed CoronaVac is currently the most-administered Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil, but only because the government of Sao Paulo state defied resistance from the Bolsonaro administration to acquire it.Araujo, who took up the foreign minister post vowing to "resist Maoist China" and its plan "to dominate the world," had repeatedly provoked squabbles with Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-jair-bolsonaro-overhauls-cabinet-amid-covid-19-surge-101617060686152.html

The statement did not name the other counties.The UN group has joined the list of countries that have asked China to address reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Recently, several companies such as H&M and Nike (NKE) said they were concerned about allegations that forced labour has been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang.Chinese media has called for Chinese boycotts of Swedish multinational retailer H&M, sports apparel powerhouses Nike and Adidas; New Balance; Burberry and other members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) that have voiced concerns or pledged not to use supply chain components produced in Xinjiang, South China Morning Post reported.Swedish multinational H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, has been pulled from major e-commerce stores in China and blocked by several major navigation, review and rating apps.Dozens of Chinese celebrities have terminated contracts or said they would cut ties with these brands, including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Uniqlo -- a move lauded by state media.On Friday, the Biden administration said America is keen to ensure that US companies adhere to US law and worker concerns and "don't in any way support forced labour"The tensions between Beijing and western countries have escalated recently after the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom joined the European Union (EU) imposed sanctions on Chinese officials involved in human rights violations.The sanctions blacklisted former and current officials in the Xinjiang region--Zhu Hailun, Wang Junzheng, Wang Mingshan and Chen Mingguo--for alleged abuses, which have sparked international outrage.The coordinated move also targeted the state-run Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.In retaliation to the bloc's sanctions, China has decided to introduce sanctions against 10 European Union officials and four European organisations after accusing them of spreading lies and false information about the Xinjiang region.On Friday, China introduced sanctions on nine UK citizens and four entities in response to London's sanctions on Beijing over the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.The dispute has seen a flurry of activity in diplomatic circles, with China and European nations summoning each other's ambassadors to answer for the move and responses to it, according to the South China Morning Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/well-known-global-brands-may-be-linked-to-rights-abuses-in-china-s-xinjiang-region-un-panel-101617058558401.html

He added that the labor union is on board with what Biden will announce.“The country’s infrastructure has been crumbling for years and we know it needs investment,” he said. “This ought to be a bipartisan initiative because the infrastructure supplies everybody, regardless of party.”Conway said that the administration is looking to spend $3 trillion overall on the long-term economic program, but that he expects Wednesday’s announcement on transportation will only be half of that number or maybe even less. Further infrastructure elements, like retro-fitting schools, will come later, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-to-announce-transportation-focused-stimulus-on-wednesday-101617056691009.html

However, there’s growing frustration among lawmakers that those methods -- used in response to previous hacks -- haven’t deterred US adversaries from attacking its computer networks.The administration continues to be focused intensively on remediation, Sullivan said. “Meaning, making sure that we’ve address the vulnerabilities of federal networks in particular,” Sullivan said.The breach -- along with another of Microsoft Corp.’s Exchange email software -- is an early test for Biden and his cybersecurity team.In December, cybersecurity analysts discovered a sprawling espionage campaign in which hackers compromised SolarWinds software, inserting malicious code into updates. As many as 18,000 customers received the malicious updates, though far fewer were targeted for follow-on attacks by the suspected Russian hackers.This month, Microsoft revealed that suspected Chinese hackers exploited flaws in the code of Exchange to breach customer email systems. Cybersecurity experts say the attack had tens of thousands of victims.The administration is working with Microsoft to encourage customers to patch their systems, and the nine compromised federal agencies are supposed to complete internal reviews of the breaches this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solarwinds-hack-us-weighs-seen-and-unseen-responses-to-major-cyber-attack-101617055862155.html
30-03-2021||World||Increase in child migrants passing through dangerous Darien Gap between Panama, Colombia: UN||The number of child migrants passing through the perilous Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama has risen dramatically, the UN child welfare agency said Monday.While underage migrants made up only about 2% of those using the jungle corridor in 2017, in 2020 children comprised 25% of the migrants making the hard trek on foot, UNICEF's report said.The Darien Gap is a 60-mile (97-kilometer) stretch of roadless jungle that provides the only land route north out of South America. There is little food or shelter on the week-long trek and bandits and wild animals prey on migrants.Most migrants making the hike are from Haiti or Cuba, with smaller numbers from African nations such as Cameroon and Congo and South Asian countries India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.“I have seen women coming out of the jungle with babies in their arms after walking for more than seven days without water, food or any type of protection,” said Jean Gough, the UNICEF regional director who made a two-day trip to the zone.“These families go beyond their limits and put their lives at risk, often without realizing the risks they are taking,” Gough said.While only 109 children made the journey in 2017, that swelled to 3,956 in 2019. The coronavirus pandemic and travel restriction reduced both adult and child numbers in 2020, with the latter falling to 1,653.Over the last four years, a total of at least 46,500 migrants had made the trek, and in total for those years they included 6,240 minors.The US government has been facing an increase in the number of unaccompanied minors and families with children arriving at its southern border in recent months. Last week there were around 18,000 unaccompanied children in government custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/increase-in-child-migrants-passing-through-dangerous-darien-gap-between-panama-colombia-un-101617054275584.html

Some were still closed on Monday as the waters began to recede.The Harpeth River crested 15 feet (about 4.6 meters) above flood stage Sunday night at Kingston Springs and was expected to fall below flood stage by Monday night.But the National Weather Service warned that up to two inches of rain could fall in parts of Tennessee on Tuesday night and Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tennessee-floods-claim-fifth-victim-more-rain-on-the-way-101617050223886.html
30-03-2021||World||US Capitol riot suspect wore 'I Was There' shirt when arrested||Garret Miller didn't speak to the law enforcement officers who arrested him on charges he stormed the US Capitol in January, but the T-shirt he was wearing at his Dallas home that day sent a clear and possibly incriminating message.Miller's shirt had a photograph of former President Donald Trump, and it said “Take America Back” and “I Was There, Washington D.C., January 6, 2021,” federal prosecutors noted in a court filing Monday.Prosecutors are urging a judge to keep Miller jailed while he awaits trial on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 riots in the nation's capital.On a recorded call immediately after his arrest, Miller told his mother, “I don’t feel that I’ve done anything wrong and now I’m being locked up,” according to prosecutors.Like many of the more than 300 people facing federal charges in connection with the siege, Miller thoroughly documented and commented on his actions that day in a flurry of social media posts.After Miller posted a selfie showing himself inside the Capitol building, another Facebook user wrote, “bro you got in?! Nice!" Miller replied, “just wanted to incriminate myself a little lol,” prosecutors said.Miller joined the mob that breached the Capitol building and later threatened to kill New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a Capitol police officer, authorities said.After the Democratic congresswoman tweeted the word “Impeach,” Miller tweeted back to her, “Assassinate AOC,” according to prosecutors.In a Jan. 10 post on Instagram, Miller said the officer who shot and killed a woman in the crowd of rioters should get a televised execution, according to prosecutors. Miller believed the officer was a Black man and called him a “prize to be taken,” prosecutors said.“He will swing," he allegedly wrote. "I had a rope in my bag on that day.”“By bringing tactical gear, ropes, and potentially, by his own admission, a gun to the Capitol on January 6, 2021, Miller showed that he was not just caught up in the frenzy of the crowd but instead came to D.C. with the intention of disrupting the democratic process of counting and certifying Electoral College votes,” prosecutors wrote.A federal magistrate judge in Texas ordered Miller detained after his Jan. 20 arrest. On Feb. 12, a grand jury in the District of Columbia indicted Miller on 12 counts, including civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, and assaulting, resisting or impeding officers.Miller's attorney is seeking his client's release from custody, saying he has expressed regret for his actions.“Nevertheless, he has no history of violence, and he did not engage in any acts of violence in connection with the charged offenses, unlike many others who have previously been released,” defense attorney F. Clinton Broden wrote.Miller remains jailed in Oklahoma City. His transport to Washington is on hold because he broke his collarbone while playing soccer in the recreation yard at a Dallas jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-riot-suspect-wore-i-was-there-shirt-when-arrested-101617048938087.html
30-03-2021||World||Romania: Protesters march against Covid-19 restrictions in Bucharest amid rising infections||Anti-restriction protesters took to the streets in several Romanian cities Monday against new pandemic measures that came into force a day earlier amid rising Covid-19 infections.More than a thousand people gathered in the capital, Bucharest, sounding horns and chanting “Freedom!” as they marched to the government headquarters in central Victory Square. One man was detained by police after refusing to identify himself for not wearing a face mask.Smaller protests were held in other parts of the country. The demonstrations were largely organized by the far-right AUR Party, which has spoken out against pandemic restrictions and supported a number of recent anti-vaccination protests.Party leader George Simion, who has called on people to protest across the country every day this week, attended the Bucharest demonstration.The new restrictions include an 8pm curfew and, in hard-hit areas, shorter shopping hours.On Monday Romania recorded its highest number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units — almost 1,400 — since the pandemic started, and roughly another 12,000 people infected with Covid-19 are receiving regular hospital care.So far, the country — which has a population of more than 19 million — has recorded more than 940,000 confirmed infections, 23,234 have died, and almost three million shots of vaccine have been administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/romania-protesters-march-against-covid-19-restrictions-in-bucharest-amid-rising-infections-101617048482374.html
30-03-2021||World||American Airlines to put most jets back in service as travel rebounds after Covid-19 pandemic||American Airlines Group Inc. expects to put most of its fleet back in service in the second quarter following “recent strength in domestic and short-haul international bookings” that hint at a gathering travel rebound.Falling infections and hospitalizations and rising vaccinations have spurred demand after a blow early this year when the US required negative coronavirus tests for international travelers, American said in a regulatory filing Monday. The seven-day average of net bookings on March 26 was about 90% of the 2019 level and domestic flights are 80% full, the company said.American’s upbeat assessment underscored recent progress against a pandemic that caused an unprecedented decline in travel last year. Earlier this month, the carrier reported “what looks like the beginning of a very large uptick” in demand. American on Monday projected that strong bookings would continue into the second quarter, but cautioned that visibility was limited.“Despite some areas of Europe going under new lockdowns and the US CDC still advising against unnecessary travel, the recovery is in full swing,” Andrew Didora, an analyst at Bank of America Corp., said in a report. Airline bookings are “seeing a more pronounced improvement since early February, led by leisure.”As if to underline the uncertainty facing the travel recovery, however, US airline stocks fell as Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pleaded with Americans to wear masks and stick with Covid-19 measures.“I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,” Walensky said at a press briefing. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope, but right now I’m scared.”American slipped 1.3% to $22.63 at 2:37 p.m. in New York, the shallowest decline on a Standard & Poor’s index of major US carriers. The shares had climbed 45% this year through March 26, the most on the industry stock gauge.The Fort Worth, Texas-based company parked 22 Boeing Co. 737-800 jets and at least 15 regional planes as demand sagged last year, and permanently retired 158 aircraft from its fleet. American operated 1,399 planes at the end of 2020, before reactivating any stored aircraft.The demand outlook for long-haul international flights is also cloudy. Much of Europe is lagging behind the US in vaccine distribution, and some countries have recently imposed more restrictions on movement and gatherings.First-quarter system capacity will be down 40% to 45% from the same period in 2019, American said. That represents a slight improvement from the airline’s previous outlook of down 45%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-airlines-to-put-most-jets-back-in-service-as-travel-rebounds-after-covid-19-pandemic-101617046373672.html
30-03-2021||World||US President Joe Biden says 90% of adults to be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine from April 19||President Joe Biden said Monday that 90% of US adults will be eligible to get a Covid-19 vaccine in three weeks, and that his administration will more than double the number of pharmacies where shots are available, as cases begin to rise again.“Look at what we have done in the last ten weeks. No other country has come close,” Biden said at the White House. But he urged states that have eased restrictions on masks and other prevention measures to reinstate them: “The war against Covid-19 is far from won.”Biden made the announcement Monday afternoon at the White House, marking April 19 as a new milestone in the vaccination effort. He also said that nearly all US adults will be able to get a shot within 5 miles of their homes.The announcement comes as the US continues to ramp up its inoculation effort. Biden doubled his goal for vaccines last week after the US reached his initial target six weeks early.The US is on pace to soon administer 3 million doses a day of Covid-19 vaccine, as the supply increases and states widen eligibility. After stalling at about 2.5 million doses a day, the rate of shots administered in the US has started to again climb.On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the US reported a total of more than 10 million shots in arms -- a record three-day stretch that helped push up the average rate, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.Roughly three-quarters of vaccines still go directly to states, but Biden has steered a growing share to federal channels, including pharmacies, as supply has increased. That shift has allowed Biden to target disadvantaged zip codes as he tries to address disparities in access, often along racial lines.At the same time, Rochelle Walensky, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pleaded with Americans to wear masks and stick with Covid-19 mitigation measures, warning of “impending doom” as cases, hospitalizations and deaths begin to rise again.Speaking at a press briefing Monday, she fought back tears as she outlined a series of warning signals and said she was frightened about a looming fourth wave of Covid cases. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope, but right now I’m scared,” Walensky said.As part of his announcement, Biden described plans to launch a dozen more community vaccination sites in the next three weeks. He said vaccines will be made available at nearly 40,000 pharmacies over that time period, from about 17,000 now.Biden previously directed states to open eligibility to all adults no later than May 1. A total of 31 states have said they will fully open eligibility by April 19. Biden’s announcement Monday is based on those moves -- and will mean roughly 90% of US adults will be eligible, he said.Biden has said the US will have enough supply by the end of May to vaccinate all US adults, though administering the shots could take longer. Until recently, eligibility was typically based on age or whether a person had underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk. Full adult eligibility means anyone 16 or older can get the shot, regardless of medical history.The 7-day average of daily shots administered has climbed to 2.7 million, the highest level yet. Biden has pledged to administer 200 million shots in total under his presidency by the end of next month and is on pace to do that.Biden also announced $100 million in funding to help vaccinate vulnerable and at-risk older adults, and people with disabilities. The program would be aimed at getting those high-risk people scheduled for, and taken to, vaccine appointments, including those with mobility challenges.The US vaccine effort is buoyed by vast supplies. The administrations of Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have used wartime powers to prioritize US government orders.Biden has said the US will begin sharing shots with other nations once it has enough to cover all US adults, including the potential need for booster shots and a stockpile for children, given the uncertainty over which vaccines will be best for younger age groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-says-90-of-adults-to-be-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine-from-april-19-101617045838385.html
30-03-2021||World||Canadian panel recommends pausing administration of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for people under 55 years||Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization is recommending a pause on AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccinations for people under 55 for safety reasons, two officials with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.The officials confirmed the recommendation on condition on anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly before the announcement. It remains a recommendation and it is up to each of Canada’s provinces to decide to follow it or not.Dr. Joss Reimer of Manitoba’s Vaccine Implementation Task Force said despite the finding that there was no increase risk of blood clots overall related to AstraZeneca in Europe, a rare but very serious side effect has been seen primarily in young women in Europe.“So out of abundance of caution, Manitoba will be recommending that these vaccines only be used in people who are 55 or older at this time. I do want to say this is a pause while we wait for more information to better understand what we are seeing in Europe,” Reimer said.Reimer said the increase in the rare type of blood clot happens affects somewhere around one in 100,000 or one in a million people who receive AstraZeneca. She said it typically happens between four and 20 days after getting the shot and the symptoms can mirror a stroke or a heart attack.Reimer said they have not seen any of these cases in Canada.“While we still believe the benefits for all ages outweigh the risks I’m not comfortable with probably. I want to see more data coming out of Europe so I know exactly what this risk benefit analysis is,” Reimer said.Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province, suggested his province would do a pause as well.“I’d rather wait than roll the dice,” Ford said.Several European countries that had suspended using the vaccine over concerns it could cause blood clots have resumed administering it after the EU’s drug regulator said the vaccine was safe.Health Canada, the country’s regulator that approved AstraZeneca, is expected to hold a news conference later Monday.Canada is expected to receive 1.5 million doses of AstraZeneca from the US this week.The vaccine is used widely in Britain, across the European continent and in other countries, but its rollout was troubled by inconsistent study reports about its effectiveness, and then more recently a scare about clots that had some countries temporarily pausing inoculations.Canadian Regulators have approved the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Canada has placed bigger bets on Pfizer and Moderna, ordering up to 76 million doses of Pfizer and up to 44 million of Moderna, compared with up to 20 million of AstraZeneca.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-panel-recommends-pausing-administration-of-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-people-under-55-years-101617045010003.html
