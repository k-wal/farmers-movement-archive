But both sides need to rediscover the art of diplomacy,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hits-out-at-us-japan-ahead-of-sino-us-talks-in-alaska-101616003050583.html

17-03-2021||World||15 dead, 30 infected with Ebola in Africa's Guinea, Congo||The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have reported 30 Ebola virus cases and 15 related deaths so far.The Africa CDC, the specialised healthcare agency of the 55-member African Union, reported a fatality rate of 50 per cent in the two countries.Official figures reported to the agency showed that the DRC had 12 cases and six deaths while Guinea had 18 cases and nine deaths, the Africa CDC said in a statement issued late Tuesday.According to the Africa CDC, Guinea and DRC have so far reported eight Ebola virus recoveries, six and two, respectively.Seven healthcare workers are amongst the confirmed cases, two in DRC and five in Guinea, according to the agency.The Africa CDC, in its Ebola virus cross-border updates, indicated that between February 15 to March 12, some 18 Ebola virus-related alerts were reported in Sierra Leone.It, however, stressed that all alerts were investigated and tested negative for the Ebola virus, as it emphasized that there are no confirmed Ebola cases from Sierra Leone so far.Meanwhile, the agency called on all African countries to enhance their cross-border surveillance efforts by mapping population movements to identify all potential crossing points where there is a risk of disease spread.African countries have been urged to set up screening posts and conduct health screenings for travellers with signs of Ebola, as well as implement public health measures at border crossing points including temperature monitoring, and infection prevention and control measures.It also called on AU members to continue performing contact tracing and follow up of all probable and confirmed cases, as well as enhance infection prevention and control measures in health care settings, health care workers protection and practice safe and dignified burial.New outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus disease in the two African countries are sending new jitters to Africa as the continent is still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.The 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak claimed over 11,300 lives, with over 28,600 recorded cases.Ebola is a highly contagious hemorrhagic fever that causes a range of symptoms including fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, generalized pain or malaise and in many cases internal and external bleeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/15-dead-30-infected-with-ebola-in-africa-s-guinea-congo-101616001900045.html
17-03-2021||World||Homeland Security head rejects GOP claims of border 'crisis'||The head of the Department of Homeland Security pushed back Wednesday against Republican criticism of the Biden administration's border policies, refusing to say that the surge of migrant children entering the United States is a “crisis.”As GOP members of Congress argued that President Joe Biden had wrongly rolled back immigration policies enacted by former President Donald Trump, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas pointed to another Trump policy that was widely reviled: the separation of immigrant families under a “zero tolerance” policy on border crossings.“A crisis is when a nation is willing to rip a 9-year-old child out of the hands of his or her parent and separate that family to deter future migration," Mayorkas told the House Homeland Security Committee. "That, to me, is a humanitarian crisis.”The number of migrants being stopped at the US-Mexico border has been rising since last April, and the administration is still rapidly sending back most single adults and families under a public health order issued by Trump at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the US is now allowing teens and children to stay, at least temporarily, and they have been coming in ever larger numbers. Border agents have also been prevented from expelling families with young children from Texas' Rio Grande Valley because of changes in Mexican policy.More than 4,000 migrant children were being held by the Border Patrol as of Sunday, including at least 3,000 in custody longer than the 72-hour limit set by a court order, according to a US official. The agency took in an additional 561 on Monday, twice the recent average, according to a second official. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss figures not yet publicly released.The rise has left Biden in a difficult spot. He is criticized by Republicans for what they view as encouragement to illegal border crossings and by some Democrats over the prolonged detention of minors.Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., referenced a photo of a small crowd of demonstrators in Tijuana, Mexico, wearing matching T-shirts with the words “Biden, please let us in” that circulated widely on social media in recent days.“I look at two months ago, and we had a certain situation. We were under control," Van Drew said. "And I look now with people crossing the border illegally in much larger numbers with shirts with our president’s name on it. That means something under anybody’s standard.”The situation is also a challenge to Biden's effort to overhaul broader Trump policies intended to curtail both legal and illegal immigration.“I can say quite clearly: Don't come over,” Biden said in an ABC News interview that aired Wednesday.The number of migrants attempting to cross the border is at the highest level since March 2019. Mayorkas on Tuesday said it was on pace to hit a 20-year peak.“The situation at the southwest border is difficult,” Mayorkas said in his most extensive remarks to date on the subject. “We are working around the clock to manage it and we will continue to do so. That is our job.”Under questioning Wednesday, Mayorkas and some Democrats also highlighted nonimmigration issues, including the threat of domestic extremism following the violent insurrection at the Capitol, while Republicans focused primarily on the border.Several Republicans argued that Biden's rescinding of the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy was a mistake. Small numbers of immigrants — far from the more than 70,000 people barred from entry under the policy — have been allowed into the US during the first weeks of the new administration after they pass a Covid-19 screening. Human rights groups and lawyers have documented kidnappings, rapes and attacks in border cities against many migrants forced to wait in Mexico.Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas defended Trump's agreements to send people from Central America to other countries in the region instead of letting them seek asylum under American law.“The Trump administration, in my judgment, did a masterful job in negotiating the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy and the asylum cooperative agreements with Central America,” McCaul said. "It was actually a foreign policy achievement.”Biden has moved to roll back those policies and restore a program allowing Central American children to seek asylum while in their home countries. Said Mayorkas, “Sometimes the tools of deterrence defy values and principles for which we all stand.”The Health and Human Services Department plans to open shelter facilities at Moffett Federal Airfield near San Francisco and in Pecos, Texas, to handle the flow. It is also looking to expand a facility in Donna, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley, to hold 2,000 people.Also, the Dallas Convention Center was to begin holding children as early as Wednesday, with plans to accommodate up to 3,000. A makeshift holding center in Midland, Texas, that opened last weekend for 700 children had 485 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/homeland-security-head-rejects-gop-claims-of-border-crisis-101616001912715.html

In the Mississippi capital of Jackson, state employees were warned to head to stairwells if they hear weather sirens. Near Birmingham, labor organizers canceled an outdoors event at an Amazon facility where workers are voting on union representation.At least two waves of storms were likely, forecasters said, and the worst might not hit until a cold front passes overnight.“The biggest question is how strong to severe these storms are going to be and if they're going to be tornadic right off the bat," said Gary Goggins, a forecaster with the National Weather Service office for Birmingham.Communities across the South used social media to share the location of tornado shelters. In Jackson, Tennessee, officials said a civic center and the regional airport would be open for residents seeking shelter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-across-southeast-us-bracing-for-potential-tornadoes-101616001447737.html

The country of 11 million announced 3,465 new infections and 56 deaths on Wednesday, bringing the total number of infections to just under 230,000. More than 7,200 people have died.Kikilias renewed an appeal to private sector pathologists, respiratory specialists and general practitioners to assist the public health service. “It is a battle for human life, it is honoring the Hippocratic oath,” Kikilias said during a regular Health Ministry briefing on the coronavirus. “Our citizens need you, Greece needs you.”Kikilias said if at least 200 doctors from those particular specialties do not respond to his appeal within the next 48 hours, he will recommend to Prime Minister Kyrakos Mitsotakis to order the requisitioning of their services, essentially forcing them into working in the public sector.Greece was credited with handling the initial outbreak of the pandemic well, with an early lockdown imposed last spring keeping cases and hospitalizations low. The respite gave the government time to add hundreds of intensive care beds to the public health system.But the country has been struggling to overcome a surge in infections and deaths since the fall, despite lockdown measures that have largely shuttered the retail sector and only allow people to leave their homes for specific reasons and with either a self-written declaration or an SMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-could-order-private-doctors-to-join-covid-19-fight-in-next-two-days-101616000671030.html
17-03-2021||World||Israel PM Netanyahu fights for re-election without key ally Donald Trump||As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a re-election battle next week, he's missing an ally he could rely on during three previous votes over the past two years: Donald Trump.The American former president's conservative base was avidly pro-Israel and Trump fulfilled a wishlist for the hawkish Netanyahu.Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, blessed settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and doled out US incentives for Arab nations to normalise ties with the Jewish state.Netanyahu cited his closeness with Trump to bolster his candidacy, printing the former president's face on his posters during past campaigns.The prime minister "actually said to his followers: See, whenever I want, I knock on the door of the White House and the White House opens the door," Tamar Hermann, a political scientist at the Open University of Israel, told AFP.President Joe Biden represents a dramatically different political reality for Netanyahu, who is seeking to extend his record 12 consecutive years in power on March 23.In this vote, "the presence of the American administration is minimal," Hermann said.'No alternatives'?Netanyahu and Biden have both affirmed a decades-long friendship, but they have sharp policy differences, especially concerning Iran.Biden has sought a return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, an agreement loathed by Netanyahu which Trump had scrapped.The Democratic president is also expected to renew US criticism of Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank."There's no love for Netanyahu in this administration and among Democratic elites," said Shibley Telhami, an expert on US policy in the Middle East at the University of Maryland."The problem for them right now is that the practical alternatives to him are almost equally bad."Several of Netanyahu's former allies have joined rival right-wing parties.Polls show none of those new factions is likely to beat Netanyahu's Likud, but they have shifted Israeli politics further to the right.Biden's ideology may align most closely with Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party led by Yair Lapid, which is predicted to finish second behind Likud.Veteran US Democratic political consultant Mark Mellman, who is advising the challenger, said Lapid shares Biden's values and counts the president as a friend."Biden is for a two-state solution. There are parties running in Israel that are opposed to a two-state solution," Mellman said.Still, "there's nothing that [Biden] has done that suggests that he wants to play a favourite here at all."David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said even if Biden wanted to back a Netanyahu rival, any alternative coalition could face collapse under ideological divisions."They agree they want to get rid of Netanyahu. That gets them through the first month, but what do they agree on after that?" said Makovsky.Moreover, he told AFP, the Biden administration's attention is elsewhere."The administration has got a lot on its plate with Covid, Covid, Covid, 500,000 Americans killed, all the economic implications of Covid, and it's just crowding out a lot of issues," he said.'Not Mideast focused'Biden has signalled he will not reverse some of Trump's moves that were popular in Israel.He does not intend to return the US embassy to Tel Aviv and his administration supports the Trump-brokered agreements that saw Israel normalise ties with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.Washington's criticism of an International Criminal Court probe into possible Israeli war crimes in the West Bank and Gaza was also welcomed across the Israeli political spectrum."The US is going to work with whoever emerges," Dan Shapiro, who served as Barack Obama's ambassador to Israel, told AFP."But the broader picture is that President Biden's overriding priorities right now are generally not Middle East focused."Rather than aim for a comprehensive peace deal, Biden will focus on improving daily life for Palestinians by restoring aid and renewing diplomatic missions, which Trump cut off, Shapiro predicted.Domestically, Biden faces only limited calls from progressives to advocate harder for the Palestinian cause.Last week Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and four Democratic senators asked Secretary of State Tony Blinken to pressure Israel to do more to help Palestinians get coronavirus vaccines.Israel is the world leader in Covid vaccinations per capita, but has only offered a limited quantity of doses to the Palestinians, who have yet to launch large-scale inoculations in the occupied West Bank or Israeli-blockaded Gaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pm-netanyahu-fights-for-re-election-without-key-ally-donald-trump-101615999809625.html
17-03-2021||World||Colombian businessman, aide of Venezuela's Maduro, faces extradition to US||A court in Cape Verde granted a U.S. request to extradite Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman close to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.The ruling comes two days after a regional court in Nigeria ordered the authorities in Cape Verde, an Atlantic Ocean island nation, to free Saab and halt extradition proceedings.Saab, 49, has been indicted by a U.S. federal court in Florida on money-laundering charges related to bribing Venezuelan officials. He has denied the charges through his lawyers.The Cape Verde Supreme Court “confirms the judicial authorization for the extradition of the defendant to the U.S.,” it said in the ruling. “The extradition that is now authorized is for the extradited person to be subject to a criminal process for only one of the crimes that is being attributed, in accordance with the guarantee offered by the requesting state.”Saab plans to appeal, said Femi Falana, one of his lawyers.“We shall be filing an appeal to the Constitutional Court and reaffirm our confidence that Ambassador Saab will be released,” he said in a text message. “The defense is currently studying the decision and we will issue a further substantial statement later.”Saab was detained June 12 when the private plane he was traveling on from Venezuela to Iran made a fuel stop on the Cape Verdian island of Sal. Prior to his arrest, Saab was tapped to orchestrate deals that would exchange Venezuelan gold for Iranian gasoline.Authorities in Cape Verde said they made the arrest in response to an Interpol Red Notice, spurred by the money-laundering charges. Following his arrest, Venezuela identified Saab as its diplomat on a “humanitarian mission” to Iran, an argument Cape Verde’s Barlavento Court of Appeal has rejected.The Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice, based in Nigeria, on March 15 ruled that Saab should be freed because he was detained before the Red Notice was issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombian-businessman-aide-of-venezuela-s-maduro-faces-extradition-to-us-101615999199837.html
17-03-2021||World||Senate unanimously confirms Katherine Tai as Joe Biden's top trade envoy||The Senate confirmed Katherine Tai as the top US trade envoy in an overwhelming bipartisan vote on Wednesday.She will be the first Asian American and first woman of colour to hold the position.Tai is considered a problem-solving pragmatist, and her nomination by President Joe Biden to be U S trade representative drew support from Democrats and Republicans alike. She was confirmed on a 98-0 vote and is the 19th member of Biden's Cabinet to clear the Senate.A former trade negotiator and congressional staffer, Tai has vowed to work for a US trade policy that benefits ordinary workers, not just big corporations, and to work more closely with America's allies to confront an increasingly assertive China.In her confirmation hearing, she ducked questions about how she'd handle several politically sensitive questions such as whether the Biden administration would drop former President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and whether it would revive an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that was negotiated by President Barack Obama but jettisoned by Trump.Fluent in Mandarin, Tai served several years as head of China enforcement at the trade representative's office.“I know firsthand how critically important it is that we have a strategic and coherent plan for holding China accountable to its promises and effectively competing with its model of state-directed economics,? Tai told senators last month, taking an indirect shot at Trump's often chaotic approach to negotiations with Beijing.In the biggest trade war since the 1930s, Trump slapped taxes on USD 360 billion in Chinese imports in a fight over China's aggressive push — alleged to include cybertheft — to promote its own technology companies and challenge US technological dominance.Biden and his team appear to be in no hurry to reverse Trump's China tariffs. US legislators and policymakers across the political spectrum have taken an increasingly confrontational line on China, frustrated by its trade practices, crackdown on Hong Kong and aggressive pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea.Tai promised to work with US allies to present a united front to Beijing. Far from coordinating with US allies on trade, Trump sparred with them instead, putting tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and threatening to target European cars, too.At her confirmation hearing, Tai wouldn't commit to dropping the tax on foreign metals, calling tariffs “a legitimate tool in the trade tool box.?Tai also dodged a question about whether the Biden administration would revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact with 11 Pacific Rim countries.The pact excluded and was meant to isolate China and cement US ties with other Asian countries. Trump called the TPP a job killer and withdrew from it in his first week in office. The pact also faced opposition in Biden's Democratic Party.Tai last served as the top trade staffer at the House Ways and Means Committee. She handled negotiations with the Trump administration over a revamped North American trade deal.Under pressure from congressional Democrats, Trump's trade team agreed to strengthen the pact to make it easier for Mexican workers to form independent unions and demand better pay and benefits — decreasing the incentives for US firms to move south of the border to take advantage of cheap labour.(AP)RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-unanimously-confirms-katherine-tai-as-joe-biden-s-top-trade-envoy-101615998820947.html
17-03-2021||World||Georgia shooting: Suspect may have 'sexual addiction', say police||The man accused of killing eight people at massage parlors in the Atlanta area told police his act was not racially motivated, and that he potentially had a “sex addiction,” officials said Wednesday.Still, officials said they were investigating whether the deaths were hate crimes amid concerns over a wave of attacks on Asian Americans. Six of the victims were Asian and seven were women.Officials did not say that Robert Aaron Long, 21, ever went to the parlors where the shootings occurred. They also said he was planning to go to Florida in a plot to attack “some type of porn industry."“He made indicators that he has some issues, potentially sexual addiction, and may have frequented some of these places in the past,” said Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds.He said it was too early to tell if it was racially motivated. “But the indicators right now are it may not be. It may be targets of opportunity. Again, we believe that he frequented these places in the past and maybe have been lashing out.”Many suspects who commit mass shootings have a history of violence against women. Still, the attack haunted members of the Asian American community who saw the shootings as an attack on them, given a recent wave of assaults that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States. The virus was first identified in China, and then-President Donald Trump and others have used racially charged terms like “Chinese virus” to describe it.“We’re in a place where we’ve seen an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans since the pandemic started,” said Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen. “It’s hard to think it is not targeted specifically toward our community.”The attacks began Tuesday evening, when five people were shot at Youngs Asian Massage Parlor near Woodstock, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Atlanta, Cherokee County Sheriff’s spokesman Capt. Jay Baker said. Two people died at the scene, and three were taken to a hospital where two died, Baker said.About an hour later, police responding to a call about a robbery found three women dead from apparent gunshot wounds at Gold Spa near Atlanta's Buckhead area, where tattoo parlors and strip clubs are just blocks away from mansions and skyscrapers in one of the last ungentrified holdouts in that part of the city. Officers then learned of a call reporting shots fired across the street, at Aromatherapy Spa, and found another woman apparently shot dead.“It appears that they may be Asian,” Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden has been briefed on the “horrific shootings” and would receive an update later Wednesday from Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray.Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant cautioned that it was too early to say if the attack was hate crime. Over the past year, thousands of incidents of abuse have been reported to an anti-hate group that tracks incidents against Asian Americans, and hate crimes in general are at the highest level in more than a decade.“We are heartbroken by these acts of violence,” Asian Americans Advancing Justice — Atlanta said in a statement. “While the details of the shootings are still emerging, the broader context cannot be ignored. The shootings happened under the trauma of increasing violence against Asian Americans nationwide, fueled by white supremacy and systemic racism.”Police in Atlanta and other major cities deplored the killings, and some said they would increase patrols in Asian American communities. Seattle’s mayor said “the violence in Atlanta was an act of hate,” and San Francisco police tweeted #StopAsianHate. The New York City Police counterterrorism unit said it was on alert for similar attacks.Other civil liberties groups and prominent Americans also expressed their dismay. The Rev. Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said she’s “deeply saddened that we live in a nation and world permeated by hate and violence. I stand with Asian members of our World House, who are a part of our global human family.”Former President Barack Obama regretted that “even as we’ve battled the pandemic, we’ve continued to neglect the longer-lasting epidemic of gun violence in America.” While acknowledging that the shooter's motive was not known, he said “the identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence that must end.”Surveillance video recorded a man pulling up to the Cherokee County business about 10 minutes before the attack there, and the same car was spotted outside the Atlanta businesses, authorities said. A manhunt was launched, and Long was taken into custody in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) south of Atlanta, Baker said.Video evidence “suggests it is extremely likely our suspect is the same as Cherokee County’s, who is in custody,” Atlanta police said in a statement.South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in statement Wednesday that its diplomats in Atlanta have confirmed with police that four of the victims who died were women of Korean descent. The ministry said its Consulate General in Atlanta is trying to confirm the nationality of the women.FBI spokesman Kevin Rowson said the agency is assisting Atlanta and Cherokee County authorities in the investigation.Crisp County Sheriff Billy Hancock said in a video posted on Facebook that his deputies and state troopers were notified Tuesday night that a murder suspect out of north Georgia was headed their way. Deputies and troopers set up along the interstate and “made contact with the suspect,” he said.A state trooper performed a PIT, or pursuit intervention technique, maneuver, “which caused the vehicle to spin out of control,” Hancock said. Long was then taken into custody “without incident.”Crisp County sheriff’s spokeswoman Haley Wade said Wednesday morning that Long, who is white, is no longer in their custody and that her office has turned over its information to the other Georgia agencies and the FBI.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in South Korea meeting with Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong, mentioned the killings during an opening statement.“We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,” he said.“Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence,” Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday evening on Twitter.___Associated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to the this story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-shooting-suspect-may-have-sexual-addiction-say-police-101615996200926.html

17-03-2021||World||UK minister views India as like-minded, high trust vendor nation||The UK has a central role to play on the world stage as an independent sovereign state, a leading member of the Western alliance, and an energetic and dependable partner in the growing prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a major foreign policy speech on Wednesday.Addressing the US Aspen Security Forum virtually a day after Britain released its flagship Integrated Review of foreign policy, the senior Cabinet minister warned that democracy is under threat around the world and therefore the policy document singles out like-minded nations, such as India, who will be key to upholding democratic values and interests.He also named India among the countries that would help address the need for diversified global supply chains with “high trust vendors”.“The UK will remain anchored in NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organisation], in Five Eyes, a close US ally, a friend of the Gulf, a dependable European neighbour and partner, a passionate member of the Commonwealth. But, Global Britain will also be able and willing to forge and follow agile clusters with like-minded countries, where our values and our interests demand it,” said Raab.“That’s why you can see under our Presidency of the G7 that we’ve invited India, South Korea and Australia to join this year’s summit, because we in the West, we have got to broaden our reach and appeal, if we are going to tackle global challenges and manage the threats we face today,” he said.Pointing to some of the lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that it showed up very clearly the weaknesses of the global supply chain model, as every country around the world queued up for personal protective equipment (PPE) from China and a small number of other mass-producing countries.“Of course, we embrace the power of the market and we value our trade with China. But we will also develop new partnerships with existing allies, and other high trust vendors. We will work with the likes of Estonia and Norway, India and Israel, Singapore and South Korea, and many others, to diversify our supply chains from manufacturing to tech, to shore up our economic resilience,” he said.With reference to the ‘Global Britain in a Competitive Age’ Integrated Review, which calls for an Indo-Pacific tilt in the UK's foreign policy, the minister reiterated a commitment to the East as part of a common mission to strengthen democracy.Warning that “democracy is in retreat”, Raab pointed out that in the next decade, the combined wealth of autocratic regimes is likely to exceed that of the world's democracies.He noted: “Just take a second to think about what that means. Tyranny is richer than freedom. And that matters to us here at home because we know stable, freedom-respecting, democracies are much less likely to go to war, to house terrorists or to trigger large scale flows of immigration.“Democracies are generally, not always, but generally easier to trade with and easier to cooperate with to solve our shared problems. That's the first problem. The second trend is the rise of new threats. We have all become used to talking about asymmetric warfare since 9/11 but technology, twisted to perverse causes, is creating dangerous new weapons which falls short of armed conflict.”He said the UK has a moral responsibility and an indivisible stake in the planet, global economy and ecosystem to protect the peace and stability that underpin them.The minister championed the UK’s commitment to free trade, which he said reflects a deeply-held belief in human exchange as a “force for good”.“Britain is truly global, and that gives us an edge,” he declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-views-india-as-like-minded-high-trust-vendor-nation-101615995572322.html
17-03-2021||World||EU chief says AstraZeneca shortfalls slow Covid vaccine campaign||The European Union's chief executive criticized Anglo-Swedish vaccine-maker AstraZeneca on Wednesday, accusing the embattled pharmaceutical company of delaying Europe's coronavirus vaccination campaign and warning that the EU is weighing export bans to ensure supplies.“AstraZeneca has unfortunately under-produced and under-delivered, and this painfully, of course, reduced the speed of the vaccination campaign,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters.Von der Leyen said the company originally pledged to deliver 90 million doses of its shot in the first three months of 2021, but later said it could only provide 40 million, then more recently only 30 million.Beyond criticism for its slow deliveries, notably in Europe, AstraZeneca also has had to deal with reports of dangerous blood clots in some recipients of its shot, although the company and international regulators say there is no evidence the vaccine is to blame. Several countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, have suspended its use.The EU’s drug regulator insisted Tuesday that there is “no indication” it does so, and von der Leyen said Wednesday that “I trust AstraZeneca, I trust the vaccines.”AstraZeneca’s formula is one of three vaccines in use on the continent. But the escalating concern is another setback for the EU’s vaccination drive, which has been plagued by shortages and other hurdles and is lagging well behind the campaigns in Britain and the US. For the second quarter of 2021, van der Leyen said, AstraZeneca will only deliver 70 million doses, less than half of the 180 million it was “contractually obliged to deliver.”Two production sites in the UK figure in the EU's advance purchasing agreement drawn up with AstraZeneca, she said, adding: “We’re still waiting for doses to come from the UK," she said.Von der Leyen also noted the EU has exported around 41 million vaccine doses to other countries. “But open roads run in both directions, and this is why we need to ensure that there is reciprocity and proportionality,” she said.“If the situation does not change, we will have to reflect on how to make exports to vaccine producing countries dependent on their level of openness,” she added, without naming any country.She said the EU still aims to vaccinate 70% of all adults by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-says-astrazeneca-shortfalls-slow-covid-vaccine-campaign-101615993079562.html

17-03-2021||World||WHO reviewing data, recommends AstraZeneca Covid jabs continue||The World Health Organization said Wednesday its experts were still reviewing safety data on the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine following concerns around blood clots but recommended that injection programmes continue.While millions of doses of the vaccine have been administered, small numbers of people have developed blood clots, prompting countries including the EU's three largest nations -- Germany, France and Italy -- to suspend injections."The WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data," the UN health agency said in a statement."At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue."It said that once the committee had completed its review, the WHO would immediately communicate its findings.The European Union's medicines regulator on Tuesday insisted there was no evidence linking the jab to blood clots -- termed thromboembolic events -- after several nations suspended the shot over health fears.The WHO said that in mass vaccination campaigns, it was routine for countries to flag up potential adverse events after people have been immunised."This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but it is good practice to investigate them. It also shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place," it said."Vaccination against Covid-19 will not reduce illness or deaths from other causes."Thromboembolic events are known to occur frequently. Venous thromboembolism is the third most common cardiovascular disease globally."The WHO said it was in regular contact with the EU's European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on Covid-19 vaccine safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-reviewing-data-recommends-astrazeneca-covid-jabs-continue-101615989853989.html

Her mandate was to revive the organisation's fortunes after the United States, which provided a fifth of its funding, pulled out.The election is due in November, but without an opponent and a majority of the 58 Executive Board member states, including biggest financial contributor China, backing her, she should be elected for another four years.The agency, founded in the ashes of World War Two to protect the common cultural inheritance of humanity, is best known for designating and protecting archaeological and heritage sites, from the Galapagos Islands to the tombs of Timbuktu.Most of its activities are uncontroversial, but issues such as resolutions about how religious sites should be run in Jerusalem have been highly charged and the United States quit over accusations of anti-Israeli bias by the body.The official told Reuters that the signals from the new U.S. administration were positive and that the objective was to make progress on the issue over the coming months.UNESCO has had to fill a gaping financial hole. The United States left with $542 million in arrears. A U.S. return, done through a letter informing the body, would also mean that Washington would repay its arrears at some stage.Things may still prove complicated given a U.S. law that forbids Washington from funding U.N. bodies that have admitted Palestine as a full member, although a waiver can be sought.(Reporting by John Irish; Editing by Alex Richardson)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unescos-azoulay-set-for-second-term-as-no-other-nomination-submitted-official-101615987659912.html

In the weeks that followed, operational control of our southern border was compromised and a humanitarian and national security crisis has ensued,” the letter states. “The President’s actions directly contributed to this unfortunate, yet entirely avoidable scenario. They are also a blatant violation of federal law and infringe on Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.”The letter was organized by West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Homeland Security spending panel. It asks GAO head Gene Dodaro to issue a legal opinion on whether the Impoundment Control Act was violated.The fiscal 2021 spending bill that Congress passed in December has $1.4 billion for border wall and related spending.Republicans this week have focused on the surge of migrants crossing the U.S. border from Mexico, with lawmakers traveling to the region to highlight the issue. Biden has ordered federal disaster officials to the area to handle the surge, while Democrats have said that border crossings remained at roughly the same level during the Trump administration. They also have argued that the border wall is ineffective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-senators-accuse-biden-of-breaking-law-by-halting-border-wall-construction-101615986181324.html

Only the United States has reported more deaths and cases.Bolsonaro initially sought to portray Covid-19 as a "little flu" after the first case was registered in February 2020 and the slowness of Brazil's vaccination campaign among a population of more than 212 million has severely strained hospitals.Fiocruz, the Rio de Janeiro-based biomedical center that is manufacturing the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil, said on Tuesday Brazil faced its worst sanitary crisis on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-president-bolsonaro-faces-record-disapproval-rating-over-covid-101615985250536.html

The probe is expected to span multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and harassment against Cuomo, as well as claims Cuomo’s administration withheld information on Covid-19 nursing home deaths, covered up structural problems on the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, and whether Cuomo’s vaccine czar crossed ethics lines when he called county executives to gauge their loyalty to the governor.“The addition of Davis Polk will allow my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and me to fully and fairly investigate the allegations,” said Assemblymember Charles Lavine, who chairs the judiciary committee. “These are serious allegations, and they will be treated with fairness, due process and discretion.”The investigation’s launch comes just weeks ahead of a March 31 deadline for the legislature and the governor to pass a budget. The probe was an effort at finding common ground between a camp of lawmakers who have called for immediate action if Cuomo continues to refuse to resign and another group of lawmakers who want to wait for an investigation to play out before taking action. The investigation is separate from a sexual-harassment investigation by lawyers appointed by New York Attorney General Letitia James.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-begins-andrew-cuomo-impeachment-investigation-101615985910400.html
17-03-2021||World||WHO official calls blood clots 'very rare'||A top World Health Organization expert on vaccines says people should feel reassured that even if health authorities turn up a link between blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine, such cases are “very rare.”Dr. Kate O’Brien, who heads WHO’s department of immunizations and vaccines, said the U.N. health agency and the European Medicines Agency are trying to investigate the possibility of a link between blood clots and the AstraZeneca shots. The potential side effect has prompted some countries -- mostly in Europe -- to temporarily suspend use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.A WHO committee on vaccines is looking into the issue.“I think the reassurance to the public is that regardless of whether or not the committee ultimately assesses that there may be an association between these events and the vaccine, that in any event, these are very rare events,” O'Brien said during a Wednesday news conference.The current “benefit-risk assessment” from the European Medicines Agency and WHO is for countries to continue giving people AstraZeneca shots, she said. Both WHO and EMA are expected to present updated recommendations on Wednesday or Thursday.O’Brien said in general “vaccine recommendations are dynamic,” and are reviewed over days, months, and years. She noted that blood clots occur regularly in the population.“What we don’t know is whether or not that experience would be related to having been vaccinated,” she said. “The important point is that if anybody is having symptoms, any serious medical symptoms, regardless of whether you’ve been vaccinated or not vaccinated, it’s important to seek medical care for the presence of those symptoms.”The comments came at a news conference detailing how a WHO expert panel on vaccines recommended use of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose COVID-19 vaccine, which has already been granted an emergency use authorization from the U.N. agency.Dr. Annelies Wilder-Smith, a technical adviser to the expert panel, noted that studies on the J&J vaccine involving some 42,000 people turned up 10 cases of blood clotting in the placebo group -- slightly more than half of all participants -- and 14 cases among those who were administered the vaccine. She called that difference “not statistically significant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-official-calls-blood-clots-very-rare-101615985610987.html

17-03-2021||World||Egypt prepares for move to 'high-tech' new capital, away from the chaos of Cairo||Egypt is racing to prepare a grandiose new capital city in the desert east of Cairo before the first civil servants move in this summer and ahead of the delayed official opening of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's flagship project.At the heart of the city, workers are putting finishing touches to an avenue of ministries that echo the architecture of pharaonic temples and adjoin a raised Islamic complex, two domed parliament buildings and a sprawling presidential compound.There will be a monorail passing through a business district where a 385-metre central tower is close to completion. Beyond, the contours of a 10km park stretching to a giant mosque are taking shape.The city, known simply as the New Administrative Capital, is designed to operate with smart technology on virgin land away from the clutter and chaos of Cairo. It will boast universities, leisure facilities and a diplomatic quarter.But it has made halting progress, and after Emirati funding fell through shortly after it was announced in 2015, the military and government took on the estimated $25 billion cost of the first phase, injecting off-budget investment.Some foreign loans and financing have been secured.The coronavirus pandemic also slowed progress, and the first of three planned phases, covering 168 square kilometres, will not be completed when the government begins to move in."The rate of completion of the first phase has passed 60% across all projects," said Khaled el-Husseiny, spokesman for the new capital.He added that the delayed transfer of civil servants would begin in July, ahead of an official opening planned for the end of 2021.Hi-TechThe city is being designed as a high-tech model for Egypt's future.Control centres will monitor infrastructure and security electronically, roofs will be covered in solar panels, payments will be cashless and 15 square metres of green space are allocated per inhabitant, officials said."We are trying to solve all the problems we had in the past in the new capital," said Husseiny.The finished city is expected to house at least 6 million residents, its second and third phases largely residential.That will take decades to complete, although the government will be able to function normally while construction goes on, said Amr Khattab, spokesman for the Housing Ministry which is responsible for executing parts of the city.How far and how fast Egypt's centre of gravity shifts away from Cairo to the new capital 45 km from the Nile is unclear. For now, thousands of residential blocks stand empty either side of a highway leading into the new city.The completion of the business district, yet to be marketed, is set for 2023.Electric train and monorail links are under construction. The first 50,000 civil servants expected to relocate to the new capital from this summer will be offered shuttle buses to get there.Around 5,000 out of 20,000 housing units have been sold in the first residential district expected to open in May, said Khattab.On Monday, Sisi's office announced 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($96 million) in incentives for civil servants selected to move to the city.Land SalesOfficials say the city will eventually include social housing and is meant to finance itself through land sales, though it is unclear how much revenue these have generated.Of the $25 billion cost for the first phase, about $3 billion is being spent on the government district, said Husseiny.Some international financing has been secured for rail links, and a $3 billion Chinese loan has helped fund the business district, built by China State Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC).Sisi, who has embarked on multiple infrastructure mega-projects and national development schemes, says other regions will not be neglected."We are not leaving Cairo, or Alexandria or Port Said or other provinces. We are moving forward with the old and the new together," the president said last week. The capital's opening would mark the "birth of a new state", he added.Though there is support for the government's argument that the new capital can reduce congestion in Cairo, there is also concern that it will be unaffordable and inaccessible to many."Some classes will be able to live there, others won't," said Alaa Ibrahim, a 39-year-old electrician in Cairo's impoverished Imbaba district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-prepares-for-move-to-high-tech-new-capital-away-from-the-chaos-of-cairo-101615984419119.html

Of meeting the May 1 deadline, he said it “could happen, but it is tough.” If the deadline is extended, he added, it won’t be by “a lot longer.”Biden, like his predecessor, has promised to end the nearly 20-year conflict and bring home more than 2,500 American troops in the country — down from about 13,000 troops a year ago. The Trump deal caught some American allies off guard, as the roughly 7,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan rely on the US for logistics and security support.“That was not a very solidly negotiated deal that the president, the former president worked out,” Biden said in the interview. “We’re in consultation with our allies as well as the government, and that decision is in process now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-calls-afghanistan-withdrawal-deadline-of-may-1-tough-101615983309523.html

Queen Rania called it an "unspeakable atrocity in all respects".The king called for the culprits to be punished to the full extent of the law and the case was reclassified as an "act of terrorism" and transferred to the state security court.Among the other defendants, one was sentenced to 15 years jail for complicity, one to 10 years for kidnapping and two to one year.

The UK is proud to be its co-chair and I am delighted that since its launch, the coalition has made such a great start with 28 countries and organisations now signed up,” he said.He highlighted how the UK embarked on its journey to make its infrastructure more disaster-resilient over 10 years ago and is investing 5.2 billion pounds in bolstering flood defences and has a “wealth of expertise to share”.“If our battle with Covid-19 has taught us anything over the past year, it’s that we must be ready for whatever challenges may be coming next."And, as the world’s climate changes, we must not only do everything in power to strive for Global Net Zero, an ambitious 2030 emissions reductions target, but we must also adapt to its damaging effects and build more resilience to disasters – our roads, our bridges, powerlines, our schools and hospitals – all the infrastructure that we rely on to keep our economies moving and our communities safe. They must be made ready,” Johnson said.“As we look forward to COP26 in Glasgow this November, we are working hard to help countries adapt to the effects of climate change. Let’s take action now so that as we build back better from the pandemic, we do so cleaner and greener, making all our communities stronger and more resilient,” he added, in reference to the United Nations climate conference being hosted by the UK later this year.India and the UK are co-chairs of the CDRI and are presently working together to create a new multi-country facility to support Small Island Developing States in creating climate and disaster-resilient infrastructure.“In our quest for resilience, we are all in the same boat. The pandemic has reminded us that no one is safe until everyone is safe,” Modi said in his inaugural address.The virtual event, hosted by India from Wednesday to Friday, brings together stakeholders from partner countries and organisations to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems against climate and disaster risks in support of sustainable development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shared-climate-vision-on-visit-agenda-with-friend-pm-modi-boris-johnson-101615982927455.html
17-03-2021||World||Russia 'influenced' 2020 US presidential race to help Trump hurt Biden: Intelligence report||Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to help Donald Trump in last November's presidential election, according to a declassified intelligence assessment that found broad efforts by the Kremlin and Iran to shape the outcome of the race but ultimately no evidence that any foreign actor changed votes or otherwise disrupted the voting process.The report released Tuesday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence represents the most detailed assessment of the array of foreign threats to the 2020 election. These included efforts by Iran to undermine confidence in the vote and harm Trump’s reelection prospects as well as Moscow operations that relied on Trump's allies to smear Joe Biden, the eventual winner.Despite those threats, though, intelligence officials found "no indications that any foreign actor attempted to interfere in the 2020 US elections by altering any technical aspect of the voting process, including voter registration, ballot casting, vote tabulation, or reporting results.”The report is the latest official affirmation of the integrity of the election, even as Trump supporters continue to make false claims of interference, from foreign or domestic actors, and refuse to accept Biden’s victory. Multiple courts and even Trump’s own Justice Department refuted claims of widespread fraud. The document makes clear that even while Trump has cried foul about the legitimacy of the election, intelligence officials believe Russia sought to influence people close to Trump as a way to tip the election in his favour.The report, rejected by Russia as “unsubstantiated,” wades into the politically charged task of ferreting out which foreign adversaries supported which candidates during the 2020 election, an issue that dominated headlines last year. Trump, whose 2016 campaign benefited from hacking by Russian intelligence officers and a covert social media effort, seized on an intelligence assessment from August that said China preferred a Biden presidency — even though the same assessment also said Russia was working to boost Trump's own candidacy by disparaging Biden.Tuesday's report, however, says China ultimately did not interfere on either side and “considered but did not deploy" influence operations intended to affect the outcome. U.S. officials say they believe Beijing prioritized a stable relationship with the U.S. and did not consider either election outcome as advantageous enough for it to risk the “blowback” that would ensue if it got caught interfering.The primary threats instead came from Russia and Iran, albeit with different intentions and through different means, according to intelligence officials.In the case of Russia, the report says, Russia sought to undermine Biden’s candidacy because it viewed his presidency as opposed to the Kremlin's interests, though it took some steps to prepare for a Democratic administration as the election neared.The report also says Putin authorized influence operations aimed at denigrating Biden, boosting Trump, undermining confidence in the election and exacerbating social divisions in the U.S.Biden, in an interview that aired Wednesday on ABC's “Good Morning America,” said that there would be repercussions for Putin for a variety of misdeeds, saying, “The price he’s going to pay, you’ll see shortly."The president recounted that in their first call, held last month, he opened by saying to Putin that “we understand each other." And when asked in the interview if he thinks Putin is a killer, Biden said, “I do.”Central to Moscow's interference effort was reliance on proxies linked to Russian intelligence “to launder influence narratives" by using media organizations, U.S. officials and people close to Trump to push “misleading or unsubstantiated" allegations against Biden.Intelligence officials did not single out any Trump ally in that effort. But longtime associate Rudy Giuliani met multiple times with Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, who in 2020 released heavily edited recordings of Biden in an effort to link the Democratic nominee to unsubstantiated corruption allegations. U.S. officials have said they regard Derkach as an “active Russian agent,” and Tuesday's report said Putin is believed to have a “purview” over his activities.Notably, though, Russia was not as aggressive as in past election cycles in trying to hack election infrastructure. The report says Russian cyber operations that targeted state and local government networks last year were probably not election-focused and were instead part of a broader effort to target the U.S. and global entities.The Kremlin on Wednesday rejected the allegations in the report.“We disagree with this report’s findings of our country,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. “Russia didn’t interfere with the previous election and didn’t interfere with the 2020 election mentioned in the report."He said Russia "has nothing to do with campaigns against any of the candidates,” calling the report “unfounded and unsubstantiated.” He expressed regret that “such materials, far from being of high quality,” could be used as a pretext for new sanctions against Russia.Iran, meanwhile, carried out its own influence campaign aimed at harming Trump's reelection bid, an effort U.S. officials say was probably approved by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.One “highly targeted operation" — the subject of an October news conference by then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and FBI Director Christopher Wray — involved a flurry of emails to Democratic voters in battleground states that falsely purported to be from the far-right group Proud Boys and threatened the recipients if they didn't vote for Trump.Iran's efforts, which officials say were more aggressive than in past elections and continued even after the contest was over, were focused on sowing discord in the U.S., likely because Tehran believed that would hurt Trump's re-election chances.Though Iran sought to exploit vulnerabilities on state election websites and did “compromise US entities associated with election infrastructure as a part of a broad targeting effort across multiple sectors worldwide,” it did not attempt to manipulate votes or affect election infrastructure, the report concluded.The 15-page document is a declassified version of an election interference report that was provided to Trump on Jan. 7, one day after a riot at the U.S. Capitol that occurred as Congress was gathering to certify the election results.A separate document released Tuesday from the departments of Justice and Homeland Security reached a similar conclusion about the integrity of the election, saying there was no evidence any foreign actor had changed votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-influenced-2020-race-to-help-trump-hurt-biden-us-intelligence-report-101615981740344.html
17-03-2021||World||Germany to boost incentives for firms offering vocational training by $830 million||Germany will increase incentives for firms offering vocational training by 700 million euros ($830 million) as the Covid-19 pandemic undermines efforts to reduce shortages of skilled labour in Europe's largest economy, officials said on Wednesday.Even before the coronavirus crisis hit in 2020, workers and trainees faced huge reskilling challenges due to the digitalisation of business models, automation of production steps and electrification in the automobile industry.The pandemic has increased the risk of skill bottlenecks and mismatch unemployment because virus-hit firms are scaling back vocational training positions and trainees are having problems applying for an apprenticeship during lockdown.In addition, the coronavirus is reshaping Europe's labour markets more fundamentally and spurring workers to seek new career paths as old jobs disappear or remain beset with uncertainty about any return to normal.Also read: Most Germans believe it was right to pause AstraZeneca shots, survey findsLabour Minister Hubertus Heil from the centre-left Social Democrats said he put forward a package of measures worth some 700 million euros, including the doubling of a premium to 4,000 euros for small- and medium-sized companies which do not reduce the number of vocational training positions.If a company decides to offer even more vocational training positions compared to an average of the previous three years, the government will raise the bonus to 6,000 euros."We can't afford a situation where there is no vocational training during the crisis and we lament the lack of skilled workers after the crisis," Heil told Deutschlandfunk radio.Cabinet is expected to pass the package later on Wednesday.The government will also lift the company size limit in the scheme to include firms with employees of up to 499, sharply up from the previous threshold of up to 249 workers.The government hopes that the increased incentives can help counter an expected plunge in vocational training this year.From October 2020 until February 2021, the number of people looking for vocational training was roughly 40,000 below the level recorded during the same period in the previous year, according to figures from the Federal Labour Office.At the same time, firms offered 37,000 fewer open positions in vocational training schemes during that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-boost-incentives-for-firms-offering-vocational-training-by-830-million-101615970552376.html
17-03-2021||World||US to “refrain from causing stink” amid deadlocked nuclear negotiations with North Korea||Fresh off a stop in Tokyo, President Joe Biden’s top diplomat and defense chief traveled to South Korea on Wednesday, a day after North Korea made sure it had their attention by warning the United States to “refrain from causing a stink” amid deadlocked nuclear negotiations.How to get North Korea to return to talks will be a major focus when Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meet South Korean officials this week.It has been more than two years since nuclear talks stalled, and some experts say the United States and its allies should settle for a deal that would freeze North Korea’s nuclear program in return for relaxing sanctions — and possibly leave Pyongyang's already manufactured nuclear weapons in place.Austin and Blinken will meet their South Korean counterparts for separate talks Wednesday and a joint “two plus two” meeting Thursday, the first such contact between the two countries in five years.South Korea is the second leg of their regional tour aimed at boosting America’s Asian alliances to better deal with growing challenges from China and North Korea. While in Tokyo on Tuesday, they joined forces with Japanese officials to criticize China’s “coercion and aggression” and reaffirm their commitment to ridding North Korea of all its nuclear bombs.US-led diplomacy on that last topic has been in limbo since a February 2019 summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed over disputes on US-led sanctions. Kim has since threatened to enlarge his nuclear arsenal in protest of what he called US hostility.On Tuesday, Kim’s sister and a senior official in her own right, Kim Yo Jong, slammed the United States over its ongoing regular military drills with South Korea, which North Korea sees as an invasion rehearsal.“We take this opportunity to warn the new US administration,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement. “If it wants to sleep in peace for (the) coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.”Also watch: ‘If it wants to sleep in peace…’: Kim Jong Un’s sister & advisor warnsSome experts say Kim Yo Jong’s statement is a pressure tactic and that Pyongyang may try to further raise animosities with weapons tests to boost its leverage in future negotiations with Washington.Asked about Kim Yo Jong’s statement during a news conference in Tokyo, Blinken said that he was familiar with the comments and was more interested in hearing from allies and partners.Blinken said that Washington reached out to North Korea through several channels starting in mid-February, but it hasn’t received any response. He said the Biden administration is looking forward to completing its policy review on North Korea in coming weeks and was looking both at possible “additional pressure measures” and “diplomatic paths.”Shim Beomchul, an analyst with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said he expects the Biden administration to pursue a deal with North Korea that resembles a 2015 accord that froze Iran’s nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions. While the United States won’t likely give up its long-term commitment to denuclearizing North Korea, rolling back the country’s nuclear capabilities to zero is not a realistic near-term diplomatic goal, he said.Trump blew up that 2015 Obama administration deal in favor of what he called maximum pressure against Iran, and the Biden government is trying to resurrect it.In an op-ed in the New York Times in 2018, Blinken, then a managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, argued that the best deal the US could reach with North Korea “more than likely will look like what Barack Obama achieved with Iran.” He said that an interim agreement “would buy time to negotiate a more comprehensive deal, including a minutely sequenced road map that will require sustained diplomacy. That’s the approach Mr. Obama took with Iran.”Other experts say an Iran-style deal won’t work for North Korea. Iran hasn't built any bomb, but North Korea has already manufactured dozens. They say North Korea, which has a history of derailing agreements with its vehement rejection of verification processes, won’t find any reason to denuclearize when some of the most painful sanctions are lifted.“Everyone can say easily that (settling for) a nuclear freeze would allow North Korea to preserve its existing nukes. But I ask them what other options do they have” to realize North Korea’s denuclearization, said Kim Yeol Soo, an analyst with South Korea’s Korea Institute for Military Affairs.Another possible topic during US-South Korean talks is whether South Korea should actively participate in US-led efforts to curb China’s rising strength in the region.South Korea is a longtime US ally and hosts about 28,500 American troops. But its economy is heavily dependent on trade with China, making it difficult to take any step deemed provocative to its biggest trading partner. When South Korea allowed the United States to install anti-North Korea missile defense shield on its soil in 2017, it suffered economic retaliation from China, which sees the system’s radar as a security threat.South Korean Defense Minister Suh Wook told lawmakers Tuesday that the U.S. hadn’t formally proposed for South Korea to join an expanded format of the so-called “Quad” group that includes the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and that the Americans won’t likely make such a proposal during this week’s talks.China has called the Quad an attempt to contain its ambitions.Kim Yeol Soo said the allies will likely discuss Seoul joining an expanded Quad format, known as the Quad Plus, though they’ll never publicly announce it to avoid angering China. Kim said it would be “wise” for South Korea to join the Quad Plus to voice its opinions clearly and avoid being sidelined on issues involving Seoul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-refrain-from-causing-stink-amid-deadlocked-nuclear-negotiations-with-north-korea-101615970611366.html

17-03-2021||World||Human placenta continues to be sold illegally in China: Reports||Human placenta continues to be sold illegally in China, including on the internet, because of a steady demand for the organ’s unproven healing properties, a media report said this week.Customers who buy placenta cook and eat it, while the organ is also sold to traditional Chinese medicine makers who use it in medications.The practice, considered morbid by many, is not new to China but the report by thepaper.cn found that it continues to flourish despite a ban on trading of human organs since 2007.The usual sources to buy the human product are hospitals, medical waste treatment plants and funeral parlours, the report found, adding that each placenta could cost around 80 yuan ($12).Subsequently, after being processed, when it is sold to shops, the cost could go up to several hundred yuan.Processing placenta into capsules has become a business in China as some feel uncomfortable to eat it directly, said the report.Called “ziheche” in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), placenta is believed to strengthen immune systems that are weak and it is also said to be good for reproductive health.“On online shopping platform Taobao, placenta from a boy is sold at 480 yuan ($73) and 450 yuan ($69) from a girl. The price difference is due to a long-term belief in China that a baby boy’s placenta has stronger health benefits. Online sellers often use vague or cryptic language to disguise what they are selling to avoid detection by authorities,” according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.“Currently, hospitals in China either return the placentas to their owners or dispose of them as medical wastes if new mothers don’t want them,” Huang Chengsheng, an obstetrician at the Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital, told the tabloid Global Times in another report.“Many new mothers choose to take their placentas home and eat them,” Huang was quoted as saying.According to reports, placentophagy - the practice of eating one’s placenta after birth - is relatively common in China.Scientists have questioned the tradition.“Despite the many claimed benefits of placentophagy, it is unclear whether consumption of the placenta is advantageous. The placenta is not sterile and one function of the placenta is to protect the fetus from harmful exposure to substances. As a consequence, elements including selenium, cadmium, mercury, and lead, as well as bacteria have been identified in post-term placental tissues,” a paper published by the US’s National Centre for Biotechnology Information a few years ago said.“Due to in-utero or post-birth contamination bacteria or viruses may remain within post-term placental tissues. The potential adverse effects of these components of the placenta on the postpartum consumer and nursing infant are unknown,” the research paper added.The demand for placenta within China, however, is big enough for some to try and smuggle it from abroad.A number of seizures were carried out by Chinese customs in 2019.In September 2019, customs in the city of Yantai, east China’s Shandong province, intercepted a total of 3,500 injections and capsules of human placenta extract from an inbound flight.“The 3,300 injections, totalling 6,600ml, and 200 350mg capsules, were found undeclared in the luggage of a Chinese passenger who flew from Japan’s Nagoya to Yantai,” a Xinhua report on the seizure said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-placenta-continues-to-be-sold-illegally-in-china-reports-101615978989340.html

17-03-2021||World||Boris Johnson’s Britain trade deal hit by China human rights row||Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted the UK must be ready to increase trade with China, in the face of criticism that his government is putting commercial deals ahead of security and human rights.Setting out his principles for the UK’s future foreign and defense policy, Johnson told Parliament his administration would defend its values as well as its interests. He said Britain had already called out China for the treatment of its predominately Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, and had intervened to offer 3 million of Hong Kong’s people a path to becoming British citizens.“There is no question that China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours,” the prime minister told Parliament on Tuesday. “But we will also work with China where that is consistent with our values and interests, including building a stronger and positive economic relationship and in addressing climate change.”Some of Johnson’s own Conservatives -- including former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt -- raised concerns that he wasn’t taking a strong enough line against Beijing and urged him to think again. Meanwhile, a report by UK lawmakers said their was “compelling evidence” that major fashion, retail, media and technology companies that do significant business in Britain were complicit in forced labor practices in Xinjiang.Whether China appreciates Johnson’s efforts to strike a balance remains unclear. Chinese diplomats have repeatedly denounced his government over the UK’s efforts to support Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition and ban China’s main state television network.Also read: British PM to visit India in April“We urge the UK to immediately stop making political maneuvers and correct its mistakes,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing last month after the UK communications regular revoked CGTN broadcasting license. Last week, the Foreign Ministry in Beijing summoned the UK ambassador, Caroline Wilson, over a commentary she wrote defending the foreign media.China denies using forced labor in Xinjiang, explaining its policies as vocational programs to combat extremism and poverty. “Such inflammatory accusations are fabricated out of ignorance and prejudice,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the UN Human Rights Council in February.Johnson is in a delicate position as he seeks to shape a new role for the UK outside the European Union, striking commercial agreements with new allies, while attempting to show the country is still a force for “good” in the world. His struggle parallels that of the EU, which is facing resistance in parliament to an investment agreement announced in December despite concerns about forced labor.A defense blueprint for the next decade released by the Johnson government on Tuesday called for greater focus on the Indian and Pacific oceans. That included upgrades to bases in Cyprus, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman and Singapore so forces can respond more quickly to threats.‘Growth Markets’The British leader’s effort to defend his record on China was dented when the HuffPost UK published a leaked recording of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab briefing an internal meeting of his officials that human rights considerations wouldn’t always trump trade needs. Restricting trade pacts to countries that meet the standards of the European Convention on Human Rights would hurt result in missing out on commerce with “growth markets,” Raab said.The Foreign Office responded by insisting that the leaked recording from the staff meeting had been selectively edited.“I squarely believe we ought to be trading liberally around the world,” Raab told his team. “If we restrict it to countries with ECHR-level standards of human rights, we’re not going to do many trade deals with the growth markets of the future.”A spokesman for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the minister had in fact made clear “in his full answer” that Britain always defends human rights, and highlighted examples of sanctions and action the country had taken at the UN.“We regret that this audio has been deliberately and selectively clipped to distort the foreign secretary’s comments,” the spokesman said. “As he made crystal clear in his full answer, the UK always stands up for and speaks out on human rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-britain-trade-deal-hit-by-china-human-rights-row-101615965261317.html
17-03-2021||World||Peace with Pakistan will give India direct access to Central Asia: Imran Khan||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said India will be benefitted economically by having peace with his country as it will enable New Delhi to directly access the resource-rich Central Asia region through Pakistani territory.Delivering the inaugural address at the launch of the two-day Islamabad Security Dialogue, Khan also said that his government after coming to power in 2018 did everything for better ties with India and it was for India to reciprocate.“India will have to take the first step. Unless they do so, we cannot do much,” he said.India last month said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.India has also told Pakistan that "talks and terror" cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.Khan discussed Pakistan's vision of comprehensive national security, built on the pillars of traditional and non-traditional security, including his vision for economic prosperity and human welfare.Khan dwelt at length on the issue of peace in the region, including peace between Pakistan and India, saying "the unresolved Kashmir issue was the biggest hurdle between the two countries."“If India gives the Kashmiris their right under the UN (resolutions), it will be greatly beneficial for Pakistan as well as for India,” he said and added, “India can access Central Asia after peace.”Khan said that having a direct route to the Central Asian region will economically benefit India. Central Asia is rich in oil and gas.Central Asia, in the modern context, generally includes five resource-rich countries -- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcating it into two Union territories in August, 2019.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution was its internal matter. The Ministry of External Affairs has also underlined that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India.India and Pakistan had announced on February 25 that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.Ties between India and Pakistan nosedived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country.Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India's war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories.Talking about non-traditional threats to Pakistan, Khan said that climate change, food security and a weak economy were among the biggest challenges in the quest to realise the full concept of security.He acknowledged that improving the national economy was the biggest challenge but his government was trying to reduce trade deficit and control inflation so that the financial condition of common people could improve.“We cannot become a secure nation when a small rich minority is surrounded by the sea of poor people…National security is achieved when a nation stands up to secure itself,” he said at the dialogue organised by the National Security Division and think-tanks comprising the Advisory Board of National Security Committee.Khan also praised all-weather ally China for its "successful" handling of poverty and lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty in the last three decades. “It is their big achievement whether you like China or not,” he said.Khan said that Pakistan’s 25 per cent population was suffering from extreme poverty and another 25 per cent was just slightly better.He said the government already launched Ehsaas programme to give cash to the poor people and another programme of giving targeted subsidies to the poor was being launched.Khan also talked about peace in Afghanistan and reiterated support for the ongoing peace process by saying that Pakistan would be the greatest beneficiary of a stable Afghanistan.The Islamabad Security Dialogue is envisioned as an annual flagship security forum based on the model of major dialogues on security and international policy.The National Security Division, in collaboration with leading think-tanks that are part of its advisory board, has taken this initiative to provide a platform for critical thinking and robust intellectual discourse on some of the most pressing challenges and opportunities being faced by Pakistan and the wider region, according to an official statement.The two-day event is being attended virtually by international thinkers and scholars, members from the Federal Cabinet, diplomatic corps, former government officials, academia, think-tanks and civil society members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peace-with-pakistan-will-give-india-direct-access-to-central-asia-imran-khan-101615976726851.html

It was also much bigger than a 0.8% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.Also read: China acting aggressively, repressively in Asia, says BlinkenBy region, exports to China rose 3.4% in the year to February, led by chip-making equipment, nonferrous metals and plastic, slowing sharply from a 37.5% gain in the prior month due partly to the Lunar New Year holidays that fell in February.US-bound shipments, another key export market for Japanese goods, declined 14.0% year-on-year in February, dragged down by automobiles, airplane parts and motors, after a 4.8% drop in the prior month and posting a fourth straight month of declines.Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's overall shipments, fell 0.8% in the year to February, while those to European Union declined 3.3%, the data showed.The trade data comes on the eve of the Bank of Japan's two-day policy review at which it may phase out a numerical target for its risky asset buying, underscoring the rising cost of prolonged easing under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's stimulus.It also follows the Reuters Tankan poll that found Japanese manufacturers grew more upbeat about a gradual recovery though worries about Covid-19 impact lingered.Imports rose 11.8% in the year to February, roughly matching the median estimate, following a 9.5% drop in the prior month and bringing a trade surplus of 217.4 billion yen ($2 billion).Imports marked the first annual gain in 22 months due to a pick-up in domestic demand, restocking of inventory and rises in crude oil and resources prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-economy-slows-weakening-of-us-china-shipments-raises-concerns-101615945875109.html
17-03-2021||World||'Don't come': Biden tells migrants after criticism over surge at Mexican border||US President Joe Biden urged migrants not to come to the United States on Tuesday, as criticism mounted over a surge in people arriving at the southern border with Mexico -- including thousands of unaccompanied children."Yes I can say quite clearly don't come over ... Don't leave your town or city or community," he said in an interview with ABC News, addressing the migrants.Speaking hours after his head of homeland security defended the administration's immigration policies, Biden also shrugged off claims that his dismantling of former president Donald Trump's tough stance had encouraged the surge, pointing out that there had been similar surges in 2019 and 2020."The idea that Joe Biden said 'come' - I heard the other day that they're coming because I'm a nice guy... Here's the deal, they're not," he said.On January 20, his first day in office, Biden scrapped several of Donald Trump's contentious immigration policies, including halting new construction of a border wall and proposing legislation to create a citizenship pathway for the nearly 11 million people living illegally in the US.Republican critics say Biden's policies caused a sharp increase in migrants seeking to cross into the US illegally.Also read: Undocumented Indian immigrants hold USD15.5 billion in spending powerThe president spoke a day after top Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy visited the border in Texas with fellow Republican lawmakers and accused Biden of creating a "crisis."- Migrant spikes 'not new' -Biden's chief of homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday also defended the administration's immigration policies.Mayorkas acknowledged the United States was "on pace" to encounter more migrants at the border than at any time in two decades, but said such spikes were "not new," having also occurred in 2019, 2014 and earlier."The situation we are currently facing at the southwest border is a difficult one," Mayorkas said in a statement."We are keeping our borders secure, enforcing our laws, and staying true to our values and principles."Mayorkas said the rise in unaccompanied children -- some as young as six or seven -- comes from ending the policies of Trump, whose administration "cruelly expelled young children into the hands of traffickers.""They are vulnerable children and we have ended the prior administration's practice of expelling them," he said.The Biden administration continues to expel most single adults and people traveling in families.In February, the US Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) arrested about 100,000 people at the southern border -- including nearly 9,500 unaccompanied children -- a 28 percent jump over January.Mayorkas blasted the Trump administration for having cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras meant to tackle the root causes of migration such as violence and the impacts of natural disasters.Holding facilities for apprehended migrants are crowded, Mayorkas said, noting authorities had not "had the capacity to intake the number of unaccompanied children we have been encountering."Complicating conditions, pandemic-related physical distancing protocols have further reduced space, said Mayorkas, who has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help activate additional facilities.Cuban-born Mayorkas said his parents, who brought him to the US as an infant, "understood the hope and promise of America.""Today, young children are arriving at our border with that same hope," he said. "We can do this."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-come-biden-tells-migrants-after-criticism-over-surge-at-mexican-border-101615957550237.html

Hartman is being held on a trespassing charge.Hartman allegedly left the facility where she had been staying while on electronic monitoring. The device allowed Cook County sheriff's deputies to track her as she headed for O'Hare. Deputies activated an alarm on Hartman's device as she neared Terminal 1, where she was arrested.Officials of the Cook County Sheriff's Department say plans are to seek a felony escape charge for Hartman.Hartman's arrest comes two weeks after a court hearing in which Hartman's attorneys and prosecutors said they reached the plea deal on a pending case that would have imposed 18 months of probation, plus court-ordered mental health treatment.Formal plea proceedings had not begun, but Judge Peggy Chiampas put attorneys on notice that she was not inclined to agree to that sentence.Hartman, was arrested at O'Hare in October 2019 just as she was trying to pass the second of two security checkpoints, according to court records. She was released from Cook County Jail about a year ago in an effort to release low-risk detainees from contracting Covid-19.The 2019 arrest violated her probation sentence for sneaking past O'Hare security in January 2018, boarding a jet and flying to London's Heathrow Airport without a ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-with-history-of-stowaways-busted-for-sneaking-into-chicago-airport-101615957530210.html
17-03-2021||World||Most Germans believe it was right to pause AstraZeneca shots, survey finds||A majority of Germans believe it was right for the government to suspend AstraZeneca's COVID-19 shots pending an investigation of cases where recipients developed unusual blood disorders, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday.Germany, along with more than a dozen European Union member states, halted AstraZeneca after its vaccine oversight body found seven people had suffered rare cerebral vein thromboses, three of whom died.According to the Forsa snap poll for broadcasters RTL and ntv, 54% of respondents said the decision by Health Minister Jens Spahn had been right. Nearly four in 10 said the reaction was excessive. Some 39% thought the suspension was wrong.The European Union's drug regulator is investigating the reports of blood clots, bleeding and low platelet counts and will report its findings on Thursday.Its head, Emer Cooke, said on Tuesday that the benefits of the AstraZeneca shot clearly outweighed its risks. It was important, she added, to maintain public trust in vaccines in order to beat the coronavirus pandemic.The willingness of Germans to be vaccinated against COVID, at 71%, has fallen by two percentage points since Forsa's last poll on March 3. The new survey covered 1,001 respondents and had a margin for error of three percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-germans-believe-it-was-right-to-pause-astrazeneca-shots-survey-finds-101615975468744.html

Even I open my arms and say 'Let dialogue prevail'."Francis, who visited Myanmar in 2017, said: "Blood does not resolve anything. Dialogue must prevail."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-kneel-on-the-streets-of-myanmar-and-say-stop-the-violence-pope-101615974981692.html

It extends up to the end of May, when weather deteriorates and climbing becomes dangerous.Those wishing to scale mountains still have to be quarantined in a hotel in the capital and test negative for the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-expecting-hundreds-of-mountain-climbers-despite-covid-crisis-101615974641801.html
17-03-2021||World||Myanmar protesters don't relent in face of deadly crackdown||Protesters against the military takeover in Myanmar were not relenting Wednesday as the deadly crackdown on peaceful demonstrations took an increasing toll.The verified death toll among protesters since the February 1 coup ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi has now exceeded 200, according to a tally compiled by the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.“Junta forces target protesters but also ordinary people using sniper rifles regardless of the time or place,” charged the organisation.“Some injured people were arrested and died without access to medical treatment, some individuals have died due to being tortured during interrogation, some others who were shot dead in a crackdown were dragged away without mercy and their dead bodies are not being returned to their families by junta forces,” it elaborated, repeating widespread and credible allegations.The association, whose tallies include only verified cases, said that as of Tuesday, in addition to 202 fatalities, 2,181 people have been arrested or charged, with 1,862 still being detained or sought.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions.Regional media outlets and social media posts reported new peaceful protest marches Wednesday in Taungoo, Thayet, Myingyan, and Madaya, all in central Myanmar; Tamu, in the northwest near the border with India, and Pyay, on the Irrawaddy River northwest of Yangon.There were also fresh reports of the novel protest tactic of lining up rows of signboards in public streets to serve as proxies for human demonstrators, an approach that is being called “non-human strikes.”Such actions took place Wednesday in Pyinmana, a satellite town of the capital Naypyitaw, and Naungcho, a town in Shan State in north-central Myanmar.Protesters in Yangon's Kyeemyindine township put a new spin on the tactic, having coconuts stand in for people, painted word by word in Burmese, “Spring Revolution.”Police in several Yangon neighbourhoods on Tuesday night continued their aggressive patrols, firing in the air, attacking several individuals and conducting raids on the homes of suspected protesters. They also dismantled barricades put up Wednesday morning by protesters.The extent of protests Wednesday in Yangon was hard to gauge as the government further restricted communications, limiting access to timely information.The government ordered mobile internet data service shut on Sunday. Wi-Fi access, much less extensive, has been left on, but some users reported Wednesday that it has slowed to a crawl, making it difficult to upload photos and video.Several neighbourhoods in Yangon have been under martial law since Monday, putting them under complete control by the military, which has also made it difficult for protesters to organise and communicate.State television MRTV announced Tuesday evening that a leading figure in the resistance movement, Dr Sasa, has been charged with high treason, which carries a death sentence.Sasa, a medical doctor who uses a single name, is a member of the Chin ethnic minority and was appointed a special U.N. envoy by the Committee Representing Pyihtaungsu Hluttaw, comprising elected members of Parliament who were not allowed to take their seats.The CRPH, which operates underground inside the country and with representatives abroad, has established itself as a shadow government that claims to be the sole legitimate representative body of Myanmar's citizens. It was declared an illegal treasonous organization by the junta.Sasa is accused of stirring up internal conflict and acting against the junta, which claims to be the country's sole legitimate ruling body despite having ousted an elected government.Sasa said he was proud to be charged with treason, “because treason against the junta means that I am standing with the people of Myanmar, giving my life for their freedom, for federal democracy and for justice.”His statement, dated Tuesday and duplicated on his Facebook page, recounted the Myanmar military's long history of committing atrocities against ethnic minorities and putting down past protest movements, as well as the killings of civilians following last month's coup.“It is these Generals that have committed acts of treason every day. Taking what they want for themselves, denying the people their rights, and oppressing those that stand in their way,” Sasa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-don-t-relent-in-face-of-deadly-crackdown-101615972906947.html
17-03-2021||World||Biden White House kicks off Covid stimulus tour||With a promise of "shots in arms and money in pockets," President Joe Biden on Monday kicked off a week of promotion and travel for the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill he signed into law last week to help the country move past the Covid-19 pandemic.Biden and other advocates including Vice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden are being deployed to various states and to television as part of what the White House is calling the "Help Is Here Tour."The package, one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history, provides $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments, an expansion of the child tax credit and increased funding for vaccine distribution."Help is here, and hope is here, in real and tangible ways," Biden said in remarks from the White House.The legislation was Biden's first legislative priority on taking office in January. His fellow Democrats used narrow majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate to pass a large measure of what Biden originally proposed without Republican support.The Democratic president said his administration would reach two important goals over the next 10 days: 100 million coronavirus shots in people's arms and 100 million checks in people's pockets or bank accounts."Shots in arms and money in pockets. That's important. The American Rescue Plan is already doing what it was designed to do: make a difference in people's everyday lives. And we're just getting started," Biden added.The White House has said it does not believe former President Barack Obama's administration, in which Biden served as vice president, did enough to promote its more than $800 billion 2009 economic rescue program. Democrats went on to lose control of the House to Republicans the next year.Taking their case directly to the people, Harris traveled to Las Vegas on Monday, while Biden goes to Pennsylvania on Tuesday and Atlanta on Friday. He will also do an interview on Wednesday on ABC's "Good Morning America" program."We want to avoid a situation where folks are unaware of what they're entitled to and then this moment passes and they don't get the full relief," the vice president told reporters in Las Vegas.POPULAR SUPPORTDemocrats regard the bill as good policy and good politics. Opinion polls show majorities supporting efforts to shore up the coronavirus vaccination campaign, prepare schools to reopen and ease poverty after a year-long pandemic that has killed more than 535,000 Americans and put millions of people out of work.Republicans, who broadly supported coronavirus relief early in the crisis when Republican Donald Trump was president, have called the latest measure an overpriced collection of pet projects unrelated to the pandemic.Harris said she visited Nevada because of the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the state's hospitality industry. Speaking with workers and labor unions about the legislation's benefits, she urged people to file their taxes so they can receive such relief faster.She will visit Colorado on Tuesday. Both there and in Nevada, Democrats will be defending U.S. Senate seats in elections next year that could be critical in helping the party maintain narrow control of that chamber.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-white-house-kicks-off-covid-stimulus-tour-101615971766517.html
17-03-2021||World||Sri Lanka to continue with Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine: Govt spokesman||Sri Lanka will continue to use the Oxford AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines despite its suspension in some countries over reports that the doses were causing blood clot-related complications, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.Some nations, mostly European, suspended the use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which also has a tie-up with the Serum Institute of India, after some reports of blood clotting.Ramesh Pathirana, the Cabinet co-spokesman, said that the vaccine halted in certain European countries was limited to one batch of the vaccine and Sri Lanka had not received doses from the same batch.“Those vaccines which are involved in that problem only belong to a certain batch in that vaccine are temporarily suspended in certain countries in Europe, that batch of vaccines was not given to Sri Lanka,” he said.He said that the public should remain calm and not fear such reports.His comments come in the wake of several European countries -- including Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Norway and Iceland -- pausing the administration of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Some Asian and African countries have expressed concern. Congo and Thailand have stopped the doses.However, the UK and EU regulators and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have backed the usage of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs.India gifted 500,000 doses of Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines to Sri Lanka, which kicked off its vaccination programme in late January.Health officials said some 7,84,500 people out of the 21 million population had already been given the first dose of the vaccine. Pathirana said under the World Health Organization’s COVAX facility, the island would soon receive another batch of vaccines.“We are arriving at a controlled situation due to the intervention of the health officials and security forces and due to the dedication of the people,” he said.Sri Lanka has so far reported 88,524 coronavirus cases with 534 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-to-continue-with-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-govt-spokesman-101615965427630.html
17-03-2021||World||Myanmar's Buddhist monks urge military to end violence against protesters||Myanmar's most powerful Buddhist monks' association called on the junta to end violence against protesters and accused an "armed minority" of torture and killing innocent civilians since last month's coup, media said on Wednesday.In its most forthright condemnation of the military's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations, the government-appointed organisation also said in a draft statement its members intended to halt activities, in an apparent protest.The State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee planned to release a final statement after consulting the religious affairs minister on Thursday, Myanmar Now news portal said, citing a monk who attended a meeting of the committee.Monks have a long history of activism in Myanmar and were at the forefront of a 2007 "Saffron Revolution" against military rule, an uprising that, although suppressed, helped usher in democratic reforms.Committee members could not immediately be reached for comment, but their reported stance would signal a significant rift between authorities and a group that usually works closely with the government.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1, detaining her and members of her party, drawing wide international condemnation.Ousted members of parliament, most from Suu Kyi's party, pushed for a united stand against the coup in the ethnically diverse country, saying the designation of terrorist would be lifted from all autonomy-seeking insurgents fighting for democracy.More than 180 protesters have been killed as security forces try to crush a wave of demonstrations, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group says.Security forces killed a man at a demonstration in Yangon overnight, the victim's brother said. In the morning, protesters in one neighbourhood left rows of coconuts on a road, representing people, with a sign saying: "Give back our future!"While the security forces have focused on stamping out dissent in the main city of Yangon, small demonstrations erupt elsewhere.Several hundred people gathered with protest signs in Demoso in the east, Pathein in the Irrawaddy river delta and Dawei in the south on Wednesday, pictures on social media showed.Residents of the second city of Mandalay and the central town of Monywa also reported protests.A total mobile internet shutdown made it difficult for protesters to communicate and verify the information. Very few people in Myanmar have access to Wi-Fi."We have to use old ways to communicate," Chit Chit Win, a member of a women's protest group, told Reuters from Dawei."We use a guerrilla protest system. We tell people to disperse if security forces come...avoiding confrontation but doing what we can."A team of U.N. investigators on Myanmar appealed for people to collect and preserve documentary evidence of crimes ordered by the military in order to build cases against its leaders.A junta spokesman did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.Deadly pay disputeParts of Yangon have been placed under martial law and thousands of residents have fled the industrial suburb of Hlaingthaya where security forces killed 40 people on Sunday and Chinese-financed factories were set ablaze.Workers said a dispute over pay at a Chinese-owned factory in the industrial zone turned violent on Tuesday after the owner called the security forces, who shot dead a labour leader and then at least four people.Myanmar Now said six people were killed. Two doctors told Reuters there were still wounded people there, but the army had sealed off the area.Chinese state media have warned that Beijing could take unspecified action if there are further attacks on Chinese-owned businesses.Many people in Myanmar believe Beijing is backing the military. Unlike Western powers, China has not condemned the coup and, along with Russia, has prevented the U.N. Security Council from denouncing the military's actions.France said the European Union would approve sanctions against those behind the coup next Monday.The junta charged with treason an emissary of the ousted lawmakers who is attempting to re-establish the civilian government. Sasa, who goes by a single name and is abroad, issued a statement saying he was proud to have been charged and the generals committed treason every day.The ousted members of parliament said they recognised all insurgent groups committed to a "federal democratic union" and thanked them for giving refuge to coup opponents who had fled to their zones.The army, which has said for decades it is the only institution capable of ensuring national unity, said it took power after its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's party were rejected by the electoral commission.It has promised a new election but not set a date.Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup and faces various charges including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios and infringing coronavirus protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-buddhist-monks-urge-military-to-end-violence-against-protesters-101615970242700.html

It has reported just 35 deaths due to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-says-homegrown-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-available-by-4th-quarter-101615959176392.html
17-03-2021||World||Voters go to polls on final day of pandemic-hit Dutch election||Thousands of voting booths opened across the Netherlands early Wednesday on the final day of a general election overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic, with caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte seeking a fourth term in office.Rutte's conservative People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy has been leading polls by a wide margin for about a year, but the lead has been shrinking in recent weeks.If his party emerges as the largest when polls close at 9 p.m. (2000 GMT), Rutte will be first in line to lead talks to form the next ruling coalition. If he succeeds, he could become the country's longest-serving prime minister.His popularity rose sharply last year as he steered his country through the pandemic that has killed more than 16,000 people in the Netherlands and plunged the prosperous nation of just over 17 million into recession. But that popularity has eroded in recent weeks as public support for a months-long lockdown declined and his government resigned over a scandal involving tax officials wrongly labeling thousands of families as fraudsters.“What are you still doing here?” anti-immigration opponent Geert Wilders asked Rutte in a final televised debate Tuesday night. “Why don’t you stand down and let somebody else take over? We can’t let the pyromaniac put out the fire in the Netherlands.”Voters also have other issues on their minds, from the climate to housing shortages, health care funding and the Netherlands' place in Europe.A preelection version of the respected Peilingwijzer survey of different opinion polls predicted forecast Rutte’s party will win between 34 and 36 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. Wilders’ party is tipped to win 18-20 seats and the centrist D66 party, led by the country's minister for foreign trade and development cooperation Sigrid Kaag, who has positioned herself in the campaign as a viable alternative for Rutte as prime minister. The Netherlands has never had a woman as prime minister.Voting began Monday and Tuesday ostensibly for people considered to be in high risk groups for the virus. People aged over 70 also had the option of mail-in voting.The procedure for opening and counting postal votes had to be changed mid-election Tuesday after what the interior ministry called “procedural mistakes” by voters mailing in their ballots.A record 37 parties are taking part in the election, with 17 forecast to garner enough votes to win at least one seat in parliament's 150-seat lower house, up from 13 at the last election. That splintering of the political landscape is likely to make coalition formation negotiations a tough and lengthy process.Election officials had to cast their net wider in their hunt for suitable locations for polling stations so that they could offer enough room for social distancing between voters. Churches, concert halls and even Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum have been pressed into service, while voters in cars and on bikes could also cast their ballot at a drive-thru polling center in the Dutch capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/voters-go-to-polls-on-final-day-of-pandemic-hit-dutch-election-101615965365601.html
17-03-2021||World||UN investigators seek evidence of criminal orders by Myanmar junta||A UN team of investigators on Myanmar appealed on Wednesday for people to collect and preserve documentary evidence of crimes ordered by the military since a Feb. 1 coup, in order to build future cases against its leaders.More than 180 protesters have been killed in the southeast Asian nation by security forces trying to crush a wave of demonstrations since the junta seized power, says activist group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners."The persons most responsible for the most serious international crimes are usually those in high leadership positions," Nicholas Koumjian, the head of the UN team, said in a statement."They are not the ones who physically perpetrate the crimes and often are not even present at the locations where the crimes are committed."To prove their responsibility requires evidence of reports received, orders given and how policies were set."People with such information should contact the investigators through secure means of communication, he added, citing apps such as Signal or a ProtonMail account.On Tuesday, the UN human rights office condemned the use of live ammunition against the Myanmar protesters, saying, "We call on the military to stop killing and detaining protesters."Myanmar has been in turmoil since its military ousted the elected government of Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, detaining her and members of her party, drawing wide international condemnation.The UN investigators are collecting evidence of the use of lethal force, unlawful arrests, torture, and detentions of people whose families are not told of their whereabouts, an illegal practice known as enforced disappearance, the statement said.The Geneva-based Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar was set up by the UN Human Rights Council in Sept. 2018 to consolidate evidence of the most serious crimes and violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011.Koumjian has worked in courts prosecuting figures including former Liberian President Charles Taylor and former Cambodian President Khieu Samphan and his chief ideologist of the brutal Khmer Rouge Nuon Chea, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-investigators-seek-evidence-of-criminal-orders-by-myanmar-junta-101615969481828.html
17-03-2021||World||Over 10 million displaced by climate disasters in six months: Report||About 10.3 million people were displaced by climate change-induced events such as flooding and droughts in the last six months, the majority of them in Asia, a humanitarian organisation said on Wednesday.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said about 2.3 million others were displaced by conflict in the same period, indicating the vast majority of internal displacements are now triggered by climate change.Though the figures cover only a six-month period from September 2020 to February 2021, they highlight an accelerating global trend of climate-related displacement, said Helen Brunt, Asia Pacific Migration and Displacement Coordinator for the IFRC."Things are getting worse as climate change aggravates existing factors like poverty, conflict, and political instability," Brunt said. "The compounded impact makes recovery longer and more difficult: people barely have time to recover and they're slammed with another disaster."Some 60% of climate-IDPs (internally displaced persons) in the last six months were in Asia, according to IFRC's report.McKinsey & Co consulting firm has said that Asia "stands out as being more exposed to physical climate risks than other parts of the world in the absence of adaptation and mitigation".Statistics from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC) show that on average 22.7 million people are displaced every year. The figure includes displacements caused by geophysical phenomenon such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but the vast majority are displaced by weather-related events.Globally, 17.2 million people were displaced in 2018 and 24.9 million in 2019. Full-year figures are not yet available for 2020, but IDMC's mid-year report showed there were 9.8 million displacements because of natural disasters in the first half of last year.More than 1 billion people are expected to face forced migration by 2050 due to conflict and ecological factors, a report by the Institute for Economics and Peace found last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-10-million-displaced-by-climate-disasters-in-six-months-report-101615970120177.html
17-03-2021||World||US sanctions 24 China and Hong Kong officials ahead of talks||The US sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city, just ahead of the Biden administration's first face-to-face talks with China.The step reflects Washington’s “deep concern” about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy following changes to its election system endorsed by China’s ceremonial legislature last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Wednesday.Foreign financial institutions that deal with the 24 officials would be subject to U.S. sanctions, the State Department said.The planned changes to Hong Kong's electoral law give a pro-Beijing committee power to appoint more of Hong Kong’s lawmakers. The move will reduce the proportion of those directly elected and ensures that only those determined to be truly loyal to Beijing are allowed to run for office — effectively shutting opposition figures out of the political process.The U.S. announcement was made during a visit by Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Japan and South Korea, both of which are wary of China's growing economic, military and political heft.While in Tokyo, the two officials delivered a joint statement with their Japanese counterparts expressing concern about Beijing’s human rights violations in the western Xinjiang region against ethnic minorities and China’s determination to alter the status of a group of uninhabited islets administered by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing. The two arrived in Seoul on Wednesday for talks.On Thursday, Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan are scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the foreign affairs chief of China's ruling Communist Party, Yang Jiechi, in Anchorage, Alaska.The White House has set low expectations for the meeting. A senior official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said the two sides would not deliver a joint statement and no major announcements were expected.The U.S. has said it will be an initial opportunity to address intense disagreements over trade and human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang as well as the coronavirus pandemic.While President Joe Biden has sought to ease the harsh tone his predecessor took with China, his administration appears committed to taking a tough line on those issues.China has rejected all criticism of its policies toward Hong Kong, accusing foreign governments of interfering and saying political tightening was necessary following months of anti-government protests in 2019.Last June, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the city and Hong Kong authorities have arrested most of the prominent pro-democracy supporters and outspoken critics. Many others have fled abroad and renewed their calls this week for members of the Hong Kong diaspora to keep up the fight for freedoms promised to the city after the 1997 end of British colonial rule.Among those included in the sanctions are Wang Chen, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite 25-member Politburo, and Tam Yiu-chung, the Hong Kong delegate to the Chinese parliament’s standing committee, which drafted the national security law.Several officers from Hong Kong’s National Security Division were also sanctioned, including Li Kwai-wah, a senior superintendent, as well as Edwina Lau, a deputy commissioner of the Hong Kong police force and the head of the division.Starting last October, the U.S. had already sanctioned 10 officials including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Zhang Xiaoming. Sanctions forbid their travel to the U.S. and block their dealings with American financial institutions.Lam said in a television interview in November last year that the sanctions meant she receives her salary in cash and has “piles of cash” at home because she was cut off from banking services in Hong Kong.Chinese officials have shrugged off the impact of sanctions, with some calling their designation a point of pride in what they view as an attempt to undermine Chinese control in Hong Kong and its rise as a competitor to the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-24-china-and-hong-kong-officials-ahead-of-talks-101615969716238.html
17-03-2021||World||Multilingual team helps Berlin immigrants fight coronavirus||Three times a week, Aliye Tuerkyilmaz hits the markets and busy shopping streets of Neukoelln to hand out informational flyers on the coronavirus pandemic to residents of the German capital's crowded immigrant neighborhood that's studded with minarets, kebab stores and hookah lounges.The 48-year-old Turkish immigrant who speaks four languages is part of a team of five street workers enlisted to explain the dangers of Covid-19 to people often not reached through traditional channels in an area where infection numbers have regularly been among the highest in the city.“Especially the older immigrants don't understand German, some are illiterate, and some are still not aware of the health risks and regulations regarding the pandemic,” Tuerkyilmaz says as she roams through a Turkish market along the Landwehr canal where many had come to pick up fresh vegetables, chicken and bread.There are a combination of factors that have made Neukoelln a virus hotspot in Berlin, where low incomes mean that living quarters are often cramped, public transport is frequently the only option, and jobs are commonly in high-risk areas such as the food service industry.But it was the lack of information making it to the residents that prompted the formation of Tuerkyilmaz's “intercultural educational team,” or IKAT, in September by the Berlin NGO Chance BJS in coordination with district officials.The hope is that they will be able to break through the lack of communication, which not only has to do with language barriers but also a deep distrust of German authorities fed by a sense of nonacceptance, says Kazim Erdogan, a community leader with Turkish roots.“If we can't create a sense of belonging together in normal times, if people are existing next to or even against each other, then it is not possible to create this sense of togetherness now," Erdogan says.Around 35% of Berlin's 3.6 million residents have immigrant roots, primarily from Poland, Turkey, Arabic countries and the former Soviet Union. In Neukoelln, almost half have a foreign background.The district's number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents is currently at 4,828, compared to a city-wide average figure of 3,575.A study published by the Berlin state health authority in February indicated the hardest-hit districts were those with more unemployment, a greater share of welfare recipients and lower household income. The incidence of Covid-19 also rose in line with the percentage of people with a family history of migration and greater population density — factors that are linked to poverty.“Migration is not the main reason for a higher risk of catching the virus, but it is an additional one,” said Nico Dragano, a professor of medical sociology at the Heinrich-Heine University of Duesseldorf, who has been studying the disproportionally strong impact of the pandemic on underprivileged parts of society.Lacking information early on in the pandemic, many immigrant communities stuck to cherished traditions like big weddings and extended family meals in their small homes, which helped contribute to clusters of outbreaks, said Erdogan, the Neukoelln community leader.“Among my friends, there were also 20 people who got infected from one family,” Erdogan said. “They were at a celebration and didn't take the challenges seriously — it came back to haunt them.”More than 135,000 people in Berlin have been reported to have caught the coronavirus, though the estimated number of unreported cases is higher, and about 3,000 people have died.While Neukoelln was one of the city's main virus hot spots last summer, its latest number of cases — 75.5 new infections weekly per 100,000 residents — is on par with the city's current average of 75.1.It's too early to say how much initiatives like the multilingual street workers' team have contributed to bringing down the virus numbers, but district mayor Martin Hikel said that anecdotally, unconventional ways of communicating with Neukoelln's diverse immigrant communities have been important.Hikel said many residents of his district don't read German papers or watch German television stations where constantly changing virus regulations, including lockdowns, school and store closures and reopenings, are reported daily.Beyond the IKAT team, Neukoelln has sought to rectify that through other initiatives as well.City workers have painted basic rules of conduct during the pandemic — such as mask regulations — directly on sidewalks in bold letters and different languages. They've also created short multilingual videos detailing the risks of COVID-19 that feature different community leaders — including Erdogan — which can easily be shared on Facebook or via messenger services on smartphones.“We try to spread the word on social media, through social workers and local associations," Hikel said, adding that local authorities are often a step ahead of state and federal officials with their outreach methods because they are more aware of the reality on the ground.Izabella Grajkowski, a 34-year-old IKAT member with Polish roots, said people have generally been open when she approaches them in the streets.She attributes the success of IKAT's outreach work also to the fact that all members are immigrants themselves and can draw on that experience as they talk to people. They also help translate for those who have in-depth medical questions for a doctor who often joins IKAT outings and offers on-the-spot antigen tests for those who fear they’ve contracted the virus.“We all have different cultural backgrounds ourselves and we connect well with the people of Neukoelln,” she said.Topics of most concern to people are the re-opening of schools, stores and restaurants, whether they are allowed to travel abroad to visit relatives, and when and how they'll be able to get vaccinated.“The elderly have already been getting invitations for the vaccinations explaining how to register online," said Tuerkyilmaz. ”But everything is in German only — they don't understand it and don't know what to do. It's difficult."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multilingual-team-helps-berlin-immigrants-fight-coronavirus-101615968669389.html

17-03-2021||World||Kashmir only issue in way of better ties between India and Pakistan: Imran Khan||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Wednesday that India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral relations by addressing Kashmir, which is the only issue standing in the way of better ties between the two sides.Khan made the remarks while addressing the first edition of the Islamabad Security Dialogue, a two-day summit organised by Pakistan’s National Security Division in collaboration with the country’s leading think tanks.These were Khan’s first public comments on relations with India since the Indian and Pakistani armies recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – an apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two countries.“There is one issue that is stopping us [from improving relations] at this time. We will make our efforts but India must take the first step because after August 5, till they take the first step, then unfortunately we cannot move forward,” Khan said, referring to India’s decision on August 5, 2019 to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and to split the region into two Union Territories.“Our issue basically is Kashmir and it is the only issue – how we can settle it through dialogue and establish a relationship as civilised neighbours,” he said, speaking in Urdu.Also Read | Pakistan must create conducive atmosphere for meaningful dialogue: Foreign SecyKhan noted that he had attempted to settle all issues with India after forming government in 2018. “Unfortunately, there was August 5 and that was a big blow and there was a total breakdown between the two countries,” he said.“We still hope that they [India] give the Kashmiris the rights they were given by the UN Security Council to decide their own lives. It will be as beneficial for India as for Pakistan,” Khan said.“If there is movement towards the resolution of Kashmir through dialogue, the whole region will change and there will be big benefits to both countries – benefits for India because there is great poverty there. So if poverty is to be removed then our trading and economic ties must be strong and our regional connectivity should increase. India will benefit from being connected to Central Asia,” he added.Khan’s remarks reflected a change from his strident criticism of India and the Narendra Modi government over the past year.On Monday, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said the onus is on Pakistan to create a conducive atmosphere for a meaningful dialogue. Shringla listed India’s relations with Pakistan as one of the challenges in the neighbourhood, India desires good neighbourly relations with Pakistan and is “committed to addressing issues, if any, bilaterally and peacefully”, Shringla said.During his speech, Khan said Pakistan’s national security was not just about the armed forces, but included vulnerability to climate change, food security and economic matters.“As long as there is no regional peace and our relations with our neighbours and trading ties are not good, Pakistan won’t be able to take full advantage of its geo-strategic location. If there is peace in this region, Pakistan will be the biggest beneficiary because we are connected in all four directions,” he said.“We are connected to the world’s two largest markets – I mean we are connected with China and we can be connected with the other, India,” he added.Khan also spoke of Pakistan’s role in the troubled peace process in Afghanistan, saying: “After a long time, there is hope for peace in Afghanistan...No one should underestimate how difficult this is, there are big challenges in this.”He added, “We are making all efforts, I am very happy that Pakistan has done as much as it could for peace in Afghanistan but there are challenges. The Biden administration understands the war shouldn’t continue. We are trying and we hope that once Afghanistan is settled, there will be a big shift in this region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmir-only-issue-in-way-of-better-ties-between-india-pakistan-imran-khan-101615968728501.html
17-03-2021||World||Paris needs more coronavirus restrictions, French PM says||French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Tuesday that time had come for additional coronavirus restrictions in the greater Paris region as the country enters a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.France is grappling with a steady rise of new cases, leading to a heavy strain on the hospital system, especially in the capital where infections have surged.French health authorities reported 29,975 new cases nationwide on Tuesday, a 4.5% weekly jump, the sharpest in a month and a half."It seems to me that the time has come to consider new measures in the greater Paris region," Castex said in an interview on BFM TV.Castex said weekend lockdowns such as those already in place in two other regions were among measures to be considered for the greater Paris region at a meeting on Wednesday."There is no reason why we shouldn't do in one region what we are doing in another," he said.Like other EU countries, France has lagged far behind the United States or Britain in vaccinating its population.President Emmanuel Macron still hopes a vaccination drive can stave off effects of a new pandemic wave triggered by more contagious variants, and prevent France from resorting to a third national lockdown.But suspension of the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, announced on Monday over safety concerns, could jeopardise the strategy.Castex said he was ready to get the AstraZeneca vaccine if European health authorities confirmed its safety.The health ministry said there were 4,239 patients in intensive care units for COVID-19, up by 20 over 24 hours and setting a nearly four-month high. The total number of people hospitalized for the disease was at 25,492, a high since Feb 24.The number of people who have died went up by 408, at 91,170.

17-03-2021||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro names 4th health minister during pandemic||With Covid-19 still raging in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro picked his fourth health minister since the pandemic began, this time the head of the country’s cardiology society who in the past has spoken favorably of the country’s conservative leader.Marcelo Queiroga will replace Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty army general with expertise in logistics who landed the position last May despite having no prior health experience.Queiroga said in a press conference in capital Brasilia on Tuesday that the COVID-19 policy he will implement “is of the Bolsonaro administration, not of the health minister.”“I came to work for Brazil and other ministers of the Bolsonaro administration. The president is very worried about the situation,” said Queiroga, who insisted he is against any lockdown measures. Some Brazilian cities are implementing restrictive shutdowns to halt the spread.Pazuello had presided over the health ministry for the longest period of the three pandemic ministers before Queiroga. The revolving door reflects the challenges for the government of Latin America’s largest nation to implement effective measures to control the virus’ spread -- or even agree which measures are necessary.Queiroga has already called Bolsonaro “a great Brazilian.” His social media channels have not made any criticism of the president’s handling of the pandemic and pushed for a quick vaccine rollout.João Gabbardo, a former secretary-executive of the health ministry, said on Twitter that Queiroga will face the worst figures of the pandemic in Brazil when he takes over.“The record number of deaths today will be in a high scale. A suggestion; do not speak against a national lockdown,” said Gabbardo, who now works for the Sao Paulo state government.Tuesday night Brazil reported record 2,841 confirmed deaths by COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, which is 558 more than the previous all-time high established on Wednesday.On Monday, Pazuello acknowledged in a press conference that Bolsonaro aimed to replace him. The first candidate for the job, cardiologist Ludhmila Hajjar, rejected it.Pazuello’s two predecessors left the position amid disagreements with Bolsonaro, who criticized broad social distancing and supported the use of an unproven anti-malarial drug to treat the disease. He continues to hold those positions, despite health experts’ admonishments and studies showing the drug has no effect on COVID-19.Pazuello proved more compliant. Immediately after taking the job, his ministry backed use and distribution of the malaria pill. On several occasions, he said that his boss tells him what to do, and he obeys.Bolsonaro told supporters at the entrance of the presidential residence in Brasilia on Monday that there will be a transition period of up to two weeks with the outgoing and the incoming minister.“Pazuello’s work was well done in the management part. Now we are in a phase that is more aggressive in the fight against the virus,” Brazil’s president said.Brazil has recorded almost 280,000 deaths from the virus, nearly all of which were on Pazuello's watch. The toll has been worsening lately, with the nation currently averaging more than 1,800 deaths each day. Health care systems of major cities are at the brink of collapse, and lawmakers allied with Bolsonaro have proposed suitable replacements for Pazuello, while threatening to step up pressure for an investigation into his handling of the crisis.The country’s top court is also investigating Pazuello for alleged neglect that contributed to the collapse of the health care system in Amazonas state earlier this year. That probe will now be sent to a low court judge.In a particularly embarrassing episode, his ministry accidentally dispatched a shipment of vaccines intended for Amazonas state to neighboring Amapa state, and vice versa, after confusing the abbreviations for each state.Pazuello has faced intense criticism for Brazil’s slow vaccine rollout. According to Our World in Data, an online research site that compares official government statistics, only 5.4% of Brazilians have been vaccinated. Almost all were shots from Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac, which Bolsonaro repeatedly cast doubt upon.The only vaccine deal Pazuello had signed at the time, for 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca jab, has brought few shots to the arms of Brazilians so far. His ministry has since scrambled to cobble together agreements with other suppliers, recently concluding deals to acquire the Pfizer and Sputnik V shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-names-4th-health-minister-during-pandemic-101615945323909.html
17-03-2021||World||Blacklisted Chinese firms eye lawsuits after Xiaomi win against Trump ban||Chinese companies targeted by a sweeping investment ban imposed by former President Donald Trump are considering suing the U.S. government after a federal judge on Friday suspended a similar blacklisting for Beijing-based smartphone maker Xiaomi.Lawyers familiar with the matter said some of the banned Chinese companies are in talks with law firms including Steptoe & Johnson and Hogan Lovells, emboldened by US District Judge Rudolph Contreras' preliminary order halting Xiaomi's inclusion on a US.list of alleged Communist Chinese military companies that are subject to an investment ban.The Trump administration's move to blacklist Xiaomi Corp , which knocked $10 billion off its market share and sent its shares down 9.5 percent in January, would have forced investors to completely divest their stakes in the company."Companies are reaching out to lawyers to challenge the listings and the grounds for the listings," said Wendy Wysong, managing partner of the Hong Kong office of Steptoe & Johnson, a worldwide law firm headquartered in Washington. Wysong and a person familiar with Hogan Lovells, another global law firm, declined to name the companies involved in discussions.Contreras flagged the U.S. government's "deeply flawed" process for including the company in the investment ban, based on just two key criteria: its development of 5G technology and artificial intelligence, which the Defense Department alleges are "essential to modern military operations," and an award given to Xiaomi founder and Chief Executive Lei Jun from an organization said to help the Chinese government eliminate barriers between commercial and military sectors.The judge noted that 5G and AI technologies were fast becoming standard in consumer electronics, and that over 500 entrepreneurs had received the same award as Lei since 2004, including the leaders of an infant formula company."The facts that led to Xiaomi's designation are almost laughable, and I think it absolutely is going to lead to additional companies seeking relief," said Washington lawyer Brian Egan, a former legal adviser in both the White House and State Department who also works at Steptoe.GOVERNMENT UNDECIDED ON PATH FORWARDIn a joint filing on Tuesday, the government said it had not decided on the "appropriate path forward" in the Xiaomi case in light of the judge's decision.A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is defending the case, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Defense referred questions to the White House, which has not responded.Xiaomi and 43 other companies were added https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2434513/dod-releases-list-of-additional-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1237-of-fy in the waning months of the Trump administration to the blacklist, which was mandated by a 1999 law requiring the Defense Department to publish a compilation of companies "owned or controlled" by the Chinese military.Seeking to cement a tough line on China and box his Democratic successor, Joe Biden, into hardline policies, Trump signed an executive order that was later expanded to bar all U.S. investors from holding securities in the named companies beginning on Nov. 11, 2021.Other companies listed include video surveillance giant Hikvision, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and China's top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.SMIC, Hikvision and CNOOC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Luokung Technology Corp, a mapping technology company on the list, also sued the U.S. government earlier this month, and is expected to seek preliminary relief similar to that awarded to Xiaomi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blacklisted-chinese-firms-eye-lawsuits-after-xiaomi-win-against-trump-ban-101615945419836.html
17-03-2021||World||UK variant of Covid-19 spread rapidly in British care homes in span of 2 weeks: Report||The UK variant of the novel coronavirus spread rapidly in care homes in England in a span of two weeks between November and December last year, reflecting its spread across the country, according to a new study which calls for advanced surveillance systems to monitor the evolving virus.The findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, revealed that the proportion of infections among care home staff and residents caused by the new variant rose from 12 per cent in the week beginning 23 November to 60 per cent of positive cases just two weeks later, in the week beginning 7 December.In the south east of England, where the variant was most dominant, the scientists from University College London (UCL) in the UK said this fraction rose from 55 to 80 per cent over the same period.In London, where the variant spread fastest, they said the increase was from 20 to 66 per cent.Based on the analysis of 4,442 positive samples from care home staff and residents in England, the researchers believe the UK variant, also known as B.1.1.7, was present in care homes from early on."Our findings suggest the UK variant spread just as quickly in care homes as it did in the general population. This shows the importance of public health measures to reduce transmission in the country as a whole," said study senior author Laura Shallcross from UCL.According to the researchers, most of the samples were from people aged under 65, as staff are tested much more frequently than residents.However, they said the proportion of infections caused by the new variant rose from 14 per cent in the week beginning 23 November to 76 per cent in the week beginning 7 December among samples from those aged over 65."Our results are consistent with national trends, suggesting that the UK variant was present in care homes from early on, although our sample did not fully represent all care homes in England," said study lead author Maria Krutikov from UCL."To see how viruses like Covid-19 are changing and to respond quickly and appropriately, it is really important we have an advanced surveillance system, with gene sequencing that can identify new variants as early as possible," Krutikov said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-variant-of-covid-19-spread-rapidly-in-british-care-homes-in-span-of-2-weeks-report-101615965756215.html
17-03-2021||World||Hong Kong vaccine bookings jump on 1st day of expanded access||Hong Kong saw more than 144,000 people snap up Covid-19 vaccine appointments the first day the government expanded access to a majority of residents, a sharp increase amid its bid to boost a lackluster inoculation rollout.Some 30,800 people reserved slots to get the Chinese-made Sinovac Biotech Ltd. shot and 113,200 others booked doses of Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE’s vaccine at community vaccine centers in the 24 hours ending at 8 p.m. Tuesday, the government said. Data was not available from private clinics, some of which are also offering Sinovac’s shot.Before the expansion, only some 200,000 people -- comprising just 5.4% of priority groups eligible like the elderly and healthcare workers -- had come forward for shots since the vaccine drive started on Feb. 26.The total number of people able to access vaccines now represents some 70% of the city’s population of 7.5 million, with adults aged 30 to 59 years old now eligible. The government added 23,000 new reservation slots to daily capacity on Tuesday, and has increased the number of community centers offering the BioNTech shot from seven to 19.What Are Vaccine Passports and How Would They Work?: QuickTakeThe extended drive comes as the city grapples with a new outbreak of the virus centered on its expatriate community, including employees of international financial firms. HSBC Holdings Plc’s main Hong Kong office was ordered to close until further notice after three people working in the building tested positive for Covid-19.Countering ReluctanceWhile Hong Kong’s healthy adult population is one of the first in the world to gain eligibility for inoculation, the expanded access reflects a major vaccine hesitation problem that will likely delay the city’s ability to reopen to the world. Officials widened eligibility earlier than expected after uptake was dismal among priority groups, leaving millions of doses unused.Demand for Covid-19 vaccines has generally been lower in Asia, where contained outbreaks and low death tolls in places like Japan and Singapore has meant that people feel less urgency and more skepticism towards rapidly-developed shots.It’s unclear if the younger adult population will ultimately help boost these underwhelming numbers, after the initial burst of pent-up demand. An informal poll of 13 people in the 30 to 59 years old group on Tuesday showed that half were planning to get a vaccine now that they can.George Lin, chief financial officer at Hua Medicine Ltd. and a former banker at Bank of America Corp., said he was so excited to book a slot that he had a sleepless night. He signed up early Tuesday morning and will receive his first dose of BioNTech’s shot on Saturday in Causeway Bay.Hong Kong Tells U.S. Consulate to Test Staff After Two Cases“The first thing I would like to do is to travel internationally,” Lin said, including to the U.S to see his two daughters. “If I were in the U.S., I would not get this until May.”Others said they did not want to take the risk. Resistance among Hong Kong residents has grown after reports of several deaths among inoculated people, though experts said none of them are directly tied to the vaccine.“I don’t trust the vaccines, there’s not enough data to show it is safe, there’s not been enough testing,” said hairstylist Kei Ma, 41. “I don’t know how many other things the government is hiding.”‘Absence of Trust’Political turmoil and China’s tightening grip over the former British colony are complicating factors as city officials try to persuade people to take the vaccine. Lam received Sinovac’s shot on Feb. 22 along with other cabinet members.“The absence of trust only complicates the vaccine rollout,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in health security at City University of Hong Kong. “Short of mandatory vaccinations, which would likely be resisted by the population, the Hong Kong government is facing a slower path to reopening than its earlier successes against the virus suggested would be the case.”Blood Clots, Anaphylaxis and Other Vaccine Fears: QuickTakeChina is planning to ease requirements for foreigners applying for mainland visas from Hong Kong if they’ve received a Chinese vaccine, something that reassures David Bonnet, managing partner at real estate and hospitality advisory firm Delta State Holdings Ltd. who signed up for a Sinovac shot.“If you live in Hong Kong and Macau, getting one of the Chinese vaccines probably will give some tangible benefits,” he said. “I don’t want to be subject to quarantines and I hope it will be easier to travel with Chinese vaccines. My hope is to resume business as normal.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-vaccine-bookings-jump-on-1st-day-of-expanded-access-101615950632042.html

According to Bloomberg, only 122 countries have started immunizing people. As many as 10 vaccines have been proven effective against the virus within a year of it being declared a pandemic, the agency said, adding that these are already in use and companies producing these have also begun testing the updated versions designed to defeat variants of the virus. Swaminathan further added that development of more vaccine candidates should be encouraged as the need for booster immunization of populations was not very clear at this point. “We need to continue to support the research and development of more vaccine candidates, especially as the need for ongoing booster immunization of populations is still not very clear at this point,” she said.According to a research quoted by Bloomberg, a natural infection triggers the immune response to the virus just as a first dose would, making a second injection unnecessary. This could free up more supplies, Swaminathan said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-that-don-t-require-needles-cold-storage-may-be-out-by-year-end-who-expert-101615963831707.html

17-03-2021||World||With crisis stricken currency, Venezuela rolls out larger denomination banknotes||Venezuela this week is rolling out larger-denomination banknotes as hyperinflation batters the crisis-stricken South American country's bolivar currency.Bills worth 200,000 and 500,000 bolivars - worth just 10 and 27 US cents, respectively, at the current exchange rate - began to circulate on Monday, according to Reuters witnesses. Venezuela's central bank said this month it also planned to roll a bill worth 1 million bolivars, just 50 US cents.The highest-denomination bill had previously been 50,000 bolivars. Annual inflation in the once-prosperous OPEC nation was running at 2,665% in January, contributing to chronic shortages of cash."These bills in a few months will not be worth anything anymore, because in this country prices rise very quickly," said Rafael Alvarez, a healthcare worker who left a bank carrying one 200,000 bolivar bill and four bills worth 50,000 bolivars each. All that is equivalent to just 20 US cents.The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.In addition to the higher-denomination bills, President Nicolas Maduro is seeking to boost digital payments in the face of the cash shortage. While Venezuelans use debit cards for many day-to-day transactions, some services - namely public transit - still only accept cash."These new bills will not resolve the cash crisis. They will only pay for transit fare," said Evelyn Mendoza, a 47-year-old cook, as she waited in a long line to withdraw cash from a bank in the capital, Caracas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-crisis-stricken-currency-venezuela-rolls-out-larger-denomination-banknotes-101615945855106.html
17-03-2021||World||Hong Kong: IPO hits almost $11 billion, close to 500% jump from 1 year earlier||Hong Kong’s bankers are working around the clock as the region’s companies rush to go public.Initial public offerings in the city have already hit almost $11 billion, a close to 500% jump from a year earlier, with video streaming platform Bilibili Inc. and search giant Baidu Inc. among companies preparing multi-billion dollar deals. Digital roadshows and clients eager to move faster to capture abundant liquidity -- especially as market sentiment has begun to sour -- means bankers are keeping dawn-to-midnight schedules, say some, even turning down deals where they’re relegated to junior roles.Companies are trying to “get the deal done as soon as they can,” said Stephanie Tang, head of private equity for greater China at Hogan Lovells. “Many of them see this as an opportunity and if they are not catching the train quickly, they might lose the opportunity.”A pandemic-induced hunger for technology stocks and the threat of US delistings have been a boon for the financial hub during a difficult political stretch, driving a surge in initial and secondary share sales. A new push by Shanghai’s Nasdaq-like STAR board to more closely scrutinize IPOs along with a pile-up of applications there may drive more of China’s unicorns to Hong Kong, taking listings to a record, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.Also read: Jack Ma’s SCMP Joins Hong Kong media groups facing China controlUnsurprisingly, the health sector is the busiest, with deals poised for both Hong Kong and the US Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s health-care team is working on at least 20 IPOs in the $300 million to $1 billion range. Citigroup Inc. has won eight Chinese health-care mandates in the three weeks just before Lunar New Year, expecting to raise $300 million to $400 million for each in July through September. Citi has also nabbed the WeDoctor IPO, which is seeking to raise as much as $3 billion at a pre-IPO valuation of $12 billion. The details were shared by bankers and executives familiar with the deals, who asked not to be named discussing private matters.Representatives for Goldman Sachs and Citi declined to comment on the deals. WeDoctor also declined to comment.“It’s busier than ever,” said Udhay Furtado, Citi’s co-head of Asia Equity Capital Markets. “This is an attractive window for issuers and liquidity is available across financing products.”But the bustle comes loaded with execution risk as Chinese markets in early February started to stumble after a two-year rally and what’s looking like the biggest-ever quarter for initial public offerings fueled by a US-led boom in blank-check listings.In one recent deal, Autohome Inc., a Chinese online car-sales website, sold shares in the city at about a 5.5% discount to its last price in New York. Given the current volatility in the markets, only the most straightforward deals are also being pushed ahead right now, according to a banker in Hong Kong.Rushing OutMany companies pushing to sell shares have yet to establish a sustainable way to make profits, including Chinese grocery delivery apps such as Meicai and Dingdong Maicai, who are facing heavy cash burn to win market share.Liao Ming, the founder of Prospect Avenue Capital, which oversees $500 million in private equity assets, said he expects at least five of his portfolio companies to list this year, out of a total 12.“A lot of these companies including the grocery space, wouldn’t be able to find investors in a normal year,” said the Beijing-based former Morgan Stanley banker. “But because of the bullish sentiment this year, a lot of companies that aren’t ready yet are rushing to get out the door.”Charles Chau, Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Jones Day, said most clients are trying to submit IPO applications by March and supply additional financial statements by June to get a listing done by September.The rush back home by Chinese stalwarts has been going since last year, when firms such as Netease Inc. and JD.com Inc. listed in Hong Kong. And now with Chinese regulators looking at tightening rules in Shanghai, it could impact a heavy backlog of deals and bring more to the financial hub.If a slowdown in listings on the mainland pushes even more firms to Hong Kong, the hub could see a record year, wrote Sharnie Wong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. There were 735 IPO applications in mainland China in early March, compared with 500 last year, she said.Last year, Hong Kong saw $52 billion in listings, just below the $58 billion that was raised in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Accelerated PlansThe migration to virtual roadshows means bankers are able to pack more meetings into their schedules. “IPO professional intermediaries have transformed themselves,” said Edward Au, southern region managing partner at Deloitte China.In the US, markets have boomed with the listings of SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies. That’s also now reshaping Asian banking. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG have pulled people from corporate finance and equity capital markets to focus on those types of deals in Asia, according to people with knowledge of the moves.Credit Suisse declined to comment.Francesco Lavatelli, head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at JPMorgan, said the US bank has a “healthy pipeline” of deals, including SPAC IPOs and mandates from companies looking to combine with an already listed SPAC, known as a deSPAC.He said the recent stock turmoil is unlikely to derail the deals on tap. “If anything, it will accelerate plans, which might mean in some cases a deSPAC process,” the Hong Kong-based banker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-ipo-hits-almost-11-billion-close-to-500-jump-from-1-year-earlier-101615957571674.html

17-03-2021||World||Australia to ask EU to send 1 million Covid-19 vaccines for Papua New Guinea||Australia said on Wednesday it will ask the European Union to release 1 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to help Papua New Guinea (PNG) battle a dangerous outbreak, a request that is likely to inflame tensions over vaccine supplies.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the vaccines were contracted to Australia but were badly needed to contain a surge in coronavirus cases in the Pacific island nation, parts of which are just a short boat ride from Australian territory."We've contracted them. We've paid for them and we want to see those vaccines come here so we can support our nearest neighbour, PNG, to deal with their urgent needs in our region," Morrison told reporters in Canberra."They're our family, they're our friends. They're our neighbours. They're our partners... This is in Australia’s interests, and is in our region's interests."Australia will donate 8,000 locally produced Covid-19 vaccines to PNG as an immediate response to the outbreak, and would make a million doses available as soon as they arrived from Europe, he said.The request is likely to raise tensions with the European Union after Brussels, at Italy's request, blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine to Australia this month, citing vaccine shortages in Europe.It was the first refusal of an export request since the EU established a mechanism to monitor vaccine flows in late January.PNG recorded 97 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, but Australia's chief health officer said that figure was likely as "a major underestimate". PNG has officially recorded just 2,000 cases since the pandemic begun.PNG Prime Minister James Marape on Tuesday said Covid-19 had "broken loose" and urged people to avoid unnecessary travel.Australia's Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said PNG has little infrastructure to conduct mass testing, and the few that were being done were showing alarming results."When people are being admitted into hospital in Port Moresby, half of women who are coming in due to pregnancy are positive," Kelly told reporters in Canberra.Morrison warned an "uncontrolled" outbreak in PNG could produce a new variant of the virus."That would be not only a major problem for PNG but also for us and the region," Morrison said.Canberra will also suspend all travel to and from PNG from Wednesday midnight, he added.FIGHTING CHANCEA senior Australian government source said the EU had justified the blocking of the shipment to Australia earlier this month because Canberra was so successful in containing the spread of the virus, but that rationale would not hold with PNG.Aid agencies echoed the desperate need for vaccines in the impoverished country of almost nine million people."PNG needs a fighting chance to beat this, and frontline doctors and nurses could be the difference between keeping this under control or utter catastrophe for PNG's health system," said Marc Purcell, chief executive of The Australian Council for International Development - an industry body representing Australian aid agencies.The Australian government source said Canberra would lodge its request with the EU this week and an answer was likely within days. He declined to be named as he is not authorised to talk to media on the subject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-ask-eu-to-send-1-million-covid-19-vaccines-for-papua-new-guinea-101615950679094.html
17-03-2021||World||Russia tried to engineer Biden’s defeat in 2020, reveals US intelligence report||Russian President Vladimir Putin and his officials had sought to influence the 2020 US election by “denigrating” Joe Biden with “misleading or unsubstantiated allegations” pushed through people close to Donald Trump, the US intelligence community said in a declassified report on Tuesday.The intelligence report does not name any of these people, but Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney of former president Trump, may have been among them, according to news reports.He had had contacts with Russian agents during the time he pursued the attempt to implicate then presidential candidate Joe Biden in an unproven corruption scandal involving his son Hunter Biden’s business connections with a Ukrainian company.The intelligence report, which is the first about the November election, also says the Russian operation was supportive of then president Trump, but unlike in 2016, “we did not see persistent Russian cyber efforts to gain access to the election infrastructure”.Iran also conducted a “multi-pronged covert influence campaign” intended to “undercut” then president Trump, but it did not seek to directly promote his rivals, the report says.China, on the other hand, sat it out. It considered but did not deploy influence efforts because, the intelligence community says in the report, it “did not view either election outcome being advantageous enough for China to risk getting caught meddling”. It is contrary to the Trump administration’s claims of China’s involvement in election meddling at the time.The Russian influence operation was pervasive, in a throwback to the 2016 election meddling that was confirmed by special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation.“We assess that President Putin and the Russian state authorised and conducted influence operations against the 2020 US president election aimed at denigrating President Biden and the Democratic Party, supporting former president Trump, undermining public confidence in the election process, and exacerbating sociopolitical division in the US,” says the report by the National Intelligence Council.The Russian influence operation was built around a central narrative, which the report says began taking shape back in 2014 during the Obama administration’s second term. It was basically an attempt to allege corrupt ties between Biden and his family with Ukraine. Russian intelligence banked on Ukrainian proxies to build this fiction, giving themselves room for deniability.They pushed misleading and unsubstantiated allegations against Biden through, the report says, “US media organisations, US officials and US individuals, some of whom were close to former president Trump and his administration”.The US intelligence report does not name the media organisation or officials or those close to Trump, but it does identify some non-Americans who played key roles in the operations: Andriy (also spelt Andrii) Derkach, a Ukrainian legislator with links with Russia’s officials and intelligence services, and Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian “influence agent”.The report says Putin had “purview over” the activities of Derkach, who was sanctioned by the Trump administration in September 2020 as a “Russian agent” and was described as “directly or indirectly engaged in, sponsored, concealed, or otherwise been complicit in foreign interference in an attempt to undermine the upcoming 2020 US presidential election”.Giuliani, the former US president’s personal attorney, met Derkach several times in an attempt to obtain what he believed would be material implicating Biden in a corruption case linked to Ukraine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-tried-to-engineer-biden-s-defeat-in-2020-reveals-us-intelligence-report-101615957087928.html
17-03-2021||World||China acting aggressively, repressively in Asia, says Blinken||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that China was acting aggressively and repressively, citing its actions in the East and South China Seas where it has territorial disputes with Japan and other Asian nations.Speaking to a roundtable of Japanese journalists in Tokyo, Blinken said Beijing was "raising tensions not diminishing them" in the region by its maritime actions and posturing over Taiwan.Blinken is visiting Japan and South Korea along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a bid to fortify Washington's alliances in Asia, in a first overseas trip by top level members of President Joe Biden's administration.China’s extensive territorial claims in the East and South China Seas have become a priority issue in an increasingly testy Sino-U.S. relationship and are an important security concern for Japan.Blinken said Beijing was "acting both more repressively at home and more aggressively abroad, including in the East China Sea, including with regard to the Senkakus, as well the South China sea and also with regard to Taiwan".The Senkakus, also referred to as Diaoyu in China, are islets in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but claimed by China."Japan has real interest in what happens with regard to Taiwan and Taiwan's straits and we spent some time comparing notes on that," said Blinken describing his Tuesday talks with Japanese officials.The comments echoed statements issued by Blinken, Austin and their Japanese counterparts after "2 2" talks held in Tokyo on Tuesday and come ahead of Blinken's first in-person meetings with Chinese counterparts planned for later this week in Alaska."We look forward to the opportunity to lay out in very clear terms to our Chinese counterparts some of the concerns that we have about the actions they're taking," said Blinken.Following the morning roundtable with emerging Japanese reporters Blinken and Austin were set to leave for Seoul to hold "2 2" talks with South Korean counterparts until Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-acting-aggressively-repressively-in-asia-says-blinken-101615956105096.html
17-03-2021||World||6 Asian women among 8 shot dead; suspect arrested: What happened in Georgia?||Shootings at two massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia and one in Acworth on Tuesday evening left eight people dead and one wounded. The victims in the Georgia spa shootings included at least six Asian women, police said, as reported by news agency Reuters. A 21-year-old man, Robert Aarong Lung, has been taken into custody in connection with the shootings. Authorities are also investigating whether there was any connection between the three shootings, CNN reported.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is assisting the Atlanta and Cherokee county authorities in the investigation of the shootings, according to agency's spokesman Kevin Rowson. So far, the authorities have not offered any possible motive for the shootings.The shootingsAround 5pm, five people were shot at Young's Asian massage parlour which is located near a rural area in Acworth. In the shooting, two people died on the scene and three were taken to a nearby hospital where two of them also died later, as per Reuters.Around 5:50pm, police received a call of a robbery in progress at the Gold Massage spa on Piedmont road in Atlanta. Upon returning the call, the police found three women dead from apparent gunshot wounds at Gold Spa. While the police were at the scene, they received another call reporting fires shot at Aroma Therapy spa, which was just across the street, where the police found one person dead.The suspectRobert Aaron Long, the suspect in the Cherokee county shootings was taken into custody around 8:30pm, three and a half hours after the shootings, and transported to Crisp county jail. He was arrested in a highway pursuit by Georgia state police and Crisp county sheriff’s deputies, after the police in Cherokee county issued a bulletin providing a description of Long and license plates of the getaway vehicle. A tactical driving maneuver was used by the police to bring the Long’s vehicle to a halt, sheriff's officials said later. According to news agency Reuters, the investigators were "very confident" that Long was involved in all three shootings.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-asian-women-among-8-shot-dead-suspect-arrested-what-happened-in-georgia-101615955540169.html
17-03-2021||World||Myanmar Buddhist group signals break with authorities after violent crackdown||The most powerful group of Buddhist monks in Myanmar called on the junta to end violence against protesters and accused an "armed minority" of torture and killing innocent civilians following last month's coup, media reported on Wednesday.In its most forthright condemnation of the military's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations, the government-appointed body also said in a draft statement its members intended to halt activities in an apparent protest.The State Sahgha Maha Nayaka Committee (Mahana) planned to release a final statement after consulting the religious affairs minister on Thursday, the Myanmar Now news portal reported, citing a monk who attended a Mahana committee meeting.Monks were at the forefront of the 2007 "Saffron Revolution" against the junta then in power in Myanmar, an uprising that helped pave the way for democratic reforms.Mahana members could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment, but their reported stance signals a rift with authorities by a group that usually works closely with the government.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1 and detained her and other members of her party, drawing widespread international condemnation.More than 180 protesters have been killed as security forces try to crush a wave of demonstrations, according to the activist group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.On Tuesday night, security forces fired shots and one 28-year-old man was killed at a demonstration in the commercial capital of Yangon, a brother of the victim said.A total mobile internet shutdown made it difficult to verify information and very few people in Myanmar have access to WiFi. A junta spokesman did not answer telephone calls to seek comment.RESIDENTS FLEEParts of Yangon have been placed under martial law and thousands of residents have fled the industrial suburb of Hlaingthaya where security forces killed 40 people on Sunday and Chinese-financed factories were set ablaze."Here is like a war zone, they are shooting everywhere," a labour organiser in the area told Reuters, saying that most residents were too frightened to go outside.Two doctors told Reuters there were still wounded people in need of medical attention in the area, but the army had blocked access.Chinese state media has warned Beijing could take unspecified action if there are further attacks on Chinese-owned businesses.Many people in Myanmar believe Beijing is backing the military. Unlike Western powers, China has not condemned the coup and, along with Russia, has prevented the U.N. Security Council from denouncing the military's actions.TREASON CHARGESFrance said the European Union would approve sanctions against those behind the coup next Monday.The junta, meanwhile, charged with treason an emissary of ousted lawmakers who are attempting to re-establish the civilian government.Sasa, who goes by a single name and is not in the country, said he was proud to have been charged."These generals have committed acts of treason every day. Taking what they want for themselves, denying the people their rights and oppressing those that stand in their way," he said in a statement.The charges, which army-run television said were for encouraging a civil disobedience campaign and calling for sanctions, carry a possible death sentenceThe Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organisation founded by billionaire George Soros, called on Tuesday for the immediate release of a staff member held in Myanmar and said allegations of financial misconduct were false.State media in Myanmar reported that authorities had detained an official from the Open Society Myanmar and were looking for 11 other employees on suspicion the group passed funds to opponents of military rule.The army said it took power after its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised to hold a new election but has not set a date.Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup and faces various charges including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios and infringing coronavirus protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-buddhist-group-signals-break-with-authorities-after-violent-crackdown-101615955633886.html
17-03-2021||World||Uber to grant UK drivers worker status with benefits like minimum wage||Uber on Tuesday said it is granting its UK drivers worker status, with benefits including a minimum wage -- a world first for the US ride-hailing giant.Weeks after a top court ruling that could shake up Britain's wider "gig economy" of 5.5 million people, Uber said its drivers would also get holiday pay and a pension.It is a massive change in the business model of a company that had argued before Britain's Supreme Court that its drivers were self-employed.From Wednesday, "more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the national living wage when driving with Uber," the taxi app said in a statement."This is a floor and not a ceiling, with drivers able to earn more."The court ruled last month that Uber's drivers are entitled to worker's rights.The decision capped a protracted legal battle between UK drivers and the Silicon Valley taxi and delivery company.Also read: Passenger coughs on Uber driver upon being asked to wear mask. Company bans her- 'Flexibility remains' -Uber said its action over workers' rights "means drivers will earn with greater security, helping them to plan for their futures while maintaining the flexibility that is integral to the private-hire industry."The higher costs for Uber come as it faces sliding driver bookings owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, despite strong demand for the Uber Eats food delivery service during national lockdowns.Uber did not expect the change in driver compensation to affect its net income this year, the company said in a US regulatory filing."We've come to recognise that platforms like ours will work differently in different countries," Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in an editorial published in the Evening Standard."The future of work is too big of an issue for a one-size-fits-all solution, and that's OK," said Khosrowshahi -- who has previously argued for a "third way" to classify gig workers, rather than as employees or independent contractors.- Gig workers -The Services Employees International Union, which has been working to secure labour protections for Uber drivers in the United States, welcomed the UK development."This debunks nearly a decade of scare tactics from rideshare companies like Uber and makes clear that Uber can choose at any time to properly classify their drivers and pay them a living wage with good benefits," SEIU president Mary Kay Henry said in response to an AFP inquiry.The British ruling comes after California's top court last month upheld a referendum that let "gig workers" like Uber be treated as contractors.Drivers for ride-share and meal delivery apps had filed suit attempting to nullify the legislation known as Proposition 22.Proposition 22 -- passed in November and heavily backed by Uber, Lyft and other app-based, on-demand delivery services -- effectively overturned a state law requiring them to reclassify their drivers and provide employee benefits.The vote followed a contentious campaign with labour groups claiming the initiative would erode worker rights and benefits, and with backers arguing for a new, flexible economic model.Under the proposition, drivers remain independent contractors but Uber and Lyft are to pay them a number of benefits including a minimum wage, a contribution to healthcare and other forms of insurance. Critics of the measure said it failed to take into account the full costs borne by drivers.In a first for the European Union, Spain's government earlier this month announced a deal that will recognise riders working for food delivery firms such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats as salaried staff following complaints about their working conditions.In Italy, prosecutors have told Uber Eats and other food delivery platforms their couriers were employees and not independent workers, fining them 733 million euros for breach of labour safety rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-to-grant-uk-drivers-worker-status-with-benefits-like-minimum-wage-101615947569607.html
17-03-2021||World||Japan to lift emergency from Tokyo and other areas||Japan will end its state of emergency in the Tokyo region as planned on March 21, according to reports, after an improvement in the number of Covid-19 hospitalizations.Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide said he hopes to make a decision after listening to the opinions of experts and examining figures, such as the number of new cases and the hospital bed occupancy rates.The already extended measure that covers the capital plus Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa prefectures is set to expire on Sunday. Suga will evaluate the stalled pace of decline in new cases during deliberations on whether it stays in place.The rate of decline in new cases in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Chiba is slowing. But increasing numbers of officials hold the view that the state of emergency should be lifted, reported NHK World.Suga is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with the minister in charge of the country's coronavirus response, Nishimura Yasutoshi, and health minister Tamura Norihisa. They will discuss the situation, reported NHK World.The government plans to hold an advisory committee meeting on Thursday to determine whether to lift the emergency declaration. It will assess the number of infections and the state of the healthcare system. It will also consider measures to prevent a resurgence of infections, such as tests for variants.On Monday, Tokyo reported 175 new cases of the coronavirus. That's 59 more than last Monday. It's been a similar picture for the past week, with each day's tally higher than a week earlier, reported NHK World.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-will-lift-emergency-from-tokyo-and-other-areas-101615952653130.html

The three couples party to Wednesday’s case said their rights had been breached because equality and freedom of marriage are enshrined in the constitution, public broadcaster NHK said earlier.“This is a landmark ruling and I hope it will be an opportunity to build awareness that marriage is a right that should be afforded to all people equally,” said Masa Yanagisawa, head of Prime Services Japan at Goldman Sachs, who is also on the board of campaign group Marriage For All.While a number of local authorities have begun to recognize same-sex partnerships, Japan has made little progress toward equal marriage by comparison with Western countries. That can leave couples without basic rights, such as the ability to visit a partner in hospital.In Asia, only Taiwan has so far recognized same-sex marriage, though Thailand could make the change as soon as this year.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told parliament last month that the constitution, unchanged since 1947, did not envisage the recognition of marriage between two people of the same sex. The issue “concerns the foundations of the family in this country and needs to be considered with extreme caution,” he said.A more modest bill on promoting understanding of LGBTQ people drawn up by a ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker has yet to make progress toward becoming law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-court-rules-not-recognising-same-sex-marriage-unconstitutional-says-kyodo-101615952242183.html

17-03-2021||World||'Exclusion of women in decision-making marker of flawed democracy': Kamala Harris||The status of democracy depends fundamentally on the empowerment of women, whose exclusion from decision-making is a marker of a "flawed democracy", Kamala Harris has said in her first address to the United Nations as the Vice President of the US.Harris voiced concern over the decline of democracy and freedom across the globe in her address to the 65th Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women."Today, we know that democracy is increasingly under great strain. For 15 consecutive years, we have seen a troubling decline in freedom around the globe. In fact, experts believe that this past year was the worst on record for the global deterioration of democracy and freedom,” she said.Harris said Washington was strengthening its engagement with the world organisation and the broader multilateral system, as well as rejoining the Human Rights Council.She emphasised that even as the world confronts a global health crisis and an economic crisis, it was critical that “we continue to defend democracy”."The status of democracy also depends fundamentally on the empowerment of women. Not only because the exclusion of women in decision-making is a marker of a flawed democracy, but because the participation of women strengthens democracy. And that's true everywhere,” Harris said.The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.Representatives of Member States, UN entities, and ECOSOC-accredited non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from all regions of the world are virtually attending the session that will run from March 15 to 26.The theme for this year’s session is ‘Women's full and effective participation and decision-making in public life, as well as the elimination of violence, for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.’Harris, America’s first woman and first Black and South Asian-descent Vice President, told the high-level session that the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the economic security, the physical security, and the health of women everywhere.'As women struggle to get the healthcare they need, the pandemic appears to be reversing the global gains we’ve made in the fights against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, malnutrition, and maternal and child mortality,” she said.She cautioned that when women face obstacles to obtaining quality healthcare, face food insecurity, are more likely to live in poverty, and therefore disproportionately impacted by climate change, are more vulnerable to gender-based violence, and therefore disproportionately impacted by conflict, it is harder for women to fully participate in decision-making, which, in turn, makes it that much harder for democracies to thrive.UN Secretary-General António Guterres, in his remarks to the opening of the 65th session of the Commission on the Status of Women on Monday, said the pandemic was having a devastating impact on women and girls."COVID-19 is a crisis with a woman’s face. The fallout has shown how deeply gender inequality remains embedded in the world’s political, social and economic systems. Those disparities have themselves exacerbated the damage — and we have all paid the price,” he said.Quoting former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who had shaped the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Harris said: "Without equality, there can be no democracy."Harris said the status of women is the status of democracy and the United States will work to improve both.She stressed that this year, in considering the status of women, especially as it pertains to the participation of women in decision-making, nations must also consider the status of democracy.Underscoring that democracy protects human rights, promotes human dignity, and upholds the rule of law, Harris said it is a means to establish peace and shared prosperity.“It should ensure every citizen—regardless of gender—has an equal voice. At the same time, democracy requires constant vigilance, constant improvement. It is a work-in-progress,” she said.Highlighting progress in women’s empowerment in the US, Harris said in every presidential election for the last 56 years in the United States, more women have voted than men, more women than ever before serve in the US Congress and more women than ever before are their family’s breadwinner."Women in the United States lead our local, state, and national governments, make major decisions regarding our nation's security, and drive major growth in our economy.

A 21-year-old man was taken into custody in southwest Georgia hours later after a manhunt.Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said three people were killed at a spa in northeast Atlanta, while a fourth person was killed at another spa across the street. He said all four victims were female, and “It appears that they may be Asian.”Atlanta police officers responding to a call of a robbery in progress at one spa around 5:50 p.m. found three women dead from apparent gunshot wounds, police said. While they were at that scene, they learned of a call reporting shots fired at another spa across the street and found a woman who appeared to have been shot dead inside the business.Earlier, around 5 p.m., five people were shot at Young's Asian Massage Parlour in Acworth, about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north of Atlanta, Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Jay Baker said. Two of the victims were dead and three were transported to a hospital where two of them also died, Baker said.Authorities were not immediately releasing the gender or race of the victims, Baker said.A man suspected in the Acworth shooting was captured by surveillance video pulling up to the business around 4:50 p.m. Tuesday, minutes before the shooting, authorities said. Baker said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, was taken into custody in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240 kilometres) south of Atlanta.Baker said they believe Long is also the suspect in the Atlanta shootings.With two shootings at massage parlours in Atlanta and the knowledge of the Acworth shooting, Atlanta police said they dispatched officers to check nearby similar businesses and increased patrols in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-massage-parlour-shootings-leave-8-dead-1-suspect-captured-at-acworth-101615945620961.html
17-03-2021||World||'Who would have thought ...': Prince Charles takes swipe at anti-vaxxers||Britain's Prince Charles on Wednesday criticised those lobbying against coronavirus vaccines, saying they can "protect and liberate" some of society's most vulnerable members.In a wide-ranging article for the Future Healthcare Journal in which he called for an integrated approach to healthcare, the heir to the throne also took a swipe at those speaking out against Covid-19 shots."Who would have thought ... that in the 21st century that there would be a significant lobby opposing vaccination, given its track record in eradicating so many terrible diseases and its current potential to protect and liberate some of the most vulnerable in our society from coronavirus?" he wrote.The prince, 72, who tested positive for the coronavirus himself in March last year, and other senior members of the royal family have been vociferous in their support of the shots.Last month, he and his wife Camilla, 73, had their first Covid-19 doses, while Queen Elizabeth, 94, has also encouraged people to get a shot saying it did not hurt and those who were wary about it should think of others.However, the focus of the prince's article, published on Wednesday, was his message that long-term health issues needed to be addressed by integrating science, public policy and personal behaviour."I also believe that medicine will need to combine bioscience with personal beliefs, hopes, aspirations and choices," Charles wrote, calling for an open-minded approach to complementary medicine whose virtues he has long espoused despite criticism from some in the medical profession.In 2011, a leading professor of complementary medicine accused the prince of "quackery", saying that he and other backers of alternative therapies were "snake-oil salesmen" who promoted products with no scientific basis.Charles said he had always advocated "the best of both worlds" to bring evidence-informed conventional and complementary medicine together and seek a middle ground over the issue."Only then can we escape divisions and intolerance on both sides of the conventional/complementary equation, where on the one hand, the appropriate regulation of the proven therapies of acupuncture and medical herbalism is opposed, while on the other we find people actually opposing life-saving vaccinations," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-would-have-thought-prince-charles-takes-swipe-at-antivaxxers-101615940097490.html
17-03-2021||World||Iran enriching uranium with advanced machine type at underground plant: Report||Iran has started enriching uranium at its underground Natanz plant with a second type of advanced centrifuge, the IR-4, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in a report reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, in a further breach of Tehran's deal with major powers.Iran has recently accelerated its breaches of the deal's restrictions on its nuclear activities in an apparent bid to pressure U.S. President Joe Biden as both sides are locked in a standoff over who should move first to save the deal.Also Read: Iran produces uranium metal, IAEA says, in latest breach of dealTehran's breaches began in 2019 in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the deal and the reimposition of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, who opposed the agreement and sought to wreck it.Last year Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of different advanced models of centrifuge from an above-ground plant at Natanz to its below-ground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP). It is already enriching underground with IR-2m centrifuges. The deal only lets it enrich there with first-generation IR-1 machines."On 15 March 2021, the Agency verified that Iran began feeding the cascade of 174 IR-4 centrifuges already installed at FEP with natural UF6," the International Atomic Energy Agency said in the report to member states dated Monday, referring to uranium hexafluoride, the form in which uranium is fed into centrifuges for enrichment.Iran has indicated that it now plans to install a second cascade of IR-4 centrifuges at the FEP but installation of that cascade has yet to begin, the report said. Iran has already increased the number of IR-2m machines, which are far more efficient than the IR-1, installed at the underground plant."In summary, as of 15 March 2021, Iran was using 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges installed in 30 cascades, 522 IR-2m centrifuges installed in three cascades and 174 IR-4 centrifuges installed in one cascade, to enrich natural UF6 up to 5% U-235 at FEP," the IAEA report said, referring to the fissile purity of uranium.Iran is enriching up to 20% purity at another plant, Fordow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-enriching-uranium-with-advanced-machine-type-at-underground-plant-report-101615942128327.html

Bush, have delivered high profile public service announcements.But Trump has largely been silent while the man who defeated him, President Joe Biden, masterminds the vaccine rollout.Polls show that Republican men, who are overwhelmingly supporters of Trump and his "Make America Great Again" or MAGA platform, are the leading vaccine skeptics.Meanwhile, Trump remained non-committal about seeking to recapture the presidency following his one term in office."Based on every poll, they want me to run again," he said.

17-03-2021||World||Putin tried to help Trump against Biden in 2020 US elections: Report||Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to help Donald Trump in last November's presidential election, according to a declassified intelligence assessment that found broad efforts by the Kremlin and Iran to shape the outcome of the race but ultimately no evidence that any foreign actor changed votes or otherwise disrupted the voting process.The report released Tuesday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence represents the most detailed assessment of the array of foreign threats to the 2020 election. These included efforts by Iran to undermine confidence in the vote and harm Trump’s re-election prospects as well as Moscow operations that relied on Trump's allies to smear Joe Biden, the eventual winner.Despite those threats, though, intelligence officials found "no indications that any foreign actor attempted to interfere in the 2020 US elections by altering any technical aspect of the voting process, including voter registration, ballot casting, vote tabulation, or reporting results.”The report is the latest official affirmation of the integrity of the election, even as Trump supporters continue to make false claims of interference, from foreign or domestic actors, and refuse to accept Biden’s victory. Multiple courts and even Trump’s own Justice Department refuted claims of widespread fraud. The document makes clear that even while Trump has cried foul about the legitimacy of the election, intelligence officials believe Russia sought to influence people close to Trump as a way to tip the election in his favor.The report wades into the politically charged task of ferreting out which foreign adversaries supported which candidates during the 2020 election, an issue that dominated headlines last year. Trump, whose 2016 campaign benefited from hacking by Russian intelligence officers and a covert social media effort, seized on an intelligence assessment from August that said China preferred a Biden presidency — even though the same assessment also said Russia was working to boost Trump's own candidacy by disparaging Biden.Tuesday's report, however, says China ultimately did not interfere on either side and “considered but did not deploy" influence operations intended to affect the outcome. US officials say they believe Beijing prioritized a stable relationship with the US and did not consider either election outcome as advantageous enough for it to risk the “blowback” that would ensue if it got caught with interfering.The primary threats instead came from Russia and Iran, albeit with different intentions and through different means, according to intelligence officials.In the case of Russia, the report says, Russia sought to undermine Biden’s candidacy because it viewed his presidency as opposed to the Kremlin's interests, though it took some steps to prepare for a Democratic administration as the election neared.The report also says Putin authorized influence operations aimed at denigrating Biden, boosting Trump, undermining confidence in the election and exacerbating social divisions in the US.Central to that effort was reliance on proxies linked to Russian intelligence “to launder influence narratives" by using media organizations, US officials and people close to Trump to push “misleading or unsubstantiated" allegations against Biden.Intelligence officials did not single out any Trump ally in that effort. But longtime associate Rudy Giuliani met multiple times with Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, who in 2020 released heavily edited recordings of Biden in an effort to link the Democratic nominee to unsubstantiated corruption allegations. US officials have said they regard Derkach as an “active Russian agent,” and Tuesday's report said Putin is believed to have “purview” over his activities.Notably, though, Russia was not as aggressive as in past election cycles in trying to hack election infrastructure. The report says Russian cyber operations that targeted state and local government networks last year were probably not election-focused and were instead part of a broader effort to target US and global entities.Iran, meanwhile, carried out its own influence campaign aimed at harming Trump's re-election bid, an effort US officials say was probably approved by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.One “highly targeted operation" — the subject of an October news conferenc e by then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and FBI Director Christopher Wray — involved a flurry of emails to Democratic voters in battleground states that falsely purported to be from the far-right group Proud Boys and threatened the recipients if they didn't vote for Trump.Iran's efforts, which officials say were more aggressive than in past elections and continued even after the contest was over, were focused on sowing discord in the US, likely because Tehran believed that would hurt Trump's re-election chances.Though Iran sought to exploit vulnerabilities on state election websites, and did “compromise US entities associated with election infrastructure as a part of a broad targeting effort across multiple sectors worldwide,” it did not attempt to manipulate votes or affect election infrastructure, the report concluded.The 15-page document is a declassified version of an election interference report that was provided to Trump on Jan. 7, one day after a riot at the US Capitol that occurred as Congress was gathering to certify the election results.A separate document released Tuesday from the departments of Justice and Homeland Security reached a similar conclusion about the integrity of the election, saying there was no evidence any foreign actor had changed votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-tried-to-help-trump-against-biden-in-2020-us-elections-report-101615940158514.html

17-03-2021||World||'Not enough': UK drivers on Uber's minimum wage, pension, holiday pay move||Uber is giving its UK drivers the minimum wage, pensions and holiday pay, following a recent court ruling that said they should be classified as workers and entitled to such benefits.The ride hailing giant's announcement Tuesday comes after it lost an appeal last month at the UK Supreme Court following a yearslong court battle. The court's decision holds wider implications for the country's gig economy.Uber said it's extending the benefits immediately to its more than 70,000 drivers in the UK. Drivers will earn at least the minimum wage, which currently stands at 8.72 pounds ($12.12), after accepting a trip request and expenses, and will still be able to earn more.Drivers will also get holiday pay equal to about 12% of their earnings, paid every two weeks. And they'll be enrolled in a pension plan that both they and the company will pay into.“This is an important day for drivers in the UK," Uber's regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said in a filing to the SEC. He noted that drivers will still be able to work on a flexible basis. “Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives.”The drivers who filed the case welcomed the news but said it's not enough.Uber has “arrived to the table with this offer a day late and a dollar short, literally,” James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam of the App Drivers And Couriers Union said in a statement. They said the changes stopped short of the Supreme Court's ruling that pay should be calculated from when drivers log on to the app until they log off. And they said the company can't decide by itself the expense base for calculating the minimum wage, which should be based on a collective agreement.Farrar and Aslam had taken their case to an employment tribunal, which found drivers are not independent contractors, but should be designated workers, which under British law means their work terms are more casual than employees but still come with some benefits. Uber lost two rounds of appeals before the Supreme Court decision.Providing more benefits for its drivers is likely to raise costs for San Francisco-based Uber, which already was struggling to make a profit and had previously run into regulatory trouble in London, where authorities had sought to revoke its license.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-to-give-uk-drivers-minimum-wage-pension-holiday-pay-101615940200690.html
17-03-2021||World||UK foreign minister Raab says democracy in retreat globally||Democracy is in retreat around the world, British foreign minister Dominic Raab will warn on Wednesday in a speech setting out the danger that autocratic regimes pose to global stability and prosperity.Britain this week announced an overhaul of its foreign and defence policy to prioritise influence in the Indo-Pacific as a way to help moderate the expanding power and assertiveness of China's Communist Party leadership.Speaking to the US Aspen Security Forum to project that new agenda beyond a domestic audience, Raab will sum up the foreign policy review as a mission to be a "force for good in the world", saying that global democratic institutions are under their greatest threat since the end of the Cold War in 1989-90."Democracy is in retreat," he will say, adding that data showed that this decade the combined economic output of autocratic regimes is expected to exceed the combined output of the world’s democracies."Tyranny is richer than freedom, and that matters to us here at home because stable, freedom-respecting democracies are much less likely to go to war, house terrorists or trigger large scale flows of migrants," Raab said."They are generally, not always, but generally easier to trade with, and easier to cooperate with to solve our shared problems."Since its 2016 vote to leave the European Union, Britain have been searching for a new role on the global stage which lives up to the promise made by Brexit campaigners - namely that, outside the EU, British influence would be projected around the world and bring greater economic prosperity.Raab's speech will try to show that Britain, although dwarfed economically and militarily by China and the United States, now has a strategy to meet those expectations.Central to that plan is finding a leading role in protecting democracies and building a new international system based on democratic values."Without power, without economic, military, diplomatic, cultural clout, we can do nothing," Raab will say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-foreign-minister-raab-says-democracy-in-retreat-globally-101615933909063.html

Police arrested 25 people in the capital Tehran, the semi-official news agency Fars reported.The ancient Zoroastrian feast, called Chaharshanbe Suri (Scarlet Wednesday), is held on the eve of the last Wednesday of the Iranian calendar.

17-03-2021||World||US Congress report warns of repercussions over farmer protests in India||A new report by the US Congress’s non-partisan and autonomous research service has taken a critical view of India’s handling of the farmer protests, warning that New Delhi’s position on the ongoing stir could “present a challenge” for the Biden administration as it shapes its Indo-Pacific policy with India as a key partner.The report published by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) could potentially fuel the disquiet already voiced by US lawmakers.A congressional aide referring to the US Congress by its location, Capitol Hill, said that at the least, “if CRS has a published report on a topic, it indicates that the topic has generated some notable level of interest on the Hill”.“By some accounts, the crackdown on dissent has been excessive and reflective of a broader trend towards authoritarianism in India,” says the CRS report, drawing mostly upon news reports, commentaries and analyses in Indian and foreign media publications.“Perceived backsliding in India’s democracy and human rights record may present a challenge for the Biden administration in formulating its policies towards India and the Indo-Pacific,” the report adds.The report was published before the historic first-ever summit-level meeting of the Quad, which is singularly focused on the Indo-Pacific, called by President Joe Biden with the stated goals of making a “a clear statement of the importance of the Indo-Pacific region” and to put his “stamp” on the Quad process.As of now, Biden’s Indo-Pacific policy is on course and was rolled out seemingly unaffected by the Narendra Modi government’s handling of the farmer protests.But the CRS report, as the congressional aide quoted above pointed out, reflects simmering unease among some US lawmakers, who might have been too distracted in recent weeks with domestic compulsions, such as confirmation hearings of the president’s nominees and the passing of his $1.9-trillion Covid-19 relief bill.In early February, Brad Sherman, the Democratic lawmaker who co-chairs the House India Caucus, tweeted: “I urge the Indian government to make sure the norms of democracy are maintained and that protesters are allowed to protest peaceably, and to have access to the Internet and to journalists. All friends of India hope that the parties can reach an agreement.”Sherman, Steve Chabot, the Republican co-chair of the Caucus, and Ro Khanna, the Indian-American who is co-chair, also raised the issue in a meeting with the Indian ambassador to the United States, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.But another congressional aide cautioned against overestimating the impact of the CRS report, contending that it should be worrying for India only “in theory”, because Saudi Arabia got away despite being a serial violator of civic norms that deny democratic rights to its people and has the blood of slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi on its hands.The Trump administration took no public position on the farmer protests in India, possibly because it could have been distracted at the time by a worsening of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the 2020 election.In its first response to the protests, which was attracting growing international attention by then, including in America, Biden’s state department said it encouraged a resolution to the agitation through dialogue, but it also showed support for underlying reforms that triggered the protests.“In general, the United States welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India’s markets and attract greater private sector investment,” the state department said on February 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-report-warns-of-repercussions-over-farmer-protests-in-india-101615869352898.html
