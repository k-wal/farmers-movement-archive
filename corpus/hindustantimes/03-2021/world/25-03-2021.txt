25-03-2021||World||India, US agree to resolve outstanding trade issues||India and the US on Thursday agreed to work “constructively” to resolve outstanding trade issues and take a “comprehensive” look at ways to expand the relationship.In their first interaction after President Joe Biden took office, Indian minister of commerce and industry Piyush Goyal spoke to his counterpart US trade representative Katherine Tai.There was no explicit reference to a trade agreement in the readout of their conversation issued by the office of the US trade representative (USTR). It was not clear, thus, if the two sides intend to pick up from where the Trump administration had left off or they will start afresh, as Goyal suggested some weeks ago.The two officials agreed to “revitalise” engagement through the US-India Trade Policy Forum, the USTR said referring to the key platform for trade talks between the two countries.They also decided to “to work constructively to resolve key outstanding bilateral trade issues and to take a comprehensive look at ways to expand the trade relationship”.The Indian side had said the Trump administration resorted to “nitpicking” in the trade talks and constantly changed their goalposts, which eventually denied them a deal, even a “mini deal” or an “interim deal”. Goyal has called for a “fresh package” for talks.Tai raised the importance of cooperation on a broad set of issues, including digital trade, intellectual property, agriculture, labour, and climate and the environment, the USTR said, listing out major US issues, some of whom have defied resolution across administrations in India and the US and some new and emerging areas of dissonance.There was no mention in the USTR readout to the Indian demand for restoring its special trading privileges under a US trade programme called the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which were terminated by the Trump administration to force India to concede key US demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-agree-to-resolve-outstanding-trade-issues-101616696904959.html
25-03-2021||World||Joe Biden doubles goal of Covid-19 vaccines to 200 million doses||President Joe Biden opened his first formal news conference Thursday with a nod toward the improving picture on battling the coronavirus, but he was immediately pressed on thorny issues, like immigration and voting rights, now testing his administration.Biden doubled his original goal on Covid-19 vaccines by pledging that the nation will administer 200 million doses by the end of his first 100 days in office. The administration had met Biden's initial goal of 100 million doses earlier this month — before even his 60th day in office — as the president pushes to defeat a pandemic that has killed more than 545,000 Americans and devastated the nation's economy.But while Biden had held off on holding his first news conference so he could use it to celebrate progress against the pandemic and passage of a giant Covid-19 relief package, he was quickly pressed at the question-and-answer session about all sorts of other challenges that have cropped up along the way.A pair of mass shootings, rising international tensions, early signs of intraparty divisions and increasing numbers of migrants crossing the southern border are all confronting a West Wing known for its message discipline.“I am going to deal with all of those problems,” Biden pledged.He then endorsed a modification — but not elimination — of the filibuster, without which it would be difficult to get his ambitious agenda through Republican opposition in the Senate. But he left the door open, at least on certain issues, to go further.“If there’s complete lockdown and chaos, as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’re going to have to go beyond what I’m talking about,” he said.“I want to get things done. I want to get them done consistent with what we promised the American people,” said Biden, who spent decades in the Senate. “I am going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating getting things done in the United States Senate."While seemingly ambitious, Biden’s vaccine goal amounts to a continuation of the existing pace of vaccinations through the end of next month. The US is now averaging about 2.5 million doses per day and an even greater rate is possible. Over the next month, two of the bottlenecks to getting Americans vaccinated are set to ease as the US supply of vaccines is on track to increase and states lift eligibility requirements to get shots.The scene looked very different from what Americans are used to seeing for formal presidential news conferences. The president still stood behind a podium against a backdrop of flags. But due to the pandemic, the White House limited attendance and only 30 socially distanced chairs for journalists were spread out in the expansive room.“It’s an opportunity for him to speak to the American people, obviously directly through the coverage, directly through all of you,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. “And so I think he’s thinking about what he wants to say, what he wants to convey, where he can provide updates, and, you know, looking forward to the opportunity to engage with a free press.”Biden is the first chief executive in four decades to reach this point in his term without holding a formal news conference. While he has been on pace with his predecessors in taking questions from the press in other formats, he tends to field just one or two informal inquiries at a time, usually in a hurried setting at the end of an event or in front of a whirring helicopter.Pressure had mounted on Biden to hold a formal session, which allows reporters to have an extended back-and-forth with the president on the issues of the day. Biden's conservative critics have pointed to the delay to suggest that Biden was being shielded by his staff.West Wing aides have dismissed the questions about a news conference as a Washington obsession, pointing to Biden’s high approval ratings while suggesting that the general public is not concerned about the event. The president himself, when asked Wednesday if he were ready for the press conference, joked, “What press conference?”Behind the scenes, though, aides have taken the event seriously enough to hold a mock session with the president earlier this week. And there is some concern that Biden, a self-proclaimed “gaffe machine,” could go off message and generate a series of unflattering news cycles.“The press conference serves an important purpose: It presents the press an extended opportunity to hold a leader accountable for decisions,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, presidential scholar and professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania. “A question I ask: What is the public going to learn in this venue that it couldn’t learn elsewhere? And why does it matter? The answer: The president speaks for the nation.”Biden was expected to point to a surge in vaccine distribution, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the sweeping stimulus package.But plenty of challenges abound.His appearance comes just a day after he appointed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the government’s response to the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, where the administration faces a growing humanitarian and political challenge that threatens to overshadow Biden's legislative agenda.In less than a week, two mass shootings have rattled the nation and pressure has mounted on the White House to back tougher gun measures. The White House has struggled to blunt a nationwide effort by Republican legislatures to tighten election laws. A pair of Democratic senators briefly threatened to hold up the confirmation of Biden appointees due to a lack of Asian American representation in the Cabinet. And both North Korea and Russia have unleashed provocative actions to test a new commander in chief.In a sharp contrast with the previous administration, the Biden White House has exerted extreme message discipline, empowering staff to speak but doing so with caution. The new White House team has carefully managed the president’s appearances, which serves Biden’s purposes but denies the media opportunities to directly press him on major policy issues and to engage in the kind of back-and-forth that can draw out information and thoughts that go beyond curated talking points.Having overcome a childhood stutter and famously long-winded, Biden has long enjoyed interplay with reporters and has defied aides’ requests to ignore questions from the press. He has been prone to gaffes throughout his long political career and, as president, has occasionally struggled with off-the-cuff remarks.Those are the types of distractions his aides have tried to avoid, and, in a pandemic silver lining, were largely able to dodge during the campaign because the virus kept Biden home for months and limited the potential for public mistakes.Firmly pledging his belief in freedom of the press, Biden has rebuked his predecessor’s incendiary rhetoric toward the media, including Donald Trump’s references to reporters as “the enemy of the people.” Biden restored the daily press briefing, which had gone extinct under Trump, opening a window into the workings of the White House. And he sat for a national interview with ABC News last week.Biden has also delivered a series of well-received speeches, including his inaugural address, and has shown that he can effectively communicate beyond news conferences, according to Frank Sesno, former head of George Washington University’s school of media.“His strongest communication is not extemporaneous. He can ramble or stumble into a famous Biden gaffe,” said Sesno in a recent interview. “But to this point, he and his team have been very disciplined with the message of the day and in hitting the words of the day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-doubles-goal-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-200-million-doses-101616696150759.html
25-03-2021||World||Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny's health worsens in prison||Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has accused prison authorities of failing to provide proper treatment for his back pain and leg problems, saying in a letter posted Thursday that his physical condition has worsened in prison and he now has trouble walking.Navalny blamed his health problems on prison officials failing to provide the right medicines and refusing to allow his doctor to visit him behind bars. He also complained in a second letter that the hourly checks a guard makes on him at night amounted to sleep deprivation torture.Copies of his letters to penitentiary officials and Russia’s top prosecutor were posted on Navalny's website.The 44-year-old Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken opponent, was arrested on Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.Last month, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.“My condition has worsened. I feel acute pain in my right leg, and I feel numbness in its lower part,” Navalny wrote in the letter. “I have trouble walking.”He said that the authorities have given him standard pills and ointment for his pain, but refused to accept medicines earlier prescribed by his doctor.He accused prison officials of undermining his health with a “deliberate denial of due medical assistance."Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service said earlier Thursday that Navalny had undergone medical check-ups the previous day, describing his condition as “stable and satisfactory.”But Navalny's lawyer, Olga Mikhailova, said Thursday after visiting him in prison that “his right leg is in terrible shape.”Mikhailova said on Dozhd TV that Navalny was taken to a hospital outside his prison on Wednesday for magnetic resonance tomography but wasn't given the results.She said Navalny had experienced back pain for four weeks, but prison officials also would not permit a visit by his doctor. The lawyer argued that authorities should transfer Navalny to Moscow so he could get better treatment.Navalny’s wife, Yulia, said on Instagram that she doesn’t trust the prison medics, and she called on authorities to let doctors who have her and her husband's trust in to see him. She said prison authorities refused to accept a note from Navalny's doctor prescribing some exercises to ease his back pain.She denounced the treatment of her husband in prison as part of Putin’s “personal revenge.”Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the Kremlin wasn't following Navalny's condition, referring questions to the penitentiary service.Earlier this month, Navalny was moved to a prison colony in Pokrov in the Vladimir region, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of Moscow. The facility stands out among Russian penitentiaries for its particularly strict regime that includes routines like standing at attention for hours.In a note earlier this month, Navalny described the prison, IK-2, as a “friendly concentration camp.” He said he hadn’t seen “even a hint at violence” there but lived under controls that he compared to George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four.”Navalny, whom prison authorities had earlier marked as a flight risk, said he was subject to particularly close oversight, including a guard waking him up every hour at night and filming him to demonstrate he is in the required place.He complained about the practice in a separate letter to the chief of the penitentiary service and the top prosecutor that also was released Thursday, saying that the hourly checks amount to “sleep deprivation torture.”Navalny’s arrest in January triggered a wave of protests that drew tens of thousands of participants across Russia. Authorities detained about 11,000 people, many of whom were fined or given jail terms ranging from seven to 15 days.Navalny's associates called earlier this week for another mass protest across the country to demand his release from prison. They urged Russians to sign up for a protest on an interactive map and said they would set a date for it when the number of people willing to take part reaches at least 500,000 nationwide.More than 250,000 have registered on a dedicated website since it opened Tuesday.Russian officials have rejected demands from the United States and the European Union to free Navalny and stop the crackdown on his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-s-health-worsens-in-prison-101616696142982.html
25-03-2021||World||'Happens every year': Joe Biden says immigrant surge seasonal||President Joe Biden pushed back Thursday at claims the flow of undocumented immigrants at the US southern border has reached crisis levels, saying the surge is a mostly seasonal problem that happens each year."There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year," he said in his first press conference since taking office.Pushing back on criticisms that he has opened the door to undocumented immigrants, Biden said his government is committed to allowing unaccompanied migrant children to enter the United States for humanitarian reasons.More than 9,000 came in February, a number on track to top 14,000 this month, swamping facilities of the US Customs and Border Patrol for processing them.He also said that the United States is allowing a number of families to enter because Mexico is refusing to accept their return."We are sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming," Biden said."They should all be going back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/happens-every-year-joe-biden-says-immigrant-surge-seasonal-101616696129129.html
25-03-2021||World||Nike, Adidas and H&M face boycott heat over Xinjiang||Nike and Adidas came under attack on Chinese social media on Thursday over past comments the fashion brands have made about labour conditions in Xinjiang, part of a diplomatic row between China and the West.The sportswear companies were the latest caught up in a backlash prompted by a Chinese government call to stop foreign brands from tainting China's name as internet users found statements they had made in the past on Xinjiang.Chinese state media had singled out H&M on Wednesday over a statement reported last year where the Swedish fashion retailer said it was deeply concerned by reports of accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang, and that it did not source products from the Chinese region.Both Nike and Adidas, which have been growing rapidly in China, have said previously that they do not source products or yarn from the Xinjiang region. Adidas declined to comment on Thursday and Nike did not respond to requests for further comment.Earlier this week, China denied allegations of human rights abuses by its officials in the western region of Xinjiang, home to Muslim Uighurs, after the European Union, United States, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on the officials.Beijing hit back with retaliatory sanctions on European lawmakers, scholars and institutions.Some internet users said they would stop buying Nike and will support local brands such as Li Ning and Anta, while others told Adidas to leave China.The dispute creates a dilemma for Western companies who must balance the desire to expand their business in China against the views of consumers in their home markets."Brands must not rescind on their human rights responsibilities in the face of this pressure," said Chloe Cranston of Anti-Slavery International, a member of the Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uighur Region.BOYCOTT CALLSShares of Anta Sports Products Ltd and Li Ning Co surged, while shares in Adidas, Inditex and H&M fell on Thursday.State tabloid Global Times said Spain's Inditex, owner of Zara, had "quietly removed" a statement on Xinjiang from its English and Spanish-language websites.An Inditex webpage stating that the company was highly concerned about reports alleging social and labour malpractice in various supply chains among ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang was live on March 24, a Google cache showed, but now appears to be unavailable.Inditex did not respond to a request for comment. Inditex has previously said it does not have any commercial relations in Xinjiang.Chinese internet users also targeted the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a group that promotes sustainable cotton production which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, citing human rights concerns.BCI members include Nike, Adidas, H&M and Japan's Fast Retailing. The Better Cotton Initiative website also stopped working on Thursday. The organisation did not respond to a request for comment."If you boycott Xinjiang cotton, we'll boycott you. Either Adidas quits BCI, or get out of China," one internet user wrote.H&M said on Wednesday it respected Chinese consumers and that it was committed to long-term investment and development in China.But by Thursday morning, H&M did not exist on some Chinese store locator maps. Searches for H&M stores on Baidu Maps yielded no results. The retailer's official store on Alibaba's Tmall, an e-commerce platform, was inaccessible.At a daily media briefing at China's foreign ministry, spokeswoman Hua Chunying, when asked about H&M, held up a photograph of Black Americans picking cotton."This was in the US when Black slaves were forced to pick cotton in the fields," she said.Hua then held up a second photograph of cotton fields in Xinjiang."More than 40% of the cotton in Xinjiang is harvested by machinery, so the alleged forced labour is non-existent."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nike-adidas-and-h-m-face-boycott-heat-over-xinjiang-101616695635976.html
25-03-2021||World||US conducted more than two dozen pre-election cyber operations||The US carried out more than two dozen operations to thwart adversaries from election meddling ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to a top intelligence official.General Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, testified at a Senate hearing on Thursday that Cyber Command conducted the operations “to get ahead of foreign threats before they interfered or influenced our elections.”Nakasone appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee a week after the US intelligence community issued a report describing foreign efforts to influence voter opinions. It found that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered operations to hurt President Joe Biden’s candidacy and favor former President Donald Trump. Iran sought to hurt Trump’s candidacy, but China didn’t deploy influence efforts, according to the report. While there were foreign efforts aimed at affecting voter opinion, there were no attempts on “any technical aspect of the voting process,” the agencies found.Nakasone also said that two recently discovered cyber-attacks were “a clarion call” to take a fresh look at challenges facing the US.The first was December’s revelation that suspected Russian hackers compromised popular software from SolarWinds Corp. and breached about nine government agencies as well as 100 companies. And in March, Microsoft Corp. revealed that suspected Chinese hackers used vulnerabilities in its Exchange software for email and carried out an attack that experts say has tens of thousands of victims.“What we’ve seen from both the SolarWinds and the Microsoft intrusions is an increasing level of sophistication,” Nakasone said. “This is a scope, a scale, a level of sophistication that we hadn’t seen previously.”The SolarWinds attack was conducted through US networks, taking advantage of an area where Nakasone said he has limited visibility, referring to constraints on domestic surveillance by intelligence agencies.“Our adversaries understand that they can come into the United States and rapidly utilize an internet service provider -- come up and do their activities and take that down, before a warrant can be issued, before we can actually have surveillance by a civilian authority here in the United States,” he said. “That’s the challenge that we have right now.”Asked whether China has continued to steal intellectual property from the US after a 2015 agreement that neither power would conduct economic espionage, Nakasone described wide-ranging Chinese cyber activities in recent years. “I have seen the Chinese continue to utilize cyber activities below the level of armed conflict to steal intellectual property, to steal our personal identification, and at times attempt to influence our populace,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-conducted-more-than-two-dozen-pre-election-cyber-operations-101616693184255.html
25-03-2021||World||Giant cargo ship with all Indian crew blocks the Suez Canal. All you need to know||The giant cargo ship Ever Given remained stuck in the Suez Canal for the third consecutive day creating a huge backlog of ships in the canal. The Japanese owner of the ship, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, has said that the entire crew of 25 Indian nationals were safe and no oil leaks have been detected, reported the BBC.The Suez Canal authority has temporarily suspended traffic along the waterways while some experts predict that it will take several days to clear the canal costing global trade billions of dollars.Also Read | Jailed Putin opponent Navalny says his health is worsening“I can’t exclude that it can last weeks if the ship is really stuck,” Bloomberg quoted Peter Berdowski, chief executive officer of Boskalis Westminster, the parent company of the salvage team as saying.“It is like an enormous beached whale. It's an enormous weight on the sand. We might have to work with a combination of reducing the weight by removing containers, oil and water from the ship, tug boats and dredging of sand,” Berdowski added, reported Reuters.What has happened so farThe front of the ship is wedged around 5 meters into the canal wall, restricting the re-floating efforts, reported Bloomberg.The trouble began on Tuesday as the strong winds kicked up sands along the banks of the 120-mile narrow Suez canal. The over 200,000-tonne vessel was on its way from China to Rotterdam when the gusts as high as 46 miles an hour swept the dust around it making the crew lose control of the ship. Then the ship dashed into a sandy embankment that blocked nearly the entire canal. The vessel is still in the same position as it was when it careened, Bloomberg quoted Inchcape Shipping Services, a maritime services providerDigging efforts are ongoing as a way to remove sand from the front hull of the vessel to tug the vessel from the side.ImpactThe 400 meters long ship has choked both ways of one of the busiest canals linking Asia with Europe. A line of 156 large container ships, tankers carrying oil and gas, and bulk vessels with grains have created a massive traffic jam, also referred to as one of the worst shipping jams seen in years.Around 30 per cent of the world’s shipping container volume and 12 per cent of the total global trade of all goods pass through the narrow canal.As per rough estimates, the blockage in the backdrop of the global economy affected by Covid-19 will cost about $9.6 billion worth of traffic a day, as per Lloyd’s List. Westbound traffic is worth around $5.1 billion a day and eastbound traffic is around $4.5 billion a day, reported Bloomberg.Kaisha has apologised for the disruption but said dislodging Ever Given seems extremely difficult, reported BBC. “In co-operation with local authorities and Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, a vessel management company, we are trying to refloat [the Ever Given], but we are facing extreme difficulty,” BBC quoted Kaisha as saying.The shipping container vessels have nearly doubled in size in the past decade, even with the Suez Canal widening and deepening to make the transit easier. The block highlights the risk for the shipping industry as the ships get bigger and waterways get congested making such incidents common.Container ships have to wait for the canal to get clear or opt for sailing around the southern tip of Africa, Cape of Good Hope, which will take two more weeks of travel.Also Read | US lawmakers, tech CEOs face off over disinformationNick Sloane, the salvage master that led the re-flotation of the capsized cruise ship at the coast of Italy in 2012 believes that the best chance for normal shipping will return by Sunday or Monday when the tide will reach its peak. The salvors may have to lighten the vessel by unloading heavy elements from the ship, even fuel for that matter, things that aid the ship to keep steady at sea.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-cargo-ship-with-all-indian-crew-blocks-the-suez-canal-all-you-need-to-know-101616689872605.html
25-03-2021||World||Jailed Putin opponent Navalny says his health is worsening||Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny said he is suffering severe back pain despite prison officials’ assurances that he’s in a satisfactory condition.“I consider the deterioration in my health is a direct result of the actions and inactions of prison officials, deliberately aimed at refusing me necessary medical care and ruining my health,” he wrote in letters to prison and judicial authorities posted on his website by allies Thursday. “I regard what’s happening as an abuse.”Navalny demanded access to a Moscow specialist and an end to prison guards waking him every hour during the night. He has “practically lost the use” of his right leg and is in “terrible pain,” Olga Mikhailova, one of his lawyers, told TV Rain after visiting him in prison earlier Thursday.President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken critic has been held at the notorious IK-2 prison about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow since March 11. He was imprisoned for breaching parole while recovering in Germany from a near-fatal nerve-agent poisoning in Siberia last year that he and Western governments have blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny involvement.Navalny said he was taken for a scan Wednesday but not informed of the results and given only two pain-relief tablets a day.The regional Penitentiary Service said Navalny had been examined with other inmates with health complaints on Wednesday and found to be in “stable, satisfactory” condition, the state-run Tass news service reported.Navalny’s wife, Yulia, appealed to Putin to release him in an Instagram post Thursday in which she also said that prison officials had refused to allow lawyers to pass on exercise instructions from a back specialist to help her husband reduce the pain.The penal colony holding 44-year-old Navalny is known for its particularly harsh regime. He’s serving a 2 1/2 year sentence for violating probation terms of an earlier suspended fraud sentence in a case that the European Court of Human Rights has called politically motivated.His supporters have called for a day of rallies across Russia this spring. Nationwide protests that erupted in January following Navalny’s detention petered out after a major crackdown that led to thousands of arrests.Navalny’s allies say 250,000 anonymous entries have been made on a petition from people who’ve pledged to take part in the new demonstrations calling for his release, out of a targeted 500,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-putin-opponent-navalny-says-his-health-is-worsening-101616691859223.html

Gavi said it has notified recipient countries.The institute has been contracted to supply vaccines to 64 countries, and Gavi said the U.N.-backed program has “notified all affected economies of potential delays.”Gavi, which runs COVAX jointly with the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, has already distributed 31 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- 28 million from the Serum Institute and another 3 million from a South Korean contractor also producing the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unbacked-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-program-warns-of-supply-delays-101616690907397.html
25-03-2021||World||US lawmakers, tech CEOs face off over disinformation||More than two months after the violent uprising at the US Capitol, angry lawmakers in the same building Thursday are asking social media top executives for answers about how they are clamping down on misinformation and harmful content leading to violence and other damaging impacts.The leaders of Facebook, Google and Twitter sought to head off critics leading into the House of Representatives hearing, the latest in a series highlighting concerns over moderating content about elections, Covid-19 and the January 6 uprising.The remote video hearing is the fourth for Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey since last July and the third for Google's Sundar Pichai, who have been in the crosshairs of Democrats and Republicans alike."Whether it be falsehoods about the Covid-19 vaccine or debunked claims of election fraud, these online platforms have allowed misinformation to spread, intensifying national crises with real-life, grim consequences for public health and safety," said the heads of the two congressional subcommittees holding the hearing, in a statement.The tech CEOs said they were doing their best to keep out harmful content."Every day Twitter grapples with complex considerations on how to address extremism and misinformation," Dorsey said in his written testimony released in advance by the House Energy and Commerce Committee."Our efforts to combat misinformation, however, must be linked to earning trust. Without trust, we know the public will continue to question our enforcement actions."Pichai said Google is dedicated to giving people "trustworthy content and opportunities for free expression across our platforms, while limiting the reach of harmful misinformation."Zuckerberg meanwhile said Facebook has ramped up its efforts "to keep hate and violence off our platform" and offered a proposal to address concerns about liability of online platforms, suggesting that each platform have systems in place to weed out illegal content.Zuckerberg said that "people of all political persuasions want to know that companies are taking responsibility for combatting unlawful content and activity on their platforms."He maintained that Congress "should consider making platforms' intermediary liability protection for certain types of unlawful content conditional on companies' ability to meet best practices to combat the spread of this content."- Amplifying algorithms -The hearing comes amid a growing backlash against Big Tech firms which dominate key economic sectors, and which have largely benefitted from the move to online services during the pandemic.As the tech firms become a bigger part of people's lives, they have been facing a firestorm over disinformation, privacy, liability and antitrust as the Biden administration assembles its team and regulatory officials. But prospects for any immediate moves in Washington were unclear.A statement from the Energy and Commerce Committee said the big platforms "maximize their reach -- and advertising dollars -- by using algorithms or other technologies to promote content... (and) often elevate or amplify disinformation and extremist content."Some activist groups blame the platforms for the January 6 Capitol attack, claiming they failed to weed out content which led to the violence.Top law enforcement officials from 12 states meanwhile Wednesday called on Facebook and Twitter to take stronger measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 vaccine disinformation by vaccine opponents."The science is clear -- this vaccine saves lives," said New York state Attorney General Letitia James."Facebook and Twitter must take immediate action to protect New Yorkers and limit any further loss of life as a result of the spread of inaccurate information."The platforms were also expected to face criticism from Republicans for banning president Donald Trump for his comments seen as inciting the violence at the US Capitol on January 6 by his supporters, who have accused social media of political bias.Even as the tech firms face fury over disinformation, the Washington Post reported Thursday that at least seven Republican lawmakers on the committee tweeted or retweeted posted using the "Stop the Steal" phrase which was believed to be the catalyst for the January 6 violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-tech-ceos-face-off-over-disinformation-101616689553960.html

25-03-2021||World||Biden to set new Covid vaccine targets in first White House press conference||President Joe Biden is expected on Thursday to lay out a new goal for US vaccinations against Covid-19 at his first formal White House news conference, where topics will likely include immigration, infrastructure, gun control and foreign relations.Biden, who has taken questions from reporters in other settings since taking office on Jan. 20, may face sharp queries on a recent rise in asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border, plans to share coronavirus vaccines with other countries, and efforts to keep Americans safe from mass shootings.Aides have been drafting potential questions and answers for the Democratic president in recent days to prepare for the event, slated to begin at 1:15 p.m. (1715 GMT).Biden said last week that his goal of having 100 million vaccine shots administered was being met early and promised to announce a new goal this week.The administration may be able to double it, he said then.The White House says 130 million shots have been administered as of Wednesday. Some 85 million people have received one shot, while some 45 million people have been fully vaccinated.Just a few dozen journalists from news outlets selected by the White House Correspondents' Association will be on hand in the East Room, because of restrictions related to the pandemic.Biden's news conference is likely to offer a sharp contrast to the marathon sparring sessions his predecessor, Donald Trump, held with reporters, where the Republican president's insults and off-the-cuff remarks regularly made news. Ratings for the major cable television networks have dipped since Trump left the White House.At 78, Biden is the oldest person to take office as U.S. president, and his political opponents will be looking for signs he has become less sharp with age.Biden's popularity has remained high in his first two months in office, after a $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed Congress and millions were inoculated against the coronavirus with at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.A March 17-18 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 59% of adults in the United States approving of Biden's overall job performance and 35% disapproving.The president will face questions about his plans to advance gun control after two deadly mass shootings in less than a week. On Tuesday, Biden called for a ban on assault weapons and urged lawmakers to pass tighter gun control measures, but Republican support for such action is low.Biden's next big legislative package could also come up. He is expected to unveil a roughly $3 trillion bill to boost U.S. infrastructure during a trip to Pittsburgh next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-set-new-covid-vaccine-targets-in-first-white-house-press-conference-101616689225779.html
25-03-2021||World||India will honour deal to supply Covishield vaccines: Canadian PM||Supply of Covishield vaccines from India to Canada will be completed but the entire shipment may be delayed as India deals with developments outside its control.Reuters had earlier reported that the Indian government had placed a “temporary hold on all major exports” of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by the Institute of India (SII) under the brand name Covishield “to meet domestic demand as infections rise”.Another reason for a delay may be beyond India’s control, as a background media note circulated by India’s high commission to Ottawa noted: “The production of vaccines is dependent on several factors including the supply of raw materials. Some major suppliers in the West have banned the export of vaccines and also of raw materials.”A deal between the SII and Canadian firm Verity Pharmaceuticals, announced following a call from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in February, calls for 2 million doses to be shipped to Canada. Of these, 500,000 arrived in Toronto on March 3. However, there is some doubt over when the remainder will be shipped.Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Trudeau made it clear he was paying attention to reports that the Covishield supply could be affected. However, he appeared to be confident the deal will be honoured. “At this point, we have no indications that the 2 million doses we will be receiving from the Serum Institute over the coming two months will in any way be affected and we will continue to ensure that that be the case.”The media note circulated by India’s high commission did not identify the Western countries or elaborate on the raw materials impacted but there are production “challenges” expected in April.However, India plans on honouring its external obligations including those to Canada, to which it is expected to complete the final shipment by mid-May. However, the shipments were originally expected to be “front-loaded” but that may not be the case any longer.The media note stated that the “schedule of delivery remains under discussion between the companies”. It also said the Indian government was “working hard” with manufacturers to “expand the production capacity as soon as possible to meet both domestic and external demands”.It added that India has, thus far, supplied over 60 million doses to more than 75 nations, including under the COVAX facility, the global arrangement to ensure equitable access to coronavirus pandemic vaccines throughout the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-honour-deal-to-supply-covishield-vaccines-canadian-pm-101616686344073.html
25-03-2021||World||UK set to extend emergency coronavirus powers by 6 months||British lawmakers were voting Thursday on whether to prolong coronavirus emergency measures that have given the government unprecedented powers to restrict U.K. citizens’ everyday lives.The government is asking Parliament to extend the powers until September, and to approve a road map for gradually easing Britain's strict coronavirus lockdown over the next three months.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s large Conservative majority in Parliament all but guarantees success, but Johnson faces rebellion from some of his own lawmakers, who say the economic, democratic and human costs of the restrictions outweighs the benefits.The Coronavirus Act, passed a year ago as Britain went into lockdown, brought in a wide range of temporary health, economic and social powers to deal with the pandemic. It gives authorities powers to bar protests, shut down businesses, restrict travel and detain people suspected of having the virus.Heath Secretary Matt Hancock said Parliament had had to take “extraordinary measures in response to this extraordinary threat.”But Conservative lawmaker Mark Harper, a leading lockdown skeptic, said he had not “heard a single good answer” as to why the British government needed to extend the “draconian” powers for another six months.Britain has recorded more than 126,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe. But the U.K.'s fast-moving vaccination program has so far given at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to more than half of its adult population.Virus infections and deaths have fallen sharply in the last month even as they are rising in much of Europe.The British government is gradually lifting a national lockdown and children returned to school on March 8. Shops, hairdressers and outdoor dining are due to reopen on April 12, followed by indoor venues on May 17. Remaining restrictions are set to end June 21, if the country is not facing a large new virus surge.Hancock said infections were likely to rise as society opened up, but thanks to vaccines that would not automatically mean more virus-related deaths. But he said it was still right to proceed with caution.“We must restore the freedoms that we all cherish, but in a way that doesn’t put the (National Health Service) at risk,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-set-to-extend-emergency-coronavirus-powers-by-6-months-101616685510729.html
25-03-2021||World||Pak PM flouts Covid guidelines, holds in-person meet days after testing positive||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan -- who tested positive for C-19 last week -- on Thursday flouted coronavirus protocols and held in-person meeting.Shibli Faraz, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, has posted the image of the Pakistani Prime Minister on Twitter with the caption 'Prime minister with the media team today at Bani gala'.The image showed seven people sitting in a room with Imran Khan. Though Khan and the people in the meeting were wearing masks and maintained physical distancing, the image from the federal minister did not go down well with people on social media.Some were quick to point out that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had held virtual meetings after he had tested positive for coronavirus. One user wrote: "Bro that's how intelligent and sensible governments work when their premiere is sick. Protecting themselves and others."Another user wrote that it was a "boomer problem" that Khan was "sticking to 'in person' meetings when a more efficient and safe way is available."Netizens even urged the people to not "try this at home" as the cases are rising at a high rate in Pakistan."Poor optics and bad example from our PM @ImranKhanPTI. This meeting, if so important, could've been done over a video link. This pic is a violation of #SOPs and #coronavirus isolation guidelines. Once again poor advice and an incompetent team of advisors," Raza Haroon, a political worker wrote on Twitter.According to data issued by National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 38,858 tests were conducted in the country during the last 24 hours out of which 3,946 returned positive, taking the positivity ratio to 10.15 per cent, Geo News reported.Khan's special assistant on national health services Faisal Sultan had said on Saturday that the Prime Minister has tested positive for coronavirus."PM Imran Khan has tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-isolating at home," Sultan said in a tweet.Khan, 67, was vaccinated on Thursday with the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm as part of the nationwide anti-coronavirus vaccination campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-flouts-covid-guidelines-holds-in-person-meet-days-after-testing-positive-101616684136721.html
25-03-2021||World||Situation easing in eastern Ladakh, says Chinese military||The situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh has eased “distinctly” after the withdrawal of border troops from Pangong Lake, the Chinese military said on Thursday. It, however, gave no indication about the complete disengagement of frontline soldiers from all friction points in the area.India has repeatedly said that the complete withdrawal of Chinese troops from all points of conflict is necessary to maintain peace and tranquility along the disputed border.New Delhi and Beijing are cautiously attempting to emerge from the worst border conflict in decades, which saw soldiers dying on both sides.Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have been held since last year but disagreements exist; disengagement is yet to take place in the remaining areas including at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra areas.“Thanks to the joint efforts made by China and India, the situation in the border area has been eased distinctly”, Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said on Thursday.Ren added that at present China and India have disengaged front-line troops in the Pangong Lake area.Both sides have agreed to maintain communication through military and diplomatic channels to promote the settlement of other issues in the west section of the China-India boundary, Ren was quoted as saying by the Chinese military-run China Military Online.China hopes the two sides could value the hard-won results, maintain dialogue and communication and stabilise the situation against relapse and gradually reach a resolution, which can be accepted by the two countries to jointly maintain peace in the border area, he said.Asked to comment on the Quad, Ren said China is firmly opposed to the Quad alliance consisting of the US, India, Australia and Japan.Ren said China firmly opposed the four-side mechanism promoted by the US as it adheres to the “Cold War mentality”.He was responding to a question on the recent Quad summit and reported remarks by US national security advisor Jake Sullivan stating that the four leaders discussed the “challenges” posed by China.The virtual summit was attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide SugaThe Quad mechanism believes in group confrontation, is keen on geopolitical games, and uses the so-called “China challenge” as an excuse to “form cliques” and openly provoke relations between regional countries.“We are firmly opposed to this,” Ren said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-easing-in-eastern-ladakh-says-chinese-military-101616683223902.html
25-03-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to 684,000, fewest since pandemic||The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell sharply last week to 684,000, the fewest since the pandemic erupted a year ago and a sign that the economy is improving.Thursday’s report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims fell from 781,000 the week before. It is the first time that weekly applications for jobless aid have fallen below 700,000 since mid-March of last year. Before the pandemic tore through the economy, applications had never topped that level.Still, a total of 18.9 million people are continuing to collect jobless benefits, up from 18.2 million in the previous week. Roughly one-third of those recipients are in extended federal aid programs, which means they've been unemployed for at least six months.Their prolonged joblessness could prove to be a long-term hindrance: Typically, many people who have been unemployed for extended periods struggle to find work even as the economy regains its health.The economy has been showing signs of emerging from the pandemic crisis with renewed vigor, with spending picking up, manufacturing strengthening and employers adding workers. Hiring increased in February, with 379,000 added jobs — more than double January's total. The economy expanded at a 4.3% annual rate in the final three months of last year, the government estimated Thursday, slightly faster than its previous estimate. That pace is widely expected to accelerate in the coming months, fueled by substantial government rescue aid.Credit card data from JPMorgan Chase showed that consumer spending jumped last week as the $1,400 checks that are going to most adults under President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion emergency aid package began to be paid out. The Treasury says it has so far distributed 127 million payments worth $325 billion.Last week, Federal Reserve policymakers substantially boosted their forecast for the economy this year, anticipating growth of 6.5% for 2021, up from an estimate of just 4.2% three months ago. That would be the fastest rate of expansion in any year since 1984. The Fed also projects that the unemployment rate will reach 4.5% by the end of this year, down from the current 6.2%.Last week, some individual states reported sharp drops in applications for aid. In Illinois, they tumbled 80% to just under 15,000. In Ohio, they fell by nearly a third to 69,000.Nationally, though, the number of recipients in an extended federal jobless benefits program jumped by 730,000 to 5.5 million, with nearly all the increase occurring in California.Historically, the weekly unemployment claims figure has been considered an accurate reflection of the pace of layoffs. But that connection has weakened during the pandemic. Widespread fraud and the processing of backlogged claims have distorted many states’ jobless aid data. That has been particularly true for the federal program that covers self-employed and gig workers; this data has fluctuated wildly in many states.And a report from the California Policy Lab last week illustrated another complicating factor: Many people have applied multiple times during the pandemic, having been initially laid off or furloughed, then been called back to work, then been laid off again. Each layoff has triggered a new application for unemployment benefits.The Policy Lab’s report found that 75% of jobless claims in California in the final week of February were from people who had previously been laid off and applied for benefits.Across the country, economic activity slowed in February as severe winter weather caused sharp drops in home sales, retail spending and orders for heavy factory goods. Most economists, though, say they think the economy is now rebounding as the weather improves and additional support from the new $1.9 trillion federal rescue package kicks in.Some analysts are increasingly optimistic that hiring will accelerate quickly this year. Two senior fellows at the Brookings Institution have forecast that employers will add a substantial 700,000 to 1 million jobs per month, on average, over the next 10 months. At the higher end of that estimate, the economy by year’s end would have regained all the 9.5 million jobs that remain lost to the pandemic.There are still risks that could frustrate such hopes. The number of new daily coronavirus infections has leveled off, though hospitalizations and deaths continue to fall. And as many states have dropped or relaxed pandemic-related restrictions on gatherings and business activity, another wave of infections could weigh on the economy.Though growth may accelerate this year, hiring often lags behind economic growth as businesses wait to see if rising demand is sustainable. What’s more, roughly 4 million Americans stopped looking for work during the pandemic and aren’t counted in the unemployment rate. Most of them will need to be re-hired for the economic recovery to be fully complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-684-000-fewest-since-pandemic-101616679372400.html
25-03-2021||World||Family of autistic teen who died after choking on chicken nugget gets $2 million||The family of a 19-year-old student with autism will receive a $2 million settlement from a Florida school district a year and a half after he choked on a chicken nugget and died.The settlement approved by the Palm Beach County School Board on Wednesday, also sets up a mandatory training program — named in honor of Kedar Williams — for principals, teachers and other employees who work with special needs students, the South Florida SunSentinel reported.“His parents are pleased not only with the settlement, but they are most proud of the fact they fought for their son and fought for a training program designed to address the deficiencies that led to Kedar’s death,” said Sia Baker-Barnes, a lawyer who represents his mother, Megan Williams, and estate.Kedar Williams was rushed to a hospital Aug. 13, 2019, after choking on the chicken nugget at William T. Dwyer High in Palm Beach Gardens.Williams had a form of autism that made him mostly non-verbal, and he also had a condition that made him prone to aspiration, or choking, the family said.An aide was supposed to be assigned only to Williams, Baker-Barnes said. But video showed the aide was attending to another student when Williams choked.“Having your son wave goodbye to you in the morning, before school, and then never seeing him alive again is a mother’s worst nightmare. Our family has a gaping hole without Kedar in our lives,” his mother, Megan Williams, said in a statement.The boy's father, Jeffrey Williams, will share in the settlement. He is a teacher in Polk County.“He’s around children every day, so this is a reminder of the loss he feels,” Salesia Smith-Gorden, a lawyer Jeffrey Williams, told the newspaper.Normally, there’s a cap of $300,000 for negligence or liability cases, unless a claims bill is filed in the Legislature, allowing a larger payout. But the family filed a lawsuit in federal court, in addition to state court, citing a violation of federal protections for students with disabilities. That enabled them to collect a larger settlement without the Legislature.“While no amount of money will ever take away the pain caused by this tragedy, the School District of Palm Beach County hopes that the settlement reached with the Williams family will help to ease the burden of this tremendous loss,” district spokeswoman Claudia Shea said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-autistic-teen-who-died-after-choking-on-chicken-nugget-gets-2-million-101616677241305.html
25-03-2021||World||US Secretary of State Blinken says West needs to cooperate more than ever||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that cooperation between allies was more important than at any time in recent history and that relations with NATO and the European Union would be crucial to overcoming challenges.Speaking on the last day of his three-day visit to Brussels, Blinken continued what many European officials said was a charm offensive to win back the support of allies sidelined during four abrasive years under US President Joe Biden's predecessor Donald Trump."I came here very much with one particular focus in mind, and that was to make clear the United States' determination to revitalise our alliances and partnerships," Blinken said alongside Belgium's Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes.He later told U.S. diplomats in Brussels he wanted to mend and "modernise" relationships to focus on new challenges, which he has listed as China's rise, Covid-19, climate change, a newly assertive Russia and keeping a technological edge on rivals."There's a greater premium than any time since I've been involved in these issues, on finding ways to work together, again," said Blinken, a long-time Biden confidant involved in U.S. foreign policy for decades.Blinken won European Union support on Wednesday for a U.S. plan to confront Chinese power together through a formal dialogue that Beijing had hoped to avoid, praising EU officials who Trump actively sought to undermine."A basic tenet of the Biden-Harris administration is consulting with our friends, early and often," Blinken said.Biden will address EU leaders via video conference later on Thursday, the first such gesture since President Barack Obama did so in 2009.Issues remain, however, including Turkey's purchase of Russian missiles and discussions with Moscow to buy more, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under construction between Russia and Germany, which Blinken reiterated that Washington opposes."Some of our allies are moving in the wrong direction," he said on Wednesday, referring to backsliding on democracy in Hungary, Poland and Turkey, although he did not name countries.He stressed that alliances need to serve U.S. interests and that NATO allies must help pay for their own security, saying: "We can't sustain effective alliances without showing how they deliver for the American people."But China's decision on Monday to retaliate strongly against Western sanctions over human rights abuses has appeared to bring Europe and the United States closer together. European governments have summoned Chinese envoys to explain measures against EU nationals that were seen as going far beyond what Brussels imposed."We're convinced that it is (through) enduring relationships, like the one between our countries, and like the ones that exist through the European Union and through NATO ... that we can overcome any of these challenges," Blinken said.Citing the "devastating" Covid-19 pandemic, Blinken promised to work with the EU and NATO on global distribution of vaccines, and to ensure they are prepared for future pandemics.While insisting Europe does not have to choose between the United States and China, Blinken insisted throughout his trip that the West must show authoritarian states that democracy is a superior system and stand up for liberal values.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secretary-of-state-blinken-says-west-needs-to-cooperate-more-than-ever-101616675386031.html
25-03-2021||World||UK’s 2020 emission drop sees it almost halfway to net zero||The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by 9% in 2020 as coronavirus lockdowns saw a drop in road use and pollution from the business sector.The large annual drop puts the country at almost halfway to its legal goal of effectively eliminating the UK’s territorial emissions by 2050, according to provisional data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.The long term decline in UK emissions has been driven by the shift away from burning coal for power generation. As electricity demand fell and renewable energy made up a larger share of the power mix, carbon dioxide emissions from the sector fell by nearly 12% in 2020.UK CO2 pollution - which makes up the largest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions - fell by almost 11% in 2020, caused mainly by a significant drop in road use, as lockdowns ground the country to a halt.Half of the drop in CO2 output came from the 20% fall in transport emissions. Meanwhile residential sector emissions increased by 1.8% as people stayed at home as 85% of UK households burn gas for heating.The UK’s net-zero emissions target doesn’t include emissions from imported goods or emissions attached to shipping and aviation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-2020-emission-drop-sees-it-almost-halfway-to-net-zero-101616675116126.html
25-03-2021||World||Greek Independence Day events culminate in military parade||Fighter jets flew by the ancient Acropolis and tanks rumbled past parliament in central Athens on Thursday as Greece’s celebrations for the bicentenary of its war of independence culminated in a military parade attended by dignitaries from Britain, France and Russia but no members of the public.With Greece struggling to contain a renewed surge of coronavirus infections that are straining the health system, the crowds that normally line the route were banned from this year’s Independence Day parade, with the public able to watch only through live television coverage or online streaming.Greece invited dignitaries from Russia, France and Britain, the great powers that had provided vital assistance to the nation’s bid for independence from the Ottoman Empire, to attend the celebrations marking 200 years since the start of the Greek rebellion.Britain's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and French Defense Minister Florence Parly were in Athens for the events, along with Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades. French President Emanuel Macron had been due to attend, but pulled out a few days earlier as coronavirus infections spiked in France and he tightened restrictions domestically.Charles, Mishustin, Parly and Anastasiades laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier outside parliament before the start of the military parade, which included a mounted cavalry section and marching troops from the army, navy and air force, as well as the police, fire department and coast guard.Fighter planes and helicopters flew in formation above central Athens — they included a US Air Force plane, French Rafale jets and Britain's Royal Air Force Voyager aircraft in which Prince Charles flew to Greece, the Union Jack emblazoned on its tail.Unable to watch the parade in person, many Athenians came out onto balconies in the center of the city to watch the flyby, snapping pictures with cameras and mobile phones.The Greek independence revolt started in the Mani region of the southern Peloponnese peninsula in 1821 and continued for years without official foreign support, with the Greeks gradually becoming riven by dissent and infighting. In 1827, with the revolution almost squashed, the war fleets of Britain, Russia and France intervened to destroy a Turkish-Egyptian fleet in the Bay of Navarino, in the western Peloponnese.This crucial blow enabled the Greeks to fight on and eventually gain independence in 1830.Speaking during an official dinner Wednesday night, Prince Charles noted his ties to Greece, the land of his grandfather and of his father’s birth.“In feeling a profound connection to Greece — her landscapes, her history and her culture — I am hardly alone: there is something of her essence in us all,” he said. “As the wellspring of Western civilization, Greece’s spirit runs through our societies and our democracies. Without her, our laws, our art, our way of life, would never have flourished as they have.”Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis kicked off Thursday’s celebrations by attending the raising of the Greek flag on the Acropolis.“Two centuries ago, a handful of determined fighters within and outside Greece, raised the banner of independence. They set in motion a process the end of which not even they themselves could have dreamed of. With the help of their allies, they fought heroically and won their freedom,” Mitsotakis said in a speech.Throughout Greece’s history as an independent nation “we have lived through moments of triumph and of pain. Wise decisions, but also great mistakes,” he said. “But in all of humanity’s great tribulations our land was always on the right side of history.”Mitsotakis noted that this year’s Independence Day was “unique, but also different, as it finds us in the final battle with the pandemic. With great difficulties, but with victory now visible. Besides, our national vaccination campaign is named Freedom.”Despite being under lockdown-type measures since early November, Greece has seen spiraling coronavirus infections, with record numbers of patients intubated in intensive care units and dozens of daily deaths. Hospitals are strained to their limits, with many ICUs at capacity. As of Wednesday evening, the overall pandemic death toll had reached 7,649 and there were about 245,000 total confirmed infections in the country of around 11 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greek-independence-day-events-culminate-in-military-parade-101616674121811.html
25-03-2021||World||World War II codebreaker Alan Turing is the new face of Britain's £50 note||The rainbow flag is flying proudly Thursday above the Bank of England in the heart of London's financial district to commemorate World War II codebreaker Alan Turing, the new face of Britain's 50-pound note.The design of the banknote was unveiled before it is set to be formally issued to the public on June 23, Turing's birthday. The 50-pound note is the most valuable denomination in circulation but is little used during everyday transactions, especially during the coronavirus pandemic as digital exchanges increasingly replaced the use of cash.The new note, which is laden with high-level security features, completes the bank's rejig of its stable of paper currencies over the past few years. Turing's image joins that of Winston Churchill on the five-pound note, novelist Jane Austen on the 10-pound note and artist J. M. W. Turner on the 20-pound note. All the notes are made from polymer rather than paper, which means they should last longer and remain in better condition through their use.The new note incorporates two windows and a two-colour foil that designers say will make it very difficult to counterfeit. There is also a hologram image that changes between the words “Fifty” and “Pounds” when the note is tilted from side to side, as well as an embedded microchip to pay tribute to Turing's role in the birth of computers.Turing was selected as the new face of the 50-pound note in 2019 following a public nomination process, recognition of his pivotal role in breaking Nazi Germany's Enigma code during World War II. The code had been believed to be unbreakable as the cypher changed continuously. Historians say the cracking of the code may have helped shorten the war by at least two years, potentially saving millions of lives.The 250,000 or so votes supporting Turing's nomination also represented a recognition of the discrimination that he faced as a gay man after the war.“There’s something of the character of a nation in its money, and we are right to consider and celebrate the people on our banknotes," Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey said.“Turing is best known for his codebreaking work at Bletchley Park, which helped end the Second World War. However, in addition, he was a leading mathematician, developmental biologist, and pioneer in the field of computer science. He was also gay, and was treated appallingly as a result."During World War II Turing worked at the secret Bletchley Park code-breaking centre, where he helped crack Enigma by creating the “Turing bombe,” a forerunner of modern computers. He also developed the “Turing Test” to measure artificial intelligence.After the war, he was prosecuted for homosexuality, which was then illegal, and forcibly treated with female hormones — a form of chemical castration. His conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). He died at age 41 in 1954 after eating an apple laced with cyanide.Turing received a posthumous apology from the British government in 2009, and a royal pardon in 2013. Four years later, the Turing law, which pardoned gay men with past convictions, was passed.Actor and author Stephen Fry said the choice of Turing to appear on the 50-pound note marks another step in the nation’s long overdue recognition of “this very great man,” whose “talents ranged far and wide.”In a YouTube video posted by the Bank of England, Fry laid out the levels of discrimination and “barbaric punishments” that gay men faced in the years after World War II.“Alan Turing was among the thousands of men who were harried and harangued by the authorities," he said.“Not just down to the hostile attitude to their sexuality alone, but also under the bigoted belief that there was a link between homosexuality and communism," Fry added.Over the past decade, Turing's life has become known to a much wider audience, especially in the wake of the 2014 film “The Imitation Game” that saw Benedict Cumberbatch play the role of Turing.Great-nephew James Turing, who runs the Turing Trust which refurbishes U.K. computers for use in African schools, said the Bank of England’s move was an "unbelievable honour” for his family.“It certainly highlights the enormity of Alan’s legacy, which hopefully we are doing something through the Turing Trust that he would be proud of in continuing to further enable access to a digital world," he told BBC radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-war-ii-codebreaker-alan-turing-is-the-new-face-of-britain-s-50-pound-note-101616673863597.html
25-03-2021||World||EU's top court rejects effort to force tougher climate rules||The European Union’s top court on Thursday rejected an effort by a Scandinavian youth group and eight families around the world to force the EU to set more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that they were not “individually” affected by Europe’s climate policy.Families from Kenya, Fiji, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and Romania and the Swedish Sami Youth organization launched the legal action in 2018. They hoped to draw attention to the impact of climate policy on individuals and activists fighting for starving Arctic reindeer and other environmental issues.The European General Court acknowledged that the plaintiffs are generally affected by climate change but rejected the case in 2019 on procedural grounds. The families and youth group appealed to the European Court of Justice, or ECJ, the bloc’s top court.The ECJ upheld the lower court’s decision Thursday, saying the plaintiffs “are not individually concerned” by the EU’s climate legislation so the case won't be heard.After the legal effort was initially launched, the European Commission proposed a “European Green Deal” with more ambitious goals toward fighting climate change. European Union leaders reached a deal last year to cut the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, more than the previous goal of 40%.Experts say ending the use of fossil fuels is one of the most important measures needed to limit global warming, believed to be causing heavier storms, fiercer droughts and other weather problems damaging lives and livelihoods around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eus-top-court-rejects-effort-to-force-tougher-climate-rules-101616673749913.html
25-03-2021||World||What North Korean missile tests mean for US relations||New U.S. president, same old North Korean playbook. Almost.Two months after President Joe Biden took office, North Korea is again turning to weapons tests to wrest outside concessions. But the tests so far have been relatively small compared to past launches. That indicates Washington has a window of engagement before North Korea pursues bigger provocations.This week, North Korea’s neighbors reported the country fired four short-range missiles into the sea in its first missile launches in about a year. The launches — two on Sunday, two on Thursday — came after the North said it had rebuffed dialogue offers by the Biden administration, citing what it called U.S. hostility.Here’s look at North Korea’s recent missile launches and their motives.WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S STRATEGY THIS TIME?North Korea has a long history of performing major weapons tests around the time new governments take power in the United States and South Korea.In February 2017, less than a month after Donald Trump assumed the U.S. presidency, North Korea tested a mid-range missile that observers said showed an advance in weapon mobility. Later in 2017, four days after current South Korean President Moon Jae-in was inaugurated, North Korea fired what it called a newly developed, nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile.In 2009, North Korea conducted a long-range rocket launch and a nuclear test within the first four months of the first term of the Obama administration.This week’s weapons tests largely appear to follow that playbook, but experts believe the country held back from a more serious a provocation because the Biden administration is still evaluating its North Korea policy.The four missiles fired this week were all short-range and don’t pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. According to South Korea’s assessment, the first two weapons launched Sunday were believed to be cruise missiles. But Japan said the two fired Thursday were ballistic missiles, more provocative weapons that North Korea is banned from testing by U.N. Security Council resolutions.“The basic pattern isn’t much different. But while North Korea in the past focused on showing off its maximum capability when a new government came in the United States, I feel the North is trying to control the level of (its provocation),” said Du Hyeogn Cha, an analyst at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.WHAT DOES NORTH KOREA WANT?What it has always wanted: for “the United States to lift sanctions while letting it maintain its nuclear capability,” said Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy.Because the Biden administration is unlikely do that anytime soon, some experts say North Korea may stage bigger provocations, like a long-range missile test or a nuclear detonation.For now, it is ramping up its rhetoric along with the short-range missile launches.In January, about 10 days before Biden took office, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced he would enlarge his nuclear arsenal and beef up the country's fighting capability to cope with a hostile U.S. policy and military threats. He also pressed South Korea to suspend regular military drills with the United States if it wants better ties.When U.S. and South Korean militaries pressed ahead with their springtime drills this month, Kim’s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned the U.S. to “refrain from causing a stink” if it wants to “sleep in peace” for the next four years.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Washington reached out to Pyongyang starting in mid-February, but Pyongyang hasn’t responded. Coupled with the overture, however, Blinken continued to slam North Korea’s human rights record and nuclear ambitions when he visited Seoul last week. North Korea’s First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country will keep ignoring such U.S. offers because of what she called American hostility.The recent launches seem to be an example of North Korea “putting Kim Yo Jong’s threats into action as she said the United States can’t sleep in peace if it doesn’t accept its demands,” said Moon Seong Mook.WHAT’S NEXT?Experts say it’s highly unlikely for the Biden administration to back down and make concessions in the face of North Korea’s short-range missile launches. Biden, who has called Kim “a thug,” also isn't likely to sit down for one-on-one talks with Kim unless he gets a pledge that North Korea will denuclearize — and officials confirm the country is sincere.Amid the standoff, North Korea could end up launching bigger weapons tests, especially if it isn’t satisfied with the Biden administration's North Korea policy review that is expected to be publicized soon, experts say.“Biden won’t likely do a Trump-style ‘reality show summit’ with Kim. Kim’s agony in the next four years will be subsequently deepened and his nuclear gambling cannot help continuing,” said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at South Korea’s Korea University.North Korea could turn to long-range missile and even nuclear tests, which Kim Jong Un suspended when he began engaging diplomatically with Washington. While Kim Jong Un has claimed to have achieved the ability to attack the U.S. homeland with nuclear missiles, outside experts said the North hasn’t mastered everything it would need to do that.Such a major provocation would certainly prompt the United States and its allies to seek additional U.N. sanctions against North Korea.But tougher sanctions may be difficult because of China, the North's major diplomatic ally and economic lifeline, wields veto power on the U.N. Security Council. Given its current tensions with Washington, China may not easily agree to more sanctions even if North Korea engages in long-range or nuclear tests, analyst Cha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-north-korean-missile-tests-mean-for-us-relations-101616673512537.html
25-03-2021||World||Xi urges chinese province to deepen ties with democratic Taiwan||Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged Fujian to do more to develop ties with Taiwan, a sign of Beijing’s continuing efforts to bring the democratically ruled island under its sway.Xi told provincial officials to “be bold in exploring new paths for integrated cross-strait development,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday. He urged them to focus on offering policies that would benefit Taiwanese people and deepen mutual understanding, Xinhua said, without elaborating.Xi worked in Fujian from 1985 to 2002, rising from vice mayor of Xiamen to provincial governor, and recalled that period as he wrapped up a four-day “inspection tour.”“I worked in Fuzhou for six to seven years,” he said. “I came here at the age of 37 and spent the best years of my life here. I gained a lot of experience and understanding.”The Chinese leader also visited RICOM Group, an optical lens company in Fuzhou, according to Xinhua. The company says on the Chinese-language version of its website that it supplies the Shenzhou manned spacecraft program.China works to entice companies and individuals to work on the mainland, while at the same time isolating the current government of the island, which sits just 130 kilometers (80 miles) across a strait from Fujian. Beijing said earlier this month it would let agricultural firms sell bonds on the mainland and also enjoy preferential insurance and credit policies.Beijing at the same time exerts pressure on the government of President Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence. China cut off ties with the island Tsai was elected 2016, and kept up that pressure after she won a second term.Chinese military jets make frequent incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, and the mainland sometimes flexes its economic might to the island of nearly 24 million people. Last month China blocked pineapple imports, saying it found pests in shipments.Xi said in 2019 that the mainland is “not committed to renouncing the use of force” to take control of the island, which has strong economic and security ties to the U.S.The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been ruled separately since Chiang Kai-shek moved his government to the island as he lost a civil war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-urges-chinese-province-to-deepen-ties-with-democratic-taiwan-101616671574526.html
25-03-2021||World||NASA's Mars helicopter mission next month may pave the way for interplanetary flight||NASA engineers plan to send a miniature helicopter whirring just above the surface of Mars next month in an interplanetary aviation experiment that, if successful, would mark the first powered, controlled flight by an aircraft on another celestial body.The U.S. space agency is comparing the Martian debut of its 4-lb (1.8-kg) solar-powered whirlybird, dubbed Ingenuity, with the Wright Brothers' first sustained flight of a motor-driven aeroplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903.Paying homage to that feat, a tiny swath of wing fabric from the original Wright Brothers plane has been fastened underneath the helicopter's solar panel and will go aloft with Ingenuity when it takes flight roughly 150 million miles from Earth.Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles, where Ingenuity was designed and built, are aiming to launch the twin-rotor, four-legged helicopter on its maiden test flight sometime around April 8.The helicopter was carried to the red planet last month strapped to the belly of NASA's Mars rover Perseverance, which landed Feb. 18 on the floor of a vast basin called Jezero Crater after a nearly seven-month journey through space.Perseverance, a robot lab on wheels, is designed primarily to seek out traces of fossilized microbial life from Mars' ancient past and to collect rock specimens for return to Earth through future missions to Mars.One of its first tasks is to transport Ingenuity to its test-flight zone, a flat area near Perseverance's landing site. There the helicopter will be unloaded by remote control and set on the surface before the rover drives carefully away.NASA has set aside 30 Martian days to unpack and prepare the helicopter for its historic, but modest, first spin. It will take off on a slow, vertical ascent to about 10 feet (3 meters), hovering for 30 seconds, rotating in the air and then descending to a gentle touchdown.JPL plans to film the entire exercise with cameras mounted on Perseverance, parked a short distance away, and will beam images back to Earth hours later. Ingenuity is also equipped with two cameras of its own used for navigation.The helicopter will undertake additional flights up to 16 feet (5 meters) high, assuming the initial foray unfolds as expected.'Wright Brothers' momentIf successful, NASA hopes Ingenuity - a technology demonstration separate from Perseverance's astrobiology mission - paves the way for aerial surveillance of Mars and other destinations in the solar system, such as Venus or Saturn's moon Titan.The immediate goal, however, is achieving "that Wright Brothers moment, getting powered, controlled flight, then adding mobility and adding other capabilities like any flight-test program," said Bobby Braun, JPL's planetary science director.While Mars possesses just a third of the gravity to overcome as Earth, its atmosphere is just 1% as dense, presenting a special challenge for aerodynamic lift. To compensate, engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger (4-feet-long) and spin more rapidly than would ordinarily be needed for an aircraft of its size.The design was successfully tested in vacuum chambers simulating Martian conditions at JPL, but it remains to be seen whether Ingenuity will fly on the red planet.The small, lightweight aircraft must also withstand punishing cold, with nighttime temperatures dropping as low as 130 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius), using solar power alone to recharge its batteries and keep internal components sufficiently heated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-mars-copter-mission-next-month-may-pave-the-way-for-interplanetary-flight-101616669507527.html

Because their grief is not a sickness, it is a loss. And loss takes time."The leave provisions apply to mothers, their partners as well as parents planning to have a child through adoption or surrogacy, she said.One in four New Zealand women have had a miscarriage, Andersen said in her statement.India is the only other country with similar legislation, media said.New Zealand was the first country in the world to give voting rights to women and has been an pioneer on issues around woman's rights.The ruling centre-left Labour government is led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is seen as a global champion for women. Her government last year passed a historic law to decriminalise abortion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-unanimously-passes-miscarriages-bereavement-leave-law-101616667678403.html
25-03-2021||World||White House to spend $10 billion to bolster vaccine effort||The White House announced Thursday that it is dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural enclaves throughout the country.The effort, which is funded through the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package passed earlier this month, will include $6 billion in funding for community health centers to expand Covid-19 vaccinations, testing and other preventive health care for populations at higher risk for the virus.President Joe Biden's administration, which will start distributing the money in April to nearly 1,400 centers across the country, said health centers can also use the funding to modify and improve infrastructure and add mobile units.In addition, the Biden administration said it is allotting $3 billion to bolster “vaccine confidence.” The money, which will be parceled out to 64 jurisdictions, can be used by rural, faith-based organizations and by food assistance and housing nonprofits in high-poverty communities to conduct door-to-door outreach and education efforts to urge eligible people to schedule vaccination appointments.Some of the funding will also be spent to help dialysis clinics provide Covid-19 vaccinations to people receiving dialysis and health care personnel in the clinics.About $300 million is earmarked for community health worker services to support Covid-19 prevention and control, and an additional $32 million is for training, technical assistance and evaluation, the White House said.The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 545,000 people in the United States, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-to-spend-10-billion-to-bolster-vaccine-effort-101616666469489.html
25-03-2021||World||Traffic suspended in Suez Canal as bid to refloat stranded ship hits new trouble||The owners of a giant container vessel blocking the Suez Canal said Thursday they were facing "extreme difficulty" refloating it, prompting Egypt to suspend navigation through one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was trying to refloat the Panama-flagged MV Ever Given, a 400-metre (1,300-foot) long vessel which veered off course and ran aground in a sandstorm on Tuesday.Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs Inc show the 59-metre wide container ship wedged diagonally across the entire canal.Japanese ship-leasing firm Shoei Kisen Kaisha said it owned the giant vessel and was facing "extreme difficulty" trying to refloat it."In co-operation with local authorities and Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, a vessel management company, we are trying to refloat (the ship), but we are facing extreme difficulty," Shoei Kisen Kaisha said in a statement on its website."We sincerely apologise for causing a great deal of worry to ships in the Suez Canal and those planning to go through the canal."As shipping specialists warned it could take days or even weeks to budge the vessel, the Suez Canal Authority announced it was "temporarily suspending navigation".Maritime sources told AFP Thursday that a new dredger had been deployed to speed up the operation while northern convoy ships remain docked in the waiting areas of the canal.Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs Inc show the 59-metre wide container ship wedged diagonally across the entire canal."We've never seen anything like it before," said Ranjith Raja, Middle East oil and shipping researcher at international financial data firm Refinitiv."It is likely that the congestion... will take several days or weeks to sort out as it will have a knock-on effect on other convoys."- 'Days, maybe weeks' -The blockage has already hit world oil markets. Crude futures surged six percent on Wednesday as traders assessed the likely impact on deliveries.Broker Braemar warned that if tug boats are unable to move the giant vessel, some of its cargo might have to be removed by crane barge to refloat it."This can take days, maybe weeks," it said.The vessel's managers, Singapore-based Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), said its 25 crew were unhurt and the hull and cargo undamaged.A MarineTraffic map showed large clusters of vessels circling as they waited in both the Mediterranean to the north and the Red Sea to the south.Historic sections of the canal were reopened in a bid to ease the bottleneck, with dozens of ships waiting at both ends of the waterway.The waterway drastically shortens travel between Asia and Europe because it prevents vessels from having to navigate around southern Africa's Cape of Good Hope.The Singapore-to-Rotterdam route, for example, is 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) and up to two weeks shorter than going around Africa.It is an "absolutely critical" route because "all traffic arriving from Asia goes through the Suez Canal," said Camille Egloff, a maritime transport specialist at Boston Consulting Group.Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal last year carrying more than one billion tonnes of cargo, according to the SCA.Egypt earned $5.61 billion in revenues from the canal in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/traffic-suspended-in-suez-canal-as-bid-to-refloat-stranded-ship-hits-new-trouble-101616665995748.html

25-03-2021||World||H&M, Nike in hot soup in China over forced Uighur labour comments||Retail giants such as H&M and Nike are facing a massive social media backlash in China for statements on the use of forced Uighur labour to pick cotton in the northwestern Xinjiang province.Xinjiang is currently in the middle of tit-for-tat sanctions between Beijing and the West for alleged human rights abuses. The European Union, the US, Britain and Canada on Monday imposed sanctions on Chinese officials accusing them of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.China retaliated with its own sanctions against few European lawmakers, institutions and academics.The massive online backlash was triggered by a social media post by the Communist Youth League, a Communist Party of China (CPC) group, on Wednesday after it published old statements made by the companies.In separate statements, the companies had said that they were “concerned” about reports that Uighurs were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, and that they did not source products from the region.While H&M had made the statement last year, it was unclear when Nike had put out its statement. “We are concerned about reports of forced labour in, and connected to, the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR),” Nike said.The Communist Youth League quoted the statements, seemingly as a part of Beijing’s retaliation against the sanctions levelled by western countries.“Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!” the Communist Youth League, the youth wing of China’s ruling party, said in a post on the Weibo social media platform.Online response against the old posts was overwhelming with millions calling for the boycott of the companies. While many called for boycotts, celebrities cut ties, and e-commerce platforms have dropped the retailer, H&M.China, according to Reuters, is H&M’s fourth-biggest market with sales of 2.9 billion Swedish krona ($337 million) in the 12 months through November 2020. It has hundreds of outlets across China.More angry responses were targeted at the company after H&M China said in an announcement on Wednesday evening that the group had always upheld the principles of openness and transparency in the management of the global supply chain, ensuring that suppliers around the world comply with sustainability commitments such as the “OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct”, and that it does not represent any political position.“Chinese netizens don’t buy the H&M reply regarding Xinjiang cotton, and some said the reply implies that the firm is not doing wrong,” the China-based Global Times said in a report on Thursday.“As of 8am on Thursday, more than 115,000 comments were made after the company’s statement was made late on Wednesday, and one of the top comments is that ‘let me translate, the reply is that, I am not doing wrong’,” the GT report added.According to Reuters, topics around the Nike statement were among the highest trending on China’s Twitter-like social media Weibo on Thursday, and the social media storm had wider fallout. Popular Chinese actor Wang Yibo terminated his contract as a representative for Nike in response to social media criticism over its Xinjiang statement, his agency said on Weibo on Thursday.Xinjiang is the largest cotton growing region in China, ranking first nationally in total output, per unit production and planting area for 25 consecutive years, Chinese state media reported last year. In 2020, the total cotton planting area in Xinjiang reached 2.51 million hectares, nearly the same as in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hm-nike-in-hot-soup-in-china-over-forced-uighur-labour-comments-101616662403689.html

25-03-2021||World||North Korea missile launch tests Biden, alarms Japan ahead of Olympics||North Korea launched two suspected ballistic missiles into the sea near Japan on Thursday, underscoring steady progess in its weapons programme and ramping up pressure on the new U.S. administration as it reviews North Korea policy.The apparent tests were reported by authorities in the United States, South Korea, and Japan, and coincided with the start of the Olympic torch relay in Japan.They would be the first ballistic missile tests by North Korea in nearly a year and the first reported since US President Joe Biden took office in January.Analysts said the latest missile tests did not mean denuclearisation diplomacy was dead, but they highlight an inconvenient truth for the US administration: Pyongyang's arsenal is advancing, posing new threats and increasing its potential bargaining power should talks resume."Every day that passes without a deal that tries to reduce the risks posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile arsenal is a day that it gets bigger and badder," said Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.Thursday's launches came just days after North Korea fired several cruise missiles in an exercise that Biden said was not provocative but "business as usual".The Biden administration is in the final stages of its North Korea policy review, officials have said, and has been simultaneously signalling a hard line on human rights, denuclearisation and sanctions, while making diplomatic overtures that have been rebuffed by Pyongyang.It would be a mistake for Washington to ignore the advances in North Korea's short-range missiles, especially after leader Kim Jong Un declared in January that his military had the technology to miniaturise nuclear warheads and place them on tactical missiles, said Markus Garlauskas, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council and former U.S. National Intelligence Officer for North Korea."Downplaying North Korean ballistic missile tests will not help U.S. diplomacy with North Korea in any way, and would only encourage North Korea to further test the bounds of what the new administration can accept," he said.The missile launches highlight the threat North Korea's illicit weapons programme poses to its neighbours and the international community, the United States military's Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement.The command said it was monitoring the situation and consulting allies. There was no official comment from the White House or State Department on the test.North Korea typically confirms such missile tests - which it says are part of its sovereign right to self-defence - in state media the day after they happen.Japan's coastguard said the first missile was detected soon after 7 a.m. and flew about 420 km (260 miles), followed by a second 20 minutes later that flew about 430 km.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that two "short-range missiles" were fired into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan from North Korea's east coast.South Korean and U.S. intelligence agencies were analysing the data of the launch for additional information, the JCS said in a statement.Narang said even short-range ballistic missile tests would be a "step up" from the weekend cruise-missile test and allow North Korea to improve its technology while sending a proportionate response to recent U.S.-South Korea military drills.REGIONAL REACTIONThe launches overshadowed the start of the Olympic torch relay in Japan, beginning a four-month countdown to the summer Games in Tokyo."The first launch in just less than a year represents a threat to peace and stability in Japan and the region and violates U.N. resolutions," Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in comments aired by public broadcaster NHK.Suga said he would ensure a safe and secure Olympics and discuss the launches with Biden during his visit to Washington next month.Japan lodged a formal protest through its embassy in China, while South Korea's National Security Council expressed deep concern.After a meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong in Seoul, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed the need to establish peace and stability in Northeast Asia."This means all related countries need to abandon arms race and escalation of military activities of any form," he told a news conference.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula was the goal of all mankind."We call on the relevant sides to meet each other halfway and continue to maintain the deescalation situation to advance political settlement and work for lasting peace and security on the peninsula," she said.U.S. POLICY CHALLENGELeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Biden's North Korea policy review would come within the context of the administration's strategy on China, North Korea's only major ally."North Korea’s military activities after reaffirming ties with Beijing raise questions about how China is complicit in sanctions evasion and may be enabling the Kim regime's threats to the region. This will increase calls in the U.S. and elsewhere to sanction Chinese firms involved in illicit trade," he said.North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon or its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, ahead of an historic meeting between leader Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018.In early 2018, North Korea announced a moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and ICBMs, though it says it no longer feels bound by that after negotiations with the Trump administration faltered.Biden's diplomatic overtures to North Korea have similarly gone unanswered, and the North said it would not engage until the United States ceased hostile policies and military exercises with South Korea.Analysts have noted a change in wording from previous U.S. administrations, emphasising the "denuclearisation of North Korea" rather than the whole peninsula - a position likely to be anathema to Pyongyang.North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programmes throughout 2020 in violation of U.N. sanctions dating back to 2006, helping fund them with about $300 million stolen through cyber hacks, according to U.N. sanctions monitors.It has tested a number of new short-range missiles that can threaten South Korea and the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed there, most recently in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-missile-launch-tests-biden-alarms-japan-ahead-of-olympics-101616661689608.html
25-03-2021||World||1 report, 4 theories: Scientists mull clues on virus' origin||A team of international and Chinese scientists is poised to report on its joint search for the origins of the coronavirus that sparked a pandemic after it was first detected in China over a year ago — with four theories being considered, and one the clear frontrunner, according to experts.The lengthy report is being published after months of wrangling, notably between U.S. and Chinese governments, over how the outbreak emerged, while scientists try to keep their focus on a so-far fruitless search for the origin of a microbe that has killed over 2.7 million people and stifled economies worldwide.It wasn't immediately clear when the report will be released after its publication was delayed earlier this month. By many accounts, the report could offer few concrete answers, and may raise further questions.It will offer a first glance in writing from 10 international epidemiologists, data scientists, veterinary, lab and food safety experts who visited China and the city of Wuhan — where a market was seen as the initial epicenter — earlier this year to work with Chinese counterparts who pulled up the bulk of early data.Critics have raised questions about the objectivity of the team, insisting that China's government had a pivotal say over its composition.Defenders of the World Health Organization, which assembled the team, say it can't simply parachute in experts to tell a country what to do — let alone one as powerful as China.“I expect that this report will only be a first step into investigating the origins of the virus and that the WHO secretariat will probably say this," said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University's Global Health Policy and Governance Initiative at the O'Neill Institute. “And I expect some to criticize this as insufficient."The Wuhan trip is billed as Phase 1 in a vast undertaking to flesh out the origins of the virus.The WHO has bristled at depictions of the mission as an "investigation" — saying that smacks of an invasive forensic probe that wasn't called for under the resolution adopted unanimously by the agency's member states in May that paved the way for the collaboration. The WHO and China later ironed out the ground rules.Team member Vladimir Dedkov, an epidemiologist and deputy director of research at the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute in Russia, summarised the four main leads first laid out at a marathon news conference in China last month about the suspected origins of the first infection in humans. They were, in order of likelihood: from a bat through an intermediary animal; straight from a bat; via contaminated frozen food products; from a leak from a laboratory like the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Officials in China, as well as Chinese team leader Liang Wannian, have promoted the third theory — the cold-chain one — while the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump played up the fourth one, of the lab leak. But Dedkov said those two hypothesis were far down the list of likely sources.He suggested frozen products on which the virus was found were most likely contaminated by infected people. An infected person also likely brought and spread the virus at the Wuhan market associated with the outbreak, where some of the contaminated products were later found.“In general, all the conditions for the spread of infection were present at this market,” Dedkov said in an interview. “Therefore, most likely, there was a mass infection of people who were connected by location.”“At this point, there are no facts suggesting that there was a leak" from a lab, Dedkov said.“If suddenly scientific facts appear from somewhere, then accordingly, the priority of the version will change. But, at this particular moment, no.”Suspicions about political meddling have dogged the mission, and the international team leader — the WHO's Peter Ben Embarek — acknowledged in interviews last week that unspecified “pressures” might weigh on its members.Liang, in a Chinese newspaper interview, also bemoaned political pressure on the team.Delays in deploying the international team to China, repeated slippage in the timing of publication of the report, and rejiggering of the plans for it — an initial summary of findings was jettisoned as an idea — have only fanned speculation that the scientists have been steered by political authorities or others.“The last understanding we had was that it is expected to come out this week — we'll have to see if that actually happens,” the U.S. charge d'affaires in Geneva, Mark Cassayre, said on Wednesday. “We have a clear understanding that other studies will be required.”He said the U.S. was hopeful the report would be a “real step forward for the world understanding the origins of the virus, so that we can better prepare for future pandemics. That's really what this is about.”The WHO leadership, including Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, repeatedly praised the Chinese government's early response to the outbreak, though recordings of private meetings obtained by The Associated Press exposed how top WHO officials were frustrated at China's lack of cooperation.The international team was wholly reliant on data collected by Chinese scientists after the outbreak surfaced, and Dedkov called the visit to Wuhan an “analytical trip, mainly for the purpose of retrospective analysis in the sense that we studied only those facts that were obtained earlier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-report-4-theories-scientists-mull-clues-on-virus-origin-101616660807459.html
25-03-2021||World||Pakistan Interior ministry refuses to renew Nawaz Sharif's passport||Pakistan Interior Ministry on Wednesday decided not to renew the passport of former Prime Minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif who is currently residing in London.The interior ministry stated this in response to a query by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made on February 19 regarding the "request for issuance of new diplomatic passport by the former Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif", reported Dawn.Sharif's passport had expired in February of this year. Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had already announced in January that the PML-N supremo's passport would not be renewed as per instructions from Prime Minister Imran Khan.The letter by the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs turned down the request and stated that the renewal of Nawaz Sharif's passport would not be processed by the relevant authorities.The interior ministry stated that in order to return to Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif may apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD) from the Pakistan High Commission in the UK, and "the same may be issued once he produces prior bookings of travel to Pakistan through PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) only."The Ministry also said that Nawaz was declared a proclaimed offender by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a criminal appeal titled "Mian Nawaz Vs NAB", as well as Toshakhana Reference by an accountability court in Islamabad and declared absconder in reference in case of Mir Shakeelur Rehman by an accountability court in Lahore, reported Dawn."He being a fugitive of the law and absconder cannot seek any further relief unless he surrenders before the courts in Pakistan," the letter said.IHC had granted eight-week bail to Nawaz Sharif on October 29, 2019, and had allowed him to travel abroad for four weeks for medical treatment on November 16, 2019 order.As per the court directives, the duration could be extended based on medical reports. Meanwhile, Interior Ministry had asked for more information related to Nawaz's health, reported Dawn.Nawaz Sharif has been vocal about the misgovernance of PM Imran Khan and has held many virtual summits of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) criticising the incumbent government and had garnered the support of a large audience in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-interior-ministry-refuses-to-renew-nawaz-sharif-s-passport-101616654657131.html
25-03-2021||World||Biden eager to fix ‘broken’ immigration system: White House||President Joe Biden is keen that the US Congress should quickly fix America's "broken” immigration system, for which he has already sent in a legislation, the White House has said.In February, the Biden administration introduced an ambitious immigration bill in Congress which among other things proposes to eliminate the per-country cap for employment-based green cards.The US Citizenship Act of 2021 proposes a pathway to citizenship to 11 million undocumented workers, elimination of per country quota for employment-based green cards and work authorisation for dependents of H-1B foreign workers.“The president...believes that there should be faster processing, that our immigration system is broken at many levels and of the system and that he is eager for Congress to move forward with action there,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday at her daily news conference.She was responding to a question on the recent protest by Indian-American doctors who are seeking the elimination of the existing per country quota for Green Card, as a result of which the backlog for Indians now runs into several decades.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently.The bicameral immigration bill, if passed by both the chambers of the Congress House of Representatives and the Senate and signed into law by President Joe Biden, would bring citizenship to millions of foreign nationals, including undocumented workers and those who came to the country legally.The legislation would also benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian IT professionals and their families.Responding to another question on the inordinate delay in the issuance of employment authorisation card to H4 and L2 visa holders, a significant number of whom are Indian women, Psaki said that part of the reason the administration went to push for action on immigration on the Hill is to move forward with expediting the processing and doing that on several levels, including a number of the visas.“So, that's part of the reason why we think that’s such an important piece to move forward,” Psaki said.An H-4 visa is issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals.The Biden administration has taken several steps to address the problems related to legal immigrants.The citizenship bill sent by the White House to Congress includes providing new funding to the state and local governments, private organisations, educational institutions, community-based organisations, and not-for-profit organisations to expand programmes to promote integration and inclusion, increase English-language instruction, and provide assistance to individuals seeking to become citizens.This bill clears employment-based visa backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and eliminates per-country visa caps.The bill makes it easier for graduates of US universities with advanced STEM degrees to stay in the US; improves access to green cards for workers in lower-wage sectors; and eliminates other unnecessary hurdles for employment-based green cards.The bill provides dependents of H-1B visa holders work authorisation, and children are prevented from “aging out” of the system.The bill sent by the White House also creates a pilot programme to stimulate regional economic development, gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the authority to adjust green cards based on macroeconomic conditions, and incentivises higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American workers.It also requires that the DHS and the Department of Labour establish a commission involving labour, employer, and civil rights organisations to make recommendations for improving the employment verification process.Workers who suffer serious labour violations and cooperate with worker protection agencies will be granted greater access to U visa relief.The bill protects workers who are victims of workplace retaliation from deportation in order to allow labour agencies to interview these workers.It also protects migrant and seasonal workers, and increases penalties for employers who violate labour laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-eager-to-fix-broken-immigration-system-white-house-101616651012354.html
25-03-2021||World||Narendra Modi’s supporters in the US stem hostility in Chicago city council||The Chicago city council on Wednesday rejected a resolution to condemn the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the revocation of Kashmir’s special constitutional status, handing Indian-descent supporters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a first victory in a battle that had seemed largely skewed against him thus far.The Chicago council members turned down the resolution 26-18 with six abstentions.A similar resolution had been passed earlier by at least six city councils starting with Seattle in February 2020. Despite pushback from Indian-descent supporters of PM Modi, that legislation, or variations of it, passed in six other cities such as Cambridge in Massachusetts, St Paul in Minnesota, San Fransisco in California, Albany in New York, and Hamtramck in Michigan.“Dedication, talent, time, sweat and tears of sons and daughters of India won,” said Bharat Barai, an Indian-American physician who spearheaded the effort to defeat the resolution in the Chicago city council. Barai had also played a key role organising the 2-14 Madison Square Garden event for Modi on the latter’s first visit to the US after taking office.Unlike the pushback against other city council resolutions, the effort to defeat the Chicago legislative measure had the full backing of the Indian government. The Indian consulate general in Chicago reached out to several members of the city council, arguing, according to people familiar with these discussions, that India had a right to defend itself. Some council members, aldermen, had resisted the pitch from the Indian government, saying it amounted to interference in Chicago city’s affairs.On Wednesday evening, Modi supporters in the US hailed the vote as a major victory. “The efforts of the larger Indian-American community to defend their country of origin and expose the efforts of the opponents of India won the day,” said Darshan Soni, an activist.The resolution - titled “Recognition of India’s 72nd anniversary of Republic Day and call for condemnation of violence against certain castes and faith group” - was introduced in July 2020 in efforts launched by Modi detractors in several US cities.The proposed resolution that upset Indian-descent supporters of Modi included, “(Former) president (Donald) Trump’s bigoted policies within the US including discriminating on religious grounds, targeting vulnerable communities, stripping citizenship, fabricating crises and stoking hatred have been mirrored by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his… Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, and their alarming ideology that Hindus are racially and culturally superior to others.“Across the country, there has been a surge in the number of mobs lynching’s and violence towards minorities.”Also, the proposed resolution had sought to condemn the “the inherently discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which actively creates an unconstitutional, religion-based criteria to grant citizenship to select immigrants - the first instance of religion being used as a criterion for Indian citizenship; the CAA has already been used to threaten deportation for India’s 40,000 Rohingya refugees”.Chicago Tribune, a local news outlet, noted the contentious proceeding. “During an unusually long and intense council debate for a symbolic measure, some aldermen said they had received thousands of messages from both sides in recent months, most urging them to vote against it,” it said.Indian community leaders acknowledged swamping the offices of the aldermen with emails decrying the resolution as a part of their campaign, which they propose to scale up to the national level to replicate the success in Chicago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/narendra-modi-s-supporters-in-the-us-stem-hostility-in-chicago-city-council-101616651541864.html
25-03-2021||World||US surpasses 30 million Covid-19 cases amid vaccinations||The United States on Wednesday surpassed 30 million cases of Covid-19 even as the country is making progress on the number of vaccinations.While daily new infections have decreased significantly from their peak in January, new cases remain high at around 55,000 cases per day, while 1,000 people are dying every day despite a decline in casualties due to vaccinations, reported The Hill.Meanwhile, hundreds of spring breakers have been flocking to the streets, beaches and restaurants in Miami Beach in Florida, prompting health officials to urge people not to let down their guard.Health officials have also warned against states lifting coronavirus restrictions until a wider share of the population is vaccinated."When I'm often asked, 'Are we turning the corner?' my response is really more like, 'We are at the corner. Whether or not we're going to be turning that corner still remains to be seen,'" said Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, on Wednesday during a White House briefing."You've got to continue to do what we're doing: more vaccinations and continue to do public health measures until we actually do turn the corner," he added.The country is now vaccinating people at the pace of around 2.5 million shots every day, reported The Hill. 70 per cent of people aged 65 and above have received at least one shot, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Data.Experts say people should still wear masks when in public and avoid crowds and travel."I continue to be worried about the latest data and the apparent stall we are seeing in the trajectory of the pandemic... CDC is watching these numbers very closely. As I said on Monday, the decisions we make now will determine what the pandemic looks like in the days and weeks ahead," said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky on Wednesday.The US continues to remain the worst affected country by the coronavirus pandemic, with 30,009,771 total infections and 545,237 deaths so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surpasses-30-million-covid-19-cases-amid-vaccinations-101616650510567.html

25-03-2021||World||Myanmar anti-coup activists to hit streets in fresh protests after paralysing strike||Myanmar pro-democracy activists plan to resume street demonstrations on Thursday, a day after a nationwide silent strike saw businesses shut and people stay at home in protest against military rule in the Southeast Asian country.In a sign of further international pressure over a Feb. 1 coup, the United States is planning to impose sanctions on two conglomerates controlled by Myanmar's military, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Marking a switch in tactics by protesters, Wednesday's silent strike left normally bustling areas of commercial hubs like Yangon in the south and Monywa in central Myanmar deserted.While the scale of the street protests had been dropping in recent days, activists called for a big demonstration on Thursday."The strongest storm comes after the silence," protest leader Ei Thinzar Maung said in a social media post.Candle-lit vigils took place across Myanmar again overnight, photographs on social media showed, with some small early protests already starting on Thursday morning.In Thanlyin on the outskirts of Yangon protesters held up placards reading: "We don't accept military coup", while medical staff wearing white coats held a dawn march in the second city of Mandalay.At least 286 people have been killed as the security forces employ lethal force to quell unrest, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.Five more people were wounded overnight in Mandalay, Myanmar's second city, Myanmar Now media outlet reported.A 16-year-old man later died after being shot in the back, the outlet said.The funeral of a seven-year-old girl killed on Tuesday, the youngest known victim of the crackdown, took place on Wednesday in Mandalay.A spokesman for the military, which said on Tuesday 164 protesters had been killed, did not answer calls seeking comment.SINGAPORE FOREIGN MINISTER IN JAKARTAThe junta on Wednesday freed hundreds of people arrested in its crackdown on protests against the overthrow of the elected government of Aung Sang Suu Kyi.There was no word from authorities on how many prisoners were let out, but AAPP said 628 people were released after more than 2,900 had been arrested since the coup.The junta has faced international condemnation for staging the coup that halted Myanmar's slow transition to democracy and for its deadly suppression of dissent.It has tried to justify the takeover by saying a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was fraudulent - an accusation the electoral commission has rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency.The European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Monday against individuals involved in the coup and the repression of the demonstrators.Meanwhile, a move by the U.S. Treasury to blacklist two conglomerates controlled by the military - Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) - and freeze any assets they hold in the United States could come as early as Thursday, sources said.The military controls vast swathes of Myanmar’s economy through the holding firms and their subsidiaries.Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, has been in detention since the coup and faces charges that her lawyer says have been cooked up to discredit her.Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan is due to meet his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi in Jakarta on a trip starting on Thursday that is expected to include discussions on Myanmar.Malaysia and Indonesia are seeking an urgent meeting of Southeast Asia's ASEAN regional grouping, of which Myanmar is a member to discuss the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-anti-coup-activists-to-hit-streets-in-fresh-protests-after-paralysing-strike-101616649375542.html

Both Moscow and Seoul remain committed to an early resumption of the negotiation process between the parties involved in the interests of a lasting resolution of the entire range of issues in the region," Lavrov said after talks with his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-yong, Sputnik reported.Lavrov also mentioned that Northeast Asia, including the Korean parties, must abandon the arms race in the region."We emphasized the importance of efforts to maintain a peaceful and stable situation in Northeast Asia, including, of course, the Korean Peninsula, which implies the refusal of the parties to continue the arms race and to build up military activity in any form," said Lavrov, who is on a two-day visit to Seoul, reported Sputnik."I highly appreciate that we are steadily developing the multifaceted bilateral relations after the establishment of diplomatic contacts in 1990," Chung added.South Korean Foreign Minister also pointed out, despite the C-19 pandemic, South Korea remained an important economic partner of Russia, the second-biggest one in the Far East."In 2019, the [bilateral] trade reached $22.3 billion and the inter-human contacts became the most intensive in the history of the Korea-Russian relations. Although the pandemic urges us to change the usual format of cooperation, I believe that at such moments we must not reduce our contacts and continue the close cooperation to boost the inter-human contacts," Chung said.On Thursday, North Korea test-fired two ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan, sparking concern in South Korea and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-seoul-committed-to-resume-talks-on-korean-peninsula-issues-says-lavrov-101616649120096.html
25-03-2021||World||North Korea test-fires ballistic missiles in message to US||North Korea on Thursday test-fired its first ballistic missiles since President Joe Biden took office, as it expands its military capabilities and increases pressure on Washington while nuclear negotiations remain stalled.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the launches threaten “peace and safety in Japan and the region,” and that Tokyo will closely coordinate with Washington and Seoul on the North’s testing activities.South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong, after meeting his Russian counterpart in Seoul, expressed “deep concern” over the launches and urged the North to uphold its commitments for peace. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called for a swift resumption of dialogue to resolve the standoff with North Korea.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the two short-range missiles were fired at 7:06 a.m. and 7:25 a.m. from an area on the North’s eastern coast and flew 450 kilometers (279 miles) on an apogee of 60 kilometers (37 miles) before landing in the sea. It said South Korea’s military has stepped up monitoring in case of “further provocations” from the North.A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military observations, matched the information from South Korea’s military, saying that initial assessments suggest the North fired two short-range ballistic missiles.“This activity highlights the threat that North Korea’s illicit weapons program poses to its neighbours and the international community,” said US Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson Capt. Mike Kafka.The launches came a day after US and South Korean officials said the North fired short-range weapons presumed to be cruise missiles into its western sea over the weekend.North Korea has a history of testing new US administrations with missile launches and other provocations aimed at forcing the Americans back to the negotiating table.Still, Thursday’s launches were a measured provocation compared to the nuclear and intercontinental missile tests in 2017 that inspired war fears before the North shifted toward diplomacy with the Trump administration in 2018.Analysts say that the North would gradually dial up its weapons displays to increase its bargaining power as it angles to get back into stalled talks aimed at leveraging nuclear weapons for badly needed economic benefits.It’s unclear how the Biden administration would respond before it completes its policy review on North Korea in the coming weeks.The negotiations over the North’s nuclear program faltered after the collapse of Kim Jong Un’s second summit with President Donald Trump in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of their nuclear capabilities.Since Trump’s first meeting with Kim in 2018, the North has not conducted nuclear or long-range missile tests, although analysts believe they have pressed ahead with their programs on both.The North has continued short- and medium range missile testing during its suspension of nuclear and long-range tests, expanding its ability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including US bases there.Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from South Korea’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the flight data released by South Korea's military suggests the North possibly tested a new solid-fuel system modeled after Russia’s 9K720 Iskander mobile ballistic missiles.These missiles, which analysts see as potentially nuclear capable, are designed to be highly maneuverable and travel on lower trajectories compared to most other ballistic weapons.Kim said it was also possible that the North tested its new multiple rocket launchers or another solid-fuel ballistic system that outwardly resembles the US MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System.The North had conducted at least 16 launches of the new short-range weapons since they were first revealed in 2019.North Korea has so far ignored the Biden administration’s efforts to reach out, saying it won’t engage in meaningful talks unless Washington abandons its “hostile” policies.Kim Jong Un’s powerful sister last week berated the United States over its latest round of combined military exercises with South Korea that ended earlier this month, describing the drills as an invasion rehearsal and warned Washington to “refrain from causing a stink” if it wants to “sleep in peace” for the next four years.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the North’s short-range tests on Sunday were its first missile firings since April 2020. President Joe Biden played down those launches, telling reporters, “There’s no new wrinkle in what they did.”While Kim has vowed to strengthen his nuclear weapons program in recent speeches, he also tried to give the new US administration an opening by saying that the fate of their relations depends on Washington.During his visit to Seoul last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sternly criticised North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and human rights record and pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince the North to denuclearize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-test-fires-ballistic-missiles-in-message-to-us-101616648855832.html
25-03-2021||World||In a first for US, Senate confirms transgender doctor for key post||Voting mostly along party lines, the US Senate has confirmed former Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine to be the nation’s assistant secretary of health. She is the first openly transgender federal official to win Senate confirmation.The final vote Wednesday was 52-48. Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in supporting Levine.Levine had been serving as Pennsylvania’s top health official since 2017, and emerged as the public face of the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She is expected to oversee Health and Human Services offices and programs across the US.President Joe Biden cited Levine’s experience when he nominated her in January.Levine “will bring the steady leadership and essential expertise we need to get people through this pandemic — no matter their zip code, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability,” Biden said.Transgender-rights activists have hailed Levine’s appointment as a historic breakthrough. Few trans people have ever held high-level offices at the federal or state level.However, the confirmation vote came at a challenging moment for the transgender-rights movement as legislatures across the US. — primarily those under Republican control — are considering an unprecedented wave of bills targeting trans young people.One type of bill, introduced in at least 25 states, seeks to ban trans girls and young women from participating in female scholastic sports.One such measure already has been signed into law by Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, and similar measures have been sent to the governors in Tennessee, Arkansas and South Dakota.Another variety of bill, introduced in at least 17 states, seeks to outlaw or restrict certain types of medical care for transgender youths. None of these measures has yet won final approval.Issues related to transgender rights also are a major factor in Republican opposition to the proposed Equality Act, which would extend federal civil rights protections to LGBTQ people across the US. The measure has passed the Democratic-led House but likely needs some GOP votes to prevail in the Senate.Former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, president of the LGBTQ Victory Institute, alluded to those developments as she welcomed the Senate's vote on Levine.“At a time when hateful politicians are weaponizing trans lives for their own perceived political gain, Dr. Levine’s confirmation lends focus to the contributions trans people make to our nation,” said Parker, whose organization recruits and supports LGBTQ political candidates.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who voted no, had confronted Levine about medical treatments for transgender young people — include hormone treatment and puberty blockers — during her confirmation hearing Feb. 25.“Do you believe that minors are capable of making such a life-changing decision as changing one’s sex?” Paul asked.Levine replied that transgender medicine “is a very complex and nuanced field with robust research and standards of care” and said she would welcome discussing the issues with him.In the past, Levine has asserted that hormone therapy and puberty-blocking drugs can be valuable medical tools in sparing some transgender youth from mental distress and possible suicide risk.The confirmation vote was assailed by the conservative Family Research Council, which contended that Levine, in addition to her stance on transgender medical care, had supported “a variety of pro-abortion and anti-religious freedom proposals” while serving as Pennsylvania's health secretary.“Levine may be the most extreme radical ever confirmed by the Senate," said Travis Weber, the council's vice president for policy and government affairs.A pediatrician and former Pennsylvania physician general, Levine was appointed as Pennsylvania’s health secretary by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf in 2017. She won confirmation by the Republican-majority Pennsylvania Senate.However, Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, voted against Levine’s confirmation Wednesday.“In Pennsylvania, the pandemic struck seniors in nursing homes disproportionately hard compared to other states,” Toomey said. “This was due in part to poor decisions and oversight by Dr. Levine and the Wolf administration.”He also said an extended lockdown advocated by Levine “was excessive, arbitrary in nature, and has led to a slower recovery.”A graduate of Harvard and of Tulane Medical School, Levine is president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. She’s written in the past on the opioid crisis, medical marijuana, adolescent medicine, eating disorders and LGBTQ medicine.Praise for her accomplishments and her handling of the pandemic have coincided with a steady stream of vitriol directed at at her on social media.As reported Tuesday by the Associated Press, Levine was among the targets of a private Facebook group called the Pittsburgh Area Police Breakroom whose participants included many current and retired police officers.Dozens of group members fueled days of transphobic posts about Levine for her role in statewide social-distancing mandates to stop the spread of Covid-19.“Someone needs to shoot this thing!!” one retired officer wrote.In January, a Pennsylvania legislator shared on Facebook an image mocking Levine’s appearance, then offered a general apology.State Rep. Jeff Pyle, a Republican, said on Facebook that he “had no idea” the post mocking Levine “would be … received as poorly as it was” but that “tens of thousands of heated emails assured me it was.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-for-us-senate-confirms-transgender-doctor-for-key-post-101616648920861.html
25-03-2021||World||Kamala Harris to tackle migrant crisis at Mexico border||US President Joe Biden has handed vice-president Kamala Harris her biggest challenge of their administration: the developing immigration crisis at the southern border.“I’ve asked her, the VP, today - because she’s the most qualified person to do it - to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help - are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,” Biden said at the White House.In response, Harris said, “Thank you, Mr President and for having the confidence in me. And there’s no question that this is a challenging situation.”There have been reports of a surge of undocumented migrants, even unaccompanied children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador - the so-called Northern Triangle countries - arriving up at the Mexican border with the United States seeking entry.Unlike the Trump administration that had turned away these children, sparking international outrage, the Biden administration is allowing them entry.Biden pushed back against the growing narrative of an immigration crisis, saying “this new surge we’re dealing with now started with the last administration”. But, he added, his administration will deal with it.Harris will lead that effort - working with the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to persuade them to keep their people from heading for the US border, traversing across Mexico - through diplomacy, backed with US aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-tackle-migrant-crisis-at-mexico-border-101616648721685.html
25-03-2021||World||North Korea missile launch tests Biden administration, Tokyo Olympics||North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into the sea near Japan on Thursday, Japan's prime minister said, fuelling tension ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and ramping up pressure on the Biden administration as it finalises its North Korea policy.The missile launches highlight the threat North Korea's illicit weapons programme poses to its neighbours and the international community, the United States military's Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement.The command said it was monitoring the situation and consulting allies.Japan lodged a formal protest through its embassy in China and said the test threatened peace and safety in the region, while South Korea's National Security Council expressed deep concern.Japan's coastguard said the first missile was detected soon after 7am and flew about 420 km (260 miles), followed by a second 20 minutes later that flew about 430 km (270 miles), indicating the missiles were short-range weapons.North Korea has previously test-fired missiles over Japan that were able to carry nuclear warheads and reach anywhere in the United States."The first launch in just less than a year represents a threat to peace and stability in Japan and the region and violates UN resolutions," Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in comments aired by public broadcaster NHK.The launches coincided with the start of the Olympic torch relay in Japan on Thursday, beginning a four-month countdown to the summer Games in Tokyo which were delayed from 2020 because of the coronavirus.Suga said he would ensure a safe and secure Olympics and "thoroughly discuss" North Korea issues, including the launches, with US President Joe Biden during his visit to Washington next month.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier reported at least two "unidentified projectiles" were fired into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan from North Korea's east coast.South Korean and US intelligence agencies were analysing the data of the launch for additional information, the JCS said in a statement.South Korea's presidential Blue House will convene an emergency meeting of the national security council to discuss the launches.There was no official comment from the White House or State Department on the test.US POLICY CHALLENGENorth Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon or its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, ahead of an historic meeting between leader Kim Jong Un and former US President Donald Trump in 2018.The Biden administration is in the "final stages" of reviewing its North Korea policy, senior US officials told Reuters this week.Analysts have noted a change in wording from the previous administration, emphasising the "denuclearisation of North Korea", rather than the whole peninsula - a more unilateral position likely to be anathema to Pyongyang.Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the North Korea policy review would come within the context of the administration's strategy on China, North Korea's only major ally."North Korea’s military activities after reaffirming ties with Beijing raise questions about how China is complicit in sanctions evasion and may be enabling the Kim regime's threats to the region. This will increase calls in the US and elsewhere to sanction Chinese firms involved in illicit trade," he said.'STEP UP'Over the weekend North Korea fired two short-range cruise missiles, US and South Korean officials said, but Biden brushed off those tests as "business as usual" and officials in Washington said they were still open to dialogue with Pyongyang.Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, said short-range ballistic missile tests would be a "step up" from the weekend test, and allow North Korea to improve its technology and send a proportionate response to recent US-South Korea military drills.The test launches should not torpedo diplomatic efforts but were a reminder of the cost of the failure to secure a deal with Pyongyang, he said."Every day that passes without a deal that tries to reduce the risks posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile arsenal is a day that it gets bigger and badder," Narang said.Biden's diplomatic overtures to North Korea have gone unanswered, and the North said it would not engage until the United States dropped hostile policies, including carrying out military exercises with South Korea.North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programmes throughout 2020 in violation of UN sanctions dating back to 2006, helping fund them with about $300 million stolen through cyber hacks, according to independent UN sanctions monitors.In early 2018, North Korea announced a moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and ICBMs, though it says it no longer feels bound by that after negotiations with the Trump administration faltered.It has tested a number of new short-range missiles that can threaten South Korea and the 28,500 US troops stationed there, most recently in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-missile-launch-tests-biden-administration-tokyo-olympics-101616647707642.html

The United States hit the same milestone on December 14, but it has a larger population.Wednesday's coronavirus figures from the Brazilian health ministry added another 2,009 deaths to the country's tally, which local media say is an undercount.On Tuesday, Brazil hit a single-day record of 3,251 Covid-19 deaths and authorities fear that April could be as grim as March in the country's overwhelmed hospitals.Brazil added 1,00,000 deaths to its tally in only 75 days, a spike health experts have blamed on a lack of political coordination, new variants that spread more easily and a disregard for health protocols in many parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-second-nation-to-top-3-00-000-covid-19-deaths-101616636817849.html

25-03-2021||World||Harris to lead efforts with Mexico, Central America, to stem migrant flow||President Joe Biden on Wednesday named Vice President Kamala Harris to lead US efforts with Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle countries to try to stem the flow of migration to the United States.Biden's decision gives a high-profile assignment to his vice president, a daughter of immigrants who has forged a reputation as an ally of immigration advocates. As California attorney general, Harris had to deal with a major influx of unaccompanied minors at the state's border with Mexico in 2014.It is a task that carries political risks for Harris, a potential future presidential candidate. Border woes have been an intractable problem for multiple presidents.Biden served in a similar role for then-President Barack Obama when he was vice president. By assigning her to handling diplomatic efforts with Central America, Biden is elevating the migration issue as a top priority.Just two months into office, Biden is struggling to get a handle on a burgeoning migration challenge along the U.S. border with Mexico - a problem the Democrat blamed on "the somewhat draconian" policies of his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, who left office with his border wall incomplete.Biden said the United States was going to need help from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and that Harris "agreed to lead our diplomatic efforts and work with those countries.""The best way to keep people from coming is to keep them from wanting to leave," Biden said, listing gang violence, drug-trafficking cartels, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes as factors spurring migration.Harris said the job "will not be easy, but it is important work, it is work that we demand as a people of our country."U.S. officials are battling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in jail-like border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.Senior administration officials said Harris' focus would be on regional solutions and working with leaders in the region to make it safer for people to remain in their home countries and make asylum requests there."We're going to look at the possibility for people in their home countries in the Northern Triangle to have a predictable, regular process of seeking asylum there so they don’t have to take this phenomenally dangerous journey or, worse yet, send their children unaccompanied," said one senior official who briefed reporters on the Harris move.Harris is expected to travel to the region at some point, but no trips are planned yet, another official said. Phone calls with leaders in the region are expected as well.Recycled planEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele criticized the U.S. focus on Northern Triangle countries in a tweet on Wednesday, apparently seeking to decouple his country from Honduras and Guatemala in U.S. policy.Bukele retweeted a chart with data indicating a significant decrease in the amount of unaccompanied children from El Salvador taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection since 2020, compared with previous years."If the United States wants to seriously address immigration at the southern border, they should really drop the 'Northern Triangle' concept," Bukele tweeted. "A recycled plan that did not work in 2014 will not work now."Since taking office in January, Harris has been carving out a role for herself as a promoter of Biden’s U.S. coronavirus relief bill, the first major legislation the president signed into law. She has also taken an active role in encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.While she has not had a specific policy portfolio until now, she has had calls with foreign leaders, including those of allies such as France and Israel. Sergio Gonzales, executive director of the Immigration Hub, a migration advocacy group, welcomed Harris' appointment, saying it "underscores the seriousness of the Biden-Harris White House to tackle every aspect of our broken immigration system."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-to-lead-efforts-with-mexico-central-america-to-stem-migrant-flow-101616631647263.html

25-03-2021||World||Five things to watch as Facebook, Google, Twitter CEOs testify in Congress||The CEOs of Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, and Twitter testify before Congress on Thursday for the first time since pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, an attack in which critics say social media played a crucial role.Here are five things to watch for in the testimony of Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc's Jack Dorsey before two subcommittees of the Energy and Commerce Committee:ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE CAPITOL VIOLENCEAfter the November presidential election, false narratives about voting fraud on social media and elsewhere helped to spur supporters of former President Donald Trump to storm the Capitol, the seat of US government, on Jan. 6. Lawmakers will likely ask about social media's role in inciting the violence.The non-profit Avaaz said in a new report this week that it had identified 267 Facebook pages and groups - including "Stop the Steal" groups - with some 32 million followers that spread content glorifying violence late last year. Facebook took issue with the report, it said.SHOULD SECTION 230 BE CHANGED?The tech platforms have long lobbied to protect Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability over user content, while some Republicans have advocated that it be scrapped and several bipartisan proposals have suggested revising it.Facebook's Zuckerberg suggested in written testimony released on Wednesday that it be changed to give platforms immunity from liability if they follow best practices for removing damaging material from their platforms.Google's Pichai and Twitter's Dorsey proposed approaches such as developing content policies that are transparent and giving users ways to appeal decisions.HAS TRUMP TWEETED FOR THE LAST TIME?Republican lawmakers were angered by the decisions to suspend Trump from Facebook and Twitter in the waning days of his administration, and what they see as a general stifling of conservative voices.Republicans may pressure the CEOs to reverse course. Or they may decide that the suspensions are no big deal since Trump has apparently decided to launch his own platform in coming months.A PANDEMIC OF MISINFORMATIONLawmakers have been aggravated by widespread misinformation online about Covid-19, including how serious and real the pandemic is, bogus treatments for the coronavirus and whether vaccines to inoculate people against it are safe.Facebook said recently that it removed more than 12 million pieces of content about Covid-19 and vaccines that global health experts flagged as misinformation.Still, the Center for Countering Digital Hate said in a report this week that all three platforms had failed to satisfactorily enforce their vaccine misinformation policies and attorneys general for 12 states said Facebook and Twitter needed to do more to combat the problem.WHAT ARE PLATFORMS DOING TO STOP MISINFORMATION?The platforms have invested in content moderation aimed at curbing misinformation and introduced a flurry of new rules in recent months.Zuckerberg in his testimony will talk about its third-party fact-checking network and how Facebook promotes authoritative information. He will also continue to emphasize that Facebook is not about political content for most users. Dorsey will talk about Twitter's misinformation policies and plans, such as its fact-checking experiment Birdwatch.Pichai in written testimony on Wednesday also listed actions taken by Google after Jan. 6, such as giving authoritative news sources a higher profile.Lawmakers may ask the platforms whether actions after the assault on Congress were too little, too late.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-things-to-watch-as-facebook-google-twitter-ceos-testify-in-congress-101616632445374.html
25-03-2021||World||A $60 billion US stimulus windfall is heading China’s way||David Ni is expecting a great year for his Chinese car-wheels business, thanks to the $1.9 trillion boost President Joe Biden just gave to the US economy.Americans flush with $1,400 stimulus checks mean “demand in the US is rampant,” said Ni, whose Jiangsu Siborui Import and Export Co., headquartered in Nanjing, buys high-end aluminum alloy car wheels from Chinese producers and sells them to retailers in the US.“Citizens get cash and they jump into shopping,” he said, predicting his sales will surge by more than 30% this year.The US fiscal boost will bring huge spillovers for the global economy, especially China, the world’s biggest exporter. About $360bn of the stimulus package will be spent on imports, according to Allianz SE, with Chinese exports likely to increase by $60 billion over 2021-2022 as Americans snap up computers, household equipment and clothing.But it also means rising prices for Chinese-made goods that have already started to tick up and a possible worsening in tensions with the U.S. over trade imbalances.While US neighbors Canada and Mexico will see the biggest impact relative to the size of their economies, the stimulus package could increase China’s gross domestic product by 0.5% over the next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Bloomberg Economics estimates that a 1% boost to US demand adds about 0.08% to China’s GDP.That means the economy could expand 9% this year, according to UBS AG, which upgraded its forecast for China’s export growth in 2021 to 16%, compared with 3.6% last year. The export boost would give businesses room to spend on expanding capacity, allowing China to maintain its high levels of investment even as state spending on infrastructure slows, according to chief China economist Wang Tao. The government’s official GDP growth target for this year is “above 6%.”There’s already concerns in the US that the stimulus and expected economic rebound this year could lead to faster inflation there, with Treasury yields surging in recent weeks. An increase in imports from China combined with the recent rebound in Chinese factory prices mean American consumers could soon be paying more for their goods too.Ni said Chinese wheel producers are raising prices because of shipping costs near record highs and the recent rise in metal costs.“Southeast Asia manufacturing has not yet recovered -- the orders will fall on Chinese exporters,” he said. “Consumer prices in the U.S. are unavoidably rising.”Protectionist MovesThe trade boom could also mean more effort from the US to curb imports in the longer term in order to ease the trade imbalance with China, a source of tension in Washington for years.“Given America’s history, it is easy to envisage that protectionist sentiment, including on currencies, could be exacerbated,” Mark Sobel, a former career Treasury official, wrote in a commentary last week. “Even if the widening current account deficit is largely made in the U.S., history shows that won’t stop American finger pointing.”Stronger export growth will also slow Beijing’s efforts to rebalance the economy to make it more reliant on domestic consumption and less on industrial production. The government has been saying it wants to do this for several years, but little progress has been made and the process was actually set back last year when consumer spending collapsed.“I don’t feel that the relatively weak domestic consumption is bothering the policy makers that much. It’s similar to last year,” said Chen Long, an economist at Beijing-based consultancy Plenum. “I don’t think there’s discussion about re-balancing at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-60-billion-us-stimulus-windfall-is-heading-china-s-way-101616631611068.html
25-03-2021||World||In US, top court mulls police power to enter homes without warrant||The Supreme Court on Wednesday weighed when police can enter homes without a warrant, with the justices making up scenarios involving elderly neighbors, a cat in a tree, a mask-less social gathering and even a Van Gogh painting to help them resolve the case.While some of the examples were lighthearted, the case concerned a man whose wife was worried that he might kill himself. Police entered his Rhode Island home without a warrant and seized two handguns. The man said a ruling against him would give police a blank check to enter homes without a warrant if they were performing a “community caretaking” function.During the arguments, it seemed clear both liberal and conservative justices believe police should be able to enter a home in limited circumstances, though they worried about how to ensure police aren't given too much leeway. Using hypothetical scenarios is one way the justices test the boundaries of various legal theories, and they came up with many Wednesday.Chief Justice John Roberts asked whether police officers could enter the home of an elderly woman if they were told she was never late but missed a dinner date with neighbors and wasn't answering her phone.“The police are violating the Constitution because they walk in the back door to make sure she's not lying on the floor?” he said skeptically during 90 minutes of arguments the court heard by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic. Later, Roberts wanted to know whether officers could enter a fenced backyard to get a cat out of a tree if the cat's owners were away or whether they could go into a home to save a Van Gogh painting if water was dripping on the artwork.Other justices also tested the potential limits on police's authority. Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked whether, in a town with a high rate of coronavirus infections, police could enter a home if they saw through the window “a lot of people gathered together that are not wearing masks.”Justice Samuel Alito said what troubles people about a “caretaking exception” is that “doesn't seem to have any clear boundaries.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether officers in the case at hand could have taken “not just the gun but any bat, knife, anything else that in their judgment this man could have used" to kill himself.Prior court decisions allow police to enter a home without a warrant in emergencies. Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested allowing police warrantless entry into homes for community caretaking is most likely to be relevant in two scenarios: when an elderly person hasn't been heard from and where there are potential suicide concerns. He suggested he was worried about police officers “backing away from going into houses” in those scenarios.The case heard by the justices involved a Rhode Island couple, Edward and Kim Caniglia. In 2015, during an argument in their home in Cranston, Edward Caniglia put a gun on their home's dining room table and told his wife: "Why don’t you just shoot me and get me out of my misery?"The weapon turned out to be unloaded, and Kim Caniglia ultimately spent the night at a motel. But she called police the next day when her husband didn't answer her phone call. She told police she thought he might be suicidal.Police spoke with Edward Caniglia at his home and he told officers he was fine. But he agreed to go to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, his lawyers say, after being promised that his two handguns wouldn't be seized if he did. After an evaluation, he was discharged, but while he was away, police entered his home without a warrant and took his guns anyway. The weapons were only returned after he sued.The Biden administration is urging the court to side with the officers.The case is Caniglia v. Strom, 20-157.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-top-court-mulls-police-power-to-enter-homes-without-warrant-101616630793380.html

But since Johnson was elected in December 2019, the Union Jack has become increasingly visible — an ever-present backdrop to interviews by government ministers from their offices or homes.Its increased prominence is part of a government campaign to stress the unity of the United Kingdom at a time when support for Scottish independence is growing. The red, white and blue Union flag combines the emblems of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which make up the United Kingdom along with Wales.Some Britons, especially those on the left, are uncomfortable with visible displays of patriotism, or with the flag's associations with the British Empire and Brexit.Under the new rules, any government building wishing to fly the European Union flag will need special permission. The government says that regulations “to allow the EU flag to be flown on public buildings without acquiring planning permission will also be removed following the U.K.’s departure from the European Union,” which became final at the end of 2020.The new fly-the-flag guidance won’t apply in Northern Ireland, where displaying British and Irish flags is highly sensitive and governed by complex rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flying-the-flag-uk-govt-tells-ministries-to-wave-union-jack-101616617009789.html
25-03-2021||World||Cooperation in culture, health, railways, on Modi’s agenda on Bangladesh visit||India and Bangladesh will sign several agreements and unveil new measures to boost people-to-people contacts during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit this week, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Wednesday.Modi is set to participate with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina in the neighbouring country’s National Day celebrations on Friday. This is Modi’s first foreign visit since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, and he will also deliver a speech at the event at the national parade ground in Dhaka.Though Bangladesh has invited four heads of state and government from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives to join the celebrations marking 50 years of its independence, Modi will be the only leader to join the main celebrations on March 26.“As a reflection of the growing cooperation, both sides will sign a range of agreements during the prime minister’s visit. These agreements will cover a number of areas of our cooperation,” Shringla told a media briefing ahead of the visit.Some of the agreements will cover areas such as disaster management, trade and oceanography. The two sides will also be looking at a comprehensive trade-related agreement, and continuing discussions on a comprehensive economic partnership.“We will also have new announcements covering cooperation in areas of culture, preservation of the spirit of 1971, health, railways, education, border development, power cooperation and start-ups,” Shringla said.The visit will especially reflect the India-Bangladesh relationship based on strong political and people-to-people ties, which has “facilitated a partnership marked by conversations and discussions in candour, friendship and comfort”, he added.Modi will visit the mausoleum of “Bangabandhu” Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation, at Tungipara in Gopalganj district, thus becoming the first Indian dignitary to visit the site, Shringla said.The Indian premier is also set to visit two Hindu temples outside Dhaka – the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Satkhira and the Matua temple in Orakandi – on March 27. These temples are revered by the Matua community, a large number of whom live in West Bengal.“This visit will be of very special significance and will serve to highlight our unique and special ties, which reinforce our comprehensive strategic partnership with Bangladesh,” Shringla said. Bangladesh is also at the “intersection” of India’s “Neighbourhood First” and “Act East” polices and the scene of India’s largest visa operation, he added.Besides the National Day celebrations, Modi is visiting at a time when Bangladesh is celebrating Mujib Borsho, the birth centenary of Rahman, and the golden jubilee of diplomatic ties.Modi will meet Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid and will hold restricted and delegation-level talks with Hasina. He will also interact with representatives of the country’s 14-party ruling alliance, opposition leaders, freedom fighters and youth leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cooperation-in-culture-health-railways-education-on-pm-modi-s-agenda-on-visit-to-bangladesh-101616615240668.html
25-03-2021||World||Two Indian entries in North America’s biggest documentary film festival||Two Indian entries focusing on women will be among those screened at the 2021 edition of North America’s biggest documentary film festival, Hot Docs. The 12-day festival will commence on April 29. Among the highlights will be a 93-minute feature Writing with Fire. The documentary profiles a newspaper in rural Uttar Pradesh, Khabar Lahariya, which is run entirely by a team of Dalit women. The documentary also highlights the transition of the newspaper from print to digital. Hot Docs programmer Myrocia Watamaniuk, said that the documentary Khabar Lahariya portrays how “these reporters know they are changing perceptions of what women dare to do while protecting democracy through journalism”. It’s directed and produced by Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh. The other Indian entry in the festival, Testimony of Ana, is a 24-minute short feature directed by Sachin Dheeraj Mudigonda. According to programmer Angie Driscoll, the story is about an “adivasi woman, accused of witchcraft by her neighbours in rural India, uses faith and perseverance to survive attacks”. The festival will begin with the screening of A.rtificial I.mmortality from Canadian director Ann Shin. Covering the philosophical and ethical questions relating to the evolution of technology, it “reveals how our memories can be digitised and uploaded into digital clones, preserving our personality and spirit without the limitations of a physical body”, according to a statement from Hot Docs. The 2020 edition of the festival was disrupted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada and was postponed to May and then held virtually. A year later, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to affect the world, the 2021 Hot Docs will be held completely online. Hot Docs received nearly 2,300 submissions of which 219 documentaries from 66 countries were selected for the festival. The films fall into 12 categories including Special Presentations, International Spectrum and World Showcase and half the directors are women. “Documentaries are vitally important in helping us understand the world we live in, and to build bridges of understanding across cultural, social and political divides, particularly at this unprecedented moment in time,” Hot Docs’ director of programming, Shane Smith said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-indian-entries-in-north-america-s-biggest-documentary-film-festival-101616607858066.html
25-03-2021||World||India, US to resume homeland security dialogue||India and the US on Tuesday announced they will re-establish the Homeland Security Dialogue focused on issues such as cybersecurity, emerging technology, and violent extremism.The announcement was made after a discussion between US secretary for homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas and Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu.The two officials “agreed to re-establish the US-India Homeland Security Dialogue and to discuss important issues such as cybersecurity, emerging technology and addressing violent extremism”, the department of homeland security said in a readout of their discussion.The first round of the re-started dialogue is expected to take place later in the year, according to people familiar with the discussions.The two countries had welcomed efforts to “reinvigorate” the dialogue -- between the US Department of Homeland Security and the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs -- at the 2+2 dialogue of the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries held in New Delhi last October.An initiative of the Obama administration, the first India-US Homeland Security Dialogue was held in May 2011. The then secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, travelled to India to take part in the dialogue with her then Indian counterpart home minister P Chidambaram. The second India-US Homeland Security Dialogue was held in Washington DC in 2013 between Napolitano and the then home minister Sushilkumar Shinde.Though working groups set up as part of the dialogue continued to engage on several areas of mutual concern and issues, the dialogue at the ministerial level were not scheduled after 2013. Meetings at the ministerial level were also not held during the administration of President Donald Trump, from 2017 to January 2021. The people cited above said it wasn’t for lack of interest.Mayorkas and Sandhu also discussed “the positive engagement “ that has already taken place between the two countries since President Joe Biden took office, including the first summit-level meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, that comprises the US, India, Japan and Australia.Increased cooperation among the four countries on emerging technology was one of the key outcomes of the Quad Summit, held virtually on March 12. The initiative is to be spearheaded by the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group, one of the three working groups announced by the four leaders (the two others are focused on Covid-19 vaccine distribution and climate crisis).Mayorkas and Sandhu also took stock of other areas of interest such as “the important contributions of students and entrepreneurs that have made both countries stronger”.Richard Rossow, the India chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said, “The Homeland Security Dialogue is quite important. The United States and India both have shared concerns about terrorism. And some of the terror groups are the same. Having open lines of communications and rapport between our leading officials can ensure better coordination, keeping citizens from both nations safer.“Some emerging areas of concern require regular consultations. For example, both nations are being regularly targeted with cyber-attacks. Sharing information on sources of these attacks, the tactics, and potential countermeasures will be very helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-to-resume-homeland-security-dialogue-101616561822119.html
