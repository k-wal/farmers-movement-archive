31-03-2021||World||Now the hard part: Biden tax hikes face hurdles in Congress||US President Joe Biden's plan to pay for his $2 trillion infrastructure plan with higher corporate taxes faces hurdles in Congress from Republicans who say it will kill jobs and some of his fellow Democrats who want a bigger write-off for state and local taxes.The plan, which Biden will unveil at an event in Pittsburgh later on Wednesday, would hike the US corporate tax rate to 28%, from its current 21%, to secure more revenue from corporations that have used offshore tax shelters and other measures to reduce their tax burdens."President Biden's reform will reverse this damage and fundamentally reform the way the tax code treats the largest corporations," the White House said earlier as it released details of the plan.The Biden tax provisions quickly came under fire from American business interests and Republicans on a key tax committee in the US House of Representatives."The proposal is dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure," the US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that warned the tax hikes would "slow the economic recovery and make the US less competitive globally."Unveiled along with Biden's infrastructure plan, the tax provisions would roll back many of former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy.Biden's overall infrastructure plan charts a dramatic shift in the direction of the US economy, with investments in traditional projects like roads and bridges along with climate change and human services like elder care.The president hopes to draw bipartisan support from Republicans in Congress but will need solid backing from Democrats in the Senate and the House, if Republicans uniformly reject the legislation as they did his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.But some moderate Democrats hope to reverse Trump's cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, which is felt most acutely in Northeastern states with higher taxes."We say, no SALT, no deal," three House Democrats from New York and New Jersey said this week.Democrats control the House by a margin of 219 to 211, so they will need to stay united if no Republicans support the plan. The party has not yet decided how to shepherd the package through Congress, a House Democratic aide said.Republicans on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee decried the initiative in a pre-dawn statement as "a series of job-killing tax hikes" that would saddle American companies with a higher tax rate that their competitors in "Communist China."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-the-hard-part-biden-tax-hikes-face-hurdles-in-congress-101617211698291.html
31-03-2021||World||Series of attacks in Afghanistan kill 4, including religious scholar||A series of bombings and shootings in Afghanistan killed at least four people on Wednesday, including a religious leader and an army officer, officials said.In one of the attacks, in northern Takhar province, an explosion targeted targeted the vehicle of Mawlavi Abdul Samad Mohammadi, the head of the province's Ulema Council, the top religious body in the area.Khalil Aser, spokesman for the provincial police chief, said the blast took place in the provincial capital of Taleqan and was caused by a so-called sticky bomb attached to the cleric's car. The cleric was returning home from attending a graduation ceremony. Three people were also wounded in that attack, Aser said.Separately, a bombing in northern Balkh province killed two people on Wednesday, including a child, and wounded 16. Adil Shah Adil, spokesman for the provincial police chief, said the bomb was placed inside a cart and was remotely detonated.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Takhar and Balkh bombings.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in a statement condemned the attacks.“Targeting religious scholars and killing civilians, especially children, is a crime against humanity and Islamic values,” said a statement released by Ghani's office. It blamed the Taliban, claiming the attacks show the insurgents “do not believe in peace.”The Taliban did not comment on the two bombings.Also Wednesday, the Taliban ambushed a military convoy on a main highway linking Logar and Paktia provinces, killing an army officer. The Taliban promptly claimed responsibility for that attack.Col. Faridoon Fayaz, unit commander of southeastern provinces, was on his way to his office when he was fatally shot in the ambush, said an army official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. The official said one of the colonel's bodyguards was wounded in the attack.Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings, and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled.The Islamic State group’s local affiliate has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, but many go unclaimed, with the government putting the blame on the Taliban. The insurgents have denied responsibility for most of the attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/series-of-attacks-in-afghanistan-kill-4-including-religious-scholar-101617210945411.html

Here’s how you can use the feature||Facebook on Wednesday announced that it will allow users more control over what they share to News Feed by managing who can comment on their public posts. The social media giant said in a blog post that the new feature is aimed at limiting potentially unwanted interactions by giving users the option to adjust the commenting audience and further controlling how they want to invite conversation onto their public posts.The feature will be available for public figures, creators or brands to let them choose the commenting audience on their public posts. Facebook said that the control option is aimed at helping users feel safe and engage in more meaningful conversations with their community.“This new tool is the latest example of how we’re helping you control and curate your News Feed to best reflect who you are as your interests and priorities evolve,” the company said.Here’s how you can adjust comment control on an individual public post on Facebook:Step 1: Open the Facebook app and go to the public post on your profile that you want to adjust for commenting audienceStep 2: Click on the three-dot menu in the top right of the postStep 3: Select the “Who can comment on your post?” optionStep 4: Select from ‘Public’, ‘Friends’, or ‘Profile and Pages you mention’A similar feature was gradually introduced by Twitter for its users across the world to let them decide on the participants in a conversation. However, users restricted from replying to a tweet were allowed to quote-tweet, paired with an easier way to see quote-tweets, after concerns were raised about the misuse of the feature in spreading fake news.Facebook will also offer a Feed Filter Bar, a new menu at the top of News Feed, that would allow users to switch between an algorithmically-ranked News Feed and a feed sorted chronologically. The changes were announced by Facebook amid the company’s criticism for allegedly amplifying hate speech and misinformation globally across its platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-allow-users-pages-to-turn-off-comment-to-reduce-harassment-101617208617207.html
31-03-2021||World||Covid-19 was third-leading cause of US deaths in 2020, says CDC||Covid-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. last year, contributing to a 15.9% increase in the death rate from a year earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an official report citing full-year data.The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was the underlying or contributing cause of 377,883 deaths in the US last year, according to the CDC’s National Vital Statistics System, which collects and reports provisional annual mortality data. Only heart disease and cancer were more deadly.American Indians, Hispanics and Blacks had the highest rates of death from Covid-19 by ethnicity, the study found. The death rate among White Americans was less than half that among Blacks and Hispanics, and the vast majority of the deaths from Covid-19 were in people aged 65 years and older, who accounted for almost 81% of deaths from the disease.In a second study, the CDC rejected the notion that many deaths from Covid-19 might have been over-counted or exaggerated. The health agency reviewed death certificates of people whose deaths had been primarily attributed to the infectious disease, but also listed another condition.In 97% of certificates that attributed the death to Covid-19 along with another condition, the latter diagnosis tended to be what’s called a “chain-of-event condition” such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, or a “contributing condition” such as hypertension or diabetes. That means those other conditions were either brought about by Covid-19 or made the disease all the more deadly, the CDC said.Only 2.5% of death certificates listed conditions that haven’t been associated with Covid-19, the study found. The CDC said the analysis supports “the accuracy of Covid-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates.”Still, the CDC suggested that the underlying cause of some deaths may not have been properly classified as Covid-19, given the limited availability of testing for the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-was-third-leading-cause-of-us-deaths-in-2020-says-cdc-101617203907237.html
31-03-2021||World||Russia wants to keep a stricter eye on its anti-Putin youth||The Kremlin is seeking to counter what it sees as foreign influence on Russia’s increasingly rebellious youth with a new law aimed at tightening state control over out-of-school activities.The upper house of parliament approved legal amendments that will compel providers of “educational activities” outside of traditional academic programs to coordinate with the government, the state-run Tass news service reported Wednesday.The vaguely-defined changes were introduced after last year’s constitutional amendments that allow Vladimir Putin to remain president until 2036 also added a reference to patriotic education. They will become law once Putin signs the bill.The push to regulate extracurricular activities comes as Russian authorities are already seeking to control access to online information following a surge in protests involving the young over the jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Regulators fined internet companies for not removing posts urging teenagers to join nationwide protests earlier this year, and in March slowed access to Twitter Inc. and threatened to block it entirely in a dispute over content.“Educational activity does not need external control and it is harmed by it,” said Sergei Popov, an astrophysicist member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He started a petition protesting the changes that has garnered 245,000 signatures. While the amendments don’t specify which activities will be regulated, “I think this law will be selectively applied,” he said.Rare ResistanceThe changes provoked a rare display of resistance in the lower house of parliament, where all three nominally opposition parties voted against the measure that was passed by the ruling United Russia party. Educators and cultural workers in Russia also condemned the legislation.“The Accounts Chamber opposed the law, three reference groups opposed it, and the Academy of Sciences asked the president not to sign,” said Communist deputy Oleg Smolin, who chairs the State Duma’s education committee. “The leaders of non-profit organizations see an attempt to limit their capabilities, and museums and libraries are also alarmed.”The non-partisan upper house of parliament voted 145 to one in favor of the amendments, with one abstention, Tass reported.Supporters of the new law say it is necessary to protect students from foreign meddling aimed at historical revisionism. Putin has repeatedly stoked patriotism in confrontations with the West to retain public support as Russians’ living standards stagnated under the impact of sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic.“The lack of appropriate legal regulation creates the preconditions for uncontrolled use of a wide range of propaganda activities by anti-Russian forces in schools and among students under the guise of educational activities,” according to the amendment’s explanatory notes.Protests CallAs the Kremlin prepares for parliamentary elections in September, Putin’s popularity is flagging among a generation that has only known his rule over the past 21 years. Only 31% of Russians ages 18 to 24 want to see Putin remain president after his current term ends in 2024, compared to 57% who don’t, according to a March poll by the independent Levada Center.Navalny’s aides are preparing for a wave of protests in support of the opposition leader. A petition has gathered nearly 361,000 signatures from people pledging to join demonstrations, which organizers say will start once the total passes 500,000.The law’s broad phrasing has sparked fears it could be used to disrupt everything from language classes, exchange programs and summer camps to museum exhibitions and undesirable Wikipedia entries.Russia’s burgeoning ed-tech industry could also be hurt by the measures after experiencing rapid growth during the pandemic.“You have hundreds of thousands of tutorials, articles, videos that will be downloaded so officials can look at them and issue a permit,” said Alex Laryanovsky, a managing partner at online language school Skyeng. “In the worst case it will cause paralysis, and in the best case it will be a non-working law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-wants-to-keep-a-stricter-eye-on-its-anti-putin-youth-101617202899768.html
31-03-2021||World||Philippines demands China remove vessels at 6 islands, reefs in South China sea||The Philippine government said Wednesday that more than 250 Chinese vessels it believes are operated by militia have been spotted near six Manila-claimed islands and reefs in the disputed South China Sea and demanded that China immediately remove them.The gathering of the Chinese-flagged vessels, along with four Chinese navy ships at a Chinese-occupied manmade island base, “is hazardous to navigation and safety of life at sea" and may damage coral reefs and threaten the Philippines' sovereign rights, a government body overseeing the disputed waters said.China has ignored a Philippine government diplomatic protest and a call more than a week ago by Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana for about 200 Chinese vessels to leave Whitsun Reef, stating that the maritime territory belongs to it and the Chinese vessels were sheltering from rough seas.After carrying out aerial and maritime patrol missions, Philippine officials said 44 Chinese “maritime militia” vessels were still moored Monday at Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls Julian Felipe. More than 200 other vessels from the Chinese flotilla have apparently dispersed to five other areas in the Spratly group of islands, including three Chinese-occupied artificial islands, they said.At least four Chinese navy ships were at Chinese-occupied Mischief Reef, the Philippine officials said. China took control of the reef in 1995, drawing strong protests from the Philippines and other claimant states.About 45 Chinese vessels were in the vicinity of the Philippine-occupied island of Thitu, which Manila calls Pagasa, the officials said.“The Philippines calls on China to immediately withdraw these vessels flying its flag,” the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said in a statement. “Neither the Philippines nor the international community will ever accept China’s assertion of its so-called `indisputable integrated sovereignty’ over almost all of the South China Sea.”A patrol aircraft deployed by the Philippine military received a radio warning to stay away from one of the Chinese-occupied reefs but the pilot radioed back that the patrol would continue as planned, military officials said.The interagency body led by President Rodrigo Duterte’s national security adviser released surveillance photos of the Chinese flotilla in the disputed areas, which the Philippine government says are within its internationally recognized exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, where it has exclusive rights to fish and harness potential undersea gas and oil deposits and other resources.“Their swarming ... poses a threat to the peaceful exercise of sovereign rights of the Philippines in its EEZ,” the task force said.The Philippines regards the Spratlys, where it occupies nine islands and islets, as part of its western province of Palawan. But the resource-rich chain of islands, islets and atolls is also claimed by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. China has turned seven disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases, ratcheting up tensions in recent years.The United States has expressed support to the Philippines, its long-time treaty ally, and accused China of using “maritime militia to intimidate, provoke and threaten other nations, which undermines peace and security in the region.” Beijing denied the vessels were part of a maritime militia.Duterte has nurtured friendly ties with Beijing since taking office in 2016 and has been criticized for not immediately demanding Chinese compliance with an international arbitration ruling that invalidated Beijing’s historic claims to virtually the entire South China Sea. China has refused to recognize the 2016 ruling, which it called “a sham,” and continues to defy it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-demands-china-remove-vessels-at-6-islands-reefs-in-south-china-sea-101617200764466.html
31-03-2021||World||Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi in good health, lawyer says||Myanmar's ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi appears in good health despite two months of detention, her legal team said Wednesday, as diplomatic pressure on the military junta ramped up.Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups.The US State Department ordered the departure of non-essential diplomatic staff and their families from Myanmar, and Japan -- a top donor to the country -- halted new aid payments.The 75-year-old Suu Kyi has not been seen in public since she was deposed by the military and detained in the early hours of February 1.But a member of her legal team, Min Min Soe, was summoned to a police station in the capital Naypyidaw for a video meeting with her on Wednesday.Suu Kyi is facing a raft of criminal charges and conviction could see her barred from political office for life."The physical situation of DASSK (Suu Kyi) seemed good according to her appearance on video screen," her legal team said in a statement.Suu Kyi noted that during the meeting, police officers remained at the lawyer's side, and guards monitored her at her end, the statement said, adding that the Nobel laureate had asked whether this was legal.She faces a court hearing on Thursday, though another of her lawyers, Khin Maung Zaw, said it was likely to be fairly brief and deal with administrative matters.The junta is also probing Suu Kyi over allegations she took payments of gold and $600,000 in cash, but Khin Maung Zaw said these were not likely to become formal charges at this stage.Meanwhile, a group of ousted MPs from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), who have been working underground against the junta, said Wednesday they would form "a new civilian government" in the first week of April, without giving further details.The Committee for Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), the Burmese word for "parliament", also warned in a statement that "serious action" would be taken against those who are not part of the protest movement.Spiralling bloodshedThe US said it had decided to pull its staff out of the country to protect their safety and security.World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta figures with sanctions.Japan has halted new aid to the country, according to the country's foreign minister, but stopped short of imposing sanctions."What stance is Japan taking in terms of economic assistance? There is no new aid. We are taking this clear position," Toshimitsu Motegi told parliament on Tuesday.But so far the pressure has not swayed the generals.The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions.Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army -- on Tuesday threatened to join the protesters' fight unless the military reined in its violence.Brigadier General Tar Bhone Kyaw from the TNLA told AFP on Wednesday that they were mulling whether to end their ceasefire with the military, which he accused of "war crimes".While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days.A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible.The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes.Wounded cross borderAround 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes.Thai authorities say around 2,400 have returned "voluntarily" to Myanmar, and another 200 have also agreed to go back.Thai police said they had intercepted 10 parcels containing 112 grenades and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in northern Chiang Rai province that had been destined for Myanmar's notorious border town Tachileik.The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Myanmar on Wednesday, requested by former colonial power Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-deposed-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-in-good-health-lawyer-says-101617200133543.html
31-03-2021||World||Wisconsin Supreme Court strikes down mask mandate issued by Governor Tony Evers||The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down Gov. Tony Evers' statewide mask mandate, ruling that the Democrat exceeded his authority by issuing the order.The 4-3 ruling from the conservative-controlled court is the latest legal blow to attempts by Evers to control the coronavirus. It comes after Republicans in the Legislature voted to repeal the mask mandate in February, only to see Evers quickly re-issue it.The court last May struck down Evers’ “safer at home” order, saying that his health secretary did not have the authority for such an order. Evers’ attempts to limit capacity in bars, restaurants and other indoor places were also blocked by a state appeals court in October.In the latest case, the court ruled that any public health emergency issued by Evers is valid for just 60 days and can’t be extended without legislative approval.“The question in this case is not whether the governor acted wisely; it is whether he acted lawfully. We conclude he did not,” Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority.Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Evers had argued that he can issue multiple health emergencies because of the changing nature of the ongoing pandemic. The mask order first took effect in August and Evers extended it four times since then, most recently on Feb. 4 immediately after the Legislature repealed it.Nearly 60 organizations opposed repeal of the mask mandate, including groups representing hospitals, doctors, nurses, EMTs, school administrators, businesses, children, unions, Milwaukee schools, American Indian tribes, pharmacists, firefighters, local health departments, senior citizens, churches and dentists.With no state order in place, it will be up to local governmental units to enact their own mask policies. Many communities had moved to enact local ordinances as the Legislature looked to repeal the mandate. Mask orders are in place in cities including Milwaukee as well as Dane County, home to Madison.When the court struck down Evers’ “safer at home” order in May it was controlled 5-2 by conservatives. In that ruling, conservative justice Brian Hagedorn sided with liberals in the minority in arguing the order should not be struck down.But during oral arguments in the mask case on Nov. 16, Hagedorn questioned Evers’ authority to renew health emergencies beyond the 60-day limit. He said it was an “extraordinary grant of short-term power to the governor” and that “it seems like the Legislature wanted to allow for only a very short period of time.”“Nobody’s questioning the governor’s sincerity in trying to do what he thinks is right here,” Hagedorn said then. “But he can only do what the power he’s been given to do.”The case challenging the mask mandate was brought by Jere Fabick, a major Republican donor in Wisconsin who has given more than $350,000 to Republican or conservative candidates in Wisconsin between 1994 and the middle of 2020, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.In 2016, Fabick gave $20,000 to conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley. Fabick is a board member and policy advisor for The Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank, and also the president of a multi-state Caterpillar equipment and engine dealer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wisconsin-supreme-court-strikes-down-mask-mandate-issued-by-governor-tony-evers-101617200369738.html
31-03-2021||World||Trump's close ally Matt Gaetz probed over sexual relationship with 17-year-old girl||Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, a prominent conservative in Congress and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, said Tuesday he is being investigated by the Justice Department over a former relationship but denied any criminal wrongdoing.Gaetz, who represents parts of western Florida, is accused of having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paying her to travel with him, and he is under investigation to determine if he violated federal sex trafficking laws, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press.The probe has been underway for nearly a year and Gaetz has been aware for months that he was under investigation, the person said. The Justice Department has also been looking into whether Gaetz, 38, may have also been involved in relationships with other underage girls, the person said.The person could not publicly discuss the details of an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Gaetz told Axios that his lawyers were informed that he was the subject of an investigation “regarding sexual conduct with women” but that he was not a target of the probe. He denied that he ever had a relationship with any underage girls and said the allegations against him were “as searing as they are false.”A subject is conventionally thought of as someone whose actions fall within the scope of a criminal investigation, whereas a target is someone whom prosecutors have gathered evidence linking to a crime. But during the course of an investigation, a subject can become a target.Gaetz's comments came shortly after The New York Times first reported the investigation. It is a federal crime to transport a minor over state lines for sex.Gaetz said that the allegations were part of an extortion plot by a former Justice Department official.“Over the past several weeks my family and I have been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million while threatening to smear my name,” Gaetz said in a statement.Gaetz said his family has been cooperating with the FBI and said his father was wearing a recording device, at the FBI’s direction, “to catch these criminals.” He demanded the Justice Department release the recordings.“No part of the allegations against me are true, and the people pushing these lies are targets of the ongoing extortion investigation,” he said.The Times cited three people familiar with the matter, saying the scrutiny was part of a broader Justice Department probe into one of his political allies and fellow Florida politician, Joel Greenberg, who was indicted last summer on sex trafficking and other charges that he stalked a political opponent. A judge ordered the former tax collector back to jail earlier this month for violating the conditions of his release.“I believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to criminalize my sexual conduct, you know, when I was a single guy,” Gaetz told Axios.“I have definitely, in my single days, provided for women I’ve dated,” Gaetz said. “You know, I’ve paid for flights, for hotel rooms. I’ve been, you know, generous as a partner. I think someone is trying to make that look criminal when it is not.”Gaetz has not been charged with a crime. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-close-ally-matt-gaetz-probed-over-sexual-relationship-with-underage-girl-101617199622224.html
31-03-2021||World||Warm weather in northwest Europe raises fresh Covid-19 worries||Much of northwest Europe is basking in unusually warm weather on Wednesday, prompting many people to throw caution to the wind despite a worrying uptick in coronavirus cases in parts of the continent.Temperatures in Belgium, which is facing a resurgence of the virus, have never been so high so early in the year, while those in England, where restrictions are being loosened following a dramatic fall in new cases, could on Wednesday nudge the all-time March high.In Belgium, the mercury has hit 24.5 degrees Celsius (76 Fahrenheit), prompting thousands of people to head to beaches and parks. The fine weather is expected to continue until Friday and the start of the Easter weekend.Good news for the 11.5 million Belgians craving sun after a gloomy winter, but a real worry for the government struggling to deal with a third wave of infections.Though it's proven that the virus is far less easy to catch outdoors, there are worries that traveling could lead rise to more infections.In response to the number of passengers on its trains, Belgium's national rail company, SNCB, has been forced to activate a “stop-and-go” system to prevent travelers in several train stations from boarding packed-out trains.Currently, residents in Belgium are banned from traveling abroad but can move freely across the country. A night-time curfew is in place.Many did not resist the appeal of a grand day out to North Sea beaches, especially after the government decided last week to shut down schools for an extra week before the Easter school break in a bid to slow infections.That move could ultimately backfire.“It's too crowded. And you don’t have to be a great scientist to predict that," Western Flanders Governor Carl Decaluwe told Het Niewsblad newspaper.Both Decaluwe and the SNCB are now advising against trips to the coast, but the situation in big cities is also a source of worry.In Brussels, for instance, crowds gathered in one of the city’s largest parks to enjoy al fresco drinks and outdoor games. Despite restrictions limiting outside gatherings to four people, bigger groups were spotted sitting on the grass. And although mandatory mask-wearing outdoors is in force, many did not bother with the rule.Brussels prosecutor's office issued a warning Wednesday following the announcement on social networks of two illegal festivals scheduled to take place on April 1 and 2 in two of the city's parks. The office said police will be deployed and that anyone breaching restrictions could be prosecuted.One of the parties is promoted by a collective called the Abyss. The group said it does not question the government's strategy but fights for citizens' rights to gather outdoors.“Some people say we have fallen into a health dictatorship," the group said. “We want to prove that it is still possible to live and therefore to celebrate even in the midst of a pandemic, as our grandparents did during the war."Belgium has reported over 876,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and almost 23,000 virus-related deaths. Hospitalizations due to Covi-19 have risen consistently in recent weeks, and the country's health authorities have warned that intensive care unit occupancy could reach a critical level by April 10 if the pace of infections does not slow down.Parks in the neighboring Netherlands also are getting crowded in the warm spring weather. In the city of Utrecht, authorities have begun painting circles on the grass in parks in an attempt to get visitors to maintain social distancing when they sit or lie in the sun.In Amsterdam, the municipality closed the city’s central Vondelpark, saying it was too busy and only letting people out.Coronavirus infections have been rising for weeks in the Netherlands, despite a months-long tough lockdown.Many parts of the UK are enjoying the turn of the weather, but the coronavirus backdrop in the country is very different to elsewhere in Europe. The rise in temperatures toward the all-time March high of 25.6 Celsius (78 Fahrenheit) recorded in 1968 has come at a time when restrictions on socializing have been eased following a near three-month lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines.Restrictions on gatherings were eased on Monday, and groups of up to six, or two households of any size, can meet in parks and gardens once more, while outdoor sports facilities can reopen. Face masks are not required in most outdoor settings in England.With the fine weather set to be short-lived, there is clear evidence that some people are stretching the rules to the limit.Adam Jones said he saw a “couple of thousand” people in Cannon Hill Park, to the south of the central England city of Birmingham, while out walking with his girlfriend on Tuesday evening.“We did one lap of the park and by the time we were leaving it looked like a festival,” the 27-year-old said.Local police said no fines were issued but that there would be extra officers in the area on Wednesday to ensure that the rules are being abided by.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to act responsibly.“We have come so far, don’t blow it now,” he said on Twitter.The easing was sanctioned after a dramatic fall in new coronavirus cases over the past few weeks that has seen the UK go from being the European country with the worst outbreak at the start of the year to one with one of the lowest rates of infection in the whole continent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warm-weather-in-northwest-europe-raises-fresh-covid-19-worries-101617198719364.html

31-03-2021||World||2 years after commercial ties snapped, Pakistan clears import of sugar, cotton from India||The Pakistan government paved the way for resumption of limited trade relations with India by allowing imports of sugar and cotton from the neighbouring country on Wednesday, almost two years after commercial ties were snapped by bilateral tensions. The green signal for the imports from the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of Pakistan’s Cabinet reflected a recent thaw in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad after the armies of the two sides recommitted themselves to a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir last month. Pakistan’s finance minister Hammad Azhar, who was appointed to the position by Prime Minister Imran Khan only on Tuesday, told a news conference in Islamabad that the move will allow the country to cope with the rising price of sugar and a shortage of cotton. The Cabinet committee approved imports of up to 500,000 tonnes of sugar by the private sector and allowed imports of cotton up to the end of June to meet the needs of small and medium enterprises. “Following an increase in the price of sugar, we allowed imports from across the world but the prices around the world are also high, which means imports aren’t possible. In our neighbouring country India, the price of sugar is lower than the price in Pakistan,” Azhar said, speaking in Urdu. “So we have decided to allow trading in sugar with India, [with imports of] up to 500,000 tonnes by the private sector,” he added. The difference in the price of sugar in the two countries is estimated to be 15% to 20% and the imports will help cover a minor shortfall and reduce prices. “The benefits will go to the poor of Pakistan,” Azhar said. Noting that there is great demand for cotton in Pakistan as textile exports had increased and last year’s crop wasn’t good, Azhar said: “We had allowed cotton imports from around the world but not from India, and this makes a difference to SMEs or the smaller industries. The bigger firms can import cotton from Egypt or other countries and even at expensive prices, but this is needed by SMEs. “Today, on a proposal from the commerce ministry, the ECC decided that we will open imports [of cotton] from India till the end of June.” Azhar sidestepped a question from a reporter on the resumption of trade ties with India without addressing the Kashmir issue by saying: “If the burden on the ordinary man is reduced by trading with some country, there is no loss in it.” On the Indian side, Pakistan’s decision will benefit growers and merchants in Punjab, which has for long had trade relations with the neighbouring country and was a key source of vegetables, fruits and other agricultural products. Trade has invariably been hit whenever tensions spiked between India and Pakistan, and this was also the case when the 2019 Pulwama suicide attack triggered a military standoff. Pakistan’s National Security Committee had unilaterally suspended trade relations with India in August 2019 after New Delhi scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. The move by the Indian and Pakistani armies to strictly adhere to the ceasefire on the LoC from February 25 was the outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two sides and led to a thaw in relations. In recent weeks, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa has spoken of the need to “bury the past and move forward”, while Prime Minister Khan has said India will have to take the first step for improving ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for an atmosphere of trust and devoid of terrorism for better relations between the two sides in a message sent to his Pakistani counterpart on Pakistan Day on March 23, Khan responded by saying that his country desires peaceful and cooperative ties. “Creation of an enabling environment is imperative for a constructive and result-oriented dialogue,” Khan said in his response sent to Modi on Monday. Though external affairs minister S Jaishankar didn’t meet his Pakistani counterpart on the margins of the Heart of Asia ministerial conference in Tajikistan on Tuesday, both sides have dialled down the rhetoric amid indications that more steps are likely to be taken to normalise relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-years-after-commercial-ties-snapped-pakistan-clears-import-of-sugar-cotton-from-india-101617198893066.html

Around 150,000 people had received BioNTech shots in Hong Kong before the vaccinations were suspended.The Hong Kong chief executive’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on the SCMP story outside of business hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-like-to-resume-biontech-covid-vaccine-shots-next-week-report-101617196663326.html
31-03-2021||World||2 Capitol police officers sue Trump over January 6 riots||Two US Capitol Police officers have filed a lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, saying he incited the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection and was responsible for physical and emotional injuries they suffered as a result.James Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, and Sidney Hemby, an 11-year veteran, filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in US District Court for the District of Columbia seeking damages of at least $75,000 each."This is a complaint for damages by US Capitol Police officers for physical and emotional injuries caused by the defendant Donald Trump’s wrongful conduct inciting a riot on January 6, 2021, by his followers trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election," the lawsuit said.Trump has denied responsibility for the rioting, which left five people dead, including a police officer. His office did not immediately return a call for comment on the lawsuit.The lawsuit cites the former Republican president's conduct before and beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won, including comments in speeches, on Twitter and during presidential debates.It said Trump stoked violence throughout the 2020 presidential campaign and escalated his false assertion that the election was rigged after the election was called for Biden."During his 2016 campaign, and throughout his presidency, Trump had threatened violence towards his opponents, encouraged his followers to commit acts of violence, and condoned acts of violence by his followers, including white supremacists and far rightwing hate groups," it said.The lawsuit also cited Trump's encouragement to supporters to come to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and "Stop The Steal" in the months after the election, including a tweet on Dec. 19: "Big protest on D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild.""Trump’s December 19th tweet about the January 6th rally was taken by many of his supporters as a literal call to arms," the lawsuit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-capitol-police-officers-sue-trump-over-january-6-riots-101617196246768.html

During a tell-all interview with iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, made explosive revelations, including the claim that the couple had a secret marriage ceremony in their “backyard”, officiated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby."You know, three days before our wedding, we got married," said Meghan. "No one knows that. The vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury," she added.Harry and Meghan publicly shared their vows during the grand marriage ceremony in Windsor on Saturday, May 19, 2018, before becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Welby, who led the couple in their public vows, told la Repubblica that the “legal wedding” took place on Saturday, backing the officially documented wedding.“I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offence if I had signed it knowing it was false," the archbishop was quoted by the newspaper as saying.However, Welby admitted that he had a number of “informal” meetings with the couple ahead of the wedding, adding that he won’t say “what happened at any other meetings”. Both Harry and Meghan had said it was “just the three of us” when they shared the personal vows."So, you can make what you like of that. But the legal wedding was on the Saturday, but I won't say what happened at any earlier meetings," the archbishop added.The most damaging allegation by the couple involved an unnamed member of the royal family who raised concerns about the potential skin colour of their son before he was born. Meghan told Oprah that the British royal family refused to make her son Archie a prince partly due to conversations about how dark his skin might be. Harry later clarified that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were never part of those conversations.“Neither his grandmother nor grandfather were part of those conversations. He did not tell me who were part of those conversations, as you can see I tried get that answer," Oprah said on a follow-up with CBS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-won-t-say-archbishop-on-meghan-s-claim-of-secret-wedding-with-harry-101617194549199.html
31-03-2021||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro fires armed forces chiefs after sacking defense minister||Commanders of Brazil’s army, navy and air force were fired on Tuesday after President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed his defense chief as part of a broader cabinet restructuring.The shake-up, precipitated by congressional allies who have been unhappy with the president’s pandemic response, displeased the heads of the military who received no advance warning about the replacement of Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva, according to two people close to the armed forces who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.The dismissal of the three commanders -- General Edson Pujol, Admiral Ilques Barbosa and Brigadier Antonio Carlos Moretti Bermudez -- happened during meetings with Azevedo e Silva and Walter Braga Netto, who will take over as defense minister in the coming days, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.The change was announced by the ministry in a statement, and replacements haven’t been named yet. The three had been in their posts since January 2019.“What happened was a rupture in the relationship between Bolsonaro and the institutional armed forces,” said Octavio Amorim Neto, a political scientist specializing in civil-military relations who teaches at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, one of Brazil’s top universities, in Rio de Janeiro. “This means one of the key pillars of his government is distancing itself from Bolsonaro.”Read More: Bolsonaro Ousts Top Ministers as Pandemic Spirals Out of ControlBolsonaro, a former army captain who’s not affiliated with any political party, has been under pressure to make room for allies from the centrist establishment he once disdained but now relies on to pass legislation and protect him from impeachment attempts.As his handling of the pandemic comes under fire, he has also sought more explicit backing from the armed forces. Earlier this month, fighting governors who had imposed restrictions to commerce and the movement of people, he said “my army won’t go to the streets to ensure obedience to governors’ decrees.”No CoupThe president also made comments on the possibility of declaring a state of siege, which would give him power over governors, but that would require backing from congress. That statement prompted a call from the Supreme Court justice seeking explanations, local media reported.Yet Azevedo e Silva often dismissed Bolsonaro’s moves, more than once publishing statements where he reaffirmed the role of the armed forces as a state institution rather than a government body. He had been at the helm of the defense ministry since the president took office in January, 2019.Read More: Bolsonaro’s Erratic Behavior is Making His Military Backers Nervous“During this period, I preserved the armed forces as a state institution,” Azevedo e Silva wrote in a terse statement following his dismissal on Monday.Bolsonaro on Tuesday night said he plays by the constitution. “I can’t decree a state of siege, that’s up to congress,” he told supporters in front of the residential palace.While the recent developments made clear there is a widening gap between Bolsonaro and the armed forces as the pandemic worsens -- on Tuesday, the country reported a record 3,780 deaths from the respiratory disease -- Brazil is not at risk of a coup, according to Amorim Neto.“Even though he has been working closely with Bolsonaro, general Braga Netto is attached to the rule of law and the Constitution. He’s a conservative but not a die-hard Bolsonarista,” he says. “One thing is a certain degree of tolerance with the political excesses of Bolsonaro. To endorse his adventurous ideas is something else entirely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-fires-armed-forces-chiefs-after-sacking-defense-minister-101617193139419.html
31-03-2021||World||BBC scribe flees China after threats over Xinjiang, Covid-19 reporting||A senior China correspondent for the BBC has moved to Taiwan following legal threats, pressure, and intimidation over reports on alleged Xinjiang rights abuses and the coronavirus pandemic.John Sudworth told BBC Radio 4 that he had relocated to Taiwan after nine years in Beijing as it was “too risky to carry on”. “We left in a hurry, followed by plainclothes police all the way to the airport through the check-in. The true grim reality for reporters here is being made clear all the way to the very end.”Sudworth’s wife, Yvonne Murray, the China correspondent of RTE, the Irish broadcaster, left with him, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) said.Sudworth’s relocation comes amid criticism of the BBC for its reporting on alleged forced labour practices targeting Uighur Muslim minorities in Xinjiang’s cotton industry in particular.The reportage was strongly criticised by the Chinese foreign ministry as well as state media outlets.The BBC confirmed Sudworth’s relocation after the tabloid Global Times reported on Wednesday, he was “hiding” in Taiwan.Quoting unnamed sources, the tabloid accused Sudworth of “hiding in Taiwan” after he “…became infamous in China for his many biased stories” on Xinjiang and also the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.When asked about the development, the Chinese foreign ministry denied any hand in it. “We never threatened him,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. “We don’t know why he left because he didn’t say goodbye.”On the threat of legal notices on the reports, Hua said, “I think those people are trying to protect their own rights and interests through legal means, but such acts have nothing to do with the Chinese government.”In its statement, the BBC said, “John’s reporting has exposed truths the Chinese authorities did not want the world to know.”The FCCC said Sudworth “forms one of an ever-larger number of journalists driven out of China by unacceptable harassment”.In a statement shared on social media, the FCCC added that he had been kept on “a series of short visas, variously lasting one, three and six months”, putting pressure on his ability to raise his young family.“Sudworth left after months of personal attacks and disinformation targeting him and his BBC colleagues, disseminated by both the Chinese state media and Chinese government officials.”The club noted that attacks on Sudworth and the BBC escalated after the British broadcasting regulator revoked the licence of Chinese state TV channel CGTN in February. “We urge China to live up to its stated commitment to facilitate unhindered reporting in China. In particular, the FCCC calls for an end to dangerous, personal attacks on individual reporters and foreign media outlets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bbc-scribe-flees-china-after-threats-over-xinjiang-covid-19-reporting-101617193852686.html

31-03-2021||World||Biden to unveil $2.25 trillion spending, corporate tax hikes||President Joe Biden will unveil a $2.25 trillion U.S. infrastructure plan Wednesday -- paid for by steep tax hikes on businesses-- that his administration said will prove the most sweeping since investments in the 1960s space program.The four-part, eight-year plan dedicates $620 billion for transportation, including a doubling in federal funding for public transit. It would provide $650 billion for initiatives tied to improving quality of life at home, like clean water and high-speed broadband. There’s $580 billion for strengthening American manufacturing -- some $180 billion of which goes to what’s billed as the biggest non-defense research and development program on record -- and $400 billion to address improved care for the elderly and people with disabilities.Biden’s plan would increase the corporate income tax to 28% from 21%, and set a 21% minimum tax on global corporate earnings. The White House said tax increases will be “fully paying for the investments in this plan over the next 15 years.”But the plan faces a rough road in Congress. Garnering Republican support in either the House or Senate, both of which Democrats control by narrow margins, will be difficult, if not impossible. Corralling moderate and progressive Democrats will also be a challenge.“Like great projects of the past, the president’s plan will unify and mobilize the country to meet the great challenges of our time: the climate crisis and the ambitions of an autocratic China,” the White House said in a statement before Biden’s afternoon speech in Pittsburgh.What Biden lays out Wednesday is just the first part of his long-term economic program, with a second round of initiatives to be announced in mid-April. Those will focus on “helping families with the challenges like health care costs, child care, and education.”The program will prove far more complex to enact than the $1.9 trillion pandemic-relief bill signed earlier in March. Republicans are staunchly opposed to tax increases, and the breadth of measures will invite partisan and even internal Democratic battles. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has warned that efforts to improve infrastructure shouldn’t turn into “a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies.”As seen with the Covid-19 bill, Biden’s initial plans are coming in much bigger than what economists had anticipated. The shift to a major expansion in fiscal policy has already driven up forecasts for growth this year, and sent Treasury yields climbing. While stocks have reacted with some volatility in recent weeks, the S&P 500 index hit a record high on Friday.Biden’s plan will create millions and millions of jobs, an administration official told reporters, while declining to provide a specific figure.Pittsburgh ModelBiden will present his “American Jobs Plan” Wednesday in Pittsburgh, a city the White House views as a prime example of an old manufacturing hub revitalized by new industries from health care to technology.The administration wants the same type of reorientation that Pittsburgh saw to provide fresh opportunities to working-class cities and towns across the country. The plan envisions an expensive political gambit carried out over the next decade to try to create well-paying jobs by both updating the country’s infrastructure and preparing for the coming weather patterns wrought by climate change.A major undercurrent through the infrastructure plan is addressing inequality and expanding help for segments of society that the administration judges have been left out in the past. For example, in addition to fixing the “ten most economically significant bridges in the country in need of reconstruction,” there’s $20 billion for a new program that will “reconnect” neighborhoods that were cut off by past investments, such as the I-81 highway in Syracuse, New York. And all lead pipes will be replaced, to address water-quality issues.Another key theme is bolstering U.S. competitiveness against China. There’s $50 billion earmarked for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and $40 billion more in upgrading research capacity in laboratories across the nation.Climate change is also a major target. The transportation funding proposed specifically directs $174 billion to electric vehicles, including sale rebates and tax incentives for consumers to buy American-made cars.While infrastructure has traditionally been a bipartisan endeavor, Republicans have warned they’re not in favor of the major tilt toward renewable energy in the administration’s approach. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell also said his party wouldn’t vote for tax increases.Outreach to GOPAdministration officials said Biden is open to input from members of Congress of both parties on what provisions should be in a final package and how to pay for them. The White House expects to have robust outreach to GOP lawmakers and is committed to a serious discussion with them, a White House official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s plans. That effort began with inviting Republicans from relevant committees to a Tuesday briefing with Brian Deese, the National Economic Council director.But Biden’s plans don’t necessarily need Republican support to become law. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could choose to fit many of the president’s proposals into one or more budget reconciliation bills, which require only a simple majority vote in the Senate. The challenge is, as Pelosi has already indicated, that not all elements could fit into such a bill, which sets certain requirements for inclusion.The infrastructure package doesn’t include any of the proposed tax increases on individuals that Biden talked about on the campaign -- like raising the top tax rate for individuals and increasing the levy on capital gains. That was purposeful, an administration official said, because White House aides believe corporate-tax reform should pay for infrastructure and the efforts to enhance the attraction of the U.S. as a place to do business.Potential LegacyTax experts and lawmakers expect the administration to try to raise taxes on the wealthy and their assets in the second package coming later this spring.If Biden does succeed in passing the bulk of the packages he introduces, it could put him in the pantheon with Lyndon Johnson or Franklin Delano Roosevelt, presidents who instituted sweeping changes through legislation on civil rights and the social safety net.“This really is transformational in a way we have not seen since the Great Society,” said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank. “Like a lot of people, I underestimated Joe Biden. He was always in the background -- as vice presidents are supposed to be -- always in the center of the party politically. And he was clumsy. That is what we saw, and that is why I underestimated him. But I can’t quarrel with what he done since he took office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-unveil-2-25-trillion-spending-corporate-tax-hikes-101617190874724.html
31-03-2021||World||China didn’t withhold data on the origin of Covid-19 virus: Official||A top Chinese official on Wednesday dismissed accusations that China did not share all data with the World Health Organization (WHO)-appointed researchers tracing the origin of the Covid-19 virus.The denial comes a day after the publication of the WHO-China joint report on the origins of Covid-19, following which WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Beijing withheld relevant data from the team of scientists who visited Wuhan in January.Tedros was quoted as saying the investigation was “not extensive enough” and that experts had struggled to access raw information during their four-week visit to the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus first emerged in December, 2019.Additionally, at least 14 countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, and the Czech Republic, raised concerns over the report released by the WHO on Tuesday into the origin of the coronavirus, citing delays and a lack of full access to data.Speaking on the report on Wednesday, Liang Wannian, co-leader of the joint study, said Chinese and international researchers had access to the same data throughout the probe period and that the claims about lack of access were not accurate. “Of course, according to Chinese law, some data cannot be taken away or photographed, but when we were analysing it together in Wuhan, everyone could see the database, the materials - it was all done together.”Rejecting complaints about the report being delayed, Liang said “every sentence, every conclusion, every piece of data” needed to be verified by both sides before it could be released. “Throughout, we always upheld the principle of “quality comes first”,” said Liang, chief of a Covid-19 experts’ committee set up by the China’s National Health Commission.Liang had earlier told state media that to “…accomplish the arduous task of scientific cooperation and exchange, the Chinese side brought together the relevant institutions and hundreds of scientists and did their best to collect and collate data and conduct a preliminary analysis”.Liang said the origin tracing of the virus is a continuous work, adding that further tracing will be carried out around the globe, based on the findings of the study in China.China was the first country to report Covid-19 cases, so the global tracing of virus origins was first conducted here, Liang said.Separately, the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday called on all parties to respect science and the opinions and conclusions of the WHO report that found it’s extremely unlikely the virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The WHO said work could also be carried out in laboratories around the world if further evidence was available and needed, ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying said, adding that China hopes that other relevant countries will cooperate with the WHO in the same open and transparent manner as China has done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-didn-t-withhold-data-on-the-origins-of-covid-19-virus-official-101617190852429.html
31-03-2021||World||European Union delivers over 100 million Covid-19 vaccines in first quarter||The European Union will have delivered 107 million Covid vaccines by the end of this week, reaching the bloc’s targeted goal to ship 100 million doses in the first three months of the year.The milestone was confirmed by European Commission spokesperson, Dana Spinant to reporters on Wednesday and reported earlier by Bloomberg News. It was a revised goal that had to take into account multiple delays in the deliveries from AstraZeneca Plc.The drug maker, one of four suppliers authorized in the EU, had committed to providing 30 million doses by the end of this quarter, well below the originally planned 120 million shots. The other pharmaceutical companies have delivered on schedule.A spokesman for Astra said on Tuesday that the company was on track to ship 30 million doses to the EU by the end of March.The milestone is a rare vaccine win for the EU, which has been struggling to ramp up a sluggish inoculation campaign that lags behind western countries such as the UK and the US.The bloc expects to receive 360 million doses in the second quarter and is aiming to vaccinate 70% of its adult population by the end of the summer. Meanwhile, several large EU countries have reimposed lockdown measures, with Italy and France likely to announce additional restrictions on Wednesday, in the face of an onslaught of new coronavirus cases on the continent.The bloc has administered 15 doses per 100 people, less than a third of what the UK has managed, according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.The European vaccine campaign faced another setback after Germany said it would halt the use of Astra’s Covid-19 vaccine for people younger than 60 after a handful of new cases of severe blood clots emerged.“These are findings that we cannot ignore,” Merkel told reporters late Tuesday, acknowledging that the latest development will increase public uncertainty. “We all know that vaccination is the most important tool against the coronavirus -- that we have different vaccines at our disposal is our good fortune,” she added.Germany’s vaccine agency reported a rare brain blood clot in 31 people who had been given the Astra shot, nine of whom died. With the exception of two people, all of the cases were women between the ages of 20 and 63. Around 2.7 million people in Germany have so far received the Astra shot, data from the RKI public-health authority show.The data from German health authorities suggest that there has been more than one case of the rare blood clot per 100,000 people vaccinated with Astra. That’s a higher ratio than would be expected in the wider population, according to analysis earlier this month by the agency that advises the German government on medicine safety.The European Medicines Agency has alerted doctors to the latest blood-clot data, and amended the vaccine’s information notice. It said it can’t entirely rule out a link between vaccination and blood clots, including unusual cases in which patients have low levels of blood-clotting platelets.Earlier this month, the EMA reviewed the blood-clot issue and concluded that the benefits of the Astra shot outweigh the risks. But it also recommended that a warning is added to make sure the public is better informed.The move comes as European countries weigh lockdown measures in the face of rising new cases. France and Italy may announce new or extended restrictions later Wednesday to try to curb the coronavirus spread.French President Emmanuel Macron, who speaks at 8 p.m. in Paris, may consider measures including a strict nationwide lockdown, closing schools and forced transfers of patients in intensive care to other regions, according to France Info Radio.The rules in Italy could centralize decisions on school reopenings in Rome and make it compulsory for health workers to get the Covid vaccine, according to people familiar with the plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-delivers-over-100-million-covid-19-vaccines-in-first-quarter-101617188379985.html

Pfizer’s vaccine is authorized for ages 16 and older. But vaccinating children of all ages will be critical to stopping the pandemic — and helping schools, at least the upper grades, start to look a little more normal after months of disruption.In a study of 2,260 US volunteers ages 12 to 15, preliminary data showed there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared to 18 among those given dummy shots, Pfizer reported.It's a small study, that hasn't yet been published, so another important piece of evidence is how well the shots revved up the kids’ immune systems. Researchers reported high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, somewhat higher than were seen in studies of young adults.Kids had side effects similar to young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech in the coming weeks plan to ask the US Food and Drug Administration and European regulators to allow emergency use of the shots starting at age 12.“We share the urgency to expand the use of our vaccine,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. He expressed “the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year" in the United States.Pfizer isn’t the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected soon from a US study of Moderna’s vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds.But in a sign that the findings were promising, the FDA already allowed both companies to begin US studies in children 11 and younger, working their way to as young as 6-month-old.AstraZeneca last month began a study of its vaccine among 6- to 17-year-olds in Britain. Johnson & Johnson is planning its own pediatric studies. And in China, Sinovac recently announced it has submitted preliminary data to Chinese regulators showing its vaccine is safe in children as young as 3.While most Covid-19 vaccines being used globally were first tested in tens of thousands of adults, pediatric studies won’t need to be nearly as large. Scientists have safety information from those studies and from subsequent vaccinations in millions more adults.One key question is the dosage: Pfizer gave the 12-and-older participants the same dose adults receive, while testing different doses in younger children.It's not clear how quickly the FDA would act on Pfizer's request to allow vaccination starting at age 12. Another question is when the country would have enough supply of shots — and people to get them into adolescents' arms — to let kids start getting in line.Supplies are set to steadily increase over the spring and summer, at the same time states are opening vaccinations to younger, healthier adults who until now haven't had a turn.Children represent about 13% of Covid-19 cases documented in the US And while children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, at least 268 have died from Covid-19 in the US alone and more than 13,500 have been hospitalized, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics. That’s more than die from the flu in an average year. Additionally, a small number have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus.Caleb Chung, who turns 13 later this week, agreed to volunteer after his father, a Duke University pediatrician, presented the option. He doesn't know if he received the vaccine or a placebo.“Usually I’m just at home doing online school and there’s not much I can really do to fight back against the virus,” Caleb said in a recent interview. The study “was really somewhere that I could actually help out.”His father, Dr. Richard Chung, said he’s proud of his son and all the other children volunteering for the needle pricks, blood tests and other tasks a study entails.“We need kids to do these trials so that kids can get protected. Adults can’t do that for them,” Chung said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-100-effective-for-youths-aged-12-to-15-101617187845557.html

Thousands of school classes have been closed down.Macron was holding a weekly Covid defence council on Wednesday morning. A government source told Reuters three scenarios were being examined: a massive operation to transfer intensive care patients from overloaded hospitals to lesser-hit regions; school closures; strict lockdown in the hardest-hit parts of France.France faces having to tighten measures just as neighbouring Britain slowly emerges from a lockdown imposed in early January.Macron had hoped France's Covid-19 vaccine campaign would reduce the numbers falling gravely ill. But the vaccine rollout is only now finding its stride three months after it began, with just 12% of the population inoculated.The president will deliver his televised address at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)."What we needed earlier was a strict lockdown and huge vaccination drive, but it's still not too late," Gilbert Deray, a senior clinician at the Pitie-Salpeterie hospital in Paris told Europe 1 radio.France used medical evacuations to ease the load on overwhelmed hospitals during the first two waves of the epidemic but there has been more resistance from families in recent weeks. The government source said the evacuations under discussion would not require family consent.Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo told BFM TV that schools should be closed.Ten days ago, the government closed non-essential stores and limited people's movements in Paris and other regions ravaged by the virus. Mobility data analysed by Reuters showed those measures were having markedly less impact than prior lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-french-prez-macron-to-address-nation-as-third-wave-overloads-hospitals-101617186329963.html
31-03-2021||World||Thailand: 5 pro-democracy activists charged for violence against the queen||Five pro-democracy activists in Thailand were charged Wednesday with the rarely used criminal offence of attempting to harm the queen, over an encounter with a royal motorcade during a protest last year.If convicted, the group could face the death penalty or life in prison under a law that has not been used for decades and punishes any "act of violence against the queen or her liberty".The incident came as thousands of protesters marched from the Democracy Monument to the Government House in Bangkok in October last year.A motorcade ferrying Queen Suthida and Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti passed through the protest zone in the afternoon.Some protesters crowded around the vehicle, raising the three-fingered salute of defiance adopted from "The Hunger Games" books and films.Such an overt challenge of the monarchy is unprecedented in Thailand, where a draconian defamation law has been used to shield the royal family from criticism.Prosecutors formally charged the five on Wednesday.Their lawyer, Poonsuk Poonsukcharoen, sought bail and was prepared to put up a 300,000 baht ($10,000) bond for each.One of the accused, Bunkueanun "Francis" Paothong, 21, said he had no intention of harming the queen.He told reporters it had been a "wretched and excruciating five months" in legal limbo.The pro-democracy protests in Bangkok kicked off last July and called for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha's government and a rewrite of the military-scripted constitution.But the most controversial demands have been for reforms to the monarchy, including the abolition of lese majeste, the royal defamation law.Close to 20 pro-democracy protesters and student leaders are on remand in prison while fighting lese majeste charges, sedition and other offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-5-pro-democracy-activists-charged-for-violence-against-the-queen-101617185836938.html
31-03-2021||World||China under pressure after WHO chief revives lab leak theory||China faced mounting pressure Wednesday over the investigation into the origins of Covid-19, after the WHO chief revived a theory it may have leaked from a Chinese lab and the United States led concerns over data access.A report by WHO and Chinese experts released on Tuesday had judged the lab-leak hypothesis highly unlikely, saying the virus behind Covid-19 had probably jumped from bats to humans via an intermediary animal.China warmly welcomed the report, seeing it as confirmation of its handling of the investigation following allegations it had tried to delay and then restrict it.The report also initially appeared to back China's firm rejection of theories that the pandemic may have been triggered by a leak from a virology lab in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged.But WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus on Tuesday reopened the lab leak theory, as he raised concerns about the level of access China provided to the experts during their visit to Wuhan in January."In my discussions with the team, they expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data," Tedros said.He called for "timely and comprehensive data sharing" in future investigations.Tedros also said that although the experts concluded the laboratory leak was the "least likely" hypotheses, this theory needed to be probed further."I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough," Teodros said of the possibility of a leak."This requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy."Tedros then emphasised that no theory had yet been ruled out."Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table," he said.The pandemic has killed nearly 2.8 million people worldwide since it first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019.Throughout the pandemic, China has amplified theories that the virus may have surfaced outside of its borders or been imported on frozen food.China was heavily criticised by the Donald Trump administration and other Western nations for delaying access to the WHO experts.Joe Biden's administration has continued to raise concerns about China's handling of the probe.The United States on Tuesday released a statement with 13 of its allies -- Britain, Japan and Australia among them -- saying the inquiry lacked the data and samples it needed."We join in expressing shared concerns regarding the recent WHO-convened study in China," the statement said.- Diverging information -Beijing insists it was transparent with the scientists.It said it provided open access to wet markets, labs, patients and data from the first torrid weeks of the virus, admonishing critics for "politicising" a global health crisis.Health officials in Beijing are due to give a press conference on the WHO report on Wednesday afternoon.The reason for the diverging information from the WHO expert team was not immediately clear.On the laboratory accident hypothesis, the head of the investigation team, Danish scientist Ben Embarek told reporters on Tuesday that Chinese lab staff had acknowledged they initially feared a leak."Even the staff in these labs told us that was their first reaction," Embarek said."They all went back to their records... but nobody could find any trace of something similar to this virus in their records or their samples."Nobody has been able to pick up any firm arguments or proof or evidence that any of these labs would have been involved in a lab leak accident."That said, Embarek added: "We haven't done a full investigation or audit of any of the labs."Other WHO team members took to Twitter to defend the probe.Peter Daszak, who was effusive in praise of his Chinese hosts during the January probe, hit out at the "pure politics" being played with the findings led by elements of the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-under-pressure-after-who-chief-revives-lab-leak-theory-101617172063111.html

What’s next?||The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Tuesday announced the completion of the H-1B cap lottery process for the fiscal year 2022. The US immigration agency said in a statement that they have received enough e-registrations during the initial registration period to reach the H-1B quota of 85,000, including the advanced degree exemption, also known as the master’s cap.“We randomly selected from among the registrations properly submitted to reach the cap. We have notified all prospective petitioners with selected registrations that they are eligible to file an H-1B cap-subject petition for the beneficiary named in the applicable selected registration,” the USCIS stated.The online accounts of H-1B registrants will now show one of the four statuses - ‘Submitted’, ‘Selected’, ‘Denied’, and ‘Invalidated-Failed Payment’. The ‘Denied’ status would show in case multiple registrations were submitted by or on behalf of the same registrant for the same beneficiary.What’s next?Detailed H-1B cap-subject petitions for those selected in the lottery process, including petitions eligible for the master’s cap, now have to be filed by the sponsoring employers from April 1, 2021. At least 90 days window will be available to file the H-1B cap-subject petition at the correct service centre as online filing is not available for H-1B petitions.“Selection in the registration process does not relieve the petitioner from submitting evidence or otherwise establishing eligibility, as registration only pertains to eligibility to file the H-1B cap-subject petition,” the agency said.The lottery system continued to apply for the current season since the department of homeland security (DHS) has delayed the implementation of proposed changes to the H-1B registration system and selection process until December 31, 2021. The delay is supposed to provide more time for the immigration agency to train its staff and give stakeholders time to adjust to the new rule. The H-1B visa allows American companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise, of which the vast majority are from India and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-completion-of-h-1b-cap-lottery-process-for-fy-2022-what-s-next-101617184340157.html

The US and other countries say the WHO report lacked crucial information, access and transparency and further study was warranted.Kato called for additional investigation and analysis and said Japan will encourage WHO to consider additional investigation inside China.“We will further cooperate with other countries in carrying out additional studies that are still necessary,” Kato said.The report said the virus most likely came from bats and spread to an unidentified mammal before being transmitted to people. It called a laboratory leak an unlikely route of transmission that didn't warrant further study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-demands-further-probe-into-covid-19-origins-after-who-releases-report-101617179982577.html
31-03-2021||World||WHO team urges patience after first look for origin of coronavirus||An international team behind a long-awaited study of the possible origins of Covid-19 with Chinese colleagues on Tuesday called it a “first start,” while the United States and allies expressed concerns about the findings and China trumpeted its cooperation.Team leader Peter Ben Embarek of the World Health Organization presented the team's first-phase look into the possible origins of the pandemic that has killed nearly 2.8 million people and pummeled economies since it first turned up in China over a year ago.The report, obtained by The Associated Press on Monday and formally published on Tuesday, said transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario and that a lab leak is “extremely unlikely.” The WHO chief has said all hypotheses remain open.After the report's publication, the U.S. and over a dozen other countries expressed concerns about the study, pointing to delays and a lack of access to samples and data — without finger-pointing at Beijing directly. China responded by reiterating its criticism of efforts to “politicize” the issue.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration was still reviewing the WHO report, but said “it lacks crucial data, information ... It lacks access. It lacks transparency." She said the study did not rise to the level of the impact that the pandemic has had on the world.“That's why we also have called for additional forward-looking steps,” she said in a briefing with reporters. "It doesn't lead us to any closer (an) understanding or greater knowledge than we had six to nine months ago about the origin.”Separately, in what it called a joint statement by 14 countries, the State Department said they were calling for “momentum” for a second-phase look by experts and pointed to the need for further animal studies “to find the means of introduction into humans” of the coronavirus.The countries expressed support for the WHO's experts and staff, citing their “tireless” work toward ending the pandemic and understanding its origins to help prevent a future one. But they said the study had been “significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples.”Psaki said China has “not been transparent” with the U.N. health agency.Critics of China's government in Washington and beyond say it took too long to allow in the team members: Their roughly four-week visit to China in January and February came more than a year after the coronavirus outbreak was first noticed in the city of Wuhan.The European Union, in a separate statement, echoed concerns about the late start to the study, the delayed deployment of the expert team, and the limited availability of samples and data, but called the report “a helpful first step.”A statement on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's web site after the release pointed to China's cooperation with WHO and said the Chinese side of the team “offered necessary facilitation for the team's work, fully demonstrating its openness, transparency and responsible attitude.”It repeated China's frequent criticism of efforts to politicize the issue, saying that it will “jeopardize anti-pandemic cooperation, and cost more lives.” It also reiterated the Chinese government's belief that the study of the pandemic's origins “should be conducted in multiple countries and localities.”Ben Embarek said the team members faced political pressure from “all sides,” but insisted: “We were never pressured to remove critical elements in our report.” He also pointed to “privacy” issues in China that prevented sharing of some data, saying similar restrictions exist in many countries.Joined by several team members for a news conference, Ben Embarek said that “where we did not have full access to all the raw data we wanted, that has been put as a recommendation for the future studies.”That was a major theme for the WHO team: More needs to be done, and many questions remain unanswered.“This is only a first start -- we've only scratched the surface of this very complex set of studies that need to be conducted,” Ben Embarek said. "We have pointed to many additional studies that should be conducted from now on.”“This is a work in progress," he added, "and we all have to be patient.”Ben Embarek said it was difficult to know when -- if at all -- the precise origin of the pandemic will come to light. While the team members believe one hypothesis that the virus could have leaked from a laboratory was not likely, it was “not impossible” either, he said.“We haven't seen or been able to hear or see or look at anything that would warrant different conclusions from our side,” he said.But in its report, the team proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis — a speculative theory that was promoted by former U.S. President Donald Trump among others. It also said the role played by a seafood market where human cases were first identified was uncertain.Suspicion of China partially underpinned the theory that the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. The report cited several reasons for all but dismissing that possibility.“This is a dynamic process. Nothing is cast in stone. There are no firm conclusions," Ben Embarek said. "And I think that's how we should look at the whole outcome of this report — and this work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-urges-patience-after-first-look-for-origin-of-coronavirus-101617177699623.html
31-03-2021||World||Texas Senate approves abortion restrictions, bills move to house||The Texas state Senate passed six laws intended to restrict abortion on Tuesday, including one that, if approved by lawmakers in the lower chamber and signed by the governor, would prohibit the procedure once a fetal heartbeat was detected.The half-dozen bills mark the latest effort by right-leaning state legislatures to roll back abortion rights since former President Donald Trump's three appointments to the Supreme Court gave conservatives a 6-3 majority.South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster in February signed a law outlawing abortion once a fetal heartbeat was detected. Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, quickly sued to have it overturned.The Republican-led Montana legislature has passed several measures limiting access to abortion and have asked voters to approve another that would essentially outlaw voluntary termination of a pregnancy.In Texas, where abortion is already illegal past 20 weeks gestation, one of the six bills approved on Tuesday would, like South Carolina's law, ban the procedure once a fetal heartbeat was detected.A second measure, written by Republican State Sen. Angela Paxton, would ban most abortions in Texas if the Supreme Court overturns its 1973 ruling that the procedure is protected by the U.S. Constitution."The life of the mother is incredibly important, as is the life of the unborn child. It's a difficult situation," Paxton said, according to the Austin American-Statesman.A fetus that is viable outside the womb, at around 24 weeks into the pregnancy, is widely considered the threshold at which abortion can be prohibited in the United States, where the issue remains deeply divisive.The Texas state Senate on Tuesday also voted to prohibit the use of abortion pills after seven weeks of gestation and to mandate that doctors make counseling available to women who are seeking to terminate their pregnancy.Lawmakers also banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy when a severe abnormality has been detected in the growing fetus.The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a bid by Kentucky's Republican attorney general to defend a restrictive state law, struck down by lower courts, that abortion rights advocates have said would effectively ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

His son, Thomas Liddy, confirmed the news of his father’s demise, according to US media. Liddy, who became a radio talk show host after his release from prison, remained unrepentant for the part that he played in the Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of then US President Richard Nixon. "I'd do it again for my president," Liddy said years later.Born in New Jersey in 1930, Liddy lived in a German American neighbourhood where his first interactions with politics were with the radio speeches of Adolf Hitler. After a stint in the Army and graduating from Fordham university law school, Liddy joined the FBI. Later, he helped organise Nixon’s presidential campaign in New York. Owing to his participation in the campaign, he was named special assistant to Treasury after Nixon took office. He also participated in Nixon’s re-election bid.Liddy was known for his extreme ideas and harsh tone with opponents of Nixon. One of such ideas was the Watergate scandal - a plan to bug the Democratic National Committee offices. But the plan resulted in America’s biggest political scandal. Liddy and fellow operative Howard Hunt were arrested along with five others and indicted on federal charges three months after the break-in. Liddy spent four years and four months in prison which included more than 100 days in solitary confinement although he was sentenced to 20 years. His sentence was commuted in 1977 by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. "When I did Watergate, I probably had more fun doing that than I had doing anything else.

31-03-2021||World||US senators introduce bill to prohibit funds from being used to buy Chinese solar panels||A group of powerful Republican senators has introduced a legislation to prohibit federal funds from being used to buy solar panels from companies based in China, allegedly using forced labour in Xinjiang.‘The Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act’ requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop standards and guidelines to prohibit federal funds from being used to purchase solar panels manufactured or assembled by entities with ties to the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).It also requires the Comptroller of the US to submit to Congress a report on the amount of solar panels procured by federal departments and agencies from covered entities.The bill requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to conduct an independent study of the domestic market of solar panel production and the global supply chain and workforce involved in solar panel production.“Beijing has made it clear that to do business in China, you must leave American values behind,” Senator Marco Rubio said.“As the Chinese Communist Party is actively committing genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslim minorities, it forces American companies to look the other way while profiting from its egregious human rights violations, including forced labour,” Rubio said.He said that the CPC’s crimes should not be fuelled by American taxpayer dollars.China has emerged as one of the leading manufacturers of solar panels and photovoltaic power.China is accused of committing serious human rights violations against minority Uyghurs in the resource-rich Xinjiang region.Last week several western countries - including the US, the UK, Canada and European Union members - imposed sanctions on officials in China over the situation in Xinjiang.China has repeatedly denied the allegations of abuse and has hit back with retaliatory sanctions on European officials.“No taxpayer dollars should be used to prop up the Communist Party of China, which is committing a genocide against the Uyghurs under General Secretary (and Chinese President) Xi (Jinping’s) direction, continues to threaten our ally Taiwan and strip basic rights from Hong Kongers,” Senator Rick Scott said.Reports show that many solar companies rely on materials and labour from Communist China’s Xinjiang province, which is known for forced labour and horrific abuse of the Uyghurs, he said.“My Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act, which prohibits the use of federal funds to buy solar panels from Communist China, sends a clear message to General Secretary Xi that the United States will not turn a blind eye to his genocide and human rights abuses,” Scott said.Senator John Kennedy said that the CPC is guilty of monstrous human rights violations, and the regime’s cruelty is on full display in Xinjiang, where Uyghurs are suffering in Communist prison camps.Reports indicate Beijing relies on forced labour in Xinjiang to make solar panels -- and other products -- many of which it sells to the US, he said.“Americans should have no hand in funding the CCP’s atrocities, and the Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act would ensure that federal dollars don’t fund the Communist Party, or any of its affiliated entities, through the purchase of solar panels,” Kennedy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-introduce-bill-to-prohibit-funds-from-being-used-to-buy-chinese-solar-panels-101617172820878.html

Moscow has also given emergency approval to two others, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac.The vaccine for animals, developed by a unit of Rosselkhoznadzor, was named Carnivac-Cov, the watchdog said."The clinical trials of Carnivac-Cov, which started last October, involved dogs, cats, Arctic foxes, minks, foxes and other animals," said Rosselkhoznadzor's Deputy Head Konstantin Savenkov."The results of the trials allow us to conclude that the vaccine is harmless and highly immunogenic as all the vaccinated animals developed antibodies to the coronavirus in 100% of cases."Immunity lasts for six months after vaccination, but the shot's developers are continuing to analyse this, the watchdog said.Mass production of the vaccine could start as early as April, Rosselkhoznadzor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-registers-world-s-first-covid-19-vaccine-for-animals-says-watchdog-101617172511505.html

31-03-2021||World||Seats filled for first all-civilian SpaceX launch||A college science professor and an aerospace data analyst were named on Tuesday to round out a four-member crew for a SpaceX launch into orbit planned later this year billed as the first all-civilian spaceflight in history.The two latest citizen astronauts were introduced at a news briefing livestreamed from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida by SpaceX human spaceflight chief Benji Reed and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who conceived the mission in part as a charity drive.Isaacman, founder and CEO of e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments, is forking over an unspecified but presumably exorbitant sum to fellow billionaire and SpaceX owner Elon Musk to fly himself and three others into orbit aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.The flight, scheduled for no earlier than Sept. 15, is expected to last three to four days from launch to splashdown."When this mission is complete, people are going to look at it and say this was the first time that everyday people could go to space," Isaacman, 38, told reporters.Dubbed Inspiration4, the mission is designed primarily to raise awareness and support for one of Isaacman's favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center. He has pledged $100 million personally to the institute.Assuming the role of mission "commander," Isaacman in February designated St. Jude physician's assistant Haley Arceneaux, 29, a bone cancer survivor and onetime patient at the Tennessee-based hospital, as his first crewmate.Announced on Tuesday, Chris Sembroski, 41, a Seattle-area aerospace industry employee and U.S. Air Force veteran, was selected through a sweepstakes that drew 72,000 applicants and has raised $113 million in St. Jude donations.Sian Proctor, 51, a geoscience professor at South Mountain Community College in Phoenix, Arizona, and entrepreneur who was once a NASA astronaut candidate, was chosen separately through an online business contest run by Shift4 Payments.All four will undergo extensive training modeled after the curriculum NASA astronauts use to prepare for SpaceX missions.The Inspiration4 mission may mark a new era in spaceflight, but it is not the only all-civilian crewed rocket launch in the works.British billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic enterprise is developing a spaceplane to carry paying customers on suborbital excursions.SpaceX plans a separate launch, possibly next year, of a retired NASA astronaut, a former Israeli fighter pilot and two other people in conjunction with Houston-based private spaceflight company Axiom Space.Musk also intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon in 2023. Fees charged for those flights will help finance the development of Musk's new, heavy-lift Starship rocket for missions to the moon and Mars.Inspiration4 is about more than a billionaire's joyride through space, organizers say, promising the crew will conduct a number of as-yet undetermined science experiments during its brief voyage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seats-filled-for-first-all-civilian-spacex-launch-101617168776779.html

Since October 2018, more than a dozen caravans have left Honduras, heading north.Most of the migrants say they are fleeing violence and poverty in their countries, a situation that worsened in 2020 after two devastating hurricanes and the Covid-19 pandemic.Some 100,000 people were apprehended in February at the southern US border, including nearly 9,500 unaccompanied minors, a 28 percent increase over January.Biden's administration anticipates a 20-year high in migrant arrivals this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vp-harris-thanks-guatemalan-president-for-controlling-honduras-border-101617149701820.html
31-03-2021||World||Xi Jinping's shifting China is compelling investors to run, hide or hire||For any company doing business in China, the choice is now clearer than ever: Avoid commenting on any controversial subjects or risk losing access to the world’s second-largest economy.Over the past few weeks, President Xi Jinping’s government endorsed a boycott against retailers like Hennes & Mauritz AB and slapped sanctions on a range of organizations -- including a group of barristers in the U.K. -- over statements made on alleged forced labor in Xinjiang. Then on Tuesday, he signed off on sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s election system to give Beijing veto power over any candidates.China’s more aggressive stance, triggered in part by collective action by the U.S. and its allies to sanction Chinese officials, is forcing companies to quickly weigh what they will do to maintain access to 1.4 billion consumers with ever-more spending power. So far, with growth in the rest of the world anemic, most companies are either keeping their heads down or stepping up investments.While it used to be easier for companies to operate in China and manage corporate social responsibility, now it’s difficult to show that outside influence has any impact on changing the Communist Party’s actions, according to Margaret Lewis, a law professor and China specialist at Seton Hall University.“You end up in this dilemma of stay in and be complicit or pull out,” she said. “The middle ground between those two is increasingly difficult to find. It’s a starker decision now.”The best strategy for brands like H&M facing a boycott in China is to lay low and wait until the backlash “blows over,” Joerg Wuttke, head of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. Indeed, several companies pulled statements on Xinjiang off their websites.Complicated picture“It’s a complicated picture,” Wuttke said. “On the one hand, China saved the skin of many companies last year,” he said. “At the same time, you have of course this kind of political pressure that is on you, and again a topic like Xinjiang is a no-win situation.”Many foreign companies with good relations are expanding their presence in China, and Hong Kong’s finance sector is booming this year due to an influx of IPOs and work on SPAC listing deals. Companies including Baidu Inc. and Bilibili Inc. have raised almost $17 billion through first-time shares sales in the city so far this year, up nine times from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.New York-based Citigroup Inc. plans to hire as many as 1,700 staff in Hong Kong as it seeks to tap growing links between the financial hub and rising affluence in southern mainland cities such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen. A pandemic-induced hunger for technology stocks and the threat of U.S. delistings have been a boon for the financial hub, driving a surge in initial and secondary share sales.For some international law firms advising companies, however, the environment for working in Hong Kong just got a lot trickier. China’s retaliatory sanctions against the U.K. included the Essex Court Chambers, which a prominent lawyer warned could have much bigger consequences for investors.After being hit with the sanctions, the Financial Times reported that the chambers removed a reference from its website to a legal opinion by some of its lawyers implicating the Chinese government in alleged genocide in Xinjiang. The Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper said the action showed that China’s sanction were an “effective deterrent against rumors.”But Guy Sandhurst, formerly chairman of the Bar of England and Wales, said the move will affect “all British companies who do business with Chinese clients” because lawyers involved in dispute resolution for Hong Kong firms could be denied access to the territory. He called for the “Western world” to insist on dispute resolution mechanisms outside China for all future contracts.“Today it is the members of Essex Court Chambers who are sanctioned,” Sandhurst wrote on the website of the Society of Conservative Lawyers. “But tomorrow it might be Clifford Chance, Freshfields or some other major city law firm or Chambers of barristers which wittingly or otherwise offends the Chinese state.”Xi’s move on Tuesday to officially revamp Hong Kong’s election system could unleash another round of criticism and potential sanctions against Western nations, which have failed to change China’s behavior. The changes allow a small group of mainland and Hong Kong national security officials to vet every candidate standing for election, ensuring that only those loyal to Beijing are able to implement policy.Dangerous decisionsIn a letter printed on the front pages of several Hong Kong newspapers on Wednesday, leader Carrie Lam said the changes will help mitigate “excessive politicization” in society and allow the territory “to develop the economy and improve the livelihood of our citizens.” Former chief executive Leung Chun-ying echoed that in an interview on Tuesday.“A lot of opportunities,” he said when asked about Hong Kong’s economic future. “It is a question of opening our minds, our eyes and ears to these opportunities and then just share with the international community.”But while Xi’s actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang may look tough and Chinese officials are talking to the world “like now they have nothing to learn,” the moves actually reveal a paranoia that could end up backfiring among companies and countries, according to Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who’s authored several books on Chinese foreign policy.“It’s a kind of nervousness, which is a sign of weakness and a sign that they don’t feel secure,” he said. “And that’s worrisome, because when you’re insecure you may embark on dangerous decisions and actions toward others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-s-shifting-china-is-compelling-investors-to-run-hide-or-hire-101617168565253.html
31-03-2021||World||US trade war pushing China to steal tech, talent, Taiwan says||The China-US trade war is pushing Beijing to step up its efforts to steal technology and poach talent from Taiwan to boost China's semiconductor industry's self-sufficiency, the government of the tech-powerhouse island said on Wednesday.Washington has taken aim at China's tech industry during the bitter trade dispute, putting sanctions on firms including telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd, saying they are a threat to national security, angering Beijing.Chinese-claimed Taiwan is home to a thriving and world-leading chip industry, and the government has long worried about China's efforts to copy that success, through fair means or foul.Speaking at a parliamentary committee meeting on how to respond to the "red supply chain" - a reference to the colour of China's ruling Communist Party - Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said the trade war had created new risks."Affected by the U.S.-China technology war, the development of mainland China's semiconductor industry has been obstructed, but they are still committed to the industry's development," she said."In order to achieve self-sufficiency in the supply chain, poaching and infiltration are the quickest way for mainland China to do this," Wang added.Taiwan's chip workers have deep experience and speak the same language, meaning they are a "natural target for poaching China has latched onto", she added.China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Hu Mu-yuan, deputy head of Taiwan's National Security Bureau, said China's efforts were a threat to not just Taiwan, but also Japan and South Korea, threatening global trade and fair competition."Moreover, the Chinese communists are stealing other countries intellectual property to boost their own power," he added.Taiwan has strict laws to try and prevent this from happening, but officials have warned China tries to skirt them by setting up front companies on the island, using Taiwanese headhunters and other methods."Preventing Taiwan's key technology and high-tech personnel from being infiltrated by the 'red supply chain' has become an important task to protect our industry's competitiveness and ensure our economic security," Hu said.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Beijing newsroom.

31-03-2021||World||Myanmar junta deepens violence with new air attacks in east||The military launched more airstrikes Tuesday in eastern Myanmar after earlier attacks forced thousands of ethnic Karen to flee into Thailand and further escalating violence two months after the junta seized power.Thailand’s prime minister said the villagers who fled the weekend airstrikes returned home of their own accord, denying that his country’s security forces had forced them back.But the situation in eastern Myanmar appeared to be getting more, not less, dangerous.The Karen National Union, the main political body representing the Karen minority, said the airstrikes were the latest case of Myanmar's military breaking a cease-fire agreement and it would have to respond.The attacks came as protests continued in Myanmar cities against the coup Feb. 1 that ousted an elected civilian government and reversed a decade of progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian country. Hundreds of civilians have been killed by security forces trying to put down opposition to the coup.The U.S. State Department on Tuesday ordered non-essential U.S. diplomats and their families to leave Myanmar, expecting the protests to continue. The U.S. earlier suspended a trade deal and imposed sanctions on junta leaders as well as restricted business with military holding companies.Tuesday's air raids in eastern Myanmar killed six civilians and wounded 11, said Saw Taw Nee, head of the KNU's foreign affairs department.Dave Eubank, a member of the Free Burma Rangers, which provides medical assistance in the region, provided the same information on casualties.The KNU has been fighting for greater autonomy for the Karen people. It issued a statement from one of its armed units saying “military ground troops are advancing into our territories from all fronts” and vowing to respond.“We have no other options left but to confront these serious threats posed by the illegitimate military junta’s army in order to defend our territory, our Karen peoples, and their self-determination rights,” said the statement, issued in the name of the KNU office for the district that was first attacked on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, speaking before the latest air attacks, said his country is ready to shelter anyone who is escaping fighting, as Thailand has done many times for decades. His comments came a day after humanitarian groups said Thailand has been sending back some of the thousands of people who fled.“There is no influx of refugees yet. We asked those who crossed to Thailand if they have any problem in their area. When they say no problem, we just asked them to return to their land first. We asked, we did not use any force,” Prayuth told reporters.“We won’t push them back,” he said. ’If they are having fighting, how can we do so? But if they don’t have any fighting at the moment, can they go back first?”The governor of Thailand's Mae Hong Son province, where as many as 3,000 refugees had sought shelter, said later that those still on Thai soil were expected to return to their own country in a day or two.Protests against the junta continued in several Myanmar cities Tuesday despite its lethal crackdown that killed more than 100 people on Saturday alone.Engineers, teachers and students from the technology university in the southern city of Dawei marched without incident.The number of protesters killed in the city rose to eight with the announcement of the death of a teenager who was shot by soldiers on Saturday as he rode a motorbike with two friends. According to local media, a hospital certificate attributed his death to “serious injuries as he fell from a motorbike.”Medical workers in Mandalay, the country’s second-biggest city, honored three of their colleagues who have been killed by security forces. The two doctors and a nurse were remembered in a simple ceremony in front of a banner with their photographs and the words “Rest In Power.”At a cemetery in the biggest city, Yangon, three families gave their last farewells to relatives killed Monday in a night of chaos in the South Dagon neighborhood. Residents said police and soldiers moved through the streets firing randomly with live ammunition.At least 510 protesters have been killed since the coup, according to Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which counts those it can document and says the actual toll is likely much higher. It says 2,574 people have been detained, a total that includes the deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy party was reelected in the November elections by a landslide.At Thailand’s Mae Sam Laep village along the Salween River, which forms the border with Myanmar, paramilitary Thai Rangers on Tuesday twice waved off a boat that had come from the other side carrying seven people, including one lying flat and another with a bandage on his head. But ambulances soon arrived on the Thai side and it landed anyway.Thai villagers helped medical staff carry the injured people on stretchers to a small clinic at a nearby checkpoint. One man had large bruises on his back with open wounds, an injury one medical staffer said could have been caused by an explosion.An elderly woman in the group had small cuts and scabs all over her face. Thai nurses in protective gear to guard against COVID-19 attended to her, testing her and others for the coronavirus.Another villager from the boat, 48-year-old Aye Ja Bi, said he had been wounded by a bomb dropped by a plane. His legs were hit by shrapnel and his ears were ringing, he said, but he was unable to travel to get help until Tuesday.The airstrikes appeared to be retaliation for an attack by guerrillas under the command of the KNU on a government military outpost in which they claimed to have killed 10 soldiers and captured eight. Tuesday's KNU statement charged that the strikes had been planned before that.About 2,500-3,000 refugees crossed into Thailand on Sunday, according to several humanitarian aid agencies who have long worked with the Karen.They said on Monday, however, that Thai soldiers had begun to force people to return to Myanmar.“They told them it was safe to go back even though it is not safe. They were afraid to go back but they had no choice,” said a spokesperson for the Karen Peace Support Network, a group of Karen civil society organizations in Myanmar.The army has restricted journalists’ access to the area where the villagers crossed the border.Myanmar’s government has battled Karen guerrillas on and off for years — along with other ethnic minorities seeking more autonomy — but the airstrikes marked a major escalation of violence.Political organizations representing the Karen and Kachin in northern Myanmar have warned in recent weeks that junta forces have been shooting protesters in their regions and threatening a response.They were joined Tuesday by the Three Brothers Alliance, which represent the guerrilla armies of the Rakhine, Kokang and Ta-ang — also known as Palaung. The alliance said if the killing of protesters did not stop immediately, they would abandon a self-declared cease-fire and join with other groups to protect the people.The statements from the various ethnic minority groups seemed to suggest their own militaries would respond within their home regions, not in the cities of central Myanmar where the protests and the junta's repression have been the strongest.Supporters of the protest movement are hoping that the ethnic armed groups could help pressure the junta. Protest leaders in hiding say they have held talks, but there have been no commitments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-deepens-violence-with-new-air-attacks-in-east-101617155168253.html
31-03-2021||World||Migrant kids crowded into Texas facility as space runs low||More than 500 migrant children were packed into plastic-walled rooms built for 32 people, sitting inches apart on mats with foil blankets Tuesday at the largest US Customs and Border Protection holding facility for unaccompanied children.Overall, CBP's main child processing center, a compound of white tents in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, held over 4,100 migrants, more than 3,400 of them children who traveled to the US-Mexico border alone and the rest of them families. It is designed for 250 people under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the coronavirus pandemic.The Biden administration allowed journalists to see conditions for the first time since the facility opened Feb. 9 amid a spike in families and unaccompanied children crossing the border.It was a grim picture.A 3,200-square-foot (297-square-meter) space had been divided into several rooms for 32 children each under CDC guidelines, each separated by thick plastic walls instead of the chain-link fence used by previous administrations. Despite the health recommendations, one of the “pods" held nearly 700 kids, another had nearly 600 and others had just above 500. Everyone wore masks, but Covid-19 tests aren't done unless they show symptoms.Doors to the rooms were open for free movement but there was little room to roam and no one to play games. Most children just sat on the ground close together, chatting quietly. Some were wrapped in foil blankets. Lights are dimmed at night.Children, most of them between 13 and 17, are separated by age. Families occupied a separate pod that was less crowded than the jam-packed rooms for older children.A room for “tender age” children from 3 to 9 years old consisted of a walled playpen with mats on the floor and far more space than the eight pods for older children. An 11-year-old boy cared for his 3-year-old sister, and a 17-year-old cared for her newborn.“I’m a Border Patrol agent. I didn’t sign up for this,” Oscar Escamilla, acting executive officer of the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, said while looking at the younger kids.The children are processed in the tent-like facility in the Texas border town of Donna before being taken to longer-term care facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services and then placed with a family member, relative or sponsor.About two dozen of some 270 children being transferred to HHS midday tested positive for Covid-19 — the only time they are tested unless they exhibit symptoms earlier. Escamilla said the overall positivity rate at the Donna facility was about 14%.As they prepared to leave, children who tested negative for COVID-19 played soccer in the outdoor recreation area, where they can go three times a day when their pods are being cleaned. Those who tested positive for the virus gathered around metal benches off to the side and will still go to HHS centers.The Border Patrol is apprehending far more children daily than HHS is taking, leading to a severe backlog. The Border Patrol is not supposed to detain children for more than three days, but HHS lacks space.More than 2,000 kids have been at the Donna facility for more than 72 hours, including 39 for more than 15 days. One child had been there 20 days. The average stay was 133 hours.“The intent of the Border Patrol is not detention. We’re not in the business of detention,” said Escamilla, the official who supervised the media tour. “We’re forced into the business because we can’t turn them over to anybody.”HHS is housing children at convention centers in Dallas and San Diego and is opening large-scale sites in San Antonio, El Paso and elsewhere.A large HHS facility is being built near the holding center in Donna, separated by a chain-link fence. Noise from construction equipment filled the air near seven buses that were to take children to other HHS facilities.About 250 to 300 children enter the Donna facility daily and far fewer leave, a “lopsided” difference that Escamilla said was leading to more crowded conditions. It has held as many as 4,600 migrants.More than 17,000 unaccompanied children were in U.S. custody as of Monday, about 12,000 with HHS and the rest with Customs and Border Protection. On Monday, 446 children entered CBP custody but only 229 went to HHS.HHS, which opened a facility Tuesday for 500 children at Fort Bliss in Texas, is working to build up to a capacity of 13,500 beds, spokesman Mark Weber said.Several hundred kids and teenagers are crossing the border daily, most fleeing violence, poverty or the effects of natural disasters in Central America. President Joe Biden has declined to resume his predecessor's practice of expelling unaccompanied children.But his administration has continued expelling adults under a coronavirus-related public health declaration enacted by former President Donald Trump. Biden also has tried to expel most families traveling together, but changes in Mexican law have forced agents to release many parents and children into the U.S.In some cases, parents refused entry into the U.S. have sent their children across the border alone, hoping they will be placed with relatives eventually.Biden has faced intense pressure to bring more transparency to how large numbers of migrant children are being treated. In his administration’s first tour of the Donna holding facility, two journalists from The Associated Press and a crew from CBS shared text, photos and video with other news outlets as part of a pool arrangement.At the facility, children entered a tent with a dirt floor and three rows of bleacher-style seats. About 60 children waited to be admitted Tuesday, all wearing masks and seated close together.They then go into a small room for lice and scabies inspection and a general health check, including whether they have a fever. Their hair is hosed down.The facility is staffed by physician assistants and nurse practitioners, who perform psychological tests, including asking children if they have had any suicidal thoughts. All shoelaces are removed to avoid harm to anyone.Amid the loud hum of air conditioning vents, children are led to a room for processing, with anyone 14 and older getting photographed and having their fingerprints taken. Younger kids don't.In another room, agents ask them if they have a contact in the U.S. and allow the child to speak with them by phone. Plastic shields separate the agents and the children, who are seated at tables. They get bracelets with a barcode that shows a history of when they showered, medical conditions and any other personal information.All children are given notices to appear in immigration court, clearing the way for them to be released to Health and Human Services. About 1,200 children were ready for release Tuesday but there was nowhere to send them, Escamilla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-kids-crowded-into-texas-facility-as-space-runs-low-101617152468250.html

I'd be attacked anyway."“What I do believe, in this current climate, is that it wouldn't matter what I did or didn't do,” he wrote. “The attacks weren't intended for me. They were meant to wound my dad.”In the memoir, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, the president's son chronicles a lifelong battle with alcohol and drug addiction and numerous stints in and out of rehab.Hunter Biden writes that his descent into darkness followed the death of his older brother, Beau, of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46. He ends the book where he currently is in life: sober, living in California with his second wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and their baby son, Beau. Hunter Biden also has three daughters from his previous marriage.During the 2020 campaign against Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump, a Republican, and his allies repeatedly sought to make an issue of the younger Biden's work for the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Trump alleged unspecified shady dealings by the Bidens despite the lack of evidence of any wrongdoing by either candidate Biden or his son.Trump ultimately was impeached by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House for pushing Kyiv to investigate the Biden family. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to keep Trump in office.Hunter Biden writes that his only misjudgment was not considering, back in 2014 when he joined Burisma's board to help oversee its corporate practices, that Trump would be in the White House three years into the future.A lawyer and former lobbyist, he joined Burisma's board around the time his father was vice president and helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy in eastern Europe.Trump and others had insisted without evidence that Hunter Biden was exploiting his father’s name, and they raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption.“Knowing all of that now: No, I would not do it again,” Hunter Biden wrote. “I wouldn't take the seat on Burisma's board. Trump would have to look elsewhere to find a suitable distraction for his impeachable behavior.”The book's title, “Beautiful Things,” is an expression Hunter Biden and his brother would use with each other after Beau's diagnosis and was meant to stress what was important in life.The memoir was in the works before Joe Biden became the front-runner in the Democratic presidential campaign. It was kept under wraps even as Hunter Biden’s business dealings became a fixation of Trump and his allies during the election, and his finances the subject of a Justice Department investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunter-biden-says-he-wouldn-t-repeat-work-for-ukrainian-firm-101617167548761.html

The residential compound where the infections were found has been locked down.The city also ordered a crackdown on people who cross the border illegally, anyone who shelters them and those who organize such border crossings. It wasn't immediately clear how the outbreak started.China has largely eradicated the spread of the coronavirus and takes strict measures whenever a new cluster emerges. Ruili has closed all businesses except supermarkets, drugstores and food markets. Checkpoints were set up to restrict entry to epidemic-related vehicles.The first case was identified Monday, and subsequent testing of close contacts and others turned up the other ones, the Yunnan Health Commission said.Three of the infected people, all Myanmar nationals in their 20s, did not have any Covid-19 symptoms. Of the others, four Chinese and one Myanmar citizen were classified as mild cases, and the remaining Chinese person as a regular case. They ranged in age from 22 to 42 years old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-covid-19-outbreak-on-border-with-myanmar-101617167704842.html

That expansion will be powered by India and Bangladesh, helping South Asia regain its historical growth rate by 2022, it said.The success of South Asian nations in containing virus caseloads through lockdowns and other curbs and a combination of fiscal and monetary policy support helped improve the economic outlook for the region. But the recovery remains fragile and masks long-terms risks, the World Bank warned.“The pandemic is not yet under control,” said Hartwig Schafer, the bank’s vice president for the region. “South Asian countries need to ramp up their vaccination programs and invest their scarce resources wisely to set a foundation for a more inclusive and resilient future.”While the effect of pandemic-control measures such as school closures may not be evident for years, lack of access to education could amplify learning losses and result in a huge economic cost for South Asia, the lender said. An estimated 5.5 million children dropped out of school in the region, which could translate into more than $1 trillion dollars in lost earnings, it said.Here are some other key vulnerabilities highlighted in the report:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-bangladesh-to-aid-south-asia-s-historical-growth-by-2022-world-bank-101617166834612.html

A commentary published by People.cn on Monday described the incident as “unforgivable.” The website is run by the People’s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece.NASA lets net users sign up to send their name to Mars on a future flight. Taiwan appears as an option on a “country” drop-down box, as does the Vatican. It’s unclear how long Taiwan has been called a country on the website, but more than 18 million people have registered.An emailed request for comment sent to NASA outside regular business hours was not immediately answered.Foreign companies often get in trouble with the Chinese government over political issues. Chinese net users last week called for a boycott of Hennes & Mauritz AB over an undated statement on its website saying it won’t use cotton from the Xinjiang region.The retailer was also criticized by the Communist Youth League and the People’s Liberation Army. Western governments including the US accuse China of sending as many as 1 million Muslim Uyghurs to work camps in Xinjiang. Beijing denies the allegations, saying it is fighting religious extremism and providing jobs.In 2018, US airlines stopped referring to Taiwan as a country after pressure from the Chinese government.China’s Communist Party views Taiwan as its territory, which must be taken by force if necessary. The government in Taipei rejects Beijing’s claim, insisting Taiwan is already a de facto sovereign nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-is-the-latest-to-offend-china-by-calling-taiwan-a-country-101617166388530.html

That includes addressing profound inequities, including systemic racism,” he said. “We don’t pretend these problems don’t exist or try to sweep them under the rug. We don’t ignore them. We deal with them in the daylight, with full transparency.”Also Read | US President Biden to let Trump’s H1-B visa ban expire in win for tech firmsIn the executive summary of the section on India, the report acknowledged progress in Jammu & Kashmir. “The government continued taking steps to restore normalcy in Jammu & Kashmir by gradually lifting some security and communications restrictions. The government released most political activists from detention. In January, the government partially restored internet access; however, high-speed 4G mobile internet remained restricted in most parts of Jammu and Kashmir.”The summary also included a long list of significant human rights issues in India, which were dealt with in some detail later in the report. It referred to “unlawful and arbitrary killings” by police; torture by some police and prison officials; “arbitrary” arrests and detentions; “harsh and life-threatening” prison conditions; political prisoners or detainees in certain states.It also referred to “restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, including violence, threats of violence, or unjustified arrests or prosecutions against journalists, use of criminal libel laws to prosecute social media speech, censorship, and site blocking”.The summary went on to list “overly restrictive rules” on non-governmental organisations; “restrictions” on political participation; “widespread corruption at all levels in the government”; “lack” of investigation of and accountability for violence against women; “tolerance” of violations of religious freedom; crimes involving violence and discrimination targeting members of minority groups including women based on religious affiliation or social status; and “forced and compulsory child labour, as well as bonded labour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-has-rights-issues-but-situation-improving-in-j-k-says-us-state-dept-101617163611602.html

All you need to know||An unknown brain disease has caused panic in the New Brunswick province of Canada after a string of cases were reported that involved memory loss, hallucinations and muscle atrophy, according to a report in The Guardian. People living in the province became cognizant of the disease after a memo from the province’s public health agency leaked last week which asked doctors to look for symptoms relate to Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). CJD is a rare brain disease which is caused due to abnormally folded proteins called prions.Here’s everything you need to know about the unknown brain disease that has worried the health experts and officials in Canada:1. Public health officials in the province have been tracking 43 cases of the unknown brain disease since 2015 when it was first identified, The Guardian reported.2. The province's health officials told CBS News that 24 cases of the disease were reported in 2020 and six cases have been reported in 2021 itself. Officials have also linked five deaths with the disease.3. The cases were first related to CJD as some symptoms of the rare disease like memory loss, vision loss, inconsistent jerking movements have been associated with it. Although, the link has not been confirmed till now. “We don’t have evidence to suggest it’s a prion disease,” said Dr Alier Marrero, the neurologist who is leading the investigation into the cases, according to The Guardian.4. The symptoms of the unknown disease include pains, spasms, behavioural changes and between 18 to 36 months, the patients are said to develop decline in cognitive abilities, wasting of muscles or atrophy and teeth chattering. Some patients experienced hallucinations as well.5. Although the health officials have not disclosed the location of the cases related to the unknown disease, most of the cases are being linked to the Acadian peninsula.6. Some researchers have also linked the cases to environmental causes. According to the report in CBS News, some possible suspects include B-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and domoic acid, toxins that can accumulate in fish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-brain-disorder-in-canada-all-you-need-to-know-101617161050862.html
31-03-2021||World||New York on way to be 2nd-largest pot market in US, home growers to gain||New York moved toward creating the nation’s second-largest market for legal marijuana when the state Legislature passed Tuesday a bill that would impose special pot taxes and allow the licensing of dispensaries.The measure (S.854A /A.1248A) would allow cannabis storefronts to open as soon as next year, and would let home growers start cultivating their own pot. It would limit the number of licenses for large corporations, and impose sales and excise taxes that are estimated to eventually bring in about $350 million a year.The legislation would set in motion automatic expungement of records for people with previous convictions for activities that would no longer be criminalized when marijuana is legalized for use by adults 21 and older.The Senate voted for the measure 40-23. The Assembly cleared the bill by a vote of 100-49. Both chambers’ votes were largely along party lines.“There were many important aspects of this legislation that needed to be addressed correctly — especially the racial disparities that have plagued our state’s response to marijuana use and distribution as well as ensuring public safety — and I am proud that through strong collaboration, we have reached the finish line,” state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) said in a news release.Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has said he will sign the bill, which he negotiated with lawmakers in a handshake deal last week.Once New York’s program is fully rolled out, it’s anticipated to generate tens of thousands of jobs and about $4.2 billion in sales, surpassing Washington state and trailing only California, which had about $4.4 billion in sales last year.‘A Liability’Several lawmakers in both houses, mainly Republicans, brought up concerns with people under the influence of marijuana driving or going to work and using heavy machinery.“This legislation will be a liability,” said state Sen. Mario R. Mattera (R). “Our contractors are against this, the building trades are against this.”Mattera, who voted “no” on the bill, also expressed concern over the dangers of drug use, particularly for youth. He described experiencing this problem in his own family, and called marijuana a “gateway” drug.“This is a disaster waiting to happen,” he said.Taxes, RevenueThe legislation includes two kinds of new taxes: a 13% sales tax, with the money raised divided between the state (9%) and localities (4%), plus a distributor excise tax of as much as 3 cents per milligram of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, using a sliding scale based on the type of product and its potency.Tax revenue would be used to run and oversee the state cannabis program, with the remaining money divided between programs that try to help people rebuild their lives after marijuana possession arrests, as well as their communities. The revenue would also go to education and drug treatment in the state.Cities, towns, and villages would have until the end of this year to opt out from having dispensaries and pot cafes in their communities.Delivery, Pot CafesUp to 3 ounces of cannabis and 24 grams of cannabis concentrate would be legally permitted for personal possession outside of the home. Up to 5 pounds of cannabis will be allowed in a private residence, as long as it’s in a secure location out of the reach of those under age 21, according to the bill.The proposal allows for the personal cultivation of cannabis, with an adult 21 or older permitted to have up to three mature plants and three immature plants. Per household, the limit would be six of each kind of plant. Home cultivation would become legal in six months for medical marijuana patients and legal for others no later than 18 months after the first shops open, dependent upon state regulations.The legislation also would expand eligibility for medical marijuana.The bill would allow pot delivery services, with each licensee able to have the equivalent of up to 25 full-time employees. And it would allow for on-site pot consumption, as long as the cannabis cafes aren’t within 500 feet of a school, or 200 feet from a house of worship.Social Equity, LicensingNew York lawmakers also baked social and economic equity proposals into the legislation.A single company wouldn’t be allowed to handle all parts of a recreational transaction — cultivation, processing, distributing, and dispensing — with the exception of micro businesses. A cultivator or processor would be barred from having a direct or indirect financial interest in a retail dispensary.A state Cannabis Control Board and Office of Cannabis Management would be required to take small businesses into consideration and prioritize “social and economic equity” applicants from communities disproportionately impacted when marijuana was illegal. Priority for licenses also would go to those who make less than 80% of their county’s median income, and those convicted in the past of a marijuana-related offense.The bill sets a goal of allocating half of the adult-use licenses to a minority- or woman-owned business, distressed farmers, service-disabled veterans, or “social and economic equity” applicants.The state would also create business incubator programs for social equity applicants, make low- and zero-interest loans available to them, and would be permitted to waive their licensing fees, according to the bill.“Passage of this bill will mean not just legalizing marijuana, but investing in education and our communities, and bring to an end decades of disproportionately targeting people of color under state and federal drug laws,” Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D) said in a news release. “Now, this legal industry will create jobs across our state, including for those who have had their lives upended by years of unjust drug laws.”Medical DispensariesCompanies that already have a medical license in New York could have a slight advantage over newcomers when the state opens up to recreational use. There are 10, five of which are among the U.S.’s largest multi-state operators; Acreage Holdings, Columbia Care, Cresco Labs, Curaleaf, and Green Thumb Industries.Adult-use cannabis could be sold at only three of a medical operator’s dispensaries, and they could be able to sell their own products at other retail dispensaries. They could also obtain a license to distribute, cultivate, and process cannabis, but they would only be able allowed to distribute their own products, according to the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-on-way-to-be-2nd-largest-pot-market-in-us-home-growers-to-gain-101617159078689.html
31-03-2021||World||Indian-American Congressman pushes for USD 10-trillion re-industrialisation plan||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has pushed for a massive USD 10 trillion investment plans over a decade to re-industrialise the country.On the eve of President Joe Biden unveiling his economic vision, Khanna, in an interview to 'Fox News' on Tuesday, said there was need for a massive investment to re-industrialise US."What we're saying is, let's at least have consensus on re-industrialising America. That's productive investment," he said. "Up to USD 10 trillion over 10 years to re-industrialise America, so that we're producing batteries here, electric vehicles here, and having critical manufacturing supplies here.""But I do think that we have to pay for it. I mean, we have to pay for most of it. A start would be to actually collect taxes from those who are evading taxes. Larry Summers has a proposal that, if we just enforced the tax on people who aren't paying tax right now, we could collect up to USD 1.2 trillion in 10 years. So, that's what I would say is the first starting point," he said.Responding to a question, Khanna said he was completely opposed to a mileage tax or a gas tax."That hurts working families. That hurts people in rural America who have to commute long distances. I think it would be tone-deaf to have that kind of a tax," he said."What I'm talking about in terms of collecting taxes isn't just going after fraud and abuse. Right now, a lot of business income is not disclosed. If you created a new IRS form that required banks to have the disclosure of input and output in terms of accounts, you would be able to collect a lot more," he added.Khanna supported Biden's move to raise rates on those making over USD 400,000, and raising top marginal rates on them."I would consider a financial transaction tax on speculation. I would rather our money be going to producing batteries. Right now, China is eating our lunch when it comes to lithium ion battery production. They get all of the cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo," he said."Don't we want America producing those lithium ion batteries? Don't we want to be producing the electric vehicles? Don't we want to be producing critical manufacturing supplies? We couldn't even have masks. I mean, in World War II, we armed our entire military," Khanna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-congressman-pushes-for-usd-10-trillion-re-industrialisation-plan-101617156553561.html
31-03-2021||World||'Can't be silent': Biden announces actions to respond to anti-Asian violence||US President Joe Biden has announced additional actions to respond to the violence and xenophobia perpetrated against Asian Americans.The announcements on Tuesday include reinstating and reinvigorating the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), with initial focus on anti-Asian bias and violence"We can't be silent in the face of rising violence against Asian Americans," Biden tweeted. "That's why today I'm taking additional steps to respond-including establishing an initiative at the Department of Justice to address anti-Asian crimes. These attacks are wrong, un-American, and must stop."The announcement also include allocation of USD 49.5 million from the American Rescue Plan to a new grant programme for community-based, culturally-specific services and programmes for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault who face additional barriers, such as language access barriers, to services and safety.Biden, who during his prime time address had said anti-Asian violence and xenophobia was wrong and must stop, also announced to set up a Covid-19 Equity Task Force committee on addressing and ending xenophobia against Asian Americans and establishment of a Department of Justice cross-agency initiative to address anti-Asian violence."A harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us," Vice President Kamala Harris tweeted.The president and "I will not be silent which is why our administration is taking steps to address the rise in violence against the Asian American community, including an initiative to combat anti-Asian violence," Harris said.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that in the coming weeks, the administration will meet with AAPI leaders to hear their input in how it can play the most constructive role possible in the community.Biden will name a high-level Asian American member of the AAPI community to a position in the White House, she said."That's something we're working to do through consultation with a range of officials and elected officials as well. That person will be a commissioned officer and will be working on both policy and outreach," Psaki said."A big part of our effort has also been on taking actions to address the rise in anti-Asian violence and bias, and underscoring the commitment of our entire administration to working in partnership with the AAPI community," she said."The President announced that DOJ has launched an agency-wide initiative to address anti-Asian hate crimes and acts of violence. DOJ is taking steps to strengthen hate crimes data, reporting on AAPI violence, improve law enforcement training so that local law enforcement agencies can better identify anti-Asian bias," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-be-silent-biden-announces-actions-to-respond-to-anti-asian-violence-101617156532701.html

31-03-2021||World||WHO chief toughens tone on China with lab probe call||The WHO's chief, long accused of complacency towards Beijing, hardened his tone Tuesday, urging further investigation into a theory Covid-19 sprang from a laboratory leak.The director-general of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also rebuked China for sitting on key data.The theory that the new coronavirus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city where it was first detected in humans in December 2019, was a US favourite under former president Donald Trump.China has always flatly rejected the hypothesis.And the team of international experts sent to Wuhan by the World Health Organization earlier this year to probe the pandemic's origins have also all but ruled it out.Their long-delayed report, written alongside the team's Chinese counterparts and published Tuesday, ranked four hypotheses in order of probability.They said the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 disease most probably jumped from bats to humans via an intermediary animal, judging a lab leak to be an "extremely unlikely" source.But Tedros said Tuesday the probe into Wuhan's virology labs had not gone far enough, adding that he was prepared to launch a fresh investigation."I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough," he told the UN health agency's 194 member states, in a briefing on the Covid origins report."Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions," he said."Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy."- More data call -Tedros also urged China to be more forthcoming with data -- a call echoed by several countries led by the United States, Britain and Japan.Tedros said the Wuhan mission found that the first detected case had symptom onset on December 8, 2019 -- but to understand the earliest cases, scientists would benefit from full access to data stretching back to at least September 2019.The team "expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data. I expect future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing," said Tedros.Hitherto, the WHO chief has faced allegations throughout the pandemic of being too close to China -- notably from the former Trump administration, which zeroed in on the lab leak theory.Peter Ben Embarek, who led the international mission to Wuhan, said the report had "only scratched the surface" in the quest to find the origins of the pandemic, which has killed nearly 2.8 million people and battered the global economy.The WHO food safety expert said he was "optimistic" the team would discover more "and get closer to the final answer".- Lab leak 'first reaction'On the laboratory accident hypothesis, the Danish scientist said the natural initial reaction to the outbreak of the virus, in a city housing virology labs, was to make the connection between the two."Even the staff in these labs told us that was their first reaction," Ben Embarek told journalists Tuesday."They all went back to their records... but nobody could find any trace of something similar to this virus in their records or their samples."Nobody has been able to pick up any firm arguments or proof or evidence that any of these labs would have been involved in a lab leak accident."That said, Ben Embarek added: "we haven't done a full investigation or audit of any of the labs."He said there had been hours of discussions with laboratory staff and management. The documentation seen by the team had not led them to believe there was anything further left to explore.But the balance of the hypotheses could be reassessed as further leads come in, he added.The United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Australia, Israel, Britain and seven other European countries issued a joint statement voicing concerns that the investigation "was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples".Independent experts needed "full access to all pertinent human, animal, and environmental data, research, and personnel", they said.China's foreign ministry said in a statement: "Actions politicising this search for the origins will only seriously hinder global cooperation in this regard, undermine the global anti-epidemic efforts and cause more loss of life."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-toughens-tone-on-china-with-lab-probe-call-101617153971298.html
31-03-2021||World||In Photos: Cautious appreciation as Japan's famous cherry blossoms bloom early||The cherry blossom season which is regarded as the traditional sign of spring in Japan, peaked at the earliest this year since formal records began around 1,200 years ago. The blossoms, which are called ‘sakura’ in Japanese, used to reach peak bloom in April. According to scientists, early flowerings are likely to be connected to climate change. In Kyoto, which experienced a warmer spring this year, the season peaked on March 26, according to data collated by the Osaka University. Similar patterns were seen in more than 12 cities across the country.Traditional importance of ‘sakura’The appearance of the blossoming of sakura has tremendous importance in Japan’s culture. Due to their nature of blooming en masse, they symbolise clouds, which is considered a metaphor for the transitory nature of life. Moreover, the trees bloom for a very short duration, about two weeks each year from first bud to all the blossoms falling off, a reflection of the ephemeral nature of beauty.The concept of awareness of the transience of things, which is called mono no aware in Japanese, is extremely pertinent to the country’s culture. Due to their importance in Japanese culture, the cherry blossoms are used in Japanese art, films and even represented on consumer goods.Earliest peak bloomEach year, the progress of the cherry blossom season is monitored in Japan by the country’s meteorological agency. This year, the cherry blossoms reached their earliest peak bloom ever based on formal records.The meteorological agency tracks 58 cherry trees across the country and this year 40 of the trees tracked have already reached peak bloom according to the agency. The agency also said that 14 of 40 trees have reached peak bloom in record time.“We can say it’s most likely because of the impact of global warming,” said Shunji Anbe, an official at the observations division at the Japan meteorological agency according to news agency Reuters.According to data provided by the agency, average temperature in Kyoto in March rose to 10.6 degrees Celsius (51.1 F) in 2020 from 8.6 C (47.5 F) in 1953, which is being considered as the major reason for the early peak blossoms.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-photos-cautious-appreciation-as-japan-s-famous-cherry-blossoms-bloom-early-101617154131820.html
31-03-2021||World||World leaders eye global deal to tackle outbreaks||Leaders of 23 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday backed a plan to create an international treaty that would help the world deal with future health emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic.The idea of such a treaty, which would ensure equitable access to vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for pandemics, was floated by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, at a G20 summit last November. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom then endorsed the idea at its governing body meeting in January, but formal negotiations haven’t begun, say diplomats.On Tuesday, the treaty proposal got the backing of the leaders of Fiji, Portugal, Romania, Britain, Rwanda, Kenya, France, Germany, Greece, South Korea, Chile, Costa Rica, Albania, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, the Netherlands, Tunisia, Senegal, Spain, Norway, Serbia, Indonesia, Ukraine and also the WHO.“There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone,” the leaders wrote in an opinion article in major newspapers. “We believe that nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response.”Canada, meanwhile, has halted the use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for people below 55, while Germany has paused its use for those under 60 due to concerns over blood clots, although a link is yet to be established.Pakistan’s top leadership has been hit by the coronavirus with President Arif Alvi and defence minister Pervez Khattak contracting the disease, just days after Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife tested positive for Covid-19.On Monday, Alvi tweeted that he had tested positive for the disease. “I have tested positive for Covid-19...

Frazier, 18, said she began recording because “he was suffering, he was in pain”.Frazier grew emotional at times, breathing heavily and crying as she viewed pictures of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd. “I knew it was wrong. We all knew it was wrong,” she said.Donald Williams, 33, who was among the onlookers said he called 911 after paramedics took Floyd away. The 911 call Williams made after the arrest was played to the jury.Williams dabbed his eyes with a tissue as his distressed voice filled the room. “I believe I witnessed a murder,” Williams told the jury. “So I felt I needed to call the police on the police.”The footage, which prosecutors say show excessive force, led to one of the largest protest movements seen in the United States in decades. Many have held up Floyd’s death as an example of the brutality they say is routinely doled out by US law enforcement in encounters with people of colour.Lawyers for Chauvin, 45, argue that the policeman followed his training and is not guilty of the charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder or second-degree manslaughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-witnessed-a-murder-recalls-man-at-trial-over-floyd-s-death-101617153766662.html
31-03-2021||World||Pandemic delays gender parity by a generation: World Economic Forum||The pandemic has rolled back years of progress towards equality between men and women, according a report Wednesday showing the crisis had added decades to the trajectory towards closing the gender gap.A range of studies have shown that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, who have lost jobs at a higher rate than men, and had to take on much more of the extra childcare burden when schools closed.The effects will be felt in the long-term, according to the World Economic Forum, which in its annual Global Gender Gap Report found that the goalposts for gender parity appeared to be moving further away.The organisation, which usually gathers the global elite in the plush Swiss ski resort of Davos each year, had found in its previous report, published in December 2019 right before the pandemic hit, that gender parity across a range of areas would be reached within 99.5 years.But this year's report shows the world is not on track to close the gender gap for another 135.6 years."Another generation of women will have to wait for gender parity," the WEF said in a statement.The Geneva-based organisation's annual report tracks disparities between the sexes in 156 countries across four areas: education, health, economic opportunity and political empowerment.Workplace equality in 267 years On the plus side, women appear to be gradually closing the gender gap in areas such as health and education.But inequality in the workplace -- which has long appeared to be the stickiest area to fix -- is still not expected to be erased for another 267.6 years.And the pandemic has not helped.The WEF pointed to a study by the UN's International Labour Organization showing that women were more likely to lose their jobs in the crisis, in part because they are disproportionately represented in sectors directly disrupted by lockdowns.Other surveys have shown that women were carrying a greater share of the burden of increased housework and childcare during lockdowns, contributing to higher stress and lower productivity levels.Women were also being hired back at a slower rate than men as workplaces opened up again, according to LinkedIn data referenced in the report."The pandemic has fundamentally impacted gender equality in both the workplace and the home, rolling back years of progress," WEF managing director Saadia Zahidi said in the statement."If we want a dynamic future economy, it is vital for women to be represented in the jobs of tomorrow," she said, stressing that "this is the moment to embed gender parity by design into the recovery."Political gender gap growing It was in the political sphere that the march towards gender parity did the biggest about-face, with several large-population countries seeing the political gender gap widen, the WEF study found.Women still hold just over a quarter of parliamentary seats worldwide, and only 22.6 percent of ministerial positions.On its current trajectory, the political gender gap is not expected to close completely for another 145.5 years, the report found.That marks a 50-percent hike from the estimated 95 years in the 2020 report, WEF pointed out.Progress across the categories varies greatly in different countries and regions.The report pointed out that while Western European countries could close their overall gender gap in 52.1 years, countries in the Middle East and North Africa will take nearly 142.4 years to do so.Overall, the Nordic countries once again dominated the top of the table: the gap between men and women was narrowest in Iceland, for the 12th year running, followed by Finland and Norway.New Zealand took fourth place, ahead of Sweden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-delays-gender-parity-by-a-generation-world-economic-forum-101617151301581.html
31-03-2021||World||Biden administration declares Chinese actions in Xinjiang as 'genocide'||Amid escalating tensions with Beijing, the Biden administration on Tuesday (local time) declared Chinese actions against the Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang as 'genocide'.In a 2020 report on Human rights practices: China released on Tuesday, the US Department of State said: "Genocide and crimes against humanity occurred during the year against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang".Also Read: Canadian PM Trudeau slams Chinese sanctions over Xinjiang as ‘unacceptable’Former US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo first officially declared genocide in Xinjiang during the waning days of the Donald Trump administration. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken affirmed Pompeo's assessment during his confirmation hearing, but the word's inclusion into Tuesday's report formalizes the outlook as an official U.S. government assessment, Washington Post reported.The State Department said the crime includes the arbitrary imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty of more than one million civilians; forced sterilization, coerced abortions, and more restrictive application of China's birth control policies; rape; torture of a large number of those arbitrarily detained; forced labour; and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement.The state department said Chinese government officials and the security services often committed human rights abuses with impunity."Authorities often announced investigations following cases of reported killings by police but did not announce results or findings of police malfeasance or disciplinary action," the report stated.The report has come amid heightening tensions between western countries and China. The recent escalation of tensions began after the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for atrocities against Uyghurs."There were numerous reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. In many instances few or no details were available," the state department read.Also Read: Chinese digital art mocks Western criticism of labour conditions in XinjiangIn Xinjiang, the state department said that there were reports of custodial deaths related to detentions in the internment camps and there were multiple reports from Uyghur family members who discovered their relatives had died while in internment camps or within weeks of their release.The State Department also highlighted an example of Abdulghafur Hapiz, an Uyghur man who was detained in a Xinjiang internment camp since 2017. Hapiz's death was formally confirmed by the Chinese government to the United Nations in October.The government claimed Hapiz died in 2018 of "severe pneumonia and tuberculosis." His daughter said she last heard from Hapiz in 2016; sources reported he disappeared no later than 2017 and was held without charges in an internment camp.According to the report, the government conducted mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim and ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang.China Human Rights Defenders alleged these detentions amounted to enforced disappearance since families were often not provided information about the length or location of the detention, the report read.The report noted that the authorities in Wuhan disappeared four citizen journalists, Chen Qiushi, Li Zehua, Zhang Zhan, and Fang Bin, who had interviewed health-care professionals and citizens and later publicized their accounts on social media in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown in Wuhan.While Li Zehua was released in April, Fang Bin's and Chen Qiushi's whereabouts were unknown at year's end. Zhang Zhan was indicted on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," and authorities tried and convicted her on December 28, sentencing her to four years' imprisonment. She was the first known person to be tried and convicted for her coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.Human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, who has been disappeared on multiple occasions, has been missing since 2017."Using the term genocide in the report indicates profound concern in the administration about appalling Chinese government human rights violations against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other Turkic communities," Washington Post quoted Sophie Richardson, a China expert at Human Rights Watch, as saying.The move may also put further pressure on the Biden administration to punish China for its alleged actions. "The next step is to map out a strategy to back an independent investigation, gather evidence, and pursue accountability," Richardson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-declares-chinese-actions-in-xinjiang-as-genocide-101617150318065.html

31-03-2021||World||US President Biden to let Trump’s H1-B visa ban expire in win for tech firms||President Joe Biden plans to allow a pandemic-related ban on visas for certain temporary workers, enacted by former President Donald Trump, to expire Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter.The moratorium, which affected H-1B visas used by technology companies to hire foreign coders and engineers, was imposed last June. Biden is opting not to renew it, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision hasn’t been announced. The White House declined to comment.Biden’s decision will please business groups, which had pressured the administration to lift the ban ever since the new president took office. Executives have grown frustrated that the directive was not immediately revoked, arguing it hurt US companies.Trump’s restrictions on guest-worker visas, which also covered non-agricultural seasonal laborers, au pairs and others, had been under review by the Biden administration.Biden last month withdrew a related Trump executive order that stopped the issuance of new green cards, citing the pandemic -- a move that drastically cut legal immigration to the U.S. Trump had argued the policies were necessary to protect the American economy as it emerged from the pandemic-induced recession.“To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,” Biden said in a presidential proclamation at the time. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.”The ban on guest-worker visas was not revoked at the same time. Temporary work visas are unpopular with labor unions and other worker groups who argue that they put American workers at a disadvantage to their foreign counterparts.Despite the Trump administration’s extension of the visa ban at the end of 2020, opponents of the restrictions had already found some success in court.A federal judge in California granted a preliminary injunction on Oct. 1 in a lawsuit brought by several large business groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Chamber of Commerce. The groups argued Trump exceeded his authority by imposing immigration restrictions in his June 22 proclamation.The Trump Justice Department appealed that ruling to the San Francisco-based US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In February, the appellate court requested a status report from the parties by April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-let-trump-s-h1-b-visa-ban-expire-in-win-for-tech-firms-101617148136103.html

The attack wounded 20 people, including four church guards, and broke windows at the church and nearby buildings in Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province.A Security Council press statement denounced the attack as a “reprehensible” act of terrorism and reiterated that “any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation.”The council reaffirmed the need for all countries to combat “threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-condemns-palm-sunday-terrorist-act-on-indonesian-church-101617147672047.html
31-03-2021||World||'Major' pain: Biden's dog involved in 2nd biting incident||President Joe Biden's younger dog Major this week was involved in his second biting incident of the month, the White House said Tuesday.The dog "nipped someone while on a walk" on Monday, said Michael LaRosa, press secretary to first lady Jill Biden, adding that the dog “is still adjusting to his new surroundings." The individual was seen by the White House Medical Unit “out of an abundance of caution” and returned to work without injury, LaRosa added.The dog had been seen by reporters on a walk around the White House South Lawn before the president and first lady traveled to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial early Monday evening.The german shepherd only just returned to the White House last week, along with his sibling Champ, after causing a minor injury to an employee of the U.S. Secret Service on March 8.After that incident, the president said Major was “a sweet dog.” In an interview with ABC News, Biden explained the biting by saying that the dog had “turned a corner, there’s two people he doesn’t know at all, you know, and they move and moves to protect.”Biden added at the time that “85% of the people there love him.”Major, a 3-year-old rescue dog, and Champ, who is 12, were moved to the Bidens’ Delaware home after the incident. The president said Major was being trained in Delaware but disputed the idea that the pup had been sent away after the incident. He said the dogs went to Wilmington because the first couple was going to be out of town.“He was going home,” Biden said. “I didn’t banish him to home. Jill was going to be away for four days. I was going to be away for two, so we took him home.”The dogs met the Bidens two weekends ago at Camp David in Maryland and came back to Washington on March 21. Last week, one of the two German shepherds waited on the balcony of the White House as Marine One landed on the South Lawn, having ferried the president back from a speech in Columbus, Ohio.“The dogs will come and go and it will not be uncommon for them to head back to Delaware on occasion as the president and first lady often do as well,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.This week's biting incident was first reported by CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-pain-biden-s-dog-involved-in-2nd-biting-incident-101617148204187.html
31-03-2021||World||UN takes no action on latest North Korea missile tests||The UN Security Council took no action after a brief meeting Tuesday on North Korea’s latest ballistic missile tests, the first since US President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20 and a violation of UN sanctions.Council diplomats said all 15 members encouraged dialogue and negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program but disagreed on the need for a statement. Last Friday, the council unanimously adopted a resolution to renew the mandate of UN experts monitoring sanctions against the North. Hours earlier, the 15 council members discussed Pyongyang’s latest test firings at a sanctions committee meeting.On Tuesday, Russia and China both mentioned their proposed December 2019 resolution, UN diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private. It would terminate sanctions on North Korean exports such as textiles, seafood and statues, “with the intent of enhancing the livelihood of the civilian population.”The Russia-China draft resolution has languished, and whether the Security Council takes any action remains to be seen.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky told a group of reporters Tuesday “it’s still a time of assessment” of the recent missile tests.US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Monday the Biden administration is looking at “additional actions” that the United Nations might take to respond to the latest tests, but she wasn’t specific about what those actions might entail.Last week, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in defiance of UN resolutions banning such launches. Some experts said the launches, the first of their kind in a year, were aimed at applying pressure on the Biden administration which is finalizing a review on how to approach the reclusive north Asian nation.On Monday, North Korea accused the UN of a “double standard” over its reaction to the launches, warning of serious consequences.France’s UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere tweeted Tuesday: “Today at the Security Council, I recalled that North Korea’s recent ballistic missile launches violate Security Council resolutions. The continued development of #NKorea’s missiles and nuclear programs constitutes a major threat to international peace and security.”US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who recently returned from Tokyo and Seoul, said Monday the US, Japan and South Korea are united in dealing with the challenges posed by Pyongyang.“What we’re seeing from Pyongyang in terms of these provocations does nothing to shake the resolve of our three countries along with allies and partners around the world to approach North Korea from a position of strength in order to diminish the threat that it poses to the region and beyond,” Blinken said.Past short-range missile launches by North Korea have typically drawn UN Security Council condemnations, but not fresh sanctions.North Korea has been hit with increasingly tough sanctions since its first nuclear test in 2006. The latest rounds in 2017 responded to its first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States and its sixth and strongest nuclear test.The sanctions have banned key exports including coal and the import of an estimated 90 percent of refined oil products including diesel and kerosene which are key to its economy. UN experts monitoring the sanctions have reported widespread violations by North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-takes-no-action-on-latest-north-korea-missile-tests-101617148284036.html
31-03-2021||World||Brazil military chiefs quit as Bolsonaro seeks their support||The leaders of all three branches of Brazil’s armed forces jointly resigned Tuesday following President Jair Bolsonaro's replacement of the defense minister, causing widespread apprehension of a military shakeup to serve the president's political interests.The Defense Ministry reported the resignations — apparently unprecedented since at least the end of military rule 36 years ago — in a statement released without giving reasons. Replacements were not named. But analysts expressed fears the president, increasingly under pressure, was moving to assert greater control over the military.“Since 1985, we haven’t had news of such clear intervention of the president with regard to the armed forces,” said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo.Bolsonaro, a conservative former army captain who has often praised Brazil's former period of military dictatorship, has relied heavily on current and former soldiers to staff key Cabinet positions since taking office in January 2019, but Melo said the military itself has so far refrained from politics.“Will this resistance continue? That’s the question,” Melo said.The announcement came after the heads of the army, navy and air force met with the new defense minister, Gen. Walter Souza Braga Netto, on Tuesday morning.Braga Netto's first statement on the new job showed he is alligned with Bolsonaro's views for the armed forces. The incoming defense minister, unlike his predecessor, celebrated the 1964-1985 military dictatorship that killed and tortured thousands of Brazilians.“The armed forces ended taking the responsibility of pacifying the country, facing the challenges to reorganize it and secure the democratic liberties that today we enjoy,” said Braga Netto, who did not discuss the departure of the military chiefs. “The 1964 movement is part of Brazil's historic trajectory. And as such the events of that March 31st must be understood and celebrated.”A retired army general who has a relationship with the three commanders as well as with Braga Netto told The Associated Press that “there was an embarrassing circumstance so they all resigned.” He agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name, expressing fear of retribution.Bolsonaro on Monday carried out a shake-up of top Cabinet positions that was initially seen as a response to demands for a course correction by lawmakers, diplomats and economists, particularly over his handling of the pandemic that has caused more than 300,000 deaths in Brazil.That included the replacement of Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva, who said in his resignation letter that he had “preserved the armed forces as state institutions,” a nod at his effort to keep generals out of politics.Bolsonaro has often bristled at the checks and balances imposed by other branches of government and has attended protests targeting the Supreme Court and Congress.He has also criticized the Supreme Court for upholding local governments’ rights to adopt pandemic restrictions that he adamantly opposes, arguing that the economic effects are worse than the disease itself.His recent slide in popularity, and the sudden likelihood that he will face leftist former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the 2022 presidential election, has analysts saying he is looking to the armed forces for support.Retired Gen. Carlos Alberto Santos Cruz, who previously served as Bolsonaro’s government secretary, appeared to refer to such concerns when he responded to early rumors of military resignations with a tweet saying, “THE ARMED FORCES WON’T GO ON AN ADVENTURE.”Since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985, the armed forces have tried to keep a distance from partisan political quarrels.“The government has to give explanations to the population about the change in the Defense Ministry,” Santos Cruz added.Sen. Kátia Abreu, who heads the Senate's foreign relations commission, said it would be “prudent” for the new defense to minister speak to “calm the nation down about the impossibility of a military intervention."“I have a conviction that we built a strong democracy. The armed forces are part of the Brazilian state and they have the confidence of all of us,” said Abreu, a right-leaning Bolsonaro critic.Earlier this month, Bolsonaro began mentioning the armed forces in connection with his dispute with state governors and mayors over restrictive measures meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Latin America’s largest nation.“My army doesn’t go to the street to force people to stay at home,” Bolsonaro told reporters March 19.Thomas Traumann, an independent political analyst, told AP that it was the first time in living memory that all leaders of the armed forces had quit simultaneously.“He wants people who will do whatever he wants, and so it is extremely risky,” Traumann said. “He can put the army out to allow people to go to work. So the army would be in his hands, and not in the hands of the generals.”Bolsonaro saw his popularity rise last year, thanks to a generous pandemic welfare aid program. That popularity has dropped since the program ended in December, and there have been renewed protests against him as the nation's daily death toll surged to the highest in the world.Further clouding the outlook for Bolsonaro is the reemergence of da Silva after a Supreme Court justice annulled two corruption convictions and restored his political rights. Early polls indicate he would be a formidable challenger in next year’s election.In other Cabinet changes, Bolsonaro replaced Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo, who was accused by some of impeding the supply of vaccines by making comments seen as insulting to the Chinese and by not aggressively seeking sources.Earlier this month, Bolsonaro also replaced his health minister, active-duty army Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, the third health minister to leave office since the beginning of the pandemic. Pazuello's tenure coincided with most of Brazil’s 317,000 COVID-19 deaths.On Tuesday, Brazil’s health ministry said a new daily high of 3,780 deaths related to COVID-19 had been registered in the previous 24 hours. The previous high of 3,650 deaths was recorded Friday.___Associated Press writer Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-military-chiefs-quit-as-bolsonaro-seeks-their-support-101617147619096.html
31-03-2021||World||Ever Given: Ship freed at last, probe begins into Suez drama||In the end, it took roughly six days and seven hours to undo the minutes of drama that exposed the vulnerability of global trade and captivated the world. It may take longer to figure out how to avoid it happening again.At just after 3 pm local time on Monday, the Ever Given was dislodged from a sand bank in the Suez Canal by tugboats pushing and pulling to rock it loose. To cheers from the dozens of crew working on the effort to refloat it and relief among Egyptian authorities, the enormous 21st century container ship that got stuck in a waterway first opened in 1869 was free. The backlog of about 400 ships started moving that evening.“Despite the difficult situation we’ve confronted, Egyptians stood beside their leadership and their country and endured the crises and registered their joy,” President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi declared at a press conference on Tuesday alongside Osama Rabie, the chief executive of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA).Also read | Suez Canal races to clear shipping backlog at crucial maritime trade routeDutch company Boskalis, which played a key role in the rescue operation, said its “team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated” the ship at 3:05 pm local time. The operation, carried out under time pressure and “the watchful eye of the world”, required 13 tug boats and the dredging of some 30,000 cubic meters of sand, said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis.The freed vessel was travelling north toward the Great Bitter Lake, through which the canal passes, “for an inspection of its seaworthiness,” said the Taiwan company Evergreen which operates the ship. “The outcome of that inspection will determine whether the ship can resume its scheduled service.”‘Enormous complexity’There could be significant damage to the ship, Capt John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com, said. Stuck for days across the canal, the ship’s middle rose and fell with the tide, bending up and down under the tremendous weight of some 20,000 containers across its 400-meter (quarter-mile) length. On Monday, when workers partially floated the ship, all that pressure came forward to its bow.Salvage crews have been working around the clock ever since the accident which has been blamed on high winds and poor visibility during a sandstorm, although the canal authority also cited the possibility of human error.There will be questions about speed, whether the Ever Given should have employed tugs and if it should have braved the journey through the wind at all. Egyptian investigators, led by a canal authority committee, will analyse recordings from the deck, including conversations among crew.When blame gets assigned, it will likely lead to years of litigation to recoup the costs of repairing the ship, fixing the canal and reimbursing those who saw their cargo shipments disrupted. Since the vessel is owned by a Japanese firm, operated by a Taiwanese shipper, flagged in Panama and now stuck in Egypt, matters quickly become an international morass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ever-given-ship-freed-at-last-probe-begins-into-suez-drama-101617139640094.html
31-03-2021||World||Germany imposes restrictions on AstraZeneca Covid-19 jabs for people below 60 years age||Germany will deploy AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine for general use only for over-60 year olds, ministers decided Tuesday, imposing restrictions for younger people after several severe clotting cases.Under-60s can still decide to take the vaccine but only following "consultation with the doctor carrying out the vaccination ... and with an individual risk analysis," said ministers of Germany's 16 states as well as the federal health minister in a policy statement.The World Health Organization and the EU's health watchdog have both deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, but several countries have restricted its use over clotting fears.Germany's decision came after the vaccine commission known as STIKO recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of "currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects" in younger vaccinated people.It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said.Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation.The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people.Germany's medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday.Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week.On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s "pending further analysis".The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride.Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright, and more than a dozen EU nations suspended shots in mid-March before most recommenced rollouts, albeit with a patchwork of age restrictions.France has limited its use to over-55s, while Spain has done the same for under-65s.Germany's vaccination campaign has been sluggish, with official figures showing around 11 percent of the population have received a first dose so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-imposes-restrictions-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-jabs-for-people-below-60-years-age-101617132538724.html

The country of nearly 84 million also reported 155 deaths on Tuesday, up from around 65 at the start of the month.In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting late Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 58 out of Turkey’s 81 provinces, including Istanbul and Ankara, were now designated as “red” or “very high-risk” areas and would be subjected to lockdowns on both Saturdays and Sundays.Nighttime curfews that are in place across the country would continue, he said.Only 17 provinces were in the “red” category on March 2, when schools partially resumed face-to-face education, cafes and restaurants were allowed to operate at half-capacity and weekend curfews were eased in several cities.“The increase in the number of cases and patients as well as the increase in the number of deaths, is forcing us to review the existing measures,” Erdogan said in an address to the nation. “The number of our provinces which are in the red category, which constitutes the very high-risk category, has reached 58 — representing 80% of the population.”“We will have to make some sacrifices during the month of Ramadan,” he said, adding that restaurants and cafes would be allowed to serve takeout food only during the holy month, which starts on April 13 in Turkey.Mass gatherings for Ramadan meals held before sunrise and after sunset would be barred, he also announced.The Turkish Medical Association meanwhile, blamed the increase in infections on inadequate contact-tracing, the government's reluctance to impose measures in a timely manner out of economic concerns as well as the premature relaxing of the restrictions.“We, as healthcare professionals and society, are paying for these wrong policies,” the group said on Twitter.Erdogan has come under intense criticism for holding his ruling party’s congresses inside packed sport complexes across the country, despite a new surge of Covid-19 cases. He has been accused of double standards for disregarding the government’s own social distancing rules. In one such event, Erdogan boasted about the size of the crowds.Critics say the political rallies have likely contributed to the surge. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca told reporters Tuesday that he saw no benefit in “keeping the issue on the agenda.”Variants of the initial coronavirus now account for around 75% of the cases in Turkey, he said.The minister also said Turkey has received 2.8 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine and is set to receive 1.7 million more within the next 10 days.Turkey rolled out its inoculation program in January with the vaccine developed by China's Sinovac company. More than 15 million shots have been administered so far. Around 6.7 million people have received two doses.The total number of infections in the country since the start of the outbreak last year stands at more than 3.2 million. The Covid-19 death toll has reached more than 31,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-reimposes-restrictions-after-sharp-rise-in-covid-19-infections-101617132210836.html
31-03-2021||World||State police to probe Virginia Beach police shooting||Virginia Beach police have turned over their investigation of an officer-involved shooting of a former college football player to Virginia State Police after the Black man's death amid a rash of weekend shootings drew heightened public scrutiny.Donovon W. Lynch, 25, was shot by a Virginia Beach police officer in the last of three separate shooting incidents along the city’s popular oceanfront strip of hotels and restaurants. The shootings left one other person dead and eight others wounded.The case has drawn calls for a thorough and transparent investigation from such figures as Grammy-winning musician Pharrell Williams, who says Lynch was his cousin.“The Lynch family and the involved officer each deserve a comprehensive and thorough investigation into this incident, and we appreciate the public's patience as we pursue every facet of it,” Virginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate said in a statement Tuesday.Both Lynch and the police officer who shot him are Black. That officer and another officer who saw Lynch's shooting have both said that Lynch had a handgun, police said Monday.The city's police department also said that a “separate, independent witness corroborated that Mr. Lynch was in possession of a handgun" earlier that evening. But the body camera worn by the officer who shot Lynch had not been activated for "unknown reasons,” according to police. said.“We would like to provide the community answers," the police chief said Saturday. “At this point we do not have them.”Neudigate said his department on Monday formally requested that state police take the investigation.That same day, Williams told his 10 million Twitter followers that Lynch was his cousin.“It is critical my family and the other victims’ families get the transparency they deserve. VA Beach is the epitome of hope and we will get through this,” said the singer, songwriter and producer. Williams is also a Virginia Beach native.Lynch, who lived in the coastal city, was an offensive lineman for the University of Virginia’s College at Wise during the 2017 and 2018 seasons and a 2019 graduate of the school.The officer who shot Lynch has been placed on administrative leave, police said. He has been with the department for five years and is assigned to its special operations division.The Virginia Beach chapter of the NAACP said in a statement Sunday that it wasn't surprised that the officer's body camera wasn't turned on. It said its members are "watching and listening for the department’s inquiry into this shooting and expect a thorough and expeditious report. The community is waiting!”Virginia House Del. Jay Jones, a Democrat who is running for Attorney General, has called for the state AG to investigate.“We need far better accountability and transparency, and the families of those killed by police, in Virginia Beach and across this country, deserve answers,” Jones said Sunday.Lynch's shooting was one of three separate shooting incidents that police said occurred within minutes of each other along Virginia Beach's oceanfront.Police said a gun battle broke out late Friday night from what appeared to be a fight involving a group of people. Several people were wounded by gunfire in the densely packed area, and three men have been arrested. Each faces seven counts of malicious wounding, among other charges.Also killed in a separate weekend shooting was Deshayla E. Harris, 28, of Norfolk. Investigators said they believe Harris was likely a bystander struck by stray gunfire. No arrests were immediately made in her death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/state-police-to-probe-virginia-beach-police-shooting-101617131771339.html
31-03-2021||World||14 countries express ‘shared concerns’ over WHO report on Covid-19 origins||A group of 14 countries including the US, Britain, Japan, Australia and Canada has expressed “shared concerns” with a WHO-backed study on the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak in China and said they supported a “independent analysis and evaluation, free from interference and undue influence” of the pandemic.They also said the report was “significantly delayed” and added that it “lacked access to complete, original data and samples”, pointing to a lack of cooperation and transparency from China, with naming it.They did not, however, directly reject the report and said they remained committed to working with the World Health Organization.“Together, we support a transparent and independent analysis and evaluation, free from interference and undue influence, of the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the 14 countries said in a joint statement.The countries are Australia, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, South Korea, Slovenia, Britain and the US.“In this regard, we join in expressing shared concerns regarding the recent WHO-convened study in China, while at the same time reinforcing the importance of working together towards the development and use of a swift, effective, transparent, science-based and independent process for international evaluations of such outbreaks of unknown origin in the future,” they added.The report released earlier on Tuesday suggests the deadly virus jumped from bats to other animals to humans. Interestingly, it discounts as “extremely unlikely” the possibility that the coronavirus escaped from a lab - a theory that many experts believe, including Robert Redfield, former US head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Noting the WHO’s mission to advance global health security, the 14 countries expressed full support for its staff and experts, saying that “with such an important mandate, it is equally essential that we voice our shared concerns that the international expert study on the source of the Sars-CoV-2 virus was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples”.They added that “there must now be a renewed commitment by the WHO and all member states to access, transparency and timeliness”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-countries-express-shared-concerns-over-who-report-on-covid-19-origins-101617128030086.html
31-03-2021||World||China tightens grip on Hong Kong with sweeping electoral shake-up||China on Tuesday approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system, tightening Beijing’s control over the city and cutting down democratic representation in the financial hub.Chinese President Xi Jinping signed presidential orders to formalise the Hong Kong electoral reform plan on Tuesday.“The goal of the overhaul is to make sure that the bodies of power in Hong Kong are run by patriots,” state media reported, adding that it was another major step in tackling the “loopholes in the city’s governance structure”.The changes to the electoral system essentially mean lawmakers standing for elections in Hong Kong have to be vetted for their loyalty to the mainland, thereby ensuring that only “patriotic” candidates run for office in the special administrative region (SAR).It could mean the end of opposition and democracy in the city, critics have warned about the sweeping changes.As a result of the changes, the number of seats in Hong Kong’s legislature will be increased from 70 to 90.Only 20 seats will be set aside for direct elections. Of the remaining seats, 40 will be chosen by a pro-Beijing election committee that currently selects Hong Kong’s chief executive and 30 will be picked by groups representing various professions and interests.The number of members on the election committee responsible for selecting the chief executive will go up from 1,200 to 1,500.Also read | India-China border row: Air forces hold formation in LadakhAlso, 117 seats previously given to community district councillors - who are elected directly by the public and deal with local issues - will be replaced by government-appointed positions.The changes follow the imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong last year, which has been criticised as draconian and said to have been brought in to crush anti-Beijing dissent.Beijing moved with speed to bring in the changes to get rid of what the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) thought were “loopholes and deficiencies” threatening national security during the pro-democracy protests in 2019.Beijing’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), had approved the plan during its annual session earlier in March.On Tuesday, news agency Xinhua reported that the country’s top decision-making body, the NPC standing committee, voted unanimously to pass it.The move amends the annexes of Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the “Basic Law”.Under the changed system, a candidate qualification review committee of the SAR has been set up to vet and confirm the qualifications of candidates for the election committee members, the Chief Executive, and the legislative council members, Xinhua reported.The powerful vetting committee will monitor candidates for public office and work with national security authorities to ensure they are loyal to Beijing.Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, and the Basic Law was created under the “one country, two systems” principle. It had given the city more freedoms than the mainland, including freedom of speech, which are supposed to remain intact until 2047.China firmly believes the electoral reform and the earlier national security law for Hong Kong, as well as other potential reforms that could take place in the future, are “the right things to do and must be done”, whether the West likes them or not, analysts told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tightens-grip-on-hong-kong-with-sweeping-electoral-shakeup-101617103429344.html
31-03-2021||World||The Taliban is at its strongest since 2001. This needs a clear US response||With the May 1 deadline for an expected United States (US) military withdrawal from Afghanistan a little less than a month away, multiple avenues of diplomacy have been launched as the administration of President Joe Biden in Washington DC navigates the future of the US involvement in the 20-year-long war in the country.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s proposal made to Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, made public via a leaked letter, has only added more to the complexities. Blinken’s curtly written outreach to Kabul has suggested a regional approach, involving Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and India to help in bringing the Afghan crisis to some sort of conclusion. On the other hand, Moscow convened its own roundtable, attended by both the Afghan government and the Taliban, along with stakeholders such as Iran, China, Pakistan and the US. New Delhi, notably, was missing, having not been invited due to its self-designed diplomatic and political distance from the Taliban.Also Read | Taliban threaten to re-target foreign troops if May 1 withdrawal deadline missedAs these events unravelled, India and Pakistan also announced their own ceasefire along the border regions. The ceasefire, which according to some reports was brokered by the United Arab Emirates, is also being seen from the lens of a broader regional architecture that the Biden administration is promoting to attain a viable US exit from the conflict, hedging its own risks at the 11th hour by magnifying some of the regional issues that have also played a latent yet significant role in exacerbating the turmoil in Afghanistan. And this includes the India-Pakistan rivalry, where Islamabad fears an over-reaching Indian hand in Kabul will deny it “strategic depth”, as highlighted by the former Pakistan Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg in the 1980s, fearing an Indian encirclement of Pakistan.The US bringing in Turkey also adds another actor directly into the Afghan negotiations. The Biden administration inherited a fractured relationship with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally in Ankara. Now, suggesting that Turkey host talks in April where the likes of India, Iran, Pakistan, China and Russia are to sit across the table from the Afghan government along with the Taliban to look for a viable solution, may well have more to do with a potential rapprochement between Biden and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.From a distance, the Afghan negotiations now look like a multi-layered conclave, where the US is attempting to encapsulate its exit via the various intermediaries that have been involved around the Afghan peace process over the years but have limited to no agency on US troop deployments in the war. Turkey’s close relations with Pakistan also get factored in here, with both the Taliban and the Ghani government seemingly having a level of parallel comfort with Ankara’s involvement despite others, such as India and arguably Iran, potentially viewing Turkey’s role somewhat differently.Also Read | In Kabul, be ready for political uncertaintyTo add to the complexity, the US has sanctions in place against Iran, China and Russia, while also looking for their assistance to bring closure for itself in the conflict. While Tehran, Moscow and Beijing may have overlapping concerns with the US over the security situation in Afghanistan, beyond a point, all of them have significantly larger crisis points with the US. While discovering strange bedfellows is nothing new in geopolitics, short-term goals to find empty bylanes to speedily drift into an Afghan exit is only going to leave behind chaos.The US, while hedging its risks around an Afghan exit, should take into account the fact that the bedrock of any bilateral or multilateral talks around the Afghanistan question, irrespective of regional or international actors in play, will still be based around the February 2020 deal between the US and Taliban signed in Doha. A question still hangs over the future of the Doha process, and why Moscow and Ankara have become more prominent plays over the past few weeks.How the Taliban will react to the Biden administration possibly rescinding and keeping a residual force in Afghanistan remains to be seen; however, the insurgency has the Doha deal to refer to for the US to uphold its commitment over a May 1 withdrawal, irrespective of which presidency signed on the dotted line.Others, whether it be India or Russia, could play an important role to rudder Afghanistan after a political settlement is achieved, specifically financially considering a post-war long-term economic agenda is currently non-existent. But the US is not in a position to see other multilateral forums and “peace tables” as alternatives to the Doha process.American analysts have highlighted that the Taliban today is arguably in its strongest position compared to any point since 2001. This eventuality requires a robust and clear US-owned response, even within the framework of an exit.Kabir Taneja is fellow, Strategic Studies Programme, Observer Research Foundation, and the author of The ISIS Peril: The World’s Most Feared Terror Group and its Shadow on South Asia.
