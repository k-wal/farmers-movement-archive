Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately," Buckingham Palace said in a March 9 statement.Earlier, former US first lady Michelle Obama said Meghan's recollections about a remark made about the possible colour of her son's skin were heartbreaking and she hoped Meghan's experiences would be a lesson for the world.Obama told NBC News: "I feel like that was heartbreaking to hear, that she felt like she was in her own family - her own family thought differently of her.""As I said before, race isn't a new construct in this world for people of colour, and so it wasn't a complete surprise to hear her feelings and to have them articulated," she said."I think the thing that I hope for, and the thing I think about, is that this, first and foremost, is a family. I pray for forgiveness and healing for them so that they can use this as a teachable moment for us all."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talks-between-prince-harry-and-brother-william-remain-unproductive-report-101615917996693.html
16-03-2021||World||Ex-officer wants jury to hear about 2019 George Floyd arrest||A lawyer for a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd's death asked the judge again Tuesday to allow evidence of a previous arrest during which the Black man was found with drugs, a request the prosecutor derided as an attempt to “smear” Floyd's character.Defense attorney Eric Nelson said that Floyd's May 2019 arrest — a year before his fatal encounter with officer Derek Chauvin — was remarkably similar: He ignored officers’ commands, put something in his mouth, and had to be physically removed from a vehicle. In that arrest, several opioid pills were found, along with cocaine.But Prosecutor Matthew Frank argued that evidence was prejudicial, and suggested the defense wanted to admit it as a backdoor way of depicting Floyd as a bad person.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill previously rejected Chauvin’s attempt to tell the jury about the 2019 arrest, but heard fresh arguments Tuesday from both sides.Allowing testimony about the arrest would be a victory for the defense, which plans to argue that Floyd’s drug use contributed to his death. An autopsy showed Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system. Cahill said he would rule on the request Wednesday morning at the earliest.Floyd, a Black man, was declared dead on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter.Nelson argued the similarities in both incidents are relevant to establish cause of death.Both times, as officers drew their guns and struggled to get Floyd out of the car, he called out for his mother, claiming he had been shot before and crying, and he put what appeared to be a controlled substance in his mouth. Both searches turned up drugs in the cars. Officers noticed a white residue outside his mouth both times, although that has not been explained.“The similarities are incredible. The exact same behavior in two incidents, almost one year apart,” Nelson said.Paramedics who examined Floyd in 2019 warned him that his blood pressure was dangerously high, putting him at risk for a heart attack or stroke, and took him to a hospital for examination. Nelson argued that shows Floyd knew that ingesting drugs could result in his hospitalization, rather than his incarceration.Frank decried what he called, “the desperation of the defense to smear Mr. Floyd’s character, to show that what he struggled with, an opiate addiction like so many Americans do, is really evidence of bad character.”Cahill said he would stop the defense “very quickly” from suggesting at trial that Floyd didn’t deserve sympathy because he used drugs. “You don’t just dirty up someone who has died in these circumstances as a defense,” he said.The judge said some evidence from the 2019 arrest might be relevant to Floyd's cause of death, but he questioned whether two incidents were enough to show a common pattern of behavior.The jurors seated so far are a diverse group, an element being closely scrutinized in a case where race plays a central role.Nine jurors had been seated through Monday, including five who are white; one who is multiracial; two who are Black; and one who is Hispanic.The jurors include six men and three women and range in age from their 20s to their 50s. The selection process resumes Tuesday and continues until 14 people — 12 to deliberate and two alternates — are seated. Opening statements are expected March 29 unless the process isn't complete by then.On Monday, Nelson asked Cahill to postpone the trial, arguing that the jury pool was likely tainted by Friday's announcement that the city of Minneapolis would pay $27 million to Floyd's family to settle their civil rights lawsuit.“It is profoundly disturbing to the defense,” Nelson said of the settlement in the midst of jury selection. “This is not fair.”Cahill didn't immediately grant the delay, but acknowledged that the timing was “unfortunate” and said he would consider it. He said he likely would recall the seven jurors who were seated last week for further questioning, though he already instructed members of the jury pool to avoid all news coverage of the case.Three other former officers face an August trial on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exofficer-wants-jury-to-hear-about-2019-george-floyd-arrest-101615912864878.html
16-03-2021||World||Brazil's new health minister signals little change in policy to fight Covid-19||The cardiologist who’s taking the helm of Brazil’s health ministry said it’s President Jair Bolsonaro who’ll continue to dictate policies to fight a pandemic that is claiming about 2,000 lives a day.Marcelo Queiroga, who is taking over from General Eduardo Pazuello, shunned lockdowns as a government tool, telling local media it should only be used in extreme situations, and said doctors are free to prescribe medications that are unproven to combat the virus. In previous interviews before accepting the job, he had said he’s personally against the use of chloroquine in Covid-19 patients, a medication repeatedly touted by Bolsonaro.“It’s President Bolsonaro’s policy, not the health minister’s,” he told reporters on Tuesday as he arrived at the health ministry in Brasilia. “I was called to give continuity to Pazuello’s work.”Yet he defended an ample vaccination campaign in an interview with CNN Brasil, saying the government needs to increase talks with governors and mayors who are often attacked by Bolsonaro for implementing restrictive measures.Queiroga is Brazil’s fourth health minister since the coronavirus arrived in the country a little over a year ago. Luiz Henrique Mandetta and Nelson Teich, who both had medical backgrounds, left after disagreements with Bolsonaro over social distancing and unproven treatments against Covid-19. Pazuello had been in the post since May.Pressure to replace Pazuello, a logistics expert in the Army, grew in the past few weeks as Brazil succumbs to a new wave of the virus. The country has consistently reported more than 75,000 cases and 2,000 deaths a day, overtaking India -- which has a population over six times larger -- in total infections.Brink of CollapseSeveral hospitals across the country have no room for more patients as the nation’s health system finds itself on the brink of collapse. The surge in cases has been made worse by lax social distancing orders and a new, more contagious variant that originated in the Amazonian capital of Manaus.Earlier this year, patients died in Manaus as oxygen ran out at overwhelmed hospitals, a crisis that sparked a Supreme Court investigation into Pazuello’s actions and dented his reputation. The General had already faced harsh criticism over a data blackout when he first took over the job, as well as for promotion of chloroquine and other unproven medication against Covid also touted by Bolsonaro.“It is as simple as that: one commands and the other obeys,” Pazuello said in October, when Bolsonaro disapproved of his plan to buy Sinovac Biotech Ltd’s vaccine because of its Chinese origin.Vaccine Shortages, Higher Rates Muddle Outlook for Brazil FundsA lack of vaccines -- which Pazuello is largely blamed for -- has added to concerns about the recovery of Latin America’s largest economy. Conversations with pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer Inc have dragged on for months, leaving the country with few shots at hand. The health ministry has repeatedly reduced the amount of doses it expects to have at hand in March, pushing congress to ask for a formal response and leaving states and cities trying to buy their own.Brazil has recorded 11.52 million cases of Covid-19 and almost 280,000 deaths, trailing only the U.S. in both counts. It has given out about 13.5 million vaccine doses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-new-health-minister-signals-little-change-in-policy-to-fight-covid19-101615912031530.html

They found a man lying in the street with gunshot wounds who was taken to a hospital, where he died from his injuries, a police statement said.A white passenger vehicle was seen fleeing the area after the shooting, and a short time later officers tried to pull over a similar car about two miles (3.2 kilometers) away from the shooting scene, the statement said.One man ran from the car, but was taken into custody a few blocks away, the statement said. Police said another suspect in the area was also taken into custody after officers chased him on foot.The identities of the victim and the suspect were not immediately made public. Police also did not disclose details of how the shooting unfolded.News outlets reported that the university’s BroncoAlert messaging system warned the campus community that there had been a shooting in the vicinity of Jade Hall, which has student housing. A second alert urged people to shelter in place. An all-clear message was sent early Tuesday, less than an hour later. The university said that the shooting did not happen on campus property.Boise State University is one of Idaho's three public universities, with nearly 20,000 full- and part-time students. It's campus is in downtown Boise, surrounded by neighborhoods and local businesses, and it's known to sports fans for its blue football turf.The university said in a statement that counseling services are available for students and staffers impacted by the shooting.“The university community is saddened by this loss of life and extends heartfelt condolences to the victim's family and loved ones,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-dead-2-held-in-shooting-near-boise-state-university-101615912136861.html
16-03-2021||World||Health experts under pressure as countries suspend use of AstraZeneca||Global health experts came under increasing pressure on Tuesday to clear up questions over the safety of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot, as Sweden and Latvia joined countries suspending their use in a further blow to Europe's vaccination rollout.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it was investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In total, 45 million Covid shots have been delivered across the region.The EU regulator will release its findings on Thursday but its head, Emer Cooke, said she saw no reason to change its recommendation of AstraZeneca - one of four vaccines that it has approved for use."The benefits continue to outweigh the risks, but this is a serious concern and it does need serious and detailed scientific evaluation," Cooke told a news conference.A World Health Organization (WHO) committee of experts was reviewing the cases and was expected to issue a statement by the end of the day, a spokesman said.The EU's largest members - Germany, France and Italy - suspended use of AstraZeneca's vaccine on Monday pending the outcome of investigations into unusual cases of a rare cerebral thrombosis in people who had received it.The addition of Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday brought to 13 the number of EU countries to act since reports first emerged of thromboembolisms affecting people after they got the AstraZeneca shot.The WHO and EMA had earlier joined AstraZeneca in saying there is no proven link, but some experts said the episodes of blood clots, bleeding and low platelet counts in younger people seemed to indicate a causal connection to the AstraZeneca shot."The benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the risks, especially for the elderly," said Karl Lauterbach, health spokesman for Germany's Social Democratic Party."But it could be the case that the risks of the vaccine are higher for certain patient groups such as young women," Lauterbach, an epidemiologist whose party is part of the Berlin coalition, told Deutschlandfunk radio in an interview.Other epidemiologists note that similar cases have not been found in unusual numbers in Britain, which began using AstraZeneca earlier and has given more than 10 million doses."A very likely explanation of at least some of the clotting disorders seen are a result of Covid-19 rather than the vaccine," said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine."There are published papers that make clear that these problems definitely occur in Covid-19 and there is no doubt that all the vaccines in use prevent that disease. Hence the risk and benefit balance for the AstraZeneca vaccine remains clearly in favour of its benefits."Economic falloutIn the EU's largest states, including Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, AstraZeneca has accounted for about 13-15% of shots given since the rollout began almost three months ago, with Pfizer-BioNTech making up the majority, according to official data.As one as the cheapest to be developed, the AstraZeneca shot is set to be the mainstay of vaccination programmes in much of the developing world.Governments say they acted on the AstraZeneca shot out of an abundance of caution - of 1.6 million people in Germany given the vaccine, seven fell ill with a very rare cerebral vein thrombosis of whom three died.In a detailed analysis of its findings Germany's vaccine oversight body, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, said six of the cases were in women of young or middle age - a number statistically significantly higher than normally expected.Nicola Magrini, the director general of Italy's medicines authority AIFA, told daily la Repubblica the AstraZeneca shot was safe and its benefit to risk ratio was "widely positive". There have been eight deaths and four cases of serious side-effects in Italy following vaccinations, he added.In France, Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters the risk-reward ratio for the AstraZeneca vaccine remained positive.A third wave of infection in Europe, driven by more infectious viral variants, threatens to worsen a pandemic that has claimed 575,000 lives in the European Union and further delay recovery from a pandemic economic slump.Deutsche Bank on Tuesday slashed 2021 economic growth forecasts for the euro area by a whole percentage point, citing spillover of the ongoing pandemic-linked activity restrictions.Coronavirus infections are rising exponentially in Germany, an expert at the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said, putting at risk plans to lift its lockdown. France is considering a possible third national lockdown.Vaccination campaigns had got off to a slow start due to scarce supply, but the European Commission said on Tuesday it expects to receive more than 200 million doses of vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech in the second quarter, putting the EU on course to meet its targets.The EU aims to vaccinate at least 255 million people, or 70% of its adult population, by the end of the summer. The bloc has administered 11 shots so far for every 100 residents, while Israel - a world leader in vaccination - has given 108 doses, according to Our World in Data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-experts-under-pressure-as-countries-suspend-use-of-astrazeneca-101615911692571.html

16-03-2021||World||'Help is Here': Biden visits Pennsylvania to promote Covid-19 stimulus package||President Joe Biden visits Pennsylvania on Tuesday to promote his $1.9 trillion stimulus package as part of an all-out push by his team to sell a plan aimed at boosting the US economy out of its pandemic doldrums.Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and others are visiting various states and appearing on television as part of what the White House is calling the "Help is Here" tour.Biden is expected to visit a small business in Delaware County, a suburb of Philadelphia. The Democratic president defeated Republican former President Donald Trump in the election battleground state of Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election. Biden and Harris on Friday will visit Georgia, another state where Biden eked out a win over Trump.The law, known as the American Rescue Plan, passed the Democratic-led US Congress despite unified Republican opposition. Republicans supported pandemic-related relief bills under Trump but rejected Biden's plan as too expensive and not sufficiently focused on the public health crisis.White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein, speaking on CNN, defended the size of the package, saying it will power the economy out of the "start again, stop again" phase it has been in since Covid-19 pandemic-related lockdowns began a year ago.The package, one of the largest economic stimulus measures in US history, provides $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments, an expansion of the child tax credit and increased funding for Covid-19 vaccine distribution.The measure was Biden's first legislative priority upon taking office in January. Partisan battle lines are already being drawn over what could come next - a massive infrastructure plan that could involve the first major tax increase since 1993. Biden has promised he will not raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year.The White House has said it does not believe former President Barack Obama's administration, in which Biden served as vice president, did enough to promote its more than $800 billion 2009 economic rescue program. Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives to Republicans the next year.Biden on Monday said his administration would reach two important goals over the next 10 days: 100 million coronavirus shots in people's arms and 100 million checks in people's pockets or bank accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/help-is-here-biden-visits-pennsylvania-to-promote-covid-19-stimulus-package-101615909235941.html
16-03-2021||World||Michelle Obama aims to give a million meals in new campaign||Michelle Obama is launching a nonprofit campaign that aims to provide more than 1 million meals to food-insecure families in connection with the debut Tuesday of her children's food show on Netflix.The “Pass the Love w/ Waffles Mochi” initiative, named after the new series ”Waffles Mochi," is a collaborative campaign by the nonprofit Partnership for a Healthier America, its honorary chair Obama and Higher Ground Productions, the production company owned by the former first lady and her husband, former President Barack Obama.The nonprofit says the campaign was inspired by the series, which tells the story of two puppet friends who “travel the world exploring the wonders of food and culture while learning how to cook with fresh ingredients.”Walmart and Blue Apron have jumped in to support the initiative, which also aims to “leverage the show, its characters, and Mrs. Obama to meaningfully shift our food culture toward more affordable, fun, at-home meals for families of every income level,” according to the nonprofit.PHA President and CEO Nancy Roman told The Associated Press that the two companies will contribute funds to the campaign and raise money for it among their customers. More than half the money is expected to come from the public, Roman says.The nonprofit was created in conjunction with Michelle Obama's Let's Move! effort in 2010.The former first lady, who has long been a champion of healthy eating, said in the announcement last week that the idea is to “help make sure families all over the country can access fresh, nutritious food” amid the devastating impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.The US has seen a significant rise in hunger during the virus outbreak. One estimate from the organization Feeding America says around 45 million Americans in 2020 may have experienced food insecurity — limited or uncertain access to adequate food — compared with 35 million in 2019.Caitlin Caspi, a University of Connecticut professor who studies food insecurity, says the rise in unemployment, the closure of schools and disruptions across food systems -- like shortages of staple foods in the early days of the pandemic — all played a factor in the increase. And many, left with little options, turned to food banks for help.The issue has been “most pronounced among households with children, and in particular, households with children of color," Caspi said.“Meal boxes that provide fresh food and a complete set of ingredients to households are one way to reduce the impact of these food access disruptions, and to get healthy meals on the table,” she added.The food service organisation Genuine Foods will source and assemble the campaign's meal boxes, which will then be distributed by local nonprofits in various cities. Roman says they will begin to roll out the campaign in cities that have the highest child poverty rates as the funds are raised.The rollout will start in May, Roman says, and continue throughout the year. Each city deployment is expected to take place over four weeks.“We're thinking of a pace of about two a month,” Roman said. But, she added, “It will depend in part on how the campaign is going.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michelle-obama-aims-to-give-a-million-meals-in-new-campaign-101615904216147.html
16-03-2021||World||UK's Covid-19 vaccine is safe and works extremely well, says Boris Johnson||The Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and bio-pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca is safe and works extremely well, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday, amid reports that the doses were causing blood clot-related complications.In an editorial to coincide with the launch of a new 'Integrated Review' of the UK's foreign policy vision, the prime minister reflected on how just six months since its discovery, the vaccine is being produced in multiple countries including India.“I could tell from the excitement of the scientists that this was promising and that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine looked as though it would work. After exhaustive tests, so it has proved,” Johnson wrote in ‘The Times’.“That vaccine is safe and works extremely well, and now, only six months later, it is being made in multiple places from India to the US, as well as Britain, and it is being used around the world,” he said.In explaining the context of the 'Integrated Review', which lays out Johnson’s Global Britain agenda as a non-member of the European Union (EU), Johnson made reference to the vaccine as a symbol of Global Britain in action.His comments come in the wake of several European countries -- including Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Norway and Iceland -- pausing the administration of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs with concerns of a blood clotting side-effect. Some Asian and African countries have expressed concern. Congo and Thailand have stopped the doses.However, the UK and EU regulators and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have backed the usage of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs.“Successful as the UK vaccination programme may be, there is little point in achieving some isolated national immunity. We need the whole world to be protected. We need the whole world to have the confidence to open up for trade and travel and holidays and business, all the things that drive jobs and improve our lives at home,” said Johnson, highlighting that it is the “principle of enlightened self-interest” that underlies the new review of UK security, defence, development and foreign policy published on Tuesday.The coronavirus has so far claimed 125,817 lives in the UK, along with 4,276,840 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-and-works-extremely-well-says-boris-johnson-101615903874672.html
16-03-2021||World||Syrian president decrees financial stimulus amid crisis||Amid sharp economic decline, Syrian President Bashar Assad issued a decree on Tuesday granting hundreds of thousands of public sector workers and soldiers a one-time financial stimulus, equivalent to an average monthly salary.The stimulus — the third since October — comes as the national currency is crashing, now at more than 4,000 Syrian pounds to the dollar on the black market, compared to 700 a year ago. The official rate for the dollar is fixed at 1,256 Syrian pounds for $1.The decision comes a day after the government raised the price of fuel, including subsidized, by more than 50% in the third increase this year. It also raised the price of cooking gas.Nearly 80% of Syrians live in poverty, and 60% are food insecure — the worst food security situation ever seen in Syria, according to the United Nations.The decree stated that a one-time 50,000 Syrian pounds, which is nearly $11 on the black market, would go to public sector workers, including those on part-time contracts and conscripts. And 40,000 Syrian pounds would be dispensed to pensioners.Inflation has hit between 180% and 300%, according to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics. The price of a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar has gone from 700 Syrian pounds to around 2,400 this year.The Ministry of Interior Trade and Consumer Protection said the price of unsubsidized fuel would go up from 1,300 Syrian pounds per liter to 2,000 pounds, a more than 50% increase.The price of subsidized fuel would increase by nearly 60%, to 750 Syrian pounds per liter. The price of butane gas for cooking went up 37%.Economist Ziad Ghosn said the one-time payment is equivalent to the average monthly salary and estimated the cost of the stimulus would be around 120 billion Syrian pounds. He also estimated the stimulus would reach about 2 million people.Syrians have been struggling with deteriorating economic conditions, shortages of basic goods and medicine, and have been forced to wait in long lines to buy subsidized bread and fuel.A decade of conflict has caused huge devastation to the Syrian economy, isolated its government and displaced its people, driving most of them into poverty. The pandemic restrictions have added to pressure on the economy, compounded by the financial crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, which has been a bridge to Syria economically and financially.More than half a million people have been killed in Syria's 10-year conflict that has also left the country's infrastructure in ruins and most of its oil and agriculture resources outside of government control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-president-decrees-financial-stimulus-amid-crisis-101615903100912.html
16-03-2021||World||With flash mob, Israel's Arabs try to highlight fatal police shootings||At Tel Aviv's Dizengoff Circle, buzzing on a Saturday afternoon, around a dozen young people suddenly began to collapse slowly and theatrically to the ground, to the shock and confusion of Israelis out shopping or enjoying a coffee."Did it scare you?", flash mob organiser Mohamd Jabarin asked those watching, and proceeded to explain the intention - to draw attention to a surge of shootings within Israel's Arab community and accuse police of failing to tackle the violence.At least 24 Arab citizens of Israel have been shot dead this year, mostly by unknown assailants from within their towns and villages. The shootings, most often crime and gang related, have become a defining issue for the 21% minority ahead of a March 23 national election.The largest expression of the frustration and anger felt by the community has come through anti-violence protests by tens of thousands in Umm al-Fahm and other Arab towns.But the flash mobs are an attempt to raise awareness of the shootings in the heart of Jewish Israeli towns.Demonstrators accuse the police of turning a blind eye to the violence, which they say is a result of poverty and years of underinvestment in their minority communities.Israel's police say they investigate all shootings and are continuing their work to gather illegal weapons, arrest all criminals and bring them to justice."The only solution for the inaction of the police ... is to take to the streets and mobilise the Palestinian Arab people," said Enab Mhajne, 19, at the Umm al-Fahm protest on Friday.Behind her protesters waved Palestinian flags, an unusual sight on the streets of Israel.Israel's Arabs - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - are mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country's creation in 1948.Some Arab politicians have advocated working with right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the violence.Posters of Netanyahu have begun appearing in Arab neighbourhoods of cities like Haifa with a slogan bearing the Arabic slogan "We are with you".Netanyahu, who many Arabs accuse of discrimination against their community, has pledged 100 million shekels ($30.24 million) to combat violence in Arab localities.But Luna Hasan, another one of the flash mob organisers, said Arabs should focus on collective action to address the shootings, rather than rely on any one politician."Arabs are represented in every aspect of the economy, in almost every aspect of life in Israel ... we deserve safety, and we deserve protection," Hasan, 24, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-flash-mob-israel-s-arabs-try-to-highlight-fatal-police-shootings-101615902114594.html

It read: “My love is crystal clear, and it is only for China.”Several companies in China found the expression a potential catchphrase that could be used to market products.“Since February 20, some businesses and individuals have applied to use ‘Crystal Clear Love’ for the registration of trademarks on 17 items, including food, drink and clothing,” the National Intellectual Property Administration (NIPA) said in a release on Monday.“It’s the battle cry written by Chen, fully showing the martyr’s love for the motherland and his noble sentiment of selfless dedication,” the state-controlled China Daily reported, quoting the NIPA.Condemning the applications as improper efforts, the NIPA said, “It desecrated the spirit of heroes and deviated from the core values of socialism, which would make it easy to have a bad social impact.”Trademarks should not be “harmful to socialist morals and customs”, the statement added.China has been sensitive about comments perceived to be slanderous about the four soldiers who died and one who was injured in the Galwan Valley clash.At least eight persons have so far been arrested, detained or have had proceedings initiated against them for insulting the “PLA heroes and martyrs” online.On March 1, one of them, Qiu Ziming, who is a blogger, became the first person to be booked under the newly changed law on harming the reputation and honour of heroes and martyrs. He is likely to get jail time.A day later, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV aired a minute-long video during a prime-time news programme, showing Qiu, 38, admitting to the “annihilation of conscience” and “arrogance” in insulting the soldiers who were killed and injured in the clash with Indian troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-companies-bid-to-trademark-pla-soldier-s-patriotic-phrase-rejected-101615902901606.html

Pak, a Trump appointee, was told to step down a day before the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate run-off elections, the newspaper reported, citing people it didn’t identify. The Republican incumbents lost both contests.Separately, the Washington Post reported that Trump urged Georgia’s lead elections investigator to scrutinize ballots for “dishonesty” and that she had “the most important job in the country right now.”Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger confirmed to the Post that Trump placed the call, adding that he wasn’t familiar with what the president specifically said.The Post withheld the name of the investigator, who didn’t respond to its requests for comment, because of the risk of threats and harassment directed at election officials.In the case of Pak, the federal prosecutor resigned abruptly in an email to colleagues that cited “unforeseen circumstances.”The reports follow a week after it was revealed that Trump urged Georgia election officials in an hour-long call to “find” thousands of votes and recalculate the state’s presidential election results to flip the state to him.Georgia was one of five states won by Democrat Joe Biden in November that Trump had won in 2016. The state had two recounts of the presidential vote, with each showing the same outcome: that Biden had a narrow victory in a state last carried by a Democrat in 1992.Dozens of rejected claims by Trump and his associates that there had been widespread election fraud in the U.S., ranging from dead people voting to voting machines that changed Trump votes to Biden, have been thrown out of court.William Barr, the U.S. Attorney General who departed in December, also said that the Justice Department hadn’t found such evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-pushed-us-attorney-in-atlanta-a-trump-appointee-to-quit-report-101615901449088.html
16-03-2021||World||Nations assess risk of halting, continuing with AstraZeneca||With coronavirus cases rising in many places, governments faced the grimmest of dilemmas Tuesday: push on with a vaccine that is known to save lives or suspend use of AstraZeneca over reports of dangerous blood clots in a few recipients despite no evidence the shot was responsible.It has created a jagged divide across the globe, forcing politicians to assess the health risks of halting the shots at a time when many countries, especially in Europe, are already struggling to overcome logistical hurdles and vaccine hesitancy among their populations.Sweden was the latest to join a swelling group of European Union nations choosing caution over speed, even as international regulators said the data does not suggest the vaccine caused the clots and that vaccinations should continue.Europe has the luxury to be able to pick from several vaccine candidates — but the decision is still not an easy one on the continent, where the virus is again surging and where the vaccination campaign has repeatedly stumbled.The choice may be even more fraught elsewhere because many countries are relying heavily on AstraZeneca, which is cheaper and easier to handle than some other shots. The vaccine has so far played a huge role in the global initiative to ensure vaccines get to poorer countries known as COVAX.The difficulty of the decision was clear in Thailand, the first country outside Europe to temporarily suspend use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, only to recant on Tuesday — when its prime minister received a dose.“There are people who have concerns,” Prayuth Chan-ocha said after getting the shot. “But we must believe doctors, believe in our medical professionals.”Many other countries in Asia have likewise shrugged off concerns, though Indonesia halted use of the shot this week, saying it would wait for a World Health Organization report on the issue.AstraZeneca, the European Medicines Agency and the WHO have said there is no evidence the vaccine carries an increased risk of blood clots. There have been 37 reports of blood clots among the more than 17 million people who have received the vaccine across the EU and Britain, the company said.“This is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed COVID-19 vaccines,” the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said.The EMA has asked experts to look into the issue and originally planned to share their findings Thursday, but as the debate reached a fever pitch Tuesday, the regulator said it would provide an update in a news conference later in the day.The agency has so far said that the benefits of receiving the shot outweigh the risk of side effects.But the number of countries in the bloc that are sticking with the shot is falling after heavyweights like Germany, Italy, France and Spain all said they were suspending it.That left Belgium — and a handful of others such as Poland, Romania and Greece — increasingly isolated in their insistence that halting the shots now would cause a lot more harm that the side effects so hotly debated now.“When you know how the virus is making the rounds, it would be very imprudent to stop,” Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke told VRT network early Tuesday.Experts have noted that such concerns are inevitable in mass vaccination campaigns — with so many people getting shots, some are bound to get sick even if the vaccine is not to blame. That would mean “we’d have to incessantly interrupt campaigns during the coming months,” Vandenbroucke said.“We wanted to remain as scientific as possible in the mediatic-political turmoil that is currently agitating Europe,” Belgian virologist Yves Van Laethem said.In Spain, which announced it was suspending the vaccine on Monday, some medical experts had their doubt about the move. Amós García, president of the Spanish Vaccinology Association, said that countries were being overzealous in halting use of AstraZeneca.And the decisions seemed to be having a snowball effect. “There’s a cross-border contagion effect,” Garcia said.“Anything triggers the principle of caution,” García told Spanish broadcaster TVE. "Once it begins it’s like a domino, it becomes very difficult for a country to keep delivering the vaccine,” if others stop, even if only out of precaution.With the torrent of decisions casting doubt on the AstraZeneca vaccine despite assurances of experts, public opinion was tested once again to believe science over suspicion.Serbia’s Prime Minister Ana Brnabic says the Balkan country won’t stop the use of Astra-Zeneca vaccines and insisted that “unfortunately, some people are having second thoughts because of a negative campaign.”So often in disarray during the vaccine drive, the 27-nation EU was once again out of lockstep, with the member states each taking their own decision, as the executive Commission called on all to heed EMA advice. When asked if EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen would take the AstraZeneca vaccine, her spokesman Eric Mamer said “of course.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-assess-risk-of-halting-continuing-with-astrazeneca-101615901292007.html

We are tackling it," he said in a statement.The administration of President Joe Biden has been racing to speed up the processing of hundreds of unaccompanied children who are crossing the southern border every day.Officials have warned "the border is not open" and said they are sending back adults and families who have tried to cross the border illegally since Biden took office promising to reverse some of predecessor Donald Trump's hardline policies.Nearly 4,300 unaccompanied children were being held by border patrol officials as of Sunday, according to an agency official who requested anonymity to discuss the matter. By law, the children should be transferred out of Customs and Border Protection facilities to HHS-run shelters within 72 hours."The Border Patrol facilities have become crowded with children and the 72-hour timeframe for the transfer of children from the Border Patrol to HHS is not always met," Mayorkas acknowledged. HHS also has not had the capacity to take in the number of children, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defends-response-to-child-migrant-surge-at-southwest-border-101615899049027.html

16-03-2021||World||EU health ministers debate AstraZeneca shot after halting vaccine||European health ministers are discussing the future of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine as they await fresh guidance from the region’s drug regulator in response to concerns about health risks.The European Medicines Agency will hold a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, bringing forward a planned review by two days amid a fresh vaccine crisis. A growing number of countries have suspended use of Astra’s shot to examine side effects, potentially throwing the region’s already slow inoculation campaign further off track.At stake is the future of one main building block of Europe’s vaccine push, where Astra was due to account for about a fifth of all doses in the second quarter.The EU has received 14 million doses from the company so far, and could have taken in about 120 million doses in the next six months. Of the Astra doses delivered to the EU, almost 8 million have not been administered, or more than half. That compares with just 13% for the shot provided by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE.”We cannot afford a single doubt over the vaccines’ efficiency,” French Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said on France Info radio on Tuesday. The AstraZeneca CEO, Pascal Soriot, “is in the hot seat and he knows it.”But the EMA reiterated Monday that the vaccine’s benefits still outweigh its risks. Some medicines that have been on sale for decades, such as contraceptive pills, have been proven to increase the risk of blood clots and are nonetheless still on the market.With infection numbers creeping up again in countries like Germany, the risk of further vaccine shortages will increase pressure on politicians who have been punished for a lackluster immunization program. German Chancellor Angela Merkel saw her party slump to its worst ever results in two state elections on Sunday. In France, President Emmanuel Macron is running neck and neck with his populist rival Marine Le Pen in polls for next year’s presidential election.The European Commission has committed to immunizing 70% of adults by the end of September, but the latest precautions could push back efforts by at least a couple of weeks and potentially longer, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.Such delays would come at a high price by keeping businesses under virus restrictions for longer. Italy has reintroduced harsher measures, and parts of Germany have also seen an increase in infections, prompting some medical experts to demand a tightening of the restrictions from which Europe’s largest economy was just starting to emerge.“For each week that restrictions linger, we estimate the economic loss is roughly 3% of gross domestic product,” said Maeva Cousin, an economist at Bloomberg Economics. “That equates to nearly 17 billion euros for a two-week delay.”Even before the suspension, the UK-based company’s shot, jointly developed with the University of Oxford, had grappled with production delays, which the company attributed in part to typical teething issues with a new product. As a result, Cambridge-based Astra will only be able to deliver about 100 million doses to the EU in the first half of the year, it said last week, about a third of the number originally planned.Questions over the safety of the Astra shot have inserted an extra dose of bitterness into the bloc’s troubled relations with the UK government, which has been vaunting the vaccine as a vindication of British ingenuity.The suspensions in the EU contrast with Astra’s positive run in the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is championing a rapid vaccination push and continues to deem the shot safe to use.Astra’s vaccine is one of four that have been approved in the EU, alongside shots from Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna Inc., and Johnson & Johnson. With supplies from J&J yet to arrive and doses of Moderna limited, that means the bulk of immunizations in many countries will now be conducted with Pfizer-BioNTech.Responding to the suspensions, AstraZeneca said it’s working with national health authorities and European officials.After Denmark became one of the first countries in the region to suspend the shot, the EMA said on March 11 that the number of clots in vaccinated people was no higher than the number seen in the general population -- totaling 30 cases among 5 million people who had received the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-health-ministers-debate-astrazeneca-shot-after-halting-vaccine-101615896140427.html
16-03-2021||World||Jack Ma’s SCMP Joins Hong Kong media groups facing China control||As news broke that China is pressuring Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to sell the South China Morning Post, surprised employees pondered the future of Hong Kong’s main English-language daily.When Hangzhou-based Alibaba bought the SCMP in 2015 for $266 million, it injected much-needed cash into the operations and pledged that the century-old newspaper would retain editorial independence. While the newspaper has come under steady criticism for a tilt toward Beijing under Alibaba, its journalists closely covered the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while also publishing diverse opinions and coverage critical of China.Now fears are growing among some staff members that a Chinese state-owned company could eventually take over from Alibaba and put the newspaper under Beijing’s thumb, according to an employee who asked not to be identified. Such a move would mark one of the most significant blows yet to the city’s once free-wheeling media industry, where independent outlets have faced increasing pressure since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law last year.“There is suspicion that if a Chinese entity takes it over, or a Chinese billionaire takes it over, that they’re going to change the editorial line,” said Keith Richburg, director of the Journalism and Media Studies Center at the University of Hong Kong and president of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong. “This idea that the SCMP might be sold at a time when people in Beijing are talking about the need to for ‘patriots’ to be running media entities is, I would say, very, very concerning.”Beijing has moved to stifle Hong Kong’s democracy movement over the past year, rounding up dissidents and revamping the election system to give the Communist Party a veto on anyone who stands for office. The move has been criticized by countries including the US and the UK, which this week said China was in a “state of ongoing non-compliance” with the treaty that paved the way for the 1997 handover of the former British colony -- drawing an angry response from Beijing.China in recent months has heaped pressure on Hong Kong journalists, most notably with the November arrest of media tycoon Jimmy Lai, founder of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, who remains in custody on a national security charge after being denied bail. Police also conducted a high-profile raid of Apple Daily’s newsroom, and have arrested other executives from its publisher Next Digital Ltd.Ma, Alibaba’s co-founder, has been at the center of a government crackdown that began last year, targeting the e-commerce giant and its finance affiliate Ant Group Co. The Wall Street Journal first reported China’s government was asking Alibaba to shed media properties. Representatives for Alibaba in China and the US didn’t respond to requests for comment.China’s pressure on Alibaba stems from a concern about the technology giant’s influence over public opinion in the country, according to a person familiar with the matter. While no specific buyer has been identified, it is expected to be a Chinese entity, the person added. A Bloomberg investigation last year showed the Communist Party has been amassing influence in Hong Kong through its ownership of newspapers and publishing houses via its Liaison Office in the city.‘No Plans for an Ownership Change’In an internal SCMP memo to staff on Tuesday seen by Bloomberg News, Chief Executive Officer Gary Liu dismissed reports of Alibaba coming under pressure to sell its media assets. “Be assured that Alibaba’s commitment to SCMP remains unchanged and continues to support our mission and business goals,” he wrote in the memo. A later message sent on the same day by Liu reiterated that “there are no plans for an ownership change.”“SCMP remains committed to serving our global readers with independent journalism and in-depth analysis, as we have for over 117 years,” a spokesperson for the newspaper said by email.Since the national security law came into force last year, media outlets have started to tread carefully out of fear of breaching vaguely defined provisions on subversion and secessions. The government this month appointed a career bureaucrat with no media experience as director of public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong, which has seen programs that were critical of the government censored or pulled.On Jan. 6, the same day the 55 democracy activists and former lawmakers were arrested, the national security department requested documents from Apple Daily, Stand News, and In-Media. According to Reporters Without Borders, Hong Kong fell to 80th last year in its annual World Press Freedom Index, down from 18th in 2002. Mainland China sat at 177th out of 180 countries and territories. The Hong Kong government didn’t respond to a request for comment, but has repeatedly said that press freedom remains intact despite the security law.‘I’ll Be Arrested’“I’m prepared that I’ll be arrested,” said Ronson Chan, deputy assignment editor of Stand News. ”I am not prepared to leave Hong Kong, nor Stand News. Hong Kong needs us. Hong Kongers that still believe in the values of press freedom, especially in the wake of a growing mainland Chinese takeover.”The Hong Kong Free Press, a nonprofit digital news outlet that describes itself as impartial, has also come under attack. This month a magazine owned by Sing Tao News Corp., which last month came under the control of the daughter of a Chinese tycoon, devoted a four-page spread to insinuating that HKFP may have violated the national security law.The worsening environment has prompted the news organization to only use encrypted devices, check in with staff regularly and literally chain computers to the desks, according to Tom Grundy, founder and editor-in-chief of HKFP.“We expect to be forced to navigate increased bureaucratic and legal scrutiny,” he said. “Though our current policy is to hope for the best, prepare for the worst and ‘keep calm and carry on.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jack-ma-s-scmp-joins-hong-kong-media-groups-facing-china-control-101615894842180.html
16-03-2021||World||Covid-19: China approves new protein subunit vaccine for emergency use||China has approved a new COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, one that was developed by the head of its Centre for Disease Control, adding a fifth shot to its arsenal.Gao Fu, the head of China's CDC, led the development of a protein subunit vaccine that was approved by regulators last week for emergency use, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Microbiology said in a statement on Monday.It is the fifth coronavirus vaccine approved in China and the fourth to be given emergency use approval. Three of those given emergency approval have since been approved for general use. All were developed by Chinese companies.The latest vaccine was developed jointly by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co Ltd and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The team finished phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in October and is currently conducting the last phase of trials in Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Indonesia, according to the statement.The vaccine was approved for use in Uzbekistan on March 1. It's a three-dose shot that is spaced out with one month each between shots, a company spokesperson said. Like other vaccines China has developed so far, it can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures.There is no publicly available information in peer-reviewed scientific journals about the clinical trial data showing efficacy or safety. A spokesperson for the company said that the data could not be shared at this time but that the company was providing the information to health authorities.The protein subunit vaccine is similar to many of the other vaccines that have been approved globally in that it trains the body to recognise the spike protein that covers the surface of the coronavirus vaccine, although the difference lies in how it tells the body to recognise the protein. Scientists grow a harmless version of the protein in cells and then purify it before it is assembled into a vaccine and injected.China has been slow in vaccinating its population of 1.4 billion people, despite having four vaccines approved for general use. The latest numbers, according to government officials at a press briefing Monday in Beijing, is that it has administered 64.98 million doses of vaccines.China has targeted what it considers key populations for vaccination thus far, namely health care workers, those who work at the border or customs, and specific industries the government has selected. Other groups that have been notably absent thus far in comparison to many other countries are the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.The approved vaccines have previously been limited to adults 18-59 years old, as officials cited a lack of clinical trial data for those who are older, although the government appears to be signalling the limits are now being set aside.“We will promptly carry out mass vaccination of relevant populations,” Li Bin, a vice-chair on the National Health Commission, said Monday.China's official Xinhua News Agency reported over the weekend that in certain neighbourhoods in Beijing, local health centres started to offer vaccines to those aged 60 and older.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-approves-new-protein-subunit-vaccine-for-emergency-use-101615894604285.html

Roman Catholic priests now are forbidden from blessing same-sex civil unions.“I join many gay Catholics who are disheartened by this announcement and I hope their church leaders continue to advocate for these blessings,” the lawmaker said. “The Catholic Church could role-model an ability to evolve with their membership.”Also read: US bishops discouraging Catholics from getting J&J Covid-19 shot. Here’s whyRodney Croome, a leading advocate for marriage equality when same-sex marriage became legal in Australia, accused the Vatican of being out of step.Gay marriage was endorsed by 62% of voters who responded to an Australian postal ballot in 2017.“The Vatican is out of step, not only with public opinion in Australia, but with the majority of Catholics who voted ‘Yes’ for marriage equality in 2017,” said Croome, a spokesperson for just equal, an advocacy group campaigning for justice and equality.“If I could address the pope directly, I’d say that sin lies not with same-sex relationships, but with those who invoke God to push LGBTIQ people to the margins of society,” added Croome, who is gay.Benjamin Oh, co-chair of the advisory board of Australian Catholics for Equality, described the Vatican statement as “personally painful.” Oh said his 16-year same-sex relationship was “worthy of sacramental marriage.”“The church have (blessed) all kinds of things: animals, cars and even weapons used for the killing of another human being,” Oh said in an email. “For many Catholic Christians, this statement flies in the face of Jesus’ teaching to love."As a Catholic, Oh said the statement was “personally hurtful and dehumanizing, but sadly, totally unsurprising.”“There is still a toxic culture towards LGBTI people in our church and societies and this statement will no doubt be weaponized by those who want to inflict more pain, discrimination and suffering on LGBTI folks both in our church and in civil society, especially in places and communities that discriminate, marginalize, harm, abuse and even kill LGBTI persons,” Oh said.In the Philippines, Asia’s largest Catholic nation, gay rights leader Danton Remoto reacted with exasperation to the Vatican edict.“I keep on telling LGBTQIs to just have their civil unions done,” Remoto said. “We do not need any stress anymore from this church.”Remoto said it’s better to bring the struggle for gay rights in the country before local governments, which have passed more than 20 anti-discrimination ordinances through the years.“Why fight an ancient institution?” Remoto asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaticans-edict-same-sex-unions-are-sinful-met-with-criticism-by-gay-activists-101615889385047.html

We share serious concerns over China's coastguard law," Motegi addedIn February, China enacted the law that permits China's coast guard to destroy other countries' structures and to use force when defending the country's maritime claims in disputed areas.Over the past several years, China has increased its territorial and maritime claims in the Indo-Pacific region, overlapping with the interests of a number of nations.Also read: US, on mission to rally Asia against China, distracted by North KoreaIn particular, Beijing has been locked up in a dispute with Tokyo over a string of uninhabited but resource-rich islets, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China.In addition, Beijing has boosted the scale and frequency of its military drills in the Indo-Pacific, prompting the United States and its regional allies -- Japan, India and Australia -- to enhance strategic cooperation within the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in response.Blinken and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation with Japan, which they say is crucial for a free and open Indo-Pacific Region, and also stressed that the bond between the countries is based on shared values."For that trip, we come to Japan, because for over 60 years our alliance has been a cornerstone of peace, security and prosperity not only for our two countries but for the region and indeed for the world. We are here to reaffirm our commitment to this alliance ... to ensure that we keep delivering for our people today and for the future," Blinken said.Austin, in turn, stressed that the US seeks to "build upon the resolute and resilient bond between our two countries."The high-ranking official noted that the US Department of Defense stands "ready to buttress the hard work of diplomats."Motegi pointed to the need to "cement peace, stability and prosperity as strategic goals of Japan and the US" in light of the "change in power balance." "The environment has entered a completely different dimension ... and the Covid-19 pandemic is fueling the trend," Motegi noted.Japans's defense minister, Nobuo Kishi, noted that the bilateral partnership, which has been steadily developing in the past 10 years, should now be made even stronger, as the "security environment is becoming increasingly severe."Indo-Pacific region is largely viewed as an area comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system. China claims much of the South China Sea, but there are also overlapping claims by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.China has built bases and other outposts on shoals, reefs and rock outcroppings to deepen its claim over 80 per cent of the 3.6 sq km waterway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-japan-will-oppose-any-action-by-china-that-seeks-to-change-status-quo-says-motegi-101615889363088.html

16-03-2021||World||UK seeks to 'moderate' China with push for more influence in Indo-Pacific||Britain wants to expand its influence among countries in the Indo-Pacific region to try to moderate China's global dominance, a document laying out post-Brexit foreign policy priorities will say on Tuesday.The document will also underline the importance of strong ties with the United States, and British media said an increase was planned to Britain's nuclear arsenal and that Russia would be named as a top security threat.Britain's biggest foreign and defence policy review since the end of the Cold War will set out how Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to be at the forefront of a reinvigorated, rules-based international order based on cooperation and free trade.Calling the Indo-Pacific "increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world", the government highlighted a planned British aircraft carrier deployment to the region and said a previously postponed visit to India would go ahead in April.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab acknowledged Britain's attempts to influence Beijing had been marginal so far, and said cooperating with other nations in the region gave it a better chance of persuading China to play by established rules."We're far better acting in concert with clusters of like-minded countries - not just the Europeans and the Americans - but more broadly to try and have the maximum impact and moderating impact on China, because it is sensitive to its reputation," Raab told Times Radio.The United States has also underlined the importance of the Indo-Pacific region under President Joe Biden and warned against China's growing assertiveness, and the European Union also hopes to deepen ties with countries in the Indo-Pacific.The British government has said the "Integrated Review" will show that Britain, which left the EU last year, still has international clout after Brexit and will define a new era for the country."I am profoundly optimistic about the UK’s place in the world and our ability to seize the opportunities ahead," Johnson will say in a statement to parliament.POST-BREXIT FUTUREThe document will be scrutinised for evidence of how the government will deliver on Johnson's promises as Britain copes with the economic and political fallout of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.The Sun newspaper reported the document would raise the upper limit on Britain's number of nuclear warheads to 260 from 180.Sky News said the report would classify Russia as an "active threat" and take a more nuanced approach to China as a "systemic challenge" - a reference to its authoritarian, rather than democratic, leadership and its economic influence.In 2015, Britain's then finance minister, George Osborne, predicted a "golden" era in Chinese-British relations. But ties have frayed over issues including Beijing's handing of former British colony Hong Kong and security concerns around Chinese investment in Britain.Raab told Sky News Britain would like to have a positive relationship with China but not at the expense of upholding its values.A statement previewing the report underlined "the importance of our relationship with the US" alongside the defence of democracy and human rights, and safety from terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-to-moderate-china-with-push-for-more-influence-in-indopacific-101615891495611.html

16-03-2021||World||George Floyd case: Diverse jury so far for ex-cop's trial||The jurors seated so far in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd's death are a diverse group, an element being closely scrutinized in a case where race plays such a central role.Nine jurors have been seated through Monday, including five who are white; one who is multiracial; two who are Black and one who is Hispanic.Some news organizations reported the racial makeup of the jury mainly by appearances last week before Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill, mindful of strong public interest in the case, began releasing each juror's race after they were selected.Floyd, a Black man, was declared dead on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter.The jurors include six men and three women and ranges in age from their 20s to their 50s. The selection process resumes Tuesday and continues until 14 people — 12 to deliberate and two alternates — are seated. Opening statements are March 29 unless the process isn't complete by then.On Monday, Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson asked Cahill to postpone the trial, arguing that the jury pool was likely tainted by Friday's announcement that the city of Minneapolis would pay $27 million to Floyd's family to settle their civil lawsuit.“It is profoundly disturbing to the defense,” Nelson said of the settlement in the midst of jury selection. “This is not fair.”Cahill didn't immediately grant the delay, but he acknowledged that the timing was “unfortunate” and said he would consider it. He said he likely would recall the seven jurors who were seated last week for further questioning, though he already instructed members of the jury pool to avoid all news coverage of the case.The first potential juror questioned Monday was quickly dismissed after volunteering that she’d heard about the settlement and presumed it meant the city didn’t feel it would win the civil case.“When I heard that, I almost gasped at the amount,” she said, adding that she couldn’t promise she could disregard it.Potential jurors questioned later didn’t mention hearing of the settlement, and neither attorneys nor the judge directly asked if they were aware of it.The two jurors seated Monday include a Black man in his 30s who works in banking, coaches youth sports and does creative writing as a hobby, and a white woman in her 50s who works as an executive assistant at a health care clinic.The man said in his juror questionnaire that he had neutral impressions of Chauvin and Floyd, and didn’t believe Chauvin set out to murder anyone. He also wondered why other officers didn’t intervene.“I don’t know if he was doing something wrong or not, but somebody died,” the man said. “Even if you have no intention of doing something and something happens, somebody could’ve still intervened and prevented that.”The woman said she was “disturbed” by bystander video showing Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck, and couldn’t watch the whole thing.Three other former officers face an August trial on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-case-diverse-jury-so-far-for-ex-cop-s-trial-101615891534894.html
16-03-2021||World||Iran's third homegrown vaccine reaches clinical trials phase||Iran's campaign to inoculate its population against the coronavirus and promote itself as an emerging vaccine manufacturer inched on as health authorities announced Tuesday that the country's third homegrown vaccine has reached the phase of clinical trials.Details about its production, however, remained slim.Although Iran, with a population of more than 80 million, has so far imported foreign vaccines from Russia, China, India and Cuba to cover over 1.2 million people, concerns over its lagging pace of vaccinations have animated Iran's drive to develop locally produced vaccines as wealthier nations snap up the lion's share of vaccine doses worldwide.Iranian scientists, like elsewhere in the world, are rushing to condense the typically years long process to develop vaccines into a few months — a task that has acquired urgency as the country struggles to stem the worst virus outbreak in the Middle East and its economy reels from harsh American sanctions.But details are scant about the Islamic Republic's vaccine production efforts. Two other Iranian vaccines are also in the phase of clinical trials, with the most advanced, called Barekat, tested on 300 people so far.The government said 20,000 volunteers in the capital of Tehran and other cities will soon receive Iran's new vaccine, called Fakhra, which an official described to state-run media as being “100% safe,” without providing any evidence or data to support the claim. Earlier this week, the government launched a vaccine production factory it claims can make 3 million doses a day.The vaccine introduced Tuesday on state TV was created by an affiliate of Iran's Defense Ministry, known as the Research and Innovation Organization.Like with the Barekat vaccine still in the initial phase of clinical trials, the company used inactivated coronaviruses from 35,000 samples to make the new vaccine, a traditional technology based on cultivating batches of the virus and then killing it. By comparison, Western drug manufacturers are taking a newer gene-based approach to target the spikes on the outer structure of the coronavirus, a method that had never been approved for widespread use before.Iran's fragmented approach to domestic vaccine production, with entities ranging from state-owned pharmaceutical conglomerates to the Defense Ministry working separately on at least six different vaccines, reflect the country's wider factional rivalries and competing power structures.At a ceremony attended by high-ranking officials in Tehran on Tuesday, Iranian state TV broadcast footage of just a single volunteer receiving the Fakhra vaccine, named after chief Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was killed in a November attack that Iran blamed on Israel.While Fakhrizadeh was known to lead the country's disbanded nuclear weapons program in the early 2000s, Iran has eulogized him as a leader of country's domestic coronavirus vaccine development drive. Fakhrizadeh's son was the first to receive the jab of the new vaccine.The coronavirus has infected 1.7 million people in Iran and killed more than 61,000 — the highest death toll in the Middle East.Iran formally launched its limited vaccination campaign last month, doling out Russia's Sputnik V vaccine to health workers and those with chronic health conditions. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned Iran from importing American and British vaccines, a reflection of its deep-rooted mistrust of the West.Nonetheless, Iran later said it would receive 4.2 million doses of the vaccine developed by Oxford University and UK-based drugmaker AstraZeneca through the global COVAX initiative, which was created to ensure that low- and middle-income countries have fair access to vaccines.The Health Ministry has vowed to vaccinate all adults in the country by late September, although how the government will reach that ambitious goal remains uncertain. Iran says it expects to import doses for over 16 million people from COVAX.The government has alleged that tough American sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018 undermine efforts to purchase foreign-made vaccines and roll out mass inoculation campaigns like those making headway in the US and Europe.Although international banks and financial institutions often hesitate in dealing with Iranian transactions for fear of being fined or locked out of the American market, US sanctions do have specific carve-outs for medicine and humanitarian aid to Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-third-homegrown-vaccine-reaches-clinical-trials-phase-101615888495097.html

16-03-2021||World||New Hong Kong law on patriotic oaths may threaten judges||A proposed new law that tightens patriotic loyalty tests for Hong Kong politicians could also ensnare the city's judges, further threatening its vaunted judicial independence, say legal scholars, lawyers and diplomats.They warn that the so-called "negative list" - which proscribes unpatriotic acts - under the oath-taking bill is far too vague and could put judges under intense pressure if their rulings and judgments are viewed as challenging the government.The bill, launched last month and due to be debated in the city's legislature this week, is part of a new drive by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to ensure only "patriots" govern the city.Long seen as the bedrock on which Hong Kong's freedoms and international financial status are built, the city's independent judiciary and common-law-based legal system have grown in importance since the imposition of a sweeping national security law in June.Diplomats, business people and activists say that as various Hong Kong institutions crumble, including the legislature, local media and academia, the judiciary is the key remaining check on Beijing's tightening authoritarian grip on its freest city.Much of the bill involves ways that legislators and community-level district councilors can be disqualified if their oaths are deemed insincere. Such moves are expected to pave the way for mass disqualification of the pro-democracy politicians who humiliated the pro-Beijing camp when they won district polls by a landslide in 2019.But as the city's ranks of judges, including leading foreign jurists, must take oaths to Hong Kong under long-standing requirements, they also come under the sweep of the legislation.'Holistic loves'Launching the bill last month, Hong Kong's Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang said the law fulfilled "the constitutional responsibility of the government".Tsang defined patriotism as a "holistic love" that included the leadership of China's ruling Communist Party.Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school, said the vague nature of some of the elements of the negative list could spark intense scrutiny and complaints.He singled out references to acts that had a "tendency" to undermine the order of the political structure or the "overall interests" of Hong Kong."These references are extremely vague and it creates more possible complications for how the judiciary itself has to regulate judges against these new standards," Young told Reuters. "There is still time to clarify things... the point is we should not be defining these specific parameters of the oath in such vague ways with such over-reaching scope that it could undermine judicial independence."A spokesman for the judiciary said that because of judicial independence, it was inappropriate for it to comment on any legislative proposals. The Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.The spokesman added that it had been stated in "express terms" that Hong Kong's courts "shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference"."As reflected in their judicial oath, in exercising their judicial power, judges are required to determine and handle cases strictly in accordance with the law and legal principles," the judiciary spokesman said.The legislation would still have to comply with the Basic Law, which outlines judicial independence, including legal immunity for judges.Senior lawyers warned the proposals added a new layer of outside political scrutiny and could complicate long-standing arrangements involving the appointment and disciplining of judges."The shift here is that you are not swearing to uphold a constitutional principle or value, but are expected to effectively make an oath to a party or an individual," one veteran lawyer said.A senior Western envoy said that the city's once-extensive autonomy was "hanging by a thread" and that the "judges are all that is left.""We are telling the Hong Kong and Chinese governments not only that we and our business communities are watching closely, but that we are all deeply concerned at the prospect of what Beijing is styling as reforms putting extra pressure on the legal system," the envoy said. "The judiciary must be left alone to do its work."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-hong-kong-law-on-patriotic-oaths-may-threaten-judges-101615886823944.html
16-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine scare: European health ministers to discuss shot||European health ministers will discuss the future of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine after a growing number of countries suspended its use to examine side effects, potentially throwing the region’s already slow inoculation campaign further off track.The ministers will gather virtually on Tuesday to discuss their response, ahead of the latest findings by the European Medicines Agency, the regional drugs regulator, which plans to decide on the next steps on Thursday. At stake is the future of one main building block of Europe’s vaccine push, where AstraZeneca was due to account for about a fifth of all doses in the second quarter.”We cannot afford a single doubt over the vaccines’ efficiency,” French Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said on France Info radio on Tuesday. The AstraZeneca CEO, Pascal Soriot, “is in the hot seat and he knows it.”With infection numbers creeping up again in countries like Germany, the risk of further vaccine shortages will increase pressure on politicians who have been punished for a lackluster immunization program. German Chancellor Angela Merkel saw her party slump to its worst ever results in two state elections on Sunday. In France, President Emmanuel Macron is running neck and neck with his populist rival Marine Le Pen in polls for next year’s presidential election.The European Commission is expected to tell ministers to wait until the bloc’s drugs regulator gives its verdict on Thursday and to act upon this recommendation. The Commission will also sound the alarm over millions of unused doses in member states, according to a person familiar with the matter.Damage DoneThe European Commission has committed to immunizing 70% of adults by the end of September, but the latest precautions could push back efforts by at least a couple of weeks and potentially longer, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd. Some 30 million AstraZeneca doses are due to be delivered by the end of this quarter, with more coming in the next three months.Even before the suspension, the U.K.-based company’s shot, jointly developed with the University of Oxford, had grappled with production delays, which the company attributed in part to typical teething issues with a new product. As a result, Cambridge-based Astra will only be able to deliver about 100 million doses to the EU in the first half of the year, it said last week, about a third of the number originally planned.Questions over the safety of the AstraZeneca shot have inserted an extra dose of bitterness into the bloc’s troubled relations with the U.K. government, which has been vaunting the vaccine as a vindication of British ingenuity. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is meeting his colleagues from six neighboring countries later on Tuesday, whose leaders have complained about an “uneven” distribution of vaccines in the EU.Risk and RewardWhile the move to suspend is temporary and precautionary pending the EMA’s assessment, it stands to further damage the public perception of a vaccine already plagued by a flawed trial, production shortfalls and a public spat with officials in Brussels accusing the company of violating its contractual supply obligations.Shortly after the governments announced the suspensions, the EMA stuck to its view that the vaccine’s benefits “in preventing Covid-19, with its associated risk of hospitalization and death, outweigh the risks of side effects.”“A longer review or a permanent ban would deal a more serious blow to the EU’s vaccination program,” Eurasia Group analyst Federico Santi wrote in a note. “It could mean the EU may not achieve a level of vaccinations consistent with a meaningful easing of restrictions in many member states until the end of the second quarter, rather than mid-Spring as we are currently expecting.”The suspension contrasts with AstraZeneca’s positive run in the U.K., where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is championing a rapid vaccination push and continues to deem the shot safe to use.Political PerilsThe response to possible side-effects puts additional pressure on countries at a time parts of Europe fall back into lockdowns. Italy has reintroduced harsher measures, and parts of Germany have also seen an increase in infections, prompting some medical experts to demand a tightening of the restrictions from which Europe’s largest economy was just starting to emerge.German Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters in Berlin on Monday that the decision to suspend was “professional, not political.” Still, the move drew a rebuke from some other lawmakers given the low numbers of possible blood-clot findings.AstraZeneca’s vaccine is one of four that have been approved in the EU, alongside shots from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and Johnson & Johnson. With supplies from J&J yet to arrive and doses of Moderna limited, that means the bulk of immunizations in many countries will now be conducted with Pfizer-BioNTech.After Denmark became one of the first countries in the region to suspend the AstraZeneca shot, the EMA said on March 11 that the number of clots in vaccinated people was no higher than the number seen in the general population -- totaling 30 cases among 5 million people who had received the vaccine. Neighboring Sweden has stuck with the vaccine, with the country’s medical products agency saying the benefits of the shot outweigh its risks.Serious BlowResponding to the suspensions, AstraZeneca said it’s working with national health authorities and European officials.“Around 17 million people in the EU and U.K. have now received our vaccine, and the number of cases of blood clots reported in this group is lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population,” AstraZeneca said in a statement.Belgium and Austria said late Monday that they would continue using the Astra shot, but would keep a close watch on the situation.“It’s a very good vaccine that protects people against this terrible disease,” Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said, according to Le Soir newspaper.In the U.K., Johnson also defended the vaccine. He said Monday that the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is “one of the toughest and most experienced regulators in the world” and sees “no reason at all” to discontinue its use. The tally of people who have received their first dose has passed 26 million in the country.Anthony Harnden, the deputy chairman of the U.K.’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told the BBC that about 3,000 blood clots a month are common in the general population of the country, and that such a diagnosis is bound to happen simultaneously with the vaccination, rather than being caused by it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-scare-european-health-ministers-to-discuss-shot-101615887411380.html
16-03-2021||World||Over 359 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered worldwide||At least 132 countries and territories have administered more than 359 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far.As per the data provided by Our World In Data citied by The New York Times, 359,460,397 doses have been administered and as many as 4.7 persons have been vaccinated per 100 people.In the US, as many as 135,847,835 doses have been delivered and 109,081,860 doses have been administered. 71,054,445 people have received at least one dose of the vaccine while 38,335,432 persons have been completely vaccinated, as per US Centres for Disease Control.In the UK, 24,453,221 people have received the first dose of the vaccine while 1,610,280 people have received their second dose of the vaccine as well, as per the figures provided by the government.In India, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as many as 3,29,47,432 doses have been administered in the country of which 2,70,79,484 people have received the first dose while 58,67,948 people have received the second dose.According to Our World In Data, 9,374,827 people have been vaccinated in Israel at a rate of 106 persons per 100 people.However, vaccine rollout in Europe has slowed down as Denmark, Iceland and Norway have suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine while the European Union's medicines regulator investigates whether the shot could be linked to a number of reports of blood clots, as reported by CNN.Portugal has announced that it is suspending the inoculation of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine as a "precaution," joining other European countries - including France, Germany, Italy and Spain - in halting its use following reports of blood clots post-inoculation.As of now, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Luxembourg are the European countries that have suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine as a precautionary measure.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also said Monday that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks, adding that the number of people developing blood clots after vaccination does not seem to be higher than in the general population.The agency said it would hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to advise on "any further actions that may need to be taken."CNN further reported thatthe Australian government said it "remains confident" in the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, after a growing list of countries paused the rollout of its use.Chief Medical Officer, Professor Paul Kelly, said in a statement Tuesday, "there is currently no evidence that it causes blood clots."Novavax on Thursday said final data from a trial in the United Kingdom shows its COVID-19 vaccine is almost 90 per cent effective, but the vaccine was far less effective in a separate trial in South Africa, given the virus variant there that has raised concerns about weakening vaccines.According to The Hill, the data from the UK trial was very strong and similar to interim data released in January. The final data showed the vaccine is 96 per cent effective against the original virus strain, and 86 per cent effective against the variant identified in the UK, for the overall effectiveness of 89.7 per cent.In South Africa, where a concerning variant is highly prevalent, the effectiveness was far lower, at 48.6 per cent, though it was a little higher, at 55 per cent, among people who did not have HIV.The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday issued emergency use authorization for Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for the one-shot dose to be used as part of the United Nation's international vaccine distribution effort.According to The Hill, The go-ahead signal from WHO, which comes a day after the European Union approved the shot, means that countries that receive shots through the UN's COVAX effort, which promotes equitable distribution of vaccines, could cite the new endorsement in the distribution of the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-359-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-administered-worldwide-101615887417581.html
16-03-2021||World||North Korea warns US not to 'cause a stink' before Seoul meeting||In North Korea's first comments directed at the Biden administration, Kim Jong Un's powerful sister on Tuesday warned the United States to “refrain from causing a stink” if it wants to “sleep in peace” for the next four years.Kim Yo Jong's statement was issued as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Asia to talk with US allies Japan and South Korea about North Korea and other regional issues. They have meetings in Tokyo on Tuesday before speaking to officials in Seoul on Wednesday.“We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off (gun) powder smell in our land,” she said.“If it wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.”Kim Yo Jong, a senior official who handles inter-Korean affairs, also criticized the US and South Korea for holding military exercises. She also said the North would consider abandoning a 2018 bilateral agreement on reducing military tensions and abolish a decades-old ruling party unit tasked to handle inter-Korean relations if it no longer had to cooperate with the South.She said the North would also consider scrapping an office that handled South Korean tours to the North's scenic Diamond Mountain, which Seoul suspended in 2008 after a North Korean guard fatally shot a South Korean tourist.The North "will watch the future attitude and actions of the (South Korean) authorities,” before determining whether to take exceptional measures against its rival, she said in her statement published in Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper.Challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear arsenal and China's growing influence loom large in the Biden administration's first Cabinet-level trip abroad, part of a larger effort to bolster U.S. influence and clam concerns about the US role in Asia following four years of President Donald Trump's “America first” approach.A senior official from the Biden administration said Saturday that U.S. officials have tried to reach out to North Korea through multiple channels since last month, but had yet to receive a response. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the diplomatic outreach and spoke on condition of anonymity.“This is Kim Yo Jong continuing to be the tip of the wedge North Korea tries to drive between South Korea and its US ally,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.“North Korea's latest threats mean the allies have precious little time to coordinate their approaches on deterrence, sanctions and engagement.”Biden's presidency begins as Kim Jong Un faces perhaps the toughest moment of his nine-year rule. His country's battered economy has decayed further amid pandemic border closures while his summits with Trump failed to lift crippling sanctions.While Kim in recent political speeches has vowed to strengthen his nuclear weapons program, he also has said the fate of US relations depends on Washington's actions.The 2018 military agreement, which had been the most tangible outcome from the three summits between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, requires the countries to take steps to reduce conventional military threats, such as establishing border buffers in land and sea and no-fly zones.But inter-Korean relations have lain in ruin amid the stalemate in the nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang.The South Korean and US militaries began annual military exercises last week that continue through Thursday.The drills are command post exercises and computerized simulation and don't involve field training. They said they held the downsized drills after reviewing factors like the status of COVID-19 and diplomatic efforts to resume the nuclear talks with North Korea.But Kim Yo Jong said even the smaller drills are an act of hostility toward the North. In the past, the North has often responded with U.S.-South Korea drills with missile tests.“(War drills) and hostility can never go with dialogue and cooperation,” she said.Boo Seung-chan, a spokesperson from South Korea's Defense Ministry, said the combined drills were defensive in nature and called for the North to show a more “flexible attitude” that would be constructive to stabilizing peace on the Korean Peninsula. He said the South's military wasn't detecting any unusual signs of military activity from the North.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-warns-us-not-to-cause-a-stink-before-seoul-meeting-101615887019933.html
16-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Hong Kong's tough rules sees babies isolated, families cramped||Families in Asia's financial hub of Hong Kong are suffering isolation and trauma after strict coronavirus rules have led to babies being separated from parents and those with newborns herded into tiny quarantine quarters for up to 14 days. Hong Kong authorities have ordered that anyone testing positive for the virus must go to hospital, including babies, while all their close contacts, even those who test negative, are sent to makeshift quarantine camps."It’s crazy," said one mother, who said she had to abruptly stop breastfeeding following separation from her seven-month-old son last week after she was diagnosed with Covid-19."I got fever last night because I have gone from breastfeeding to 100% pumping," said the woman, who asked not to be identified."So instead of dealing with Covid, I’m dealing with blocked sore breasts."The separation of families over the virus is not common in other developed cities, say legal experts.Hong Kong's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Shahana Hoque-Ali, a scientist who moderates the Hong Kong Quarantine support group on Facebook, said it had assisted in more than 100 cases of children who had faced separation from their parents over the past year, with dozens in the past week.A separate city-wide petition circulating online on Monday asked the government to allow young children the option of home quarantine. Around 4,700 of a targeted 5,000 residents signed up in a few hours according to the website.Many expatriate families with young children were among the hundreds of residents sent to quarantine last week after an outbreak at a popular upmarket gym in Hong Kong's Sai Ying Pun district.That case has ensnared bankers, lawyers and the city’s international school network, with some teachers and students infected.Separately, a group of eight babies and parents who attended a playgroup last week were sent to quarantine after one parent was confirmed positive because of the gym outbreak.The rest of the group tested negative but they were still required to quarantine."I am really worried, it's such a small space. Three of us in this room for 10 days won't work," said Nicholas Worley, whose wife Kylie and 15-month-old son, Hunter, attended the playgroup.The quarantine rooms in Penny's Bay that accommodate Worley and many others are 18 sq. m. (194 sq. ft) in size and lack refrigerators, cooking facilities or baby amenities.While staff there did their best to assist, the facility is not designed for families, the residents said.Worley, who heads consultancy Bain's public relations in Asia, said hazards in the room, such as sharp nails and edges, fuelled additional concern over his son's safety. The trauma and psychological impact on families is intense, said a 40-year-old man in quarantine with his two young children."It's an absolute nightmare, it is just such a mess," said the man, who sought anonymity. On Sunday a class of 35 nine-year-olds from the city's Harbour School were told they needed to enter quarantine, its managing director, Dan Blurton, told Reuters."Parents and the school have strongly requested for alternative arrangements that are more humane, with regards to the treatment of young children," he added.Legal experts said there were no set guidelines regarding family separations, with each case being handled individually. Hong Kong barrister Kirsteen Lau said that legally health officers had wide discretion to grant or deny permission for a child or parent to enter a place of isolation.However, this meant that regulations "give very little guidance as to what circumstances would allow a parent and child to stay together," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hong-kong-s-tough-rules-sees-babies-isolated-families-cramped-101615858973044.html
16-03-2021||World||News Corp inks Australia Facebook deal, signalling truce after blackout||Rupert Murdoch's News Corp reached a content-supply deal with Facebook Inc in Australia, the companies said on Tuesday, a step toward settling a dispute that saw the social media giant briefly shut down thousands of pages in the country.The agreement, terms of which were not disclosed, makes News Corp the first major media outlet to strike a Facebook deal under controversial new laws that let an Australian government-appointed arbitrator set fees if companies fail to do so.Facebook's shutting out all media content in the country for a week last month angered world leaders, as the blackout included emergency services and government health pages. It ended the shutdown when Australia agreed to soften some parts of the new regulations.News Corp, which owns about two-thirds of Australian metropolitan newspapers, was among media companies calling for the government to make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay for the media links that drive viewers, and advertising dollars, to their platforms.Google had also objected for months and threatened, like Facebook, to withdraw core services from the country, before signing deals with most media outlets - including News Corp - in the days before the rules became law."The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses," News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement that thanked the Australian prime minister, treasurer and chief antitrust regulator by name."This digital denouement has been more than a decade in the making," Thomson added.Facebook's head of news partnerships in Australia, Andrew Hunter, said the deal meant Facebook's 17 million users in the country "will gain access to premium news articles and breaking news video from News Corp's network of national, metropolitan, rural and suburban newsrooms".As well as the country's top-selling tabloids The Daily Telegraph in Sydney and The Herald-Sun in Melbourne, News runs a subscription cable TV network called Sky News, which struck a separate Facebook deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, according to News Corp.News Corp was first to say it struck a Facebook deal, but free-to-air television broadcaster and newspaper publisher Seven West Media Ltd has previously said it signed a letter of intent to do so.On Tuesday, Seven rival Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd reported in the Australian Financial Review that it had also signed a letter of intent for a Facebook deal.A Nine spokesman said the company, which also publishes the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, "continue(s) having constructive and fruitful discussions with Facebook (and) when we have anything to announce we will do so".A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the Nine negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/news-corp-inks-australia-facebook-deal-signalling-truce-after-blackout-101615859023024.html
16-03-2021||World||China state TV raps Kohler, BMW for using facial recognition||Chinese state TV has criticized bathroom fixtures brand Kohler and automaker BMW for using facial recognition to identify customers in a possible violation of privacy rules that took effect this year.The accusation came in an annual China Central Television broadcast Monday to mark Consumers’ Day that often highlights complaints against foreign brands.Facial recognition is used by China’s government as part of a nationwide surveillance network to monitor the public through millions of video cameras, eavesdropping on email and messaging services and other technology.Some Chinese developers market facial recognition technology abroad, prompting complaints they might be helping oppressive governments.Kohler Co. stores, BMW dealerships and MaxMara fashion boutiques are among retailers that use facial recognition to identify and track customers, often without telling them, CCTV said.On Tuesday, Kohler said it would stop using the technology. The company said facial recognition was used only to record how many customers visited shops and information about them wasn’t saved.“We sincerely apologize to customers!” Kohler said on its social media account. “Kohler respects the rights and interests of consumers, takes warning and seriously corrects problems.”Faces are considered “sensitive personal information” under a legal change that took effect Jan. 1, CCTV said. It said anyone processing personal information must obtain the individual’s consent.The growing number of companies and devices that allow use of facial recognition as a substitute for a password means that if that information leaks, “it will seriously threaten the privacy and property security of users,” CCTV said.Some public places in China such as airports have signs that tell visitors they are being recorded.In 2019, a law professor sued a zoo in the eastern city of Hangzhou for requiring visitors to record their faces. News reports said the zoo responded by giving visitors the option of leaving their fingerprints instead.BMW AG didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Phone calls to MaxMara’s China headquarters in Beijing weren’t answered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-state-tv-raps-kohler-bmw-for-using-facial-recognition-101615868265313.html

Four other members of the security forces were missing.Diplomats and advocates have become alarmed at the rising violence, including targeted attacks on government employees, journalists, academics and rights workers in recent months even as peace negotiations were being held in Qatar.Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement on Tuesday condemning the targeted killings, especially those against minority groups, women and journalists."Unidentified attackers have also gone after journalists, civil society activists, and professionals, killing many, driving some from the country, and leaving the rest to live in fear," said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW.With the US-brokered peace talks struggling to make headway, Washington's special envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad is currently on a regional visit, trying to find a way forward before a looming deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-two-killed-in-afghanistan-after-gunmen-ambush-university-bus-101615886035540.html
16-03-2021||World||UN report finds APAC region may achieve less than 10% of SDGs by 2030||The Asia-Pacific region is lagging behind in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set for 2030, and at the current rate the region may achieve less than 10 per cent of the targets, a UN report said on Tuesday.As many as 829 million workers employed in the informal sector were impacted in April 2020 due to the pandemic-induced lockdown, the report noted.There are 17 goals under the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (UNESCAP), targeted to be achieved by 2030.These include no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, bio-diversity, innovation and infrastructure, and reduced inequalities, among others."The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is not on track to achieve any of the 17 SDGs by 2030. On its current trajectory, the region may achieve less than 10 per cent of the SDG targets," said the report titled 'Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report' of the UNESCAP.The region must urgently reverse its regressing trends on many SDGs to achieve its ambitions by 2030, the UN report said adding Asia-Pacific fell short of its 2020 milestones even before entering the global pandemic."There is therefore an added urgency to ensure that responses to the pandemic in the region and at the national level accelerate progress toward the 2030 Agenda," it said.The report also talks about the impact of mandatory lockdowns and social distancing measures on data collection activities, particularly from vulnerable groups.Unemployment increased by 15 million in the region in 2020. Compared to 2019, workers in the region lost 7.1 per cent of their labour income in 2020, equivalent to over USD 1 trillion, it said."In April 2020, lockdown measures impacted some 829 million informal workers in Asia-Pacific region."Acknowledging that in the last decade, Asia-Pacific made extraordinary progress in good health and well-being, credited to partly explain its relative success in reducing the health impact of Covid-19 on its people, the report said despite these hard won gains, there are challenges in providing adequate healthcare workforce, reducing premature deaths and improving mental health.Some subregions are well positioned to achieve a few of the goals. East and North-East Asia is on track to eradicate poverty and provide clean water and sanitation for all.South-East Asia is on track to promote sustainable industry and innovation.However, none of the sub-regions are on track on environment-related goals, and four sub-regions are regressing on climate action and life below water.Making an alarming observation on regressing climate action trends and life below water goals, UNESCAP said the region is responsible for more than half of the global greenhouse gas emissions and adverse impacts of natural disasters on people and economies increase year-by-year."As we find our way out of this pandemic, the report suggests we must focus efforts on more equitable and greener growth," it said.Green house gas emissions containment measures due to the pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in the hazardous emissions with a decrease in global daily carbon dioxide emissions of 17 per cent in April 2020 compared to the year-ago period.In Asia-Pacific, this pattern has been evident in China, India, Japan and the Russian Federation.Environmental monitoring, including satellite data clearly indicates that air quality has improved in the first half of 2020 in many countries of the region. Data shows air pollution over northern India at a 20-year low, with New Delhi and nearby areas registering a significant 50 per cent reduction of aerosol optical depth (correlating to fine particulate matter, PM2.5 and PM10) in April.However, the report said while the drop in carbon dioxide emissions has been significant, it was also temporary and emissions rose as soon as lockdowns were lifted.China relaxed its lockdown earlier than other countries, and the impact is particularly evident with its emissions during April to June comparable to or higher than emissions in the year-ago same months, the report pointed out."Recovery measures are an excellent opportunity for us to rethink our options for development pathways that are inclusive, more resilient, and respect planetary boundaries,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana."As we enter the Decade of Action to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to reinforce our collective commitment to the SDGs and let it provide our compass for building back together, better and greener," she said.To build back better, governments should renew their commitments to the SDGs' monitoring framework so that recovery can accelerate a global transformation as promised by the 2030 Agenda, the report said.The agency has also developed a National SDG Tracker tool to help the countries in the region make progress assessment on the goals.National governments can use the tool to produce snapshots of progress towards the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-report-finds-apac-region-may-achieve-less-than-10-of-sdgs-by-2030-101615885895456.html
16-03-2021||World||Sweden is latest country to stop using AstraZeneca vaccine||Sweden on Tuesday became the latest European country to pause use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine amid reports of dangerous blood clots in some recipients.The company and international regulators continue to say the vaccine is safe, however, and many countries elsewhere in the world are forging ahead with their vaccination campaigns.The move by the Swedish Public Health Agency is pending an investigation by the European Medicines Agency. ”The decision is a precautionary measure,” Swedish chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said in a statement.Also Tuesday, the German government said it will postpone a virtual summit on the country's vaccination efforts until after the EMA meeting, scheduled for Thursday.Germany, France, Italy and Spain were among countries that suspended use of the vaccine on Monday.The German government and the country's 16 state governors had planned to meet Wednesday for a virtual summit on the country's slow vaccination campaign and on ways to speed it up.AstraZeneca’s formula is one of three vaccines in use on the European continent. But the escalating concern is another setback for the European Union’s vaccination drive, which has been plagued by shortages and other hurdles and is lagging well behind the campaigns in Britain and the US.The EU’s drug regulatory agency will review experts’ findings on the AstraZeneca shot and decide whether action needs to be taken.Much of Asia has shrugged off concerns about the AstraZeneca jab, with Thailand’s prime minister receiving a shot at the start of the country's use of the vaccine on Tuesday.“There are people who have concerns,” Prayuth Chan-ocha said after his vaccination. “But we must believe doctors, believe in our medical professionals.”Thailand initially was the first country outside Europe to temporarily suspend using the AstraZeneca vaccine. But Thailand’s health authorities later decided to go ahead with it, with Prayuth and members of his Cabinet receiving the first shots.Indonesia suspended use of the vaccine on Monday, saying it was waiting for a full report from the World Health Organization regarding possible side effects.AstraZeneca has developed a manufacturing base in Asia, and the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, has been contracted by the company to produce a billion doses of the vaccine for developing nations. Hundreds of millions more are to be manufactured this year in Australia, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.AstraZeneca has said there have been 37 reports of blood clots out of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the 27-country EU and Britain. The drugmaker said there is no evidence the vaccine carries an increased risk of clots.In fact, it said the incidence of clots is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar to that of other licensed Covid-19 vaccines.Australia’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said there was no evidence so far that the vaccine causes blood clots.“Blood clots happen, they happen in Australia fairly commonly,” he said. “But, from my perspective, I do not see that there is any specific link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots, and I’m not alone in that opinion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-is-latest-country-to-stop-using-astrazeneca-vaccine-101615885004336.html
16-03-2021||World||EU to lay out plan for lifting lockdowns amid AstraZeneca setback||The European Union will start plotting its strategy to gradually lift coronavirus lockdowns, even as an AstraZeneca Plc vaccine health scare risks causing additional delays to the bloc’s botched immunization campaign.“There is reason to look forward to a substantial reduction in the prevalence of the virus, raising the prospect of a lifting of the restrictions weighing on citizens and the economy alike,” the European Commission will say in a policy document due to be unveiled Wednesday. “EU citizens have good reason to expect the situation to improve,” it will say, according to a draft seen by Bloomberg.The coordinated lifting of lockdowns will be based on a tier “system reflecting the epidemiological situation in each member state,” the Commission will say. The document’s publication is coming as a surge in contagion across the continent is forcing governments to prolong or reimpose restrictions.The tier system, due to be proposed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, will simulate how much latitude each government has to lighten the measures “without risking a reversal in the spread of the virus.” The ECDC will aim to launch the system next month, the draft says.The EU wants to vaccinate the bulk of its adult population against the virus by the end of summer, paving the way for a return to a semblance of normalcy after the once-in-a-century pandemic killed more than 550,000 people in the bloc and led its economy to the steepest recession on record.London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd. said the suspended rollout of Astra’s Covid-19 vaccine in some EU countries over concerns about possible side effects could delay the goal of immunizing three-quarters of populations by as much as a month. Still, the draft confirms the bloc is expecting 300 million doses to be distributed to members in the second quarter, which may help accelerate the bloc’s sluggish inoculation programs.Vaccination PassThe Commission will say on Wednesday that inoculations are just one piece of the reopening puzzle. On Wednesday, the EU’s executive arm will also publish a legislative proposal for a digital pass certifying that holders have been vaccinated, tested negative or recovered from the virus.The latest draft of the “Digital Green Certificate” regulation allows for vaccines authorized by national governments but not by the European Medicines Agency to be included in the certificate. The document suggests that it will be up to each individual member state to decide whether those inoculated with such shots are considered immune and therefore safe to travel, according to a person familiar with the proposals.Hungary has already started administering vaccines manufactured in Russia and China, which have yet to receive approval by the EU’s drugs regulator. The decision to include shots in the certificate that haven’t received pan-European authorization could help ease travel from outside the bloc, helping tourism-dependent economies attract more visitors. The pass will also include a mechanism to provide for vaccines administered in non-EU countries.Preparations should start “on a common approach to the gradual lifting of restrictions, to ensure that efforts are coordinated when the epidemiological situation allows for an easing of current measures,” EU leaders will say in a joint communique next week. Work on inter-operable vaccine “certificates should be taken forward as a matter of priority,” leaders will say according to a draft of their statement seen by Bloomberg.The introduction of such passes is intended to ease travel for those not considered to be carrying the virus. The EU hopes member states will approve the proposal swiftly so the certificates are in place by mid-June. Vaccination certificates may also allow the lifting of the almost blanket ban currently in place for incoming travel from outside the EU.“Tourism and other travel from outside the EU are an important feature of the EU’s openness,” the Commission will say, promising to “facilitate adaptation of restrictions where travelers from third countries,” are “in a position to present certificates under a system deemed sufficiently reliable.”Investors are also pricing in a resumption of travel. Europe’s Stoxx 600 Travel & Leisure Index fully erased its pandemic losses and closed at a record on Monday. While airlines in the gauge remain a long way from levels reached in February 2020, they’ve been rebounding since November on positive vaccine expectations and as countries such as the U.K. map out a path to ease lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-lay-out-plan-for-lifting-lockdowns-amid-astrazeneca-setback-101615879613773.html
16-03-2021||World||'US-China ties won't improve until...': Joe Biden's aide explains||US relations with China won’t improve until Beijing stops its economic coercion against America’s close regional ally, Australia, a senior aide to President Joe Biden told the Age newspaper.The administration has told the Chinese government that the US wasn’t going to leave Australia alone on the field, Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council’s Asia coordinator, said in an interview. Other nations including Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam have also been targeted by undeclared economic actions by Beijing, Campbell told the Melbourne-based newspaper.The nod of support comes days after the leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the US vowed to to promote regional security in their first virtual “Quad” summit. While China wasn’t mentioned in the group’s final statement, references to an “open” Indo-Pacific region and shared security interests left little doubt that the meeting was a show of unity against Beijing.Ties between Australia and its largest trading partner have deteriorated since April, when Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government called for independent investigators be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus. Since then, Beijing has implemented a range of trade actions against Australian goods, including coal, wine and barley.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian sidestepped a question about Campbell’s comments at a regular news briefing in Beijing, saying only that Beijing and Washington were discussing topics for their planned meeting later this week in Alaska. The cause of tensions between China and Australia was actions by Canberra, Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uschina-ties-won-t-improve-until-joe-biden-s-aide-explains-101615885118867.html

They’ve climbed roughly 12% this year to $2,218 in London -- the highest since mid-2018 -- amid a rally in commodities from metals to energy and food.EGA, which has smelters in Abu Dhabi and Dubai and a bauxite mine in Guinea, had planned an initial public offering in 2018 or 2019. That was pulled after then-US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on aluminum imports from the UAE.The company may still carry out a listing, though it’s not said when.“The timing is a decision for our shareholders, and we will keep working on our financial performance so that when the shareholders are ready for a sale, we’re ready for it,” Chief Financial Officer Zouhir Regragui said.EGA is equally owned by two sovereign wealth funds -- Investment Corp. of Dubai and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co.US TariffsTrump decided to end the 10% tariffs just before leaving office in January, but his successor Joe Biden then said they’d remain in place so as not to displace American producers.“The matter is between the two governments,” said bin Kalban. “We were quite disappointed with the decision. We made it clear that our aluminum is an important part of the US’s supply.”Shipments from the UAE account for slightly more than 10% of US aluminum imports.EGA said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were 4.1 billion dirhams ($1.1 billion) in 2020, up 63% from the year before.It expects better returns this year as it maximizes production and expands the Al Taweelah smelter in Abu Dhabi.Also read: UAE asks listed companies to add at least one woman to boardThe company will try to sell more low-carbon aluminum to customers, according to bin Kalban. Last month, it announced a deal worth as much as 100 million euros ($120 million) to supply aluminum made with solar power to BMW AG.Low-carbon aluminum is fast gaining traction, despite it being more expensive, with firms including Apple Inc. working with suppliers to reduce emissions. Electricity generation accounts for around 60% of the aluminum industry’s greenhouse-gas emissions and most smelters still use coal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aluminum-pjsc-expects-elevated-prices-as-global-economy-recovers-from-pandemic-101615879400972.html

But in a statement Tuesday morning, the government said the summit would be postponed until after the EMA's meeting, which is scheduled for Thursday.AstraZeneca's formula is one of three vaccines in use on the European continent. But the escalating concern is another setback for the European Union's vaccination drive, which has been plagued by shortages and other hurdles and is lagging well behind the campaigns in Britain and the US.The EU's drug regulatory agency will review experts' findings on the AstraZeneca shot and decide whether action needs to be taken.Elsewhere, much of Asia has shrugged off concerns about the AstraZeneca jab, with Thailand's prime minister receiving a shot at the start of the country's use of the vaccine on Tuesday.“There are people who have concerns,” Prayuth Chan-ocha said after his vaccination. “But we must believe doctors, believe in our medical professionals.”Thailand initially was the first country outside Europe to temporarily suspend using the AstraZeneca vaccine. But Thailand's health authorities later decided to go ahead with AstraZeneca, with Prayuth and members of his Cabinet receiving the first shots.Indonesia suspended the use of the vaccine on Monday, saying it was waiting for a full report from the World Health Organisation regarding possible side effects.AstraZeneca has developed a manufacturing base in Asia, and the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker, has been contracted by the company to produce a billion doses of the vaccine for developing nations. Hundreds of millions more are to be manufactured this year in Australia, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.AstraZeneca has said there have been 37 reports of blood clots out of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the 27-country EU and Britain. The drugmaker said there is no evidence the vaccine carries an increased risk of clots.In fact, it said the incidence of clots is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar to that of other licensed COVID-19 vaccines.Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said there was no evidence so far that the vaccine causes blood clots.“Blood clots happen, they happen in Australia fairly commonly,” he said. “But, from my perspective, I do not see that there is any specific link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots, and I'm not alone in that opinion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-defers-covid-19-vaccination-summit-over-astrazeneca-furore-101615884496368.html

The project cost is estimated to be around $750 million, according to Daya Ratnayake, chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority.This marks the latest addition in the expanding portfolio of the Indian firm that already operates a dozen ports in India, commands 30% market share locally and recently secured an investment from Warburg Pincus LLC. Its tie-up with John Keells -- Sri Lanka’s largest listed conglomerate -- also bolsters India’s engagement with its neighboring nation that has in recent years relied heavily on China for building its infrastructure.Also read: Ranking billionaires: As Adani beat Bezos, Musk here’s a look at 5 othersShares of Adani Ports rose as much as 2.3% in Mumbai on Tuesday, pushing this year’s climb to almost 50%.

The World Bank estimates the pandemic will push as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty.Also read: Joe Biden eyes first major tax hike since 1993 in next economic planHe said the meeting reflected Yellen's focus on the global nature of the pandemic, and her willingness to engage with a range of US leaders to hammer out solutions.Faith groups have been outspoken in urging the Biden administration to back a big boost in the International Monetary Fund's emergency reserve funds or Special Drawing Rights to help poor countries devastated by the pandemic.Yellen has given her qualified support for an new allocation of SDRs, reversing the opposition of the Trump administration. US support is critical for any boost in reserves since the United States is the IMF's largest shareholder.She spoke on Monday with British finance minister Rishi Sunak, and both agreed a new SDR allocation could form an important part of a package of support for low-income countries.Italy and other members of the Group of 20 major economies have called for a $500 billion issuance of new SDRs, a move akin to a central bank printing money. The IMF is currently working on a proposal to submit to its member countries this spring.The meeting will include senior officials from the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest Jewish movement in North America, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the United Church of Christ, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the United Methodist Church.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yellen-to-meet-christian-jewish-religious-leaders-and-jubilee-network-director-101615876982491.html
16-03-2021||World||Johnson says UK will become a global activist after Brexit||Prime Minister Boris Johnson will redirect British foreign policy toward the Indo-Pacific region as he sets out a sweeping overhaul of the U.K.’s international priorities after Brexit.The premier will publish a 100-page blueprint for diplomacy and defense, which his officials are billing as the most wide ranging re-evaluation of the U.K.’s place in the world since the end of the Cold War.In the plan, Johnson will outline a new more activist approach to international relations on issues such as climate change and democracy as he makes clear he regards the Indo-Pacific as increasingly the geopolitical center of the world, especially with the growing clout of China. Johnson intends to visit India at the end of April on his first trip overseas since Britain left the European Union trade and market regime.The plan is also due to lift the cap on the number of nuclear warheads that Britain can stockpile, according to the Guardian newspaper. The limit would increase from 180 warheads to 260 warheads, the Guardian said, citing a leaked copy of the review.“The policy is to maintain a minimal credible deterrent,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on BBC Radio Scotland on Tuesday, when asked about the U.K.’s nuclear arsenal. “We’ve also got to deal with the asymmetric threats, from criminal gangs, hostile states, whether it’s Iran or Russia.”The policy framework spans overseas aid, cyber warfare, the future of the armed forces, and addressing climate change. For Johnson, it’s a chance to tell the world how he sees post-Brexit Britain’s role in the global order developing over the next decade.“I am profoundly optimistic about the U.K.’s place in the world and our ability to seize the opportunities ahead,” the prime minister said in a statement before publication of the so-called integrated review.Brexit TiltSince leaving the EU’s orbit at the end of last year, the U.K. has sought new trade and political alliances around the world including a focus on strengthening ties with the U.S. The new tilt toward the Indo-Pacific region is aimed at neutralizing any threat from China, as lawmakers in London take an increasingly hawkish line toward Beijing over its policies on Hong Kong and its Uighur Islamic minority.Marking this shift, the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier warship will sail to the Pacific on her maiden deployment later this year, the government said. The U.K. is also applying for partner status at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the premier’s office said.“It is important messaging to show China that if she flouts the global rules-based system that alliances will form, she can’t pick opposition off individually,” Alan West, a member of the House of Lords and former head of the Royal Navy, said in an interview. “It is also the fastest-growing economic area and crucial for the new global Britain.”According to Johnson’s office, the review will include:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-says-uk-will-become-a-global-activist-after-brexit-101615883231577.html

The Thai capital reported 100 new infections on Tuesday, majority of which came from active case finding efforts to curb the spread, officials said.The spike in cases come as the Southeast Asian nation accelerates a national inoculation program before further easing quarantine rules for foreign visitors. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha was among the first to get the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine on Tuesday after a local panel of health experts said the shot posed no risk of clotting, a key reason cited by some European countries to suspend its use.Also read: Thailand plans to ease quarantine rules for tourists, Bangkok post saysAlthough the number of infections reported from the Bangkok cluster is still low, an outbreak at a seafood market in a neighboring province in December led to the country’s biggest wave of infections.

16-03-2021||World||UK oil, gas industry struggles to recover from slump caused by Covid-19||The UK’s oil and gas industry faces a struggle to recover from an investment slump sparked by the coronavirus and in the longer term will have to manage a prolonged decline in output, according to its trade body.Production may decline further this year and next, following a 5% decrease in 2020, Oil & Gas UK said in a report published on Tuesday. That follows a plunge in development and operations spending in the sector, which slumped 23% year-on-year to 11.6 billion pounds (about $16 billion), the lowest since 2004 in real terms.“Most companies in our industry remain in a fragile state” even as economies start to reopen, OGUK Chief Executive Officer Deirdre Michie said. “This year is likely to remain highly challenging, as companies continue to navigate the operational issues associated with the pandemic” while repairing finances.UK oil producers, which have seen output slump more than 60% in the past two decades as fields have aged, took another big hit from the pandemic. Only seven exploration wells were drilled last year, the least since 1965, according to OGUK, and thousands of jobs were lost.The sector is also under increasing pressure as the government seeks to move the country away from dependence on fossil fuels. Ministers are even considering an end to issuing new oil exploration licenses in the North Sea in 2040, the Telegraph reported at the weekend.Also read: Covid variant "taking over" UK, likely to dominate other countries too: ExpertThe UK industry “is leading the way on green technologies” and any licensing constraints would only increase volumes of imported fuel, OGUK said Monday. The country’s own gas and crude production -- 1.61 million barrels of oil equivalent a day last year -- covers about 70% of needs, its data show.Longer-Term DeclineOGUK sees an output decline of between 5% and 7% a year in 2021 and 2022 due to the drop in spending, as well as an increase in planned maintenance outages deferred from 2020. The basin needs “a steady stream of investment in new fields,” according to the report.There is a chance for “stabilization” in volumes toward the middle of the decade, but “overall we are in for a period of longer-term decline,” Ross Dornan, market intelligence manager at OGUK, told reporters. Yet, it is important “to manage that decline as effectively as possible,” he said.There is a range of projects being considered for investment approval in 2021 and 2022 that could unlock 700 million barrels of resources, OGUK said in the report. “But they are contingent on greater market stability and continued regulatory and government support,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-oil-gas-industry-struggles-to-recover-from-slump-caused-by-covid19-101615877197095.html

They are the first new scrolls found in archaeological excavations in the desert south of Jerusalem in 60 years.The new pieces are believed to belong to a set of parchment fragments found in a site known as “The Cave of Horror" — named for the 40 human skeletons found there during excavations in the 1960s — that also bear a Greek rendition of the Twelve Minor Prophets. The cave is located in a remote canyon in the Judean Desert south of Jerusalem.The fragments are believed to have been stashed away in the cave during the Bar Kochba Revolt, an armed Jewish uprising against Rome during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, between 132 and 136 AD.The artefacts were found during an operation by the Israel Antiquities Authority in the Judean Desert to find scrolls and other artefacts to prevent possible plundering. The authority was holding a news conference Tuesday to unveil the discovery.The Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of Jewish texts found in desert caves in the West Bank near Qumran in the 1940s and 1950s, date from the 3rd century B.C. to the 1st century A.D. They include the earliest known copies of biblical texts and documents outlining the beliefs of a little-understood Jewish sect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-experts-unearth-new-fragments-of-2000-year-old-dead-sea-scrolls-101615881148462.html
16-03-2021||World||Israel’s fourth election in 2 years: What’s different this time?||Israel’s holding parliamentary elections for the fourth time in two years on March 23 -- yet while it seems we’ve seen this film before, the domestic and global landscapes have changed vastly since the last vote. In March 2020, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, dogged by corruption allegations, was facing his most serious challenger in years. Israel hadn’t even entered the first of its three coronavirus lockdowns. Netanyahu’s chum Donald Trump was in office, and no prospective prime minister wanted to be seen courting Israel’s Arab minority.That was then. This is now:The PandemicNetanyahu has claimed credit for the world’s most successful vaccination drive, with nearly half of Israel’s 9.3 million people fully inoculated against Covid-19. Polls suggest that hasn’t given him a bump after his initially strong leadership in the pandemic gave way to confusing and politicized health decisions.The TrialNetanyahu went on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust two months after the last election. Proceedings have started slowly, but lives blighted by the virus outbreak have galvanized weekly protests demanding the ouster of a leader governing while under indictment. With joblessness a stubbornly high 18%, and thousands of businesses disappearing, he’s sunken deeper into trouble, not only with opponents, but onetime supporters, too.Gantz GoneFormer military chief Benny Gantz dueled Netanyahu to a draw in the previous three elections but his Blue and White has been limping since he teamed up with Netanyahu in a short-lived government. The party has shrunken from a high of 35 of parliament’s 120 seats to as few as four, barely enough to enter parliament, polls show. No single party is putting up a similar challenge this time.Fractured RightNetanyahu’s Likud party splintered last year, giving loyalists another slate with a similar ideology, Gideon Sa’ar’s New Hope. Sa’ar has vowed he won’t join a government headed by his former mentor, as has another nationalist party, Avigdor Liberman’s Yisrael Beitenu. Naftali Bennett, leader of the predominantly religious Yamina party, hasn’t committed either way and could become kingmaker.Extreme RightNetanyahu persuaded two hardline factions to run on a joint ticket to maximize their chances of entering parliament and joining the coalition he hopes to form. That means any Netanyahu-led coalition could include an admirer of the assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, who advocated expelling Arabs from Israel and territories it captured in wars with Arab states.No More Donald TrumpIsrael was thrilled with Trump, who recognized Jerusalem as its capital, and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. His Middle East peace plan favored Israel, he cut off aid to the Palestinians, and he brokered agreements between Israel and former foes in the Persian Gulf and Africa. Most important, perhaps, Trump shared Netanyahu’s antipathy toward the Iranian nuclear deal. That honeymoon is over. U.S. President Joe Biden is trying to rejoin the nuclear accord, and has reset relations with the Palestinians, resuming contacts and restoring aid.Divide and ConquerIf in the past, Netanyahu had vilified Israel’s Arab leaders, and warned about Arab voters going to the polls “in droves,” then this time he went on a charm offensive, visiting communities, courting Arab mayors and promising aid. Critics attribute his sudden change of heart to a desire to break up the Joint List of Arab parties and weaken the opposition. The Joint List did fracture and polls show a drop in support for Arab parliamentary factions that benefits the prime minister.Still, Some Things Never ChangeLikud is maintaining a comfortable lead over its nearest competitor, former Finance Minister Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, but Netanyahu won’t be able to easily form a coalition government, polls suggest. It’s unclear whether the anti-Netanyahu bloc would be able to put aside differences and ambitions to form a government if it musters enough support. Israel has had three inconclusive elections.

It reported the first case of that strain in January.Russian state-sponsored news agency, TASS, reported today that the country has registered a "test system" for detecting several different coronavirus strains.The British coronavirus strain is also among the variants that Russia is developing detection for, the agency quoted Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko as saying.Russia claims that it doesn’t yet have the Brazilian variant of the virus, although the so-called British variant was detected.The country is currently embroiled in a controversy with the United States over alleged coronavirus vaccine 'misinformation', that the US has accused Russia of spreading to "undermine" Covid-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-identifies-2-cases-of-south-african-covid-19-variant-regulator-101615878252480.html
16-03-2021||World||WE Charity founders grilled by Canadian lawmakers, Trudeau’s own party members||The two founding brothers of WE Charity were grilled Monday by Canadian lawmakers, including members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, as what began as a political scandal broadens into a wider controversy about the organization and its dealings with donors.In almost three hours of often combative testimony, Craig and Marc Kielburger appeared alongside their lawyer to take questions from the parliamentary ethics committee. In defiant opening remarks, Marc blamed politicians for destroying the charity. “Today, we are taking a stand,” he said. “We have been disappointed in the conduct of all political parties.”But Franceso Sorbara, a Liberal lawmaker from Ontario, told the brothers: “You want to throw blame on everyone else and not take responsibility for things that have happened within your control.”The WE organization, founded 25 years ago by the Kielburgers, landed at the heart of controversy last summer after Trudeau failed to recuse himself from a government decision to give the charity a no-bid contract to distribute pandemic aid. (The prime minister’s wife, mother and brother had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past to appear at WE events.)A Bloomberg Businessweek investigation in December included reports by former staff that donor plaques at WE projects in Kenya were swapped so often that the running joke was they should’ve been made of Velcro. WE denied the allegations at the time, calling them “baseless” and saying plaques are cemented into buildings. But it has since acknowledged removing at least two donors’ plaques. Further investigations by Bloomberg as well as national broadcaster CBC uncovered multiple cases where donors mistakenly believed they were the sole financiers of schools and water wells in the country.“What’s a member of the public like me to make of this?,” asked another lawmaker from Trudeau’s party, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, expressing confusion at WE’s evolving explanations. “Why would a plaque ever be taken down?”Craig didn’t answer the question but said the organization is conducting a review to see if there were additional cases. Asked who was responsible for moving plaques, he sought to deflect accountability to staff overseas. “It would’ve been a member of the Kenya team.” He also indicated that confusion may have arisen because funding comes from multiple sources to build and later operate a school.Also read: AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective, says Canadian PM TrudeauIn December, WE told Bloomberg that such schools, once built, are handed off to the Kenyan Ministry of Education to manage and staffed by government teachers. Asked Monday to clarify who funds ongoing operations, the brothers said the government doesn’t pay for all costs and that WE continues to contribute to operating expenses such as teacher training and school supplies.“We are transparent with our donors. We’re not perfect. We make errors,” Craig said. “We try to own those errors to the best of our ability.”The apology drew incredulity from Charlie Angus, a New Democratic Party lawmaker who has led the effort to broaden the committee’s conflict-of-interest probe to WE’s Kenya operations and dealings with donors.Angus noted that one donor, Reed Cowan, had testified that a high-profile WE supporter -- whose extended family has funded reports defending the organization -- had sought to silence him from going public about a plaque dedicated to his deceased 4-year-old son being swapped without his knowledge.“The fact that you took that plaque down twice shows this wasn’t an accident -- this was willful,” said Angus, who has amplified Cowan’s calls for U.S. and Canadian police and tax authorities to investigate the WE organization.At times during the tense hearing, other members of Trudeau’s party sought to soften the exchanges. But opposition lawmakers, increasingly frustrated as the brothers repeatedly turned questions back on them, allowed little reprieve.“Your smirking and your evading might be fun now -- it’s not going to be fun when we’re investigating you for contempt of parliament,” said Pierre Poilievre of the Conservative Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-charity-founders-grilled-by-canadian-lawmakers-trudeau-s-own-party-members-101615868079895.html

Other nations including Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam have also been targeted by undeclared economic actions by Beijing, Campbell told the Melbourne-based newspaper.The nod of support comes days after the leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the US vowed to to promote regional security in their first virtual “Quad” summit. While China wasn’t mentioned in the group’s final statement, references to an “open” Indo-Pacific region and shared security interests left little doubt that the meeting was a show of unity against Beijing.Ties between Australia and its largest trading partner have deteriorated since April, when Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government called for independent investigators be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus. Since then, Beijing has implemented a range of trade actions against Australian goods, including coal, wine and barley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/improvement-in-us-china-relations-depends-on-treatment-of-australia-biden-aide-101615876423111.html
16-03-2021||World||Controversy around AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine explained. What WHO says||The World Health Organization (WHO) has ruled out any link between AstraZeneca’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and reported blood clots even as several European countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, suspended its use."We do not want people to panic and we would, for the time being, recommend that countries continue vaccinating with AstraZeneca," WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan was quoted as saying by news agency AFP. "So far, we do not find an association between these events and the vaccine," she added.Here’s what you need to know about the controversy around AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine1. Concerns about the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in Britain were raised after three people were hospitalised in Norway last week with blood clots, bleeding, and low platelet counts after receiving the shot. One of them died of a brain haemorrhage, according to health authorities cited by AFP, while the other two were reported to be stable.2. WHO safety experts shall meet on Tuesday while a probe to ascertain whether there is a connection between the vaccine and the complaints is underway. If there are similarities between the three cases in Norway is also being looked into, Bloomberg reported.3. The British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca on Monday said that a review of at least 17 million individuals suggests that the vaccine was safe for use. The blood clotting events were not related to the vaccine, AZD1222, the company said in a statement.4. WHO and European Medicines Agency (EMA) experts will separately discuss data from AstraZeneca vaccinations, and the European regulator will hold an extraordinary meeting two days later to decide on any further action, AFP reported.5. Denmark was the first country to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on March 11 as a precautionary measure. Iceland and Norway followed the temporary move the same day.6. On Friday, Bulgaria suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine as it probed caused the death of a woman with several underlying conditions who recently took the shot, according to AFP.7. Ireland and the Netherlands join the list on Sunday, followed by Indonesia and then Germany, Italy, France, Slovenia, Spain, and Latvia on Monday.8. Australia, however, has ruled out the halt of the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, authorities said on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also termed the shot “both safe and effective.”9. AstraZeneca's shot, among the cheapest available, was chosen for supplying to the poorer nations.10. The WHO has appealed to countries not to suspend vaccinations against Covid-19 that has killed over 2.7 million deaths across the globe. The global body’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said systems were in place to protect public health, according to Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/controversy-around-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-explained-what-who-says-101615876251825.html
16-03-2021||World||Biden's 1.9 trillion bill could end up in stocks, bitcoin: Analysts||President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus will start flooding into the US economy soon, and some analysts say much of that money could end up invested in stocks or even bitcoin.Over the weekend, the government began sending the $1,400 direct payments that will go to nearly everyone in the United States.About $400 billion in payments will flow directly to households, going to individuals earning less than $75,000 a year or married couples making up to $150,000, as well as their children.And that does not count child tax credits or unemployment benefits in the massive package, which also includes funds to contain Covid-19, accelerate vaccinations, help reopen schools and aid businesses and state and local governments.The direct payments amount to $5,600 -- tax free -- for a typical family of four, funds officials hope will boost the US economy.But the majority of Americans say that rather than spend, they will use the money to pay off debts, add to savings or to invest, according to one survey by Bank of America, which interviewed 3,000 people.The bank found that 30 percent will use the money to repay their debt, 25 percent will save it and nine percent will invest.Those funds will "stay within the financial system and don't create demand for goods and services in the real economy," the report found.With only 36 percent saying they intend to spend these checks, "it's not clear who will be doing all the sustained, voracious consumption markets now are pricing in."Also read: 'If you wish to sleep well for next 4 yrs...': Kim Jong Un's sister warns BidenMajor stock indices have hit new records two days in a row after Biden signed the stimulus measure into law last week, as investors are betting the rush of funds will spur a rapid recovery of the world's largest economy.- The bitcoin attraction -Mizuho Securities found that about 10 percent of the stimulus, or about $40 billion, will be invested in equities or in cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.A survey of 235 people making less than $150,000 found that 35 to 40 percent of respondents said they would invest part of their stimulus checks in stocks and cryptocurrency.And 61 percent of these investors intend to buy bitcoin, said Dan Dolev, one of the leaders of the Mizuho study."We were very surprised" that bitcoin "is a bigger investment vehicle than stocks," he said on CNBC.The cryptocurrency hit an all-time high on Saturday at $60,000.Another survey of 430 people by Deutsche Bank found that "survey respondents plan to put a large chunk (37 percent) of any forthcoming stimulus directly into equities," which it called "a sizable inflow" into the stock market.In two prior rounds of stimulus checks in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic brought the economy to a screeching halt, only about eight percent of the funds went into stocks, the bank said.The survey showed that young people, aged 25 to 34, account for the biggest share of people planning to play the markets with their stimulus money, followed by those aged 35 to 44.Goldman Sachs estimated that with the Biden plan, "households will represent the largest source of demand for US stocks in 2021."Goldman Sachs economist David Kostin said the bank estimates household demand for equities this year will jump to $350 billion from $100 billion, "which reflects faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-1-9-trillion-bill-could-end-up-in-stocks-bitcoin-analysts-101615868066924.html
16-03-2021||World||China's LNG buyers seize on reforms opening access to import infrastructure||China’s smaller liquefied natural gas buyers are seizing on reforms that’ve opened access to import infrastructure to boost competition, issuing a spate of tenders for the fuel over the past month.The second-tier gas firms, including Guangdong Energy Group Co. and Shenzhen Energy Group Co., are forecast to continue to seek more cargoes with spot LNG prices low, adding a new source of demand for global exporters, according to energy consultant FGE.“We can expect more emerging Chinese players to be in the market for spot procurement in the coming months as China continues to open up its LNG receiving facilities,” said Alicia Wee, a senior analyst at FGE in Singapore.Until recently, China imported most of its LNG through the three major state-owned energy giants, which owned pipelines, import terminals and distributed the fuel directly to smaller players. That’s changed with the formation of China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corp., known as PipeChina, which has consolidated the infrastructure into a single firm.PipeChina has awarded over ten companies third-party access to its terminals, meaning smaller players can issue tenders directly when the need arises, instead of going through a larger state company, according to traders who requested anonymity to discuss private details.Companies like Dongguan Daosen Natural Gas Co. which bought its first cargo via a direct tender this month, have been operating in domestic markets for years, according to Wood Mackenzie. Shenzhen Energy and Guangzhou Gas are among others to have bought cargoes in recent weeks.While the infrastructure reforms are help diversify the field of importers, the majority of terminal access is still being awarded to the nation’s top buyers, including China National Offshore Oil Corp. and PetroChina Co. Terminal capacity available to third parties offered by PipeChina is 5.7 million tons per year, a fraction of China’s total capacity of 87 million tons per year at the end of 2020, according to Wood Mackenzie.Also read: Asian LNG prices edge higher on Indian, Chinese demandA further drop in Asian LNG prices could prompt another wave of spot cargo purchases by smaller firms this summer, said Beijing-based Wood Mackenzie research director Miaoru Huang.The benchmark Japan-Korea marker fell to $5.56 per million British thermal units on March 2, the lowest level since last October, according to data from S&P Global Platts. Prices have since increased, in part on higher demand from the second-tier importers, and were trading on Monday around $6.70 for April delivery.Smaller buyers are also signing more long-term deals. The firms accounted for 83% of total Chinese contracts signed last year, from a 26% share in 2019, according to BloombergNEF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-lng-buyers-seize-on-reforms-opening-access-to-import-infrastructure-101615859124063.html
16-03-2021||World||US, on mission to rally Asia against China, distracted by North Korea||Top US envoys on a mission to rally Asian allies around a common approach toward China found themselves distracted by a more immediate security concern: North Korea.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, on their first overseas trip since taking office, meet their counterparts from Japan on Tuesday to start a trip that will also take them to South Korea later in the week. They are seeking cooperation on a united front toward regional security from the countries that host the bulk of US troops in the region and face threats posed by North Korea and China.The meetings are intended to reassure the US allies of Washington’s commitment after the Trump administration accused Japan of being a security freeloader and sought a five-fold increase from Seoul in the money it spends to host American military personnel.But just hours before the start of formal discussions, the Biden administration said North Korea has so far snubbed its requests for talks. “We’ve reached out to the North Korean government through several channels starting in mid-February, including in New York, and to date, we have not received any response from Pyongyang,” State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter said at a Monday briefing.North Korea’s official media, which during the US presidential campaign called Biden an “imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being,” has yet to mention him by name since his election victory.Leader Kim Jong Un turned up the heat on the new administration a few days before Biden was inaugurated by calling the US his “biggest main enemy” and saying he would put North Korea on a path to develop more advanced nuclear technologies and missiles.Also read: In debut overseas trip, Biden's secretary of state visits Japan, KoreaNorth Korea’s official media previously lauded Donald Trump for holding three summits with Kim, celebrating what it called a “special chemistry” between the two. But the talks resulted in no steps to wind down North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. During Trump’s tenure, North Korea built its stockpile of fissile material, developed more powerful atomic weapons and tested new missiles designed to deliver nuclear warheads to all of the US mainland.Before the formal talks began in Tokyo, Kim Yo Jong, the sister of the leader, launched a rhetorical attack on joint military drills involving the US and South Korea that started this month. She warned of possible retaliation, telling leaders in Seoul that they “may find themselves in extreme uneasiness,” according to comments published Tuesday by the state’s official Korean Central News Agency.In comments directed at the Biden administration, she said: “If it wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step,” according to KCNA, without mentioning the president by name.The trip comes after Biden on Friday held the first virtual summit with so-called Quad partners Australia, India and Japan, all of whom have their own tensions with China. A statement released after the meeting referred to an “open” Indo-Pacific region and shared security interests, leaving little doubt the talks were a show of unity against Beijing.“As countries in the region and beyond know, China in particular is all too willing to use coercion to get its way,” Blinken and Austin wrote in a joint opinion piece in the Washington Post just before their visit. “Here again, we see how working with our allies is critical.”Trump’s White House eschewed collaboration with other nations on trade and the environment, instead opting to confront China on its own with tariffs, sanctions and a beefed up military presence in the Pacific.Biden is set to maintain a hard line on Beijing -- as evidenced by the move to ban the export of 5G components to Huawei Technologies Co. -- but his administration is seeking to avoid the perception it is only interested in engaging Asian nations as part of efforts to confront China.Japan and South Korea both count China as their biggest trading partner and walk a fine line in maintaining a good relationship with both Beijing and Washington.Japan and South Korea host about 80,000 US military personnel between them, the bulk of American presence in the region. The troops are meant to be a front-line defense against North Korea and provide a counterweight to China.Beijing has intensified its campaign to dominate the resource-rich South China Sea and has been challenging Tokyo over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that both sides claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-on-mission-to-rally-asia-against-china-distracted-by-north-korea-101615859108035.html

The incident on Thursday at a Bank of America in Galveston was captured by the officer's body camera, The Galveston County Daily News reported.Police say they've obtained an arrest warrant on resisting arrest and criminal trespassing charges.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday ended statewide orders requiring people to wear face masks in public places, declaring that businesses should decide for themselves what Covid-19 precautions to take on their properties. Many businesses have kept their own mask rules in place.Watch: Arrest warrant issued after woman rejects mask at Texas bankPolice said a bank manager called police after Wright refused to wear a mask while inside, and then refused to leave the building when asked.The police department on Friday released the officer's body camera video footage. In the video, Wright can be seen standing in the middle of the bank's lobby, surrounded by other customers, all of whom were wearing masks.Wright told the officer she had come to the bank to make a withdrawal. The officer asked her to go outside or put on a mask. She refused.“What are you going to do, arrest me?” she asked.He replied: “Yes, for intruding on premises.” And then she said: “That's hilarious.”Wright then told the officer the law said she didn't have to wear a mask. As the officer took out handcuffs, she pulled away and began to walk toward the door. The officer stopped her and forced her to the ground. After she was handcuffed, she complained that her foot was injured.“Police brutality right here people,” she said to the other customers at the bank. Replies of “no” and “no, it's not” could be heard.Police said she suffered minor injuries during the struggle and was taken to a hospital for treatment.Wright told The Washington Post that she has never covered her face inside stores, even when the statewide mandate was in place. She said she was in an RV park across the bay from Galveston in Hitchcock, Texas.She told the newspaper she was “attacked” and compared mask requirements to the way that Nazi Germany forced Jewish people to identify themselves with a Star of David. She also said she believed in a “plandemic” in a reference to a documentary-style video in which an anti-vaccine activist promotes a string of questionable, false and potentially dangerous coronavirus theories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arrest-warrant-issued-after-woman-rejects-mask-at-texas-bank-101615874257533.html

It's like you're walking over a fragile suspension bridge," Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, a lifelong resident in the town of Grindavik, told Reuters.Grindavik lies in the southern part of the Reykjanes Peninsula, a volcanic and seismic hot spot, where more than 40,000 earthquakes have occurred since Feb. 24, exceeding the total number of earthquakes registered there last year.Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates, Iceland frequently experiences earthquakes as the plates slowly drift in opposite directions at a pace of around 2 centimetres each year.The source of the past weeks' earthquakes is a large body of molten rock, known as magma, moving roughly one kilometre (0.6 mile) beneath the peninsula, as it tries to push its way to the surface."We've never seen so much seismic activity," Sara Barsotti, volcanic hazards coordinator at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) told Reuters.Some of those quakes clocked in at magnitudes as high as 5.7."Everyone here is so tired," Gudmundsdottir, a 5th grade school teacher, said. "When I go to bed at night, all I think about is: Am I going to get any sleep tonight?".Many in Grindavik have visited relatives, spent time in summer houses, or even rented a hotel room in Reykjavik, the capital, just to get a break and a good night's sleep.Authorities in Iceland warned of an imminent volcanic eruption on the peninsula in early March, but said they did not expect it to disturb international air traffic or damage critical infrastructure nearby.Unlike the eruption in 2010 of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which halted approximately 900,000 flights and forced hundreds of Icelanders from their homes, the eruption on the peninsula is not expected to spew much ash or smoke into the atmosphere.Experts are expecting lava to erupt from fissures in the ground, possibly resulting in spectacular lava fountains, which could extend 20 to 100 metres in the air.Already last year authorities put an emergency plan in place for Grindavik. One option includes putting locals on boats in the North Atlantic, if an eruption shuts roads to the remote town."I trust the authorities to keep us informed and evacuate us," Gudmundsdottir said. "I'm not scared, just tired."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/everyone-here-is-so-tired-40-000-earthquakes-hit-part-of-iceland-in-20-days-101615874097564.html
16-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective, says Canadian PM Trudeau||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asserted that AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine is “both safe and effective”. His position on the vaccine’s safety comes even as several countries, including France, Germany and Italy, have suspended its use due to fears of blood clotting and similar side effects.The World Health Organization (WHO) has called upon governments around the world to continue vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs since, it insisted, it’s not yet proven that the vaccine indeed causes blood clots.Canada has so far imported 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name of Covishield, manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Asked about the alarm in Europe during a media interaction in Montreal on Monday, Trudeau said, “Health Canada and our experts have spent an awful lot of time making sure every vaccine approved in Canada is both safe and effective.”He also said that Canadian health authorities were monitoring developments related to a batch of AZ shots in Europe, but added that the “best vaccine for you to take is the very first one that is offered to you”.That viewpoint was echoed by Canada’s chief public health Officer, Theresa Tam. In a statement released by her office, she said Health Canada was aware of the reports of adverse events in Europe following immunisation, but “would like to reassure Canadians that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh its risks. At this time, there is no indication that the vaccine caused these events”.“None of the batches of the vaccine under investigation in Europe were shipped to Canada,” she pointed out, adding the government was working with regulators in Europe, including the European Medicines Agency, “to determine whether there is any need to take action in Canada”.The 500,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine available in Canada now had arrived in Toronto on March 3. A deal has been signed with Greater Toronto Area-based Verity Pharmaceuticals for a total shipment of two million doses.The delivery of the Covishield jabs has already commenced in some parts of Canada. While the national advisory committee on immunisation had originally advised against the use of the vaccine on those over 65 years of age, the news outlet CBC reported that those guidelines are likely to be updated on Tuesday and it will recommend the vaccine also be provided to those over that age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective-says-canadian-pm-trudeau-101615871452460.html
16-03-2021||World||China approves fourth Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use||China has approved a new Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, one that was developed by the head of its Center for Disease Control, adding to its arsenal.Gao Fu, the head of China's CDC, led the development of a protein subunit vaccine that was approved by regulators last week for emergency use, the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Microbiology said in a statement Monday.It is the fourth such vaccine to be given emergency use approval. China has approved four vaccines developed by three Chinese companies for general use.The vaccine was developed jointly by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The team finished phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in October of last year and is currently conducting the last phase of trials in Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Indonesia, according to the statement.The vaccine was approved for use in Uzbekistan on March 1.The protein subunit vaccine is similar to many of the other vaccines that have been approved globally in that it trains the body to recognize the spike protein that covers the surface of the coronavirus vaccine, although the difference lies in how it tells the body to recognize the protein. Scientists grow a harmless version of the protein in cells and then purify it, before it is assembled into a vaccine and injected.There is no publicly available information in peer-reviewed scientific journals about the clinical trial data showing efficacy or safety. A spokesperson for the company said that the data could not be shared at this time but that the company was actively providing the information to health authorities.China has been slow in vaccinating its population of 1.4 billion people, despite having four vaccines approved for general use. The latest numbers, according to government officials at a press briefing Monday in Beijing, is that it has administered 64.98 million doses of vaccines.China has targeted what it considers key populations for vaccination thus far, namely health care workers as well as those who work at the border or customs, and specific industries the government has selected. A second group, which has notably been absent thus far in comparison to many other countries, has been the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.The vaccines have previously been limited to adults 18-59 years old, as officials cited a lack of clinical trial data for those who are older, although the government appears to be signaling the limits are now being set aside. “We will promptly carry out mass vaccination of relevant populations,” Li Bin, a vice chair on the National Health Commission, said Monday.China's official Xinhua News Agency reported over the weekend that in certain neighborhoods in Beijing, local health centers started to offer the vaccines to those aged 60 and older.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-fourth-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use-101615870262608.html
16-03-2021||World||Signal users in China report difficulty in accessing messaging app||Signal, an encrypted messaging app that competes with the likes of Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp, appears to have been blocked in China, the latest move by Beijing to crack down on social media platforms.From Monday night, Signal users reported difficulties using the app in China without the help of a virtual private network, or VPN, which allows users to mask their location and access banned foreign communication services like Gmail and Twitter. Previously, no such software was needed to access Signal.It isn’t immediately clear if this is a permanent ban, as Chinese regulators have been known to sometimes ramp up controls as a trial run only to ratchet them down later. The Cyberspace Administration of China didn’t respond immediately to a faxed request for comment Tuesday morning.Signal has been a popular tool among political dissidents and journalists seeking a communication method that minimizes the risk of messages being intercepted by government censors and bad actors. In particular, the app has gained traction among China’s mainly Muslim Uyghur diaspora.Open discussion of sensitive topics is off limits in China, where heavy government censorship is the norm.

It follows the announcement by China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi of Beijing's intention to donate vaccines at a UN Security Council meeting on Feb. 17.The mission said “China attaches great importance to the safety and security of peacekeepers” and the donation “is a further step to make China's vaccines a global public good, and also a demonstration of China's firm and continuous support to the UN and multilateralism.”Last month, the UN thanked India for offering 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for UN peacekeepers.The UN currently has a dozen peacekeeping operations, half in Africa with a total of about 100,000 peacekeepers.There was no immediate word on what the UN plans to do with the two offers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-donates-300-000-vaccine-doses-to-un-peacekeepers-101615862197782.html

16-03-2021||World||In debut overseas trip, Biden's secretary of state visits Japan, Korea||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin were set to meet counterparts in Tokyo on Tuesday, highlighting a focus by the new Washington administration on alliances in Indo-Pacific in the face of assertive China.The visit, from March 15 to 18, to Tokyo and Seoul is the first overseas trip by top cabinet members of President Joe Biden's team and follows last week's Quad alliance summit of the leaders of the United States, Japan, Australia and India.Issues on the agenda range from freedom of navigation in the South and East China Seas and semiconductor supply-chain security to the North Korean nuclear issue and a military coup in Myanmar, experts say.North Korea is likely to be in sharp focus after the White House said Pyongyang had so far rebuffed efforts from the United States to engage in dialogue. North Korea warned the new US administration against "causing a stink" if it wants peace, North Korean state media reported on Tuesday.The trip sends an "important signal of resolve to work with allies" at a time when the region faces mounting pressure from China and continued threat from North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, Sung Kim, the Acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs told reporters during a briefing ahead of the visit.The Quad summit pledged to work to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, a major priority for Tokyo, and cooperate on maritime, cyber and economic security in the face of challenges from Beijing."The most important thing that's going to happen on this trip is that Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin are making Japan and Korea (and India for Secretary Austin) the first steps on their first trip to the region," said Brian Harding, a Southeast Asia expert at the US Institute of Peace."So, by touching down in Tokyo, in a lot of ways, it'll already be successful, and sends an incredibly powerful signal about the priorities of this administration."Analysts also expect Tokyo to seek US support for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and follow-up talks on other subjects that figured at the Quad summit, such as the commitment to boost Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Asia and climate change.The secretaries are expected to make a courtesy call on Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who is set to visit the White House as the first foreign leader to meet Biden in April.Blinken and Austin will meet Japan's foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi and defence minister Nobuo Kishi in what is known as the 2 2 talks.Blinken will also meet business leaders and Japanese journalists.Both officials will leave Tokyo for Seoul on Wednesday and hold talks with counterparts in the South Korean capital until Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-debut-overseas-trip-biden-s-secretary-of-state-visit-japan-korea-101615855888308.html

The FAA has begun about 20 enforcement cases and is reviewing more than 450 cases of reported unruly passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flyers-rebuffing-masks-face-extended-faa-zero-tolerance-stance-101615855581547.html
16-03-2021||World||'Duty to help each other': Kamala Harris makes solo debut, selling relief law, raising her profile||Kamala Harris embarked Monday on her first official trip as vice president to promote the just-signed $1.9 trillion stimulus law, a two-day swing that doubles as a chance to boost her own profile.She traveled to Nevada and later will visit Colorado, both important presidential election states where Democratic senators are defending seats in next year’s midterms. The trip is part of a cross-country blitz planned by President Joe Biden and top administration officials to sell the relief package and ensure Democrats get credit for it from voters.Harris said in a speech at the Culinary Academy in Las Vegas that she and Biden aim to tell voters that the relief bill is an example of what the government should do.“We have a duty to help each other out, especially in times of need,” she said. “It is our responsibility when people are suffering. And you do it understanding the dignity of each person and your fellow human being.”Since taking office in January, Harris has been under scrutiny as she carves out a role for herself as vice president -- an office with few specific responsibilities that a former occupant, John Nance Garner, once called “a spare tire on the automobile of government.” Gaining important duties will be crucial for Harris, 56, should she choose to run for president again in the future.With this week’s trip, Harris is developing a role as a key promoter for the stimulus, the first major legislation Biden signed into law. The White House views the plan as central to defeating the pandemic and engineering a strong economic recovery. Much of Harris’s focus has been on how the rescue package could help small businesses and women in the workforce.A White House official downplayed the notion that the trip is intended to build Harris’s profile. The vice president sees it as a chance to encourage Americans to get a Covid-19 vaccine, the official said, especially people of color who are more likely to be hesitant.The official asked not to be identified discussing Harris’s plans ahead of the trip.Before stopping at the Culinary Academy, Harris visited a mass vaccination site in Las Vegas. “You all are the heroes of this moment,” she said there. “You guys are saving lives.”The Culinary Workers Union, a major labor and political force in the state, is one of the groups that operates the academy.On Tuesday, Harris is scheduled to visit a vaccination clinic in Denver and meet with small business owners to discuss aid that will flow to them under the stimulus law, the official said.Travel LimitationsHarris is eager to travel the country, the official said. The Biden White House has thus far limited official trips because of the ongoing pandemic. One of the vice president’s goals is to hear directly from people about how their lives were affected, and explain how various provisions of the rescue plan may help.“Americans will see what we did here. What you did, Mr. President,” Harris said during a Rose Garden ceremony last week celebrating the bill. “And they will feel the impact of this bill for generations to come.”The trip is part of what the White House is calling the “Help is Here” tour to tout the stimulus plan, which polls show is supported by majorities of Americans, even though it passed the House and Senate with no votes from Republicans.“The tour will make clear that help is here and we are on the path toward crushing the virus and rebuilding our economy,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday at a briefing.Harris will also join Biden during a stop in Georgia on Friday. The president plans his own trip earlier in the week to Pennsylvania, a state that was key to his victory in November. Doug Emhoff, Harris’s husband, is accompanying her to Las Vegas and Denver and will also visit Albuquerque, New Mexico, in his first solo trip as second gentleman.Harris is expected to do more traveling in the coming weeks, the White House official said.Shaping Her RoleAfter more than 50 days in office, her role in the Biden administration hasn’t yet been fully shaped.Biden has included Harris in nearly all of his public appearances, and has said she’s a full partner in his decision making. She’s had solo calls with foreign presidents and prime ministers, including the leaders of France and Israel. But she’s not yet been given a specific policy portfolio, as some of her modern predecessors have had.In his eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president, Biden put his own stamp on the job. One of his first tasks was to oversee implementation of the 2009 Recovery Act that followed the Great Recession, and was passed a month into Obama’s term. He was dubbed “Sheriff Joe” for efforts to enforce against waste, fraud and abuse.Biden appeared to acknowledge both the perks and pitfalls that come with those type of vice presidential responsibilities. He recalled in the Rose Garden last week the “dubious distinction” of implementing the law, an apparent recognition that he would have been blamed for any major problems.But he also suggested being tapped for such a job is a vote of confidence for the second in command.“I know, from experience, when the president turned to me -- like I haven’t done to the vice president yet -- and said ‘take care of it, you take care of implementing the plan,’” he said. “But she can do it.”On Monday, Biden named Gene Sperling, a former White House economic adviser under Obama and President Bill Clinton, to oversee implementation of his stimulus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/duty-to-help-each-other-kamala-harris-makes-solo-debut-selling-relief-law-raising-her-profile-101615855178787.html
16-03-2021||World||Covid-19 is 'most discriminatory crisis' for women: UN Women||The head of UN Women called the Covid-19 pandemic “the most discriminatory crisis” that women and girls have ever experienced on Monday, pointing to women losing jobs far more often than men, a “shadow pandemic” of domestic violence, and 47 million more women being pushed into living on less than $1.90 a day this year.Emerging from the pandemic, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said the world also faces more orphans and child-headed homes, an increase in child marriage, 59 percent of women reporting having to spend more time on domestic work since the pandemic began, and a digital gender gap leaving many women unprepared for the future.She spoke at the opening of the annual meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women whose theme this year is on women's participation and decision-making in public life and combatting violence against women and girls.Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of the UN women’s agency, said the World Health Organization’s latest report shows that the highest rates of intimate partner violence in the past 12 months -- 16% -- was against young women aged 15 to 24.A report for the commission’s session also underlined that “violence against women in public life is a major deterrent to their political participation, and affects women of all ages and ranks, in every part of the world,” she said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said every month the toll from violence against women rises -- from sexual abuse to child marriage.“The damage is incalculable and will resound down the decades, into future generations,” he said.The UN chief said the fallout from the pandemic “has shown how deeply gender inequality remains embedded in the world’s political, social and economic systems.”Over the past year, Guterres said women leaders are among those who’ve kept Covid-19 transmission rates low and put their countries on tract for recovery while countries with less effective responses to the pandemic “have tended to be those where strongman approaches prevail and women’s rights are under assault.”But the secretary-general said “looking across the world, we see that women’s voices remain missing from the highest levels of leadership.”According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s latest report released last week, only 25 percent of lawmakers worldwide are women and only 22 countries have a female head of state or government with Europe topping the list.“At current rates parity among heads of government will not be achieved until 2150,” Guterres said. “That’s right, another 130 years of men making the same kinds of decisions they have made for the past 130 years and more.”While these new numbers are little changed, UN Women’s Mlambo-Ngcuka said there are gains “to celebrate and inspire us.”She pointed to the share of women in government in Lithuania increasing from 8 percent to 43 percent, Rwanda leading the world with the largest share of women ministers at 54.8 percent, and the percentage of women ministers in the United States rising from 17 percent in 2020 under former president Donald Trump to 46 percent in President Joe Biden’s Cabinet, “a historic high.”Despite these positive developments, Guterres said men are dominating decision-making during the pandemic.“A study of 87 countries found that 85 percent of COVID-19 task forces contained mostly men,” the U.N. chief said.Guterres stressed that women have the skills and expertise for top jobs, and in many countries they’re graduating from higher education at higher rates than men.“What we need is not more training for women, but to train those in power on how to build inclusive institutions,” he said. “We need to move beyond fixing women and instead fix our systems.”Mlambo-Ngcuka called for “big, bold steps” and urged global leaders to make space especially for young women to enter public life.“We see them on the streets across the world, leading movements even in the face of lethal threat,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-is-most-discriminatory-crisis-for-women-un-women-101615854090490.html
16-03-2021||World||Soaring migration levels puts pressure on Joe Biden||President Joe Biden faced mounting pressure Monday from Republicans over his handling of a surge in migrants -- including thousands of unaccompanied children -- arriving at the US-Mexican border.While successive administrations have dealt with seasonal spikes in migration, Biden's critics claim he has driven the latest uptick by taking a softer stance on the flashpoint issue than his predecessor Donald Trump.On January 20, his first day in office, Biden scrapped several of Trump's contentious immigration policies, including halting new construction of a border wall and proposing legislation to create a citizenship pathway for the nearly 11 million people living illegally in the US.Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy of California, who leads his party in the House of Representatives, described Biden's policies as having created "more than a crisis.""You can continue to deny it but the only way to solve it is to first admit what he has done, and if he will not reverse action, it takes Congressional action to do it," McCarthy told a press conference on the border in the Texas town of El Paso.Republican congressman Chuck Fleischmann said Biden's administration had "created an environment" that caused an increase in migration. Other Republican lawmakers said human traffickers were profiting from Biden's policies.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden had inherited "a dismantled and unworkable system" from Trump."Like any other problem, we're going to do everything we can to solve it," she said.'No jobs, no money' At a bus terminal in the border town of Brownsville late Sunday, a Guatemalan woman told AFP she had crossed the border illegally after her husband, who is already in the US, told her things may be simpler under Biden."My husband told me to come at this time," said Rubia Tabora, a 25-year-old mother of one."At home there are no jobs, no money."In February, the US Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) arrested about 100,000 people at the southern border -- including nearly 9,500 unaccompanied children -- a 28 percent jump over January.In line with a pandemic-rooted policy adopted by Trump, who cracked down on immigration both legal and illegal as part of his "America First" doctrine, the Biden administration is deporting most of the undocumented people who arrive at the southern border.But unlike Trump, Biden has opted against expelling minors who show up unaccompanied and are filling shelters set up to hold them, with limited capacity because of the coronavirus crisis.Still, Brownsville mayor Trey Mendez said authorities in his community at the southern tip of Texas were not overwhelmed."I don't feel that it's a crisis for the city of Brownsville," he told reporters.He said about 150 migrants daily are processed in the city, most of whom leave within 24 hours.'Record' levelsThe Biden administration over the weekend ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support an effort to temporarily house thousands of children who crossed the US-Mexico border alone.While detained migrant adults and families continue to be sent back to Mexico, unaccompanied children are being processed and then get help resettling with US relatives.Dallas County commissioner J.J. Koch said that FEMA had asked the city to lease them a hall at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center as a "decompression center" to house up to 3,000 teenage boys aged between 15 and 17 for as long as 90 days, "while plans for more permanent sheltering or connection to sponsor families can be arranged."He said FEMA "desires to begin operations as early as this week."Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Saturday that numbers of unaccompanied child migrants had reached "record" levels, but dated the surge back to April 2020 and blamed ongoing violence, natural disasters, food insecurity and poverty in parts of Central America.The US Department of Health and Human Services is currently holding about 8,800 migrant children.A local activist told AFP about 200 migrants in family groups traveled on from the Brownsville bus terminal on Saturday, after receiving Covid-19 tests.Such scenes are being repeated at towns along the vast border that spans four US states.Most in Brownsville had turned themselves in after crossing the frontier and were given paperwork requiring them to report to immigration authorities later on.Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for a local Border Patrol union in Texas's Rio Grande Valley, told CNN that immigration numbers often surge around the time of an election or new presidency."A part of it is every election cycle, regardless of the political party that takes office. It gets interpreted in the southern countries a little different," he said.The US Congress is this week considering two immigration bills.One of them would grant several categories of migrants, including people brought to the country as children -- so-called "Dreamers" -- an immediate path to permanent residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soaring-migration-levels-puts-pressure-on-joe-biden-101615849814753.html
16-03-2021||World||Genocide by Pak Army in former east Pakistan needs to be globally recognised||It is matter of shame that the genocide committed by Pakistan in Bangladesh 50 years ago, which killed more than the holocaust and was aimed at changing ethnicity of a group, is yet to be globally recognised, according to a Paris-based think tank.In a report of the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs on East Pakistan Genocide: Still Yearns for Global Acknowledgement, Mario de Gasperi wrote, " The Bangladesh genocide is considered to be the largest and longest since it covers the entire length of the nine-month-long liberation war of Bangladesh. Ironically the Bangladesh genocide remains unrecognised while other genocides in Europe and Africa have been acknowledged."According to the report, three million people were killed, half-a-million girls and women were raped, and entire villages were laid to waste. Men became primary targets (almost 80 per cent male, as reported by the Bangladesh Genocide Archives). The abduction and subsequent rape of women by soldiers took place in camps for months. Many more were subject to "hit and run" rapes. Hit and run rape explains the brutality of forcing male family member-before their own death-view the rape of their female family member by soldiers.Bangladesh is celebrating 50 glorious years of its independence this year. However, the month of March is significant in the valiant struggle in Bangladesh that then East Pakistan people waged against the Pakistani Army.March 25 holds special significance being commemorated as the Genocide Day as on this day 50 years back Pakistan Army launched 'Operation Searchlight' resulting in the worst genocide in human history over a period of nine months till the Army was defeated, Gasperi wrote.Gasperi further said, "The Liberation War in erstwhile East Pakistan marked by the horrific genocide committed by the Pakistani Army and razakars, or collaborators, is not acknowledged widely even to this date.""In national elections held in December 1970 in undivided Pakistan, the Awami League won an overwhelming victory across Bengali territory. On February 22, 1971 the generals in West Pakistan took a decision to crush the Awami League and its supporters. It was recognized from the first that a campaign of genocide would be necessary to eradicate the threat," wrote Gasperi.Bangladesh, erstwhile East Pakistan witnessed almost a full collapse of humanity during the nine months of March to December in 1971. Though atrocities and brutality started well before March 1971, continuation of this barbarism reached its peak on the night of March 25, 1971.Gasperi said, "The carnage by Pakistan Army continued till their shameful surrender in mid-December, 1971. Atrocities and butchery of Pak Army are by now well established and documented not only by Bangladeshis but also international researchers, historians, scholars and news media.""General Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan and his top generals planned to murder Bengali intellectual, cultural, and political elite. They also planned to indiscriminately murder hundreds of thousands of Hindus and drive the rest into India. And they planned to destroy East Pakistan's economic base to ensure that it would be subordinate to West Pakistan for at least a generation to come," Gasperi wrote in the report.Gasperi further said in the report that there is no doubt that the mass killing in Bangladesh was among the most carefully and centrally planned of modern genocides. The genocide and gendercide atrocities were also perpetrated by lower-ranking officers and ordinary soldiers. These "willing executioners" were fuelled by abiding anti-Bengali racism, especially against the Hindu minority. "Bengalis were often compared with monkeys and chickens. Said Pakistan General Niazi, 'It was a low lying land of low lying people.'The goal of the operation was to crush the Bengali nationalist movement through fear; however, the opposite occurred.Highlighting the three phases of genocide by the Pakistan Army, Gasperi wrote, that Operation Searchlight was the first phase, which took place from late March to early May. It began as a massive murder campaign during the night of March 25, 1971."Search and destroy was the second where Pakistani forces methodically slaughtered villages from May to October. This is the longest phase because this is when Bengali forces mobilised and began to fight back. This was also the phase in which the Pakistan army targeted women to rape, abduct, and enslave.""Scorched Earth" was the third phase beginning in early December, and targeted and killed 1,000 intellectuals and professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers in Dhaka. The Pakistani Army surrendered to Indian forces days later, ending the genocide on December 16, 1971," Gasperi wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/genocide-by-pak-army-in-former-east-pakistan-needs-to-be-globally-recognised-101615831615616.html
16-03-2021||World||God ‘cannot bless sin’, so we cannot bless same-sex unions, says Vatican||The Vatican decreed Monday that the Catholic Church cannot bless same-sex unions since God “cannot bless sin.”The Vatican’s orthodoxy office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a formal response Monday to a question about whether Catholic clergy can bless gay unions.The answer, contained in a two-page explanation published in seven languages and approved by Pope Francis, was “negative.”The decree distinguished between the church’s welcoming and blessing of gay people, which it upheld, but not their unions.The Vatican holds that gays much be treated with dignity and respect, but that gay sex is “intrinsically disordered.” Catholic teaching holds that marriage between a man and woman is part of God’s plan and is intended for the sake of creating new life.Since gay unions are not intended to be part of that plan, they cannot be blessed by the church, the document said.“The presence in such relationships of positive elements, which are in themselves to be valued and appreciated, cannot justify these relationships and render them legitimate objects of an ecclesial blessing, since the positive elements exist within the context of a union not ordered to the Creator’s plan,” the response said.God “does not and cannot bless sin: He blesses sinful man, so that he may recognize that he is part of his plan of love and allow himself to be changed by him,” it said.Francis has endorsed providing gay couples with legal protections in same-sex unions, but that is in reference to the civil sphere, not within the church. His comments were made during an interview with a Mexican television station, Televisa, in 2019, but were cut by the Vatican until they appeared in a documentary last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vatican-excludes-same-sex-union-blessing-as-god-can-t-bless-sin-101615809381792.html
16-03-2021||World||Explained: Why have some countries suspended use of AstraZeneca vaccine?||Amid rising concern over blood clot events, British-Swedish pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca issued a statement on Monday saying a review of 17 million people who were administered its Covid-19 vaccine suggested that it was entirely safe for use. The statement came after a number of countries suspended the use of the jab after reports of a number of people developing blood clots after receiving the vaccine.“A careful review of all available safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union (EU) and UK with Covid-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia, in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country,” the company said in a statement.What’s the cause of concern with regards to AstraZeneca vaccine?Across the European Union and Britain, there have been at least 15 events of deep vein thrombosis or blood clot in the veins and 22 events of pulmonary embolism or when blood clot enters the lungs reported among those who were administered the AstraZeneca vaccine, officials said.Which countries have suspended the vaccine’s use?The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Ireland and Iceland temporarily suspended the use of the vaccine after reports of cases of blood clots. Italy and Romania have banned the use of a similar batch of the vaccine. Austria has also stopped the usage of certain batches of the vaccine and Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Luxembourg have suspended the same batch which was suspended by Austria.Which countries are still using the vaccine?France and Germany have said that they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence that the vaccine had caused problems. “Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,” the agency said.Could the suspension affect the vaccination programme in these countries?The decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca vaccine comes as a setback to the European vaccination programme.
