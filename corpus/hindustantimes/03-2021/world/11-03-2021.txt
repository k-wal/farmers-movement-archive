"We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun."Muslim-majority Pakistan had banned the app in October, but restored it within 10 days after the company vowed to block all accounts involved in spreading "obscenity and immorality."The telecom regulator said the social media company had agreed to moderate accounts in accordance with local laws.TikTok has been one of the most-downloaded apps in the South Asian nation behind WhatsApp and Facebook.TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has become hugely popular in a short period of time, by encouraging young users to post brief videos.But the app has been mired in controversy in a number of countries, with authorities raising privacy concerns and security fears due to its links with China.TikTok has denied that its ties to China pose a security concern in other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-blocks-tiktok-over-indecency-complaint-101615483486915.html
11-03-2021||World||Trouble for NY Governor Andrew Cuomo as Democrats demand resignation||A group of 59 Democratic state legislators demanded New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's resignation Thursday in the wake of an allegation that he groped an aide at the Executive Mansion last year.The letter released by the group comes as Cuomo's grip on power in the state appeared increasingly tenuous. The top Democrat in the state Assembly, Speaker Carl Heastie, said he will meet with members in conference today on “potential paths forward” in light of mounting allegations.In New York, the Assembly is the legislative house that could move to impeach Cuomo, who has faced multiple allegations that he made the workplace an uncomfortable place for young women with sexually suggestive remarks and behavior, including unwanted touching and a kiss.The Times Union of Albany reported Wednesday that an unidentified aide had claimed Cuomo reached under her shirt and fondled her after summoning her to his official residence.Nineteen senators and 40 Assembly members said in a letter Thursday that it was time for Cuomo to go.“In light of the Governor’s admission of inappropriate behavior and the findings of altered data on nursing home COVID-19 deaths he has lost the confidence of the public and the state legislature, rendering him ineffective in this time of most urgent need,” the letter said. “It is time for Governor Cuomo to resign.”Cuomo has repeatedly said he won’t resign and urged the public to await the outcome of an investigation of his conduct by state Attorney General Letitia James. Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.Cuomo has denied inappropriately touching anyone but has said he is sorry if he made anyone uncomfortable and didn’t intend to do so.In the newest allegation against Cuomo, the Times Union of Albany reported that the governor had summoned the aide to his Albany mansion, saying he needed help with his cellphone. After she arrived, Cuomo closed the door, reached under her shirt and fondled her, the newspaper reported.The newspaper’s reporting was based on an unidentified source with knowledge of the woman’s accusation, who said she first told the story to someone on Cuomo's staff in recent days. The newspaper hadn't spoken to the woman and didn't identify her.“I have never done anything like this,” Cuomo said through a spokesperson Wednesday evening.“The details of this report are gut-wrenching,” Cuomo said, adding that he would not speak to the specifics of this or any other allegation, given an ongoing investigation overseen by the state attorney general.Several other women who worked for the governor in Albany or during his time in former President Bill Clinton’s Cabinet, and one who met him briefly at a wedding, have also complained of inappropriate conduct.The state Assembly has 150 members. It could convene an impeachment trial against Cuomo with a simple majority vote. Until the new allegations surfaced, most of its members appeared to be leaning against trying to convene an impeachment or demanding Cuomo's resignation until the attorney general's investigation was complete.The state Senate, which would join with members of the state's top appeals court to hold an impeachment trial, has 63 members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trouble-for-ny-governor-andrew-cuomo-as-democrats-demand-resignation-101615482930461.html

China, and the rise of China, the dramatic increase of defence spending and increasingly assertive, even aggressive behaviour, both in the South China Sea and East China Sea...[It is a] cause of great concern to us," he added.Yamagami said Tokyo supported Scott Morrison-led government's decision to call out China's unofficial campaign of economic coercion after it slapped restrictions on wine, barley, beef, coal and other products.He also drew parallels with China's decision in 2010 to cut off rare earth supplies to Japan because of a dispute over the Senkakus and Beijing's restrictions on Australian exports, reported Financial Review.The ambassador's remarks came as business and political leaders warned they did not expect a thaw in Australia-China tensions in the near term.On Sunday, Beijing had warned Japan that it would be better if the two countries were friends instead of enemies.US President Joe Biden will be meeting virtually with his counterparts in the Quad -- Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia.The leaders will discuss ongoing efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and explore opportunities for collaboration in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region, the statement read from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).China has criticised the framework as an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization seeking to undermine its legitimate rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-quad-meeting-japan-expresses-support-to-australia-in-dealing-with-china-s-increasing-aggression-101615480909812.html

That would require them to deliver another 60 million doses over the next three weeks."Those have already been manufactured" and are currently being tested for quality, he said."Unless a batch (of vaccine) fails, we will be able to provide them. Our track record is that our batches don't fail," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-to-exceed-2021-covid-vaccine-production-target-by-as-much-as-20-ceo-101615482317513.html

But over the past week, Brazil has averaged more than 1,600 deaths per day, ahead of some 1,400 in the United States, where the outbreak has ebbed.As President Jair Bolsonaro rails against lockdowns and urges Brazilians out of their homes, governors and mayors have struggled to enforce restrictions, often pleading in vain with a population inured to the rising tide of the epidemic.Brazil's two most populous cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday moved to tighten measures as their hospitals struggled with a second wave of the virus, spurred by a more contagious variant that emerged in the Amazon region.While Europe and the United States ramp up vaccinations and bring down their caseloads, Brazil's federal government is off to a slow start, with only 2% of the 210 million Brazilians fully inoculated so far.In the nation's capital Brasilia, which is under a nighttime curfew, public hospital ICU wards are 97% full and private ones are at 99%, forcing the city to again set up field hospitals as it had during a peak in cases last year.On Thursday, Sao Paulo Governor João Doria announced a "new stage" of restrictions to enforce social distancing, arguing it is now the only weapon against the spread of the virus.They include a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m., the suspension of religious services and sports events, including soccer matches, and people not being allowed to use beaches and parks."This is a tough, unpopular decision. No governor wants to stop the economic activities in their state," Doria said in a video.The state of Sao Paulo, home to some 44 million people, is currently allowing only essential stores such as supermarkets and pharmacies to receive shoppers.The Sao Paulo health secretary said hospitals in more than half of the state's municipalities are full.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-hospitals-pushed-to-limit-as-covid-19-death-toll-soars-101615481916225.html
11-03-2021||World||EU 'freedom zone' for LGBT as European Parliament adopts resolution||The European Parliament has overwhelming adopted a resolution declaring the entire 27-member European Union a “freedom zone” for LGBT people, an effort to push back on rising homophobia in Poland and elsewhere.The parliament announced Thursday that there were 492 ballots in favor of the resolution and 141 against in a vote that came after a debate in a session of parliament in Brussels on Wednesday.The resolution came largely in reaction to developments over the past two years in Poland, where many local communities have adopted largely symbolic resolutions declaring themselves free of what conservative authorities have been calling “LGBT ideology.”These towns say they are seeking to protect traditional families based on unions of men and women, but LGBT rights activists say the designations are discriminatory and make gays and lesbians feel unwelcome. The areas have come to be colloquially known as “LGBT-free zones.”The resolution is the work of a cross-party group in the European Parliament, the LGBTI Intergroup.The Polish government has denounced the resolution. It argues that Poland, as a sovereign nation and a society more conservative than many Western European countries, has the right to defend its traditional family values based on a long attachment to Roman Catholicism. It accuses the EU lawmakers of overstepping their jurisdiction.The government also has argued that the rates of hate crimes are lower in Poland than in many countries in Western Europe.However, LGBT rights activists say this is impossible to measure. Kuba Gawon, who has been documenting local anti-LGBT resolutions with the group Atlas of Hate, said that there is no mention in the Polish penal code specifically about homophobic crimes, so police do not keep statistics of such crimes.“We don’t know the full number of such cases,” he said.The European Parliament's resolution said the fundamental rights of LGBT people have also been “severely hindered” recently in Hungary, due to a de facto ban on legal gender recognition for transgender and intersex people. It also notes that only two member states — Malta and Germany — have banned “conversion therapy,” a controversial and potentially harmful attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-freedom-zone-for-lgbt-as-european-parliament-adopts-resolution-101615482072779.html

11-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Why grandparents can’t see their grandchildren ‘sooner’? UK PM answers||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday revealed the reason behind the restrictions on grandparents seeing their grandchildren even after a “successful rollout” of vaccine programme to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Public Health England (PHE) had earlier advised people who are aged 70 or over, or clinically vulnerable, and are not symptomatic, to avoid contact with other family members as much as possible.“If you cannot arrange for vulnerable people to move out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible,” the guidance said.School, colleges, childcare, and children’s supervised activities resumed from March 8 as a part of Johnson’s four-step roadmap to lift the lockdown but outdoor gatherings of six people or two households were extended to March 29. In a video posted on the Twitter account of the prime minister’s office, Johnson said that though the vast majority of people over 70s and 80s have been vaccinated, the vaccines are not 100 per cent effective.“It's very effective, it's not 100% effective, and so what we don't want to see is a great surge of the disease caused by premature mingling of households,” said Johnson. “That's why we are saying that you have got to just be a bit cautious and we are hanging on until 29th March when you can meet your grandparents or grandparents can meet the rest of their family,” he added.With the successful rollout of the vaccine programme, why can’t grandparents see their grandchildren sooner?  @BorisJohnson answers ⬇️Ask your question at: https://t.co/cxEV8mMpwS pic.twitter.com/EAt3fv5px4While the ‘stay at home’ rule will end on March 29, many restrictions will remain in place, including travelling abroad. According to the government’s roadmap out of lockdown, holidays abroad will not be allowed, given the risk of imported variants. The UK health agency on Thursday announced that a new variant, B.1.324.1, identified in the UK in two people, who had recently been in Antigua, has been designated as a variant under investigation (VUI).“The variant contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with Variants of Concern (VOC), however it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a VOC,” PHE said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-why-grandparents-can-t-see-their-grandchildren-sooner-uk-pm-answers-101615481034179.html

His nomination was deadlocked at the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month in a tie vote. Senate rules allow leaders to bring stalled nominees directly to the floor for a confirmation vote, where Becerra would likely need every Democratic vote to be confirmed to the job.If he gets the job, Becerra would oversee an expansion of the Affordable Care Act that was included in Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 package, along with other other efforts to control the coronavirus.Manchin previously derailed the nomination of Biden's pick as budget director, Neera Tanden, and exerted his influence on a recently passed coronavirus relief package, driving a compromise on the size of expanded unemployment benefits central to the package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-senator-manchin-to-vote-for-becerra-to-be-health-secretary-statement-101615480937220.html
11-03-2021||World||Vaccine Initiative, cooperation on key supply chains on 1st Quad Summit agenda||The first Quad leaders’ summit on Friday will create a framework to allow the four-nation grouping to take the lead in post-Covid-19 recovery efforts, especially access to vaccines, and the creation of resilient supply chains for materials such as rare earth metals.The maiden summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, convened by US President Joe Biden less than two months after he assumed office, reflects the urgency attached by the US to coalesce the loose group to bolster cooperation on key challenges across the region and to counter a belligerent China.Among the key initiatives expected to be on the agenda when Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga gather virtually at 7 pm on Friday is a “Vaccine Initiative” and a procurement and supply chain for rare earth metals.India perceives the summit as key to building on crucial partnerships to address challenges in the Indo-Pacific and securing the maritime domain, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The summit is also an opportunity for evolution as the Quad didn’t traditionally have defined areas of cooperation and only discussed principles and shared strategic approaches.The Vaccine Initiative is being seen as the “most significant deliverable” from the summit as greater access to doses, especially for small and developing nations across the Indo-Pacific, will foster a quick global economic recovery, the people said.“Vaccines will be developed in the US, manufactured in India, financed by Japan and the US, and supported by Australia. The Vaccine Initiative will allow new manufacturing capacity to be added in India for exports to the Indo-Pacific. It will not impinge on India’s existing manufacturing capacities,” said one of the people cited above.The Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses produced, while successful vaccines developed in the US include those from Pfizer and BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.This pooling of capacities by Quad members will help boost global vaccine delivery, meet the demand-supply gap, especially within the Indo-Pacific, and add momentum to efforts to contain the pandemic.India’s role in the Vaccine Initiative will reinforce its credentials as a trusted and reliable manufacturer and supplier of medicines and expand the “Vaccine Maitri” initiative that has supplied 58.3 million doses to 69 countries so far. “It will strengthen India’s standing as the pharmacy of the world and a critical node in global health supply chains,” the person cited above said.Hindustan Times had reported on Thursday on options being considered by the Quad members to ramp up vaccine production and delivery, which will also help in the vaccine race with China.The people said the Quad’s model for collective humanitarian action through supply of Covid-19 vaccines can also serve as a template for peace, cooperation and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, which the grouping defines as its main objective.The four countries are also expected to build a rare earth metals procurement chain to counter China’s dominance in supplying these critical elements to makers of everything from smartphones to high-performance motors and batteries for electric vehicles, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported.China produced almost 60% of the world's rare earths in 2020 and the Quad members intend to counter China’s grip on supplies by funding new production technologies and development projects, and leading the way in drafting international rules, the report said.More than 90% of India’s imports of rare earths, worth $3.4 million in 2016, come from China. Over the past few years, India and Australia have been exploring the possibility of cooperating on rare earths such as lithium (used in batteries), neodymium (crucial for electric vehicles) and dysprosium (used in lasers and data storage applications), of which Australia has the world’s sixth largest reserves.The rare earths initiative will dovetail with the Quad’s stated aim of creating more robust and resilient supply chains that are not vulnerable to China’s influence. China has not shied away from using its near-monopoly on rare earths as a diplomatic bargaining chip, halting supplies to Japan over the dispute related to the Senkaku Islands in 2010. Such steps have led to massive spikes in the prices of these metals.The Quad members plan to develop refining technologies and to provide syndicated loans to rare earth mining and refining businesses. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is working to establish rules to stop China's export controls on rare earths. Though India is not a member of IEA, it entered into a strategic partnership with the US, Australia and the agency in January, at the behest of Japan, to strengthen collaboration in a range of vital areas, Nikkei reported.The genesis of the Quad was a “core group” formed by the four countries in 2004 for a joint response to the Indian Ocean tsunami. After the US and Australia sidelined the grouping because of sensitivities linked to their relations with China, the grouping faded away from the centre stage around 2007.As the Indo-Pacific became a key strategic region, the Quad was revived, largely because of Japan’s efforts, in 2017 as a dialogue at the level of senior officials. India was represented by a joint secretary from the foreign ministry. In September 2019, the grouping was elevated to the level of foreign ministers as India became more comfortable with it and there was greater convergence among members on concerns related to China.The third Quad ministerial meeting on February 18 took place within a month of the Biden administration assuming office and four months after the second meeting, while the Quad Summit will be President Biden’s second plurilateral engagement after a meeting of G7 leaders.There is considerable speculation on whether Friday’s summit will produce a joint statement – something that has never happened so far in a Quad interaction.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the summit would largely focus on five objectives. “China will be the unstated part of the agenda, and the other key elements will be the Covid-19 crisis, maritime security, techno-economic cooperation and climate change,” he said.“The Quad per se must increase its constituents and it must take action so that others believe it is a powerful but benign grouping in the Indo-Pacific. Though the current initiative is US-led, we must gauge the comfort level of the other three members, especially India – whether there is elbow room for it to make contributions and have a sense of ownership,” Bhatia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-initiative-cooperation-on-key-supply-chains-on-1st-quad-summit-agenda-101615478639995.html

It is a collage of 5,000 individual images, which were made one-per-day over more than thirteen years.The sale of the work for $69,346,250 put Beeple in the top three most valuable living artists, Christie's said in a Tweet.The work is in the form of a new type of digital asset - a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) - meaning it is authenticated by blockchain, which certifies its originality and ownership.The market for NFTs has soared in recent months as enthusiasts and investors use spare savings to buy up items that exist online. Last month, a 10-second video clip featuring an image of a fallen Donald Trump, also by Beeple, sold for $6.6 million on an NFT marketplace called Nifty Gateway."Without the NFTs, there just legitimately was no way to collect digital art," said Beeple, who specialises in irreverent digital art that explores themes such as technology, wealth and American politics.Asked what he thought of the multi-million dollar bids on his work, the 39-year-old graphic designer, who has created concert visuals for the likes of Justin Bieber, One Direction and Katy Perry, said he was lost for words."I don't know... maybe you can put an emoji into the story" he said. "It's so crazy."For NFTs, the artist's royalties are locked in to the contract: Beeple receives 10% each time the NFT changes hands after the initial sale."I do really think that this is going to be seen as the next chapter of art history" Beeple said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/digitalonly-artwork-fetches-nearly-70-million-at-christies-101615478275726.html
11-03-2021||World||Covid variant "taking over" UK, likely to dominate other countries too: Expert||A coronavirus variant first found a few months ago in Britain is now "taking over" and causing 98% of all cases in the UK, the scientist leading the country's variant-tracking research said on Thursday.Sharon Peacock said the UK variant, known as B.1.1.7, also appears to be gaining a firm grip in many of the 100 or so other countries it has spread to in the past few months."It's around 50% more transmissible - hence its success in really taking over the country," said Peacock, director of the Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium of scientists monitoring mutations in the coronavirus."We now know that it has spread across the UK and causes nearly all of the cases of Covid-19 - about 98%," she told an online briefing for Britain's Royal Society of Medicine."It appears to be the case that the other variants are not getting a foothold in this country."The B.1.1.7 variant, first detected in September 2020, has 23 mutations in its genetic code - a relatively high number of changes - and is thought by experts to be 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant variants.Peacock also noted data released on Wednesday from a UK study which found that B.1.1.7 has "significantly higher" mortality, with death rates among those infected with it between 30% and 100% greater than among those infected with previous variants."There is a small increase in the likelihood of death from the variant," she said.The World Health Organization says B.1.1.7 is one of several "variants of concern", along with others that have emerged in South Africa and Brazil. The variants are mutant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, which has already killed more than 2.7 million people in the pandemic.B.1.1.7 has spread to about 100 countries, according to WHO data, and some of those, including France, Denmark and the United States, have reported swift rises in the proportion of their Covid-19 cases being caused it.Peacock said evidence from the UK suggests B.1.1.7. is likely to become dominant elsewhere too."Because of its transmissibility, once it's introduced, it does have that advantage over other circulating variants - so it is the case that B.1.1.7 appears to be travelling around the world and really expanding where it lands."Public Health England (PHE) also said on Thursday that a new coronavirus variant had been identified in the UK in two people who had recently been in Antigua.

11-03-2021||World||England investigating new coronavirus variant linked to Antigua travel||Public Health England (PHE) on Thursday said a new coronavirus variant had been identified in the UK in two people who had recently been in Antigua, adding that it shared some traits of others but would not be categorised as concerning for now.The health authority said the variant, know as VUI-202103/01 (lineage B.1.324.1) was designated a variant under investigation on March 4 after two cases were found in the South East of England in individuals who had recently travelled to Antigua."The variant contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with Variants of Concern (VOC), however it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a VOC," PHE said in a statement.The variants are mutant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, which has already killed more than 2.7 million people in the pandemic.While scientists say that mutations in viruses are inevitable, Covid-19 variants of concern such as those first identified in south east England, South Africa and Brazil, have worrisome changes that give the virus advantages, such as increased transmissibility or reducing the effectiveness of vaccines.The E484K mutation of the spike protein has been seen in South African and Brazilian variants, and has occurred spontaneously in the UK variant, and is associated with lower vaccine efficacy. The N501Y mutation is linked to great transmissibility.PHE also said that four more cases of the P.1 variant, which was first found in northern Brazil and has the E484K and N501Y mutations, had been identified in England.That brings the total number identified in Britain to ten, PHE said, adding that they all had links to direct travel from Brazil or to a previously confirmed case that had travelled to Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-investigating-new-coronavirus-variant-linked-to-antigua-travel-101615475867071.html
11-03-2021||World||Judge allows third-degree murder charge for ex-cop in George Floyd's death||A Minnesota judge granted a request by prosecutors on Thursday to reinstate a charge of third-degree murder against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who is on trial already facing second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.Judge Peter Cahill's decision comes after the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that he must reconsider a third-degree murder charge against 44-year-old Chauvin, whose trial got underway with jury selection this week in Minneapolis."I have to follow the rule that the court of appeals has put in place," Cahill said in explaining his decision.Chauvin already faces a more serious charge of second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, as well as a charge of second-degree manslaughter.The reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge was a victory for state prosecutors, who had sought the additional lesser murder charge in part to afford them an extra path to a conviction should the jury find the evidence does not support the most serious charge. The third-degree murder charge carries a sentence of up to 25 years in prison.Chauvin's charges stem from his actions during the arrest of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes on a sidewalk outside a grocery store as the Black man pleaded for his life and then stopped moving. Police were arresting him on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the store.Floyd's death outraged people around the world and helped fuel one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States, with daily demonstrations against racism and police brutality.Lawyers for Chauvin had successfully argued the third-degree murder charge should be dropped on the basis that the statute requires the “death-causing act” not be directed at a single individual. It is often used in instances where someone uses deadly force against a crowd of people, for example.But the Minnesota Court of Appeals recently ruled in a separate case that third-degree murder could be applied even if the “death-causing act” is directed at a specific person, and ruled on Friday that this precedent binds the district court.Jury selection for Chauvin's trial was set to resume Thursday morning, with five jurors already seated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-allows-third-degree-murder-charge-for-ex-cop-in-george-floyd-s-death-101615475875022.html

The seller has labelled the statues as "Trump, who knows Buddhism better than anyone," in an apparent dig at the twice-impeached former president who frequently targeted China over coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The small version of the Trump Buddha statue, which measures 1.6 metres in height, is priced at 999 Chinese yuan (around ₹ 11,180) on Taobao, the e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba. A larger version of the statue, 4.6 metres tall, is available for 3,999 yuan (around ₹ 44, 770). According to a report by The Guardian, Trump is a popular source of merchandise on Taobao where customers can purchase Trump facemasks, models, little statues, hats, and socks.China's state-owned Global Times first reported on the statue and spoke to the furniture-maker, based in Xiamen, Fujian province, who is promoting the statue with the slogan “Make your company great again!”. The seller told the Global Times that they made 100 statues and dozens of them are already sold, noting that "most people just bought it for fun.""I bought it for fun and put it on my desk at home as a decoration. Trump can also be regarded as a representative of an era, and extreme egoism. Now the era has passed but I want the statue to remind me: Don't be too Trump," an unnamed buyer was quoted by Global Times as saying.A craft website Etsy is selling novelty gifts of 3-D printed “Trump laughing Buddha” where the seller says it is “not intended to stir up anything political”. “In fact, this Laughing Buddha mashup is simply a reminder that, no matter where we fall in the political spectrum, we could all use a little more laughter and joy in our lives!” the description reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bought-it-for-fun-trump-buddha-statue-popular-on-chinese-e-commerce-platform-101615473426721.html
11-03-2021||World||Britons told to keep getting vaccinated after some countries suspend AstraZeneca shots||The UK's medicine regulator said on Thursday that Britons should keep on getting their Covid-19 vaccines, including the shot developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, after Denmark and some other countries restricted their use of it.Denmark is suspending for two weeks the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine after reports of the formation of blood clots in some who have been vaccinated, including one death in Denmark, Danish authorities said.Norway joined Denmark in halting its roll-out of the shot after reports of blood clots, while Italy banned a batch of the vaccine after notifications of some serious adverse effects.Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was not confirmed that the reported blood clot in Denmark was caused by the vaccine, adding that the Danish suspension was precautionary."Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon," said Phil Bryan, MHRA Vaccines Safety Lead, adding that more than 11 million doses of the vaccine had been administered across the UK and that reports of blood clots were not greater than would have occurred naturally."We are keeping this issue under close review but available evidence does not confirm that the vaccine is the cause. People should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so."Austria earlier in the week halted a batch of the shot, but the European Medicines Agency said on Wednesday there was no evidence so far linking AstraZeneca's vaccine to illnesses in two people who received it in Austria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britons-told-to-keep-getting-vaccinated-after-some-countries-suspend-astrazeneca-shots-101615472511797.html
11-03-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to 712,000 as layoffs pace eases||The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to 712,000, the lowest total since early November, evidence that fewer employers are cutting jobs amid a decline in confirmed coronavirus cases and signs of an improving economy.The Labor Department said Thursday that applications for unemployment aid dropped by 42,000 from 754,000 the week before. Though the job market has been slowly strengthening, many businesses remain under pressure, and 9.6 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic that flattened the economy 12 months ago.In February, U.S. employers added a robust 379,000 jobs, the most since October, reflecting an economy in which consumers are spending more and states and cities are easing business restrictions. Thursday's figure, though the lowest weekly figure in four months, showed that weekly applications for jobless benefits still remain high by historical standards: Before the viral outbreak, they had never topped 700,000, even during the Great Recession.All told, 4.1 million Americans are receiving traditional state unemployment benefits. Counting supplemental federal unemployment programs that were established to soften the economic damage from the virus, an estimated 20.1 million people are collecting some form of jobless aid.The continuing job cuts reflect the extent to which the pandemic disrupted normal economic activity and kept consumers hunkered down at home rather than out traveling, shopping, dining out and attending entertainment venues. Cities and states restricted the hours and capacity of restaurants, bars and other businesses. Even where restrictions didn't exist, many Americans for months chose to stay home to avoid the risk of infection.Now, though, as vaccinations are increasingly administered around the country, business limitations are gradually eased and consumers grow more comfortable engaging face to face with others, optimism about the economy is rising. Last month, consumers bounced back from months of retrenchment to step up their spending by 2.4% — the sharpest increase in seven months and a sign that the economy may be poised to sustain a recovery.In the meantime, the number of confirmed new Covid-19 cases has dropped to an average of around 50,000 a day from nearly 250,000 in early January.A brightening outlook for the economy was reinforced Wednesday, when Congress gave final approval to a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill that will provide $1,400 payments to most adults and extend $300 weekly unemployment benefits into early September. The legislation will also provide money for viral vaccines and treatments, school re-openings, state and local governments and ailing industries ranging from airlines to concert halls.Many economists suggest that the combination of substantial federal aid, a rising pace of vaccinations, continually low borrowing rates and the increased willingness of consumers to spend will unleash a robust economic recovery later this year. Still, defeating the coronavirus remains vital to achieving a full recovery of the economy and the job market.“These are welcome policies, but they are still temporary relief," said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “To fully heal the labor market, the public health situation must be under control. Coronavirus started this mess and continues to cause massive economic damage on a daily basis.''||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-712-000-as-layoffs-pace-eases-101615471537863.html
11-03-2021||World||Americans seek compensation for failed Covid-19 treatments from US fund||In March of last year, Steve Cicala took his wife, Susan, to the emergency room at Clara Maass Medical Center in New Jersey to treat a worsening cough and fever, unaware she had Covid-19.As her breathing and blood pressure deteriorated, she was given azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine and put on a ventilator. Eleven days after being admitted to the same hospital where she had worked for years as a nurse, Susan went into cardiac arrest and died at age 60.Steve Cicala is now the first person known to be pursuing a Covid-19 claim with a decade-old US government fund that has up to $30 billion that can be used to compensate for serious injuries or deaths caused by treatments or vaccines in the fight against the pandemic.Covid-19 presents the first serious test of the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP) overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program so far has denied compensation in 90% of the cases filed prior to the pandemic, mostly for H1N1 flu vaccines.Cicala's claim has not been previously reported.He could receive around $367,000 from the virtually untapped fund if he can show the treatment caused his wife's death. He is not alleging negligence against the hospital, which is largely protected from liability by an emergency health law."There's nothing that's going to bring her back," said Cicala, "but obviously with our two children and now two grandchildren, if there's something that we could do to help them out, that would be nice."Cicala, 58, said he believed the hospital provided the best care possible. Clara Maass declined to comment.A deadly combinationThe government does not publish specifics of claims to the fund, the amount of payouts or why claims are denied. HHS declined to comment.A Freedom of Information Act disclosure brought by a law professor and viewed by Reuters shows 48 claims were filed this year and were pending as of Feb. 16, for serious injuries and deaths from vaccines, ventilators and drugs - figures that have not previously been reported.All of these claims were related to Covid-19.To encourage life-saving efforts during a declared public health emergency, healthcare providers and drug companies can be shielded from nearly all lawsuits, and claims for serious injuries or deaths are instead filed with the CICP.That legal protection extends to Covid-19 vaccines by Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE , and Johnson & Johnson, as well as approved medicines, which briefly included the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine touted by former President Donald Trump.US regulators revoked the emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine after studies suggested it was not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients.Electrocardiogram records show Susan Cicala's heart rhythms were disrupted by hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, according to her husband's lawyer, Jonathan Levitt of Frier Levitt."Those two in combination are known to be deadly now," said Levitt. "And she was also placed on a ventilator, which as you know, also has some substantial dangers."Cicala's is one of about a dozen claims Levitt has filed with the fund. He said he has more than 200 clients planning to seek compensation for deaths allegedly caused by failed Covid-19 treatments."Our cases are mostly about hydroxychloroquine," said Levitt, who gets paid a portion of successful claims, though he declined to say how much.US lawsuits over some drugs have run into billions of dollars and protection against liability was seen as key to developing vaccines at breakneck speed during a pandemic.However, critics said the compensation fund pays out relatively small amounts for serious injuries and lacks transparency.In its 10-year history, the fund has paid $6 million for 29 claims for vaccine injuries, according to disclosures obtained by Peter Meyers, a Georgetown Law professor and vaccine injury specialist, and viewed by Reuters. Most of those were for the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome caused by the H1N1 flu vaccine.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates about 123 million people received the H1N1 vaccine.Of the 48 coronavirus-related claims received by the fund, 21 involved Covid-19 vaccines, including three deaths, according to the FOIA information obtained by Meyers.The CDC said it has received reports of deaths among people who received Covid-19 vaccines, but has no evidence linking the shots to the fatalities.Based on Meyers' FOIA information, it appears fewer than 25 claims were filed in 2020, and it was not clear whether these were Covid-19 related.Through the end of January, more than 25 million people in the United States received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose. Meyers said the number of vaccine claims suggests the shots are extremely safe.Still, he said the program's lack of transparency could undermine support for protecting drug companies from lawsuits and for drugs and vaccines authorized for emergency use."It’s important to have openness to gain the trust of the American public and to counter the vaccine hesitancy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-seek-compensation-for-failed-covid-19-treatments-from-us-fund-101615471065740.html
11-03-2021||World||Vietnam overlooks Chinese Covid-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca shots||Vietnam, which recently began its inoculation drive, has overlooked China-made vaccines, opting for the vaccine developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca instead.According to South China Morning Post (SCMP), the programme will be initially conducted in 18 hospitals treating Covid-19 patients and in areas with higher infection numbers, according to Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long.China's Sinopharm has said the vaccine made by its Wuhan subsidiary has a 72.5 per cent efficacy, while the Beijing-based Sinovac's vaccine was found to be 50.6 per cent effective, one of the lowest efficacy rates as compared to any existing coronavirus vaccine."Besides what's available in the public health care system, the next option for me would be the vaccine from Russia, then the US, then the one from China if there is no other choice," said Hanoi resident Hoang Cam Hang.Hang's stance reflects Vietnam's move to steer clear of Chinese vaccines, despite Beijing's pledge to make vaccines a global public good and offer priority access to developing countries, reported SCMP.Vietnam, which has reported one of the lowest total Covid-19 infections, is the only country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc that has yet to publicly vouch for the use of China-made vaccines.China's vaccine diplomacy had failed with Vietnam mainly because of anti-China sentiments among the public, said Nguyen Phuong Linh, associate director with global consultancy firm Control Risks."From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the virus has been widely reported in Vietnam as originally coming from China. Since then, the anti-China sentiments, which were already strong, have shown no sign of weakening," said Linh.Furthermore, Huong Le Thu, a senior analyst, said China did not come to Vietnam with offers of personal protective equipment (PPE) as it had to other Southeast Asian neighbours, which depicted a level of politicisation in Beijing's Covid-19 diplomacy.According to SCMP, Vietnam and China have always had an uneasy diplomatic relationship, with hostile sentiments being fuelled by an ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea between China, Vietnam and three other ASEAN countries, along with Beijing's activities on the Mekong River that have affected ASEAN countries.Bilateral tensions between both sides has resurfaced as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited nine ASEAN states over few months except Vietnam.Meanwhile, Vietnam aims to inoculate 80 per cent of its population or about 72 million people to achieve herd immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-overlooks-chinese-covid-19-vaccines-for-astrazeneca-shots-101615469354355.html

By then, it was too late, and the virus had reached every continent except Antarctica.The agency made some costly missteps along the way: It advised people against wearing masks for months and asserted that Covid-19 wasn't widely spread in the air. It also declined to publicly call out countries — particularly China — for mistakes that senior WHO officials grumbled about privately.Globally, there's been 118 million coronavirus cases and 2.6 million confirmed deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The United States leads the world with 29 million cases and more than 529,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-still-struggling-to-manage-pandemic-response-101615470521950.html

We'll be following up and, if necessary, speaking out on her case," he added.A State Department representative did not answer whether the administration believed Wang had been detained by authorities but said the US government was worried about her "safety and security", and disappointed that "she wasn't given the freedom" to attend Monday's event.Wang, who was rounded up by authorities in China's nationwide "709" crackdown against human rights lawyers in 2015, had recently travelled from Beijing to Guangzhou in southern China with her husband Bao Longjun, according to Chen Jiangang, a US-based friend of Wang's and a fellow "709" human rights lawyer.Chen told the South China Morning Post neither Wang nor her husband had answered their telephones since Sunday when Bao said he had been contacted by public security officers and told not to leave Guangzhou.In a separate statement, the State Department said Wang had been "harassed, threatened, searched, and physically assaulted by police since she began to take on rights abuse cases in 2011" and had been prohibited by authorities from leaving China.In July 2015, Wang was the first lawyer to be caught up in a nationwide crackdown that ultimately saw some 300 rights lawyers and activists rounded up by authorities.Wang and Bao were later charged with inciting subversion of state power, before she was released in 2016 following a televised and - according to her - coerced confession.Her case caught the attention of the United Nations, international bar associations, and a number of foreign governments, including the US and European Union.In 2019, Wang was detained by authorities as she arrived at the US embassy in Beijing to attend a seminar about domestic violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-concerned-as-chinese-human-rights-lawyer-goes-missing-101615468293306.html

When they blocked one such site, five other websites opened and sales through it.Saudi officials said 184 sites had been launched with the aim of attracting more people at the same time as they were also blocked.Consumer products such as electronics, perfumes, bags, shoes, clothes and cosmetics were sold through these online websites.Following the discovery of the scam, the ministry conducted further research on the sites and action was then taken against them.The ministry said the closure was due to a lack of information about the online store, address, phone number and user care facility. The ministry urged people to buy only from reputable online stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-shuts-down-184-chinese-websites-for-marketing-fake-products-report-101615468495635.html

The 22-year-old activist has especially been vocal about the cases of sexual assault and rape in Australian schools and has shared thousands of such accounts over the past couple of weeks. Her petition advocating for improved sex education in schools has encouraged several women to actively resist sexual abuse in the workplace and triggered a national debate on substantial measures regarding the same.The petition, titled 'Teach Us Consent' has already managed to garner more than 30,000 signatures and sparked close to 3,000 testimonies from women who experienced sexual misconduct in schools.Education minister Tudge, while announcing the government's plans to distribute educational material in schools, also admired the courage of all the activists fighting for the aforementioned cause."I've got to say I've been quite shocked at the extent of the number of people who are coming forward," Tudge was quoted as saying.According to the data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), about one in six girls and one in ten boys face abuse, sexual or otherwise, before the age of 15.Around 374 juvenile sexual assault cases were reported in New South Wales in 2020, while less than 10% of the rapes reported to the police resulted in a conviction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-equip-schools-with-educational-material-on-sexual-consent-101615464444378.html

Over the past week, the government has laid out ambitious plans to overtake the US in research-and-development investment and shift its capital-intensive growth model toward services and consumer spending.China will prioritize stable economic growth and the creation of new jobs as its main goals for 2021, with the nation needing sustainable expansion, not large fluctuations, Premier Li said during his annual press briefing.“We would certainly be happy to see robust growth, but we are also keenly aware of the large uncertainty around the economic rebound in China as well as global economic growth and development,” Li told reporters in Beijing Thursday at the conclusion of the NPC. The growth goal of more than 6% “is not a low target,” he said.A surge in Chinese stocks on the last day of the NPC failed to prevent them from posting their worst performance during the event since 2009. The CSI 300 Index fell 2.9% over the week-long legislative meeting despite the gauge surging 2.5% Thursday, its biggest daily gain in two months.An equity rout triggered by growing concern over liquidity tightening and possible asset bubbles cast a cloud on this year’s gathering, which was condensed into half its usual two-week length due to coronavirus restrictions. Despite gaining in the last two sessions, the benchmark stock gauge is still down 12% from a 13-year high reached on Feb. 10. With the NPC concluding, some investors are looking for buying opportunities.Also read: China to grow at more than 6% in 2021; defence outlay $200bn for the first timeHong Kong Overhaul Approved Chinese lawmakers approved an extensive overhaul of how Hong Kong chooses its leaders, a momentous step in Beijing’s efforts to curb opposition in the Asian financial hub’s political system.The National People’s Congress overwhelmingly passed a proposal Thursday expected to change the size and composition of the body that picks the city’s chief executive, and have it nominate local legislators. The rubber-stamp parliament was also slated to call for establishing a mechanism to ensure candidates for elected office are “patriots,” remaking the only open elections under Beijing’s rule.Takeaways for Commodities China’s first attempt to chart a course to carbon neutrality by 2060 appeared underwhelming but the NPC still provided fodder for commodities investors. One is Beijing’s unwillingness to stretch out stimulus now that the recovery from the pandemic is almost assured, which is likely to dent optimism in the idea of a new super cycle. It bodes ill for ferrous markets, particularly given plans to reduce steel output to meet carbon goals, although metals with greener credentials like copper won’t be immune from restraints on spending.China is taking a two-step approach to climate change that would limit emissions reductions before 2035, but leave most of the heavy lifting for later, when the impact on growth will have less of effect on a wealthier society and new energy sources such as hydrogen will be deployable.Today’s Only Story In case there was any doubt of its importance, the front pages of China’s major financial newspapers were plastered with stories about the annual political event. Also unsurprising was the positive tone of the coverage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/npc-will-mend-hong-kong-s-voting-system-keqiang-to-focus-on-creating-jobs-101615464200765.html

And don't underestimate our strong will to defend our interests, as well as our dignity."(Reporting by Andy Bruce and William James, editing by Elizabeth Piper)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-proposes-hong-kong-electoral-changes-undermine-trust-in-china-101615454582842.html
11-03-2021||World||China’s parliament approves major dam project near Arunachal Pradesh||China’s parliament on Thursday gave the go-ahead to the construction of a major dam and hydropower plant on the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet near the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.The project was approved by the National People’s Congress (NPC) at its closing session on Thursday as part of the country’s 14th five-year plan.The Yarlung Zangbo flows through Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and into Arunachal Pradesh as Siang, and then as Brahmaputra in Assam before flowing into Bangladesh.The project was first announced in November last year. At the time, China had said it was within its legitimate rights to build a dam on the lower reaches of the river, also called Yarlung Tsangpo. Beijing had assured that the hydropower project will take into account the interests of the downstream countries - India and Bangladesh.This week, at least two top Chinese officials spoke about the importance of the project during the just-concluded annual session of the NPC.He Lifeng, director of China’s top planning body, the national development and reform commission (NDRC), said “the development of hydropower on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river” is a world-class landmark project alongside the Sichuan-Tibet railway and the coastal railway project along the Yangtze river.Last Saturday, Che Dalha, deputy Communist Party chief of TAR had said authorities should “strive to begin construction this year”.“Comprehensive planning and environmental impact assessments for the project should be approved as soon as possible,” he said on Saturday, according to a press release quoted by Reuters and published on Monday on an official regional government website.The new dam’s ability to generate hydropower could be three times that of central China’s Three Gorges Dam, which has the largest installed hydropower capacity in the world.“China will build a hydropower project on the Yarlung Zangbo river, one of the major waters in Asia that also passes through India and Bangladesh,” the state-run tabloid Global Times had said in a report on the project in November.“There is no parallel in history (of the project)… it will be a historic opportunity for the Chinese hydropower industry,” Yan Zhiyong, chairman of the Power Construction Corp of China (POWERCHINA), had said.The paperwork on the dam began with POWERCHINA on October 16 signing a strategic cooperation agreement covering the 14th five-year plan with the TAR government.When asked in December about the project and its impact on lower riparian countries, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying had brushed aside apprehensions.“Hydropower development in the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river is China’s legitimate right. When it comes to the use and development of cross-border rivers, China always acts responsibly,” she had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-parliament-approves-major-dam-project-near-arunachal-pradesh-101615465774223.html

"But we're on different paths."The interview was watched by 12.4 million viewers in Britain and 17.1 million in the United States.It has proved divisive among the British public: some believe it showed how outdated and intolerant the institution was, while others decried it as a self-serving assault that neither Elizabeth nor her family deserved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/were-not-racist-prince-william-says-after-meghan-and-harry-interview-101615463334106.html

Myanmar anger threatens investment plans||"China's gas pipeline will be burned," chanted a group of protesters in Myanmar this week on the route of a Chinese pipeline.Hailed by China as a symbol of "mutually beneficial cooperation", the pipeline has become a target for public anger over perceptions Beijing is backing the junta that seized power in a Feb. 1 coup.The rise in anti-China sentiment has raised questions in Myanmar business circles and in China, not only over the surge of Chinese investment in recent years but for billions of dollars earmarked for a strategic neighbour on Beijing's "Belt and Road" infrastructure plan."Chinese business, Out! Out!," the dozen or so protesters shouted in Mandalay city, a staging point on pipelines across Myanmar from the Indian Ocean to China. Social media carried many more threats.The gas pipeline, which carries gas from Myanmar's offshore fields, opened in 2013, as Myanmar's military was starting democratic reforms. The $1.5 billion 770-km (480 mile) oil pipe alongside, bringing crude mainly from the Middle East, started in 2017 under the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now detained and facing an array of charges.A PetroChina official who declined to be identified said there had been no problems with the operation of the oil pipeline - the only source of crude for the state energy giant’s refinery in Kunming, Yunnan province.Protests over the pipeline flared after a Myanmar government document leaked from a Feb. 24 meeting showed Chinese officials had asked Myanmar's junta to provide better security - and intelligence on ethnic minority armed groups on the pipeline route.Reuters was unable to reach officials in Myanmar for comment on the document."Safeguarding the security of bilateral cooperation projects is the common responsibility of both China and Myanmar," China's foreign ministry said in response to questions on the document, reiterating its call for "all sides in Myanmar to exercise calm and restraint" and to resolve their differences."This would also benefit the secure operations of bilateral cooperation projects," it said.China did not immediately respond to a question on anti-China sentiment.Hostile opinionBillions of dollars had been earmarked for such projects, including an economic corridor ending at a $1.3 billion deepwater port, industrial zones, a new city next to the commercial hub of Yangon and a railway to the border."Hostile public opinion will inflict long-term threats and damage to China’s plan," said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.She pointed in particular to the damage done to Beijing's reputation over the Myitsone Dam project, which was shelved in 2011 amid a local outcry - prompting a concerted effort by China to cultivate the public as well as political leaders."Public opinion has been treated as a priority for China’s policy in Myanmar," she said.Efforts in recent years included everything from donating school backpacks to sponsoring inspection trips to China for officials - though a 2018 survey in Myanmar still found an "explicit bias" against Chinese investments.China had also tried to keep close to Suu Kyi, while maintaining ties to the army that overthrew her.Balancing the relationship has become even more precarious.While Western countries have condemned the coup, China has not even described it as one - in line with the generals' wishes. Its call for restraint from both sides draws scorn from opponents of the coup who point to the killing of more than 60 protesters. One policeman has died, the army says."China shame on you. Stop supporting the theft of a nation," read one protest placard outside the Chinese embassy before Myanmar security forces cordoned it off.SuspicionsNo matter how outlandish, allegations of Chinese involvement have swirled on social media.Some said they had seen soldiers with Chinese features or heard some speaking Mandarin. Suspicions were raised by an increase in night-time flights to China - flights the state airline said carried seafood for the Lunar New Year holiday.Unsubstantiated claims surfaced that the planes were bringing in soldiers or technicians to install an internet firewall - an idea dismissed by the junta and described as "nonsense" by the Chinese ambassador.Concerns that anti-Beijing sentiment could turn on Chinese businesses has prompted some to reconsider their positions - especially as anti-coup protests and strikes strangle the economy."They can only vent on the Chinese people on the ground," said one Chinese businessman who gave his name as Ran and is now seeking a way out - while saying he had not faced any personal attacks.Myanmar also has a substantial minority with Chinese origins, whose older members remember anti-Chinese riots in 1967 in which an estimated 30 people were killed. Some younger members, however, have taken a conspicuous stand with the protesters."Our elders worry about the Sinophobic posts - things on Facebook like 'the Chinese will be the first people to be beaten' but it's only a small number of people making them," said Aung Aung, 23, a founder of the Young Burmese-Chinese Association."The people know where we stand. We want to get democracy back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-business-out-myanmar-anger-threatens-investment-plans-101615459892289.html
11-03-2021||World||EU to take legal action against the UK government for failing to keep promise||The European Commission is preparing to take legal action against the British government in coming days over its failure to keep promises it made in the Brexit deal to keep the island of Ireland free of border checkpoints.Here’s what what the EU is planning to do:Start an ‘infringement’ caseUnder the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK remains subject to rulings by the European Court of Justice, so the commission can start an infringement procedure against Britain as if it were still a member of the bloc.The process can take as long as three years, but can be sped up. After months of formal back and forth, the EU court can ultimately issue a ruling that would be binding on Britain. The ECJ could impose financial penalties on the UK if it ignores the decision.It’s this route that the commission took in October 2020 when Britain’s proposed Internal Market bill looked like giving the government unilateral powers to suspend parts of the Protocol. This action was ended in December after the sides reached a compromise.Also read: EU wants employers to report pay levels to fix gender gapInvoke the dispute-resolution mechanismThe second course of action makes use of the dispute resolution mechanism in the Brexit deal. The EU would accuse the UK of not acting in “good faith” as the two sides committed to do in their agreements.This again is a drawn-out process that eventually sees a five-member arbitration panel set up. The panel can take as long as a year to issue a binding ruling. Again, any questions of interpretation of EU law would be sent to the ECJ.If the UK didn’t comply with the arbitration panel’s decision, a financial penalty could be imposed. And if that wasn’t paid, the EU could suspend parts of the Brexit divorce deal -- as well as the trade deal signed in December. That could mean trade tariffs would be imposed.In the meantime, the EU might face a dilemma in how it conducts checks on goods that could be moved into the single market via Northern Ireland.Why has it come to this?Under the Brexit deal, Northern Ireland stayed in the EU’s customs union and some of the single market. This prevented the need for border checks on the island of Ireland, which was a condition for a wider Brexit deal -- but introduced them on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.It’s always been an uneasy compromise, disliked by the UK government and unionists in Northern Ireland.Last month, the government said it would unilaterally waive customs paperwork on food entering Northern Ireland until October, beyond the April 1 deadline it had agreed. The EU said it was a violation of the treaty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-take-legal-action-against-the-uk-government-for-failing-to-keep-promise-101615454558646.html

The SuperCam was developed jointly by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico, and a consortium of French research laboratories. The audio files, which were first delivered to the operation centre of the French space agency, the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES), in Toulouse, include sounds of wind and rhythmic tapping sound of laser strikes on Mars.“The sounds acquired are remarkable quality,” Naomi Murdoch, a research scientist at the ISAE-SUPAERO aerospace engineering school in Toulouse, was quoted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as saying. “It’s incredible to think that we’re going to do science with the first sounds ever recorded on the surface of Mars!” she added.The first audio file, obtained about 18 hours after landing, captured the faint sounds of Martian wind since the rover’s mast remained stowed on its deck. According to Nasa, the muffled sound is “little like the sound one hears listening to a seashell or having a hand cupped over the ear.” The second file also has the sound of wind from Mars, recorded on Perseverance’s fourth Martian day, and is “more audible, especially around the 20-second mark.”Things are sounding really good here. Listen to the first sounds of wind captured by my SuperCam microphone. This mic is located at the top of my mast. For this recording, my mast was still down so the sound is a bit muffled. https://t.co/0KpN30oIroRead | NASA's Perseverance 'SuperCam' begins hunt for past life on MarsThe US space agency said that the third file includes the rhythmic zapping sounds of a laser impacting a rock target 30 times at a distance of about 10 feet. Some zaps sound are slightly louder than others and the variations in the intensity will provide information on the physical structure of the targets, such as their relative hardness or the presence of weathering coatings.“This information will be essential when determining which samples to cache and ultimately return to Earth through our groundbreaking Mars Sample Return Campaign, which will be one of the most ambitious feats ever undertaken by humanity,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at Nasa headquarters, said in a statement.🔊 You’re listening to the first audio recordings of laser strikes on Mars. These rhythmic tapping sounds heard by the microphone on my SuperCam instrument have different intensities that can help my team figure out the structure of the rocks around me. https://t.co/nfWyOyfhNyOne of the listeners on SoundCloud, an online music sharing platform, compared the audio recording of the laser with a ticking time bomb while another said it was "like a symphony." Last week, the Perseverance rover performed its first drive on Mars that lasted about 33 minutes, covering 21.3 metres across the Martian surface. It served as a mobility test to assure the mission controllers that the drive system is good to go for surface operations following its safe landing on Mars on February 18. The rover will be used to explore the rocks in Jezero crater, an ancient lakebed that dried up as the climate of the Red planet changed, and return samples through future missions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-record-first-sound-of-laser-strikes-wind-on-mars-101615459929763.html

The EMA has launched an investigation into that death."There is broad documentation proving that the vaccine is both safe and efficient. But both we and the Danish Medicines Agency must act on information about possible serious side effects, both in Denmark and in other European countries," Brostrom said.The suspension, which will be reviewed after two weeks, is expected to slow down Denmark's vaccination campaign.Copenhagen now expects to have its entire adult population vaccinated by mid-August instead of early July, the health authority said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-suspends-use-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-over-blood-clot-fears-101615460885771.html

Nowhere is the discrepancy in vaccinations more glaring than in a comparison with Britain.The last available figures show that 35 % of the UK adult population has had a vaccine shot while the figure in the EU stands at 9.6 %.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-figures-show-major-covid-19-vaccine-exports-despite-shortage-back-home-101615456368186.html

Schools and most shops had followed in mid-December.But epidemiologists, pointing to more contagious virus variants as well as surging infection rates in Germany's neighbouring countries like the Czech Republic or Poland, have repeatedly warned against easing the partial lockdown too early.At the same time, Wieler said there are encouraging signs that a vaccination campaign was already starting to show effect."We see effects already in those who are over 80. The incidence (rate of infection) is on the decline, tremendously," he said.Germany focussed on vaccinating the oldest within its population when it began its innoculation campaign late December, but criticism has grown over the pace of the rollout as the country lags Britain or the United States.Wieler however voiced confidence that there was light at the end of the tunnel.If "everything doesn't run completely out of control... we will have control in Germany this autumn. I am absolutely convinced," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-sees-surge-in-covid-19-cases-amid-third-wave-warning-101615455406883.html
11-03-2021||World||US aims at helping India develop its own defence industrial base: Pentagon||The Biden administration is looking at deepening its military and technical cooperation with India by not only providing it with arms and equipment, but also helping New Delhi develop its own defence industrial base to allow it to work with the US and others around the region, a senior Pentagon official has told lawmakers.In 2016, the US recognised India as a 'Major Defense Partner' under which Washington will continue to work toward facilitating technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.India is a real partner, a rising partner of the United States, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs David Helvey said while responding to a question from Congressman Doug Lamborn during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday on the Indo-Pacific region by the House Armed Services Committee."We are looking to ... deepen our military-technical cooperation with India that is based on providing them arms and equipment so we can build interoperable forces and capabilities and work with India developing its own defence industrial base so that India is able to produce equipment to service their needs and to be able to work with us and others around the region," Helvey said."We have a unique designation with India; it's called a Major Defense Partner," he said, ahead of US Defence Secretary Lloyd J Austin's first visit to India from March 19 to 21 that is expected to focus on ways to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and strengthen overall defence and security ties.Austin said he would be travelling to India to meet his counterpart Rajnath Singh and other senior national security leaders to discuss deepening the US-India Major Defense Partnership and advancing cooperation between the two countries.During the Congressional hearing, Helvey said one of the things that the US was prioritising is looking at ways to operationalise the defense partnership with India to be able to look at ways where both countries can work together in the defence space in pursuit of common interests based on their converging strategic interest."I think we all agree that it needs to be a better partner and a counterweight to China, so what is the Biden administration plan to build a stronger partnership with India both economically and militarily?" Congressman Lamborn asked."One of the things we would like to be able to do is built on some of the foundational agreements that we have been able to conclude with India in recent years. Say for example, with information security or logistics arrangements to where we can share more information with India so we can build a common strategic understanding of the types of threats that we face together," Helvey said."Look at how we can use our forces and Indian forces in the Indian Ocean region and beyond to be able to work together, whether it's in maritime domain awareness or maritime security or humanitarian assistance and disaster response," Helvey said.Admiral Phil Davidson, Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, responding to the same question said that over the course of his tenure at INDOPACOM there has been some opportunity to cooperate in the maritime and to assist a little bit in information sharing, some cold-weather gear, and things like that with India's challenges along the Line of Actual Control with China."I think it's gone a long way to deepening our relationship and really presents a key strategic opportunity I think, for the United States," he said.In his prepared testimony, Helvey said that in South Asia, America's Major Defense Partnership with India continues to deepen as the two nations build interoperability through increasingly complex exercises and growing defense trade, and through expanded information sharing and secure communications to address issues of shared concern."With the completion of all foundational agreements, the partnership is now poised to accelerate. We also are pursuing emerging partnerships with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Maldives to work cooperatively to ensure the region remains free and open," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aims-at-helping-india-develop-its-own-defence-industrial-base-pentagon-101615455102961.html
11-03-2021||World||Hong Kong electoral system: Here are key points on China's move to overhaul it||China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC) moved on Thursday to overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system, reducing democratic representation in the city's institutions.The changes also include a vetting mechanism for election candidates and winners.Here are the main points.Only "patriots" can rule Hong KongChina's Communist Party saw 2019's pro-democracy protests as a direct threat to national security and set out measures to bring Hong Kong onto an authoritarian path.In 2020, Beijing introduced a national security law, saying it will restore law and order but seen by critics as a tool to quash dissent. Most high-profile democratic politicians and activists are either in exile or jail for offences under the new law or related to the protests.The protests also convinced Beijing that a political system designed to allow a minority democratic opposition in the Legislative Council was a "loophole" or "deficiency" if those politicians were too hostile to the Communist Party.A new vetting and screening committee will ensure Hong Kong institutions will be filled only with "patriots," a term which China says includes people who love the country in its present-day form, led by the Communist Party.It remains unclear what space will be left for meaningful opposition in Hong Kong as well as to what extent and on which issues vetted politicians could have differing views on how the city should be governed.Analysts said the key risk is that if governing institutions are filled only with "true patriots" without true opposition, politicians would compete over who is more loyal to the Party rather than who has the best ideas for the city.Read | Hong Kong electoral changes undermine trust in China: UKElectoral committee reshuffledThe electoral committee stacked by design with pro-Beijing figures will get 300 extra seats, bringing the total to 1,500.An announcement of the draft decision did not spell out its future composition in full, but the 117 seats occupied by district councillors, the only fully democratic institution in Hong Kong - empowered, however, only to perform menial duties related to bus stops or garbage collection - is likely to be scrapped.The new seats are likely to be filled with more pro-Beijing people from various organisations. The electoral committee will then pick many of the seats in the legislature.Beijing reasserts control over legislative councilRiding high after the 2019 protests, democratic politicians won 90% of the district council seats in a vote later that year. That gave them a slim hope - or from Beijing's point of view, raised a risk - of them winning a tiny majority in the city's mini-parliament in since-postponed 2020 elections.The Legislative Council had 70 seats, with only half directly elected in geographical constituencies. The rest represented industry and professional interests in functional constituencies mostly stacked with pro-Beijing people.The Council will now have 90 seats, with the extra seats picked by the electoral committee. Five seats given previously to district councils via functional constituencies will likely be scrapped.Local media has said geographical constituencies will be restructured into 18 from five previously, with the first two winners past the post, ensuring the pro-Beijing candidate - likely to get the second place according to polls showing a 60%/40% democratic/establishment split - will probably get a seat.If any opposition candidate is allowed to run after passing patriotic vetting, they will then face ongoing screening, limiting their options for exercising opposition too passionately or through filibustering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-electoral-system-here-are-key-points-on-china-s-move-to-overhaul-it-101615453842786.html
11-03-2021||World||Myanmar military using 'battlefield weapons' against protesters, says Amnesty||Amnesty International accused Myanmar's military government on Thursday of increasingly using battlefield weapons against peaceful protesters and conducting systematic, deliberate killings.Myanmar has been roiled by protests and other acts of civil disobedience since a Feb. 1 military coup that toppled the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi just as it was to start its second term. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.The military “is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders across the country,” Amnesty International said in a report.“By verifying more than 50 videos from the ongoing crackdown, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab can confirm that security forces appear to be implementing planned, systematic strategies including the ramped-up use of lethal force. Many of the killings documented amount to extrajudicial executions,” the report said.Security forces have used live ammunition against protesters, causing the deaths of about 60 people.There were new but unconfirmed accounts of additional deaths Wednesday and Thursday as police attempted to break up anti-coup protests in cities and towns across the country using tear gas and other weapons.As widespread protests against its takeover continue, the junta is facing a new challenge from the country's ethnic guerrilla forces, which until recently had limited themselves to verbal denunciations of last month's coup.Reports from Kachin, the northernmost state, said guerrilla forces from the Kachin ethnic minority attacked a government base on Thursday and were in turn attacked. The armed wing of the Kachin political movement is the Kachin Independence Army, or KIA.“This morning in Hpakant township, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO/KIA) attacked a military council battalion based in Sezin village, and the KIO/KIA’s Hpakant-based 9th Brigade and 26 battalions were attacked by helicopter. Both sides are still investigating,” The 74 Media reported on Twitter.A Facebook page for the Kachin Liberation Media said the KIA had overrun the government outpost and seized ammunition. It warned the government against using lethal force to break up anti-coup protests in the Kachin capital, Myitkyina, where two demonstrators were killed this week.The reports could not be independently confirmed, and ethnic guerrilla armies as well as the government often release exaggerated information. However, even making such an announcement amounts to a sharp warning to the government.The Kachin actions come a few days after another ethnic guerrilla force belonging to the Karen minority announced it would protect demonstrators in territory it controlled. The Karen National Union deployed armed combatants to guard a protest in Myanmar’s southeastern Tanintharyi Region.Myanmar has more than a dozen ethnic guerrilla armies, mostly in border areas, a legacy of decades-old struggles for greater autonomy from the central government. Many have formal or informal cease-fire agreements with the government, but armed encounters still occur.There has been speculation that some ethnic groups could form a de facto alliance with the protest movement to pressure the government.The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday unanimously called for a reversal of the military coup that ousted Suu Kyi’s government and strongly condemned the violence against peaceful protesters. The council also called for “utmost restraint” by the military.A presidential statement approved by all 15 council members was formally adopted at a virtual meeting. The British-drafted statement calls for the immediate release of leaders including Suu Kyi and President Win Myint who have been detained since the army's takeover. It supports the country’s democratic transition and “stresses the need to uphold democratic institutions.”The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions on two adult children of Myanmar’s junta chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. They are the latest in a series of sanctions imposed by the U.S. since the military seized power and began its deadly crackdown on protesters. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Myanmar’s military leaders should not be able “to derive benefits from the regime as it resorts to violence and tightens its stranglehold on democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-military-using-battlefield-weapons-against-protesters-says-amnesty-101615453532215.html
11-03-2021||World||No decision yet on US force posture in Afghanistan, says Tony Blinken||The Biden administration is currently reviewing its Afghanistan policy and has so far not made any decision on the American force posture in the war-torn country, Secretary of State Tony Blinken has said, ahead of the May 1 deadline for a final withdrawal of US troops - stipulated in a Taliban-US deal last year.The Biden administration has decided to review the Doha deal the Trump administration had signed with the Taliban in February 2020. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington's 18-year war in the country. The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001.“I don't want to prejudge the outcome of that review,” Blinken told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday.“There haven't been any decisions made yet on force posture when it comes to May 1 but as we are doing the review we are also pressing ahead with the diplomatic effort to try to drive the two parties to negotiate and to put in place agreements that would be the foundation for a just and durable peace in Afghanistan,” Blinken said.“That of course is a very tall order but one that we are working on and especially enlisting others into the effort because as we were discussing a little bit earlier neighbouring countries have a huge stake in Afghanistan not being a terrain for civil war that spills over the borders and they have influence with various parties,” he said in response to a question.“So we are engaging them, we are engaging the UN and others to try to move the parties to a meaningful negotiation even as we are looking very hard at the obligations the Taliban has made in the agreement that you reference particularly with regard to not supporting terrorist groups that could strike the US and reducing violence,” he said.US special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad spoke to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday and they discussed the latest developments pertaining to the Afghan peace talks.India, a major stakeholder in Afghanistan, has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban.India has extended developmental assistance to tune of around USD 3 billion in the last few years to Afghanistan.The US, Blinken said, has boosted diplomatic efforts in Afghanistan, ahead of the May 1 deadline for a final withdrawal of US troops. The president's goal is very clear, he said.“It's to bring our troops home. And it's to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a haven for terrorism and an ongoing threat to the United States,” he said.“We are engaged in a diplomatic effort right now to try to drive the two parties to negotiate and to move forward on commitments that the Taliban made to the US a year ago to negotiate meaningfully on a peaceful future for Afghanistan. Not only are we doing that, as important, we're enlisting other countries, the United Nations, in that effort. Many of Afghanistan's neighbours have a real stake in its future and influence with the parties,” Blinken said.While the diplomatic effort is ongoing, the US is reviewing its own troop posture, including the May 1 deadline, he said.“We haven't made any decisions yet about that, and we went to see where this effort goes to actually get the parties to engage in a meaningful way. The Taliban made other commitments when it comes to reducing violence, when it comes to non-harbouring or supporting terrorists. We want to see them make good on those obligations,” Blinken said.The Biden administration on Tuesday said the US is working closely with Afghan parties to encourage progress on a political settlement and a comprehensive ceasefire, asserting that any durable outcome has to be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned, and it is not for the US to dictate the deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-decision-yet-on-us-force-posture-in-afghanistan-says-tony-blinken-101615453689737.html

The demonstration comprised 120 vehicles and it concluded at the Chinese consulate in the city.The event this year drew support from other rights groups confronting China’s domestic human rights violations, including those backing democracy in Hong Kong and opposing the persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang province.While messages of solidarity came from the leader of the Opposition in Canada, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, the event witnessed the participation of groups such as Canada-Hong Kong Link, Federation for Democratic China and World Uighur Congress.Pointing to Chinese aggression on the border with India and in the South China Sea, Youdon Tsamotshang, board chair of Students for a Free Tibet Canada and one of the principal organisers of Wednesday’s event, said, “The Tibet issue is a marker. We’ve suffered for the last 62 years. Now the rest of the world is bearing the brunt of China’s policy.”The event marked the anniversary of Tibetans’ resistance against Chinese occupation in Lhasa, which resulted in the movement being crushed by Beijing, forcing the Dalai Lama to escape to India in 1959, where he remains in exile.Organisers of the event in Toronto called upon the Canadian government to take legislative actions targeting China similar to that in the US and “stand by the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhist community’s wishes to be in charge of the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation process”.That there is momentum in Canada for those opposing China’s policies was also evidenced by a poll released on Wednesday by Maru Public Opinion, which showed that 52% of respondents viewed China as the highest security threat faced by Canada, outstripping Russia, North Korea and Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibetans-in-canada-hold-rally-to-mark-1959-uprising-against-chinese-occupation-101615454133991.html

11-03-2021||World||China for decades waged campaign to destroy Tibet’s proud culture, history: Nancy Pelosi||China for decades has waged a campaign to destroy Tibet's proud culture and history, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has alleged, asserting that the US will continue to stand with the Tibetan people and honour those who sacrificed all for their rights and freedom.Speaking on the occasion of the 62nd anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day on Wednesday against the Chinese occupation of the remote Himalayan region, Pelosi said, “Sixty-two years ago, brave Tibetans rose up against the Chinese invasion to protect their way of life and culture. Today, we continue to stand with the Tibetan people and honour those who sacrificed all for their rights and freedom.”“Tibetan men, women and children want simply to practice their faith, speak their language and celebrate their culture free from violence and intimidation. Yet, Beijing for decades has waged a campaign to destroy Tibet’s proud culture and history, which remains a clarion call for action to freedom-loving people worldwide,” the top Democrat said.That is why, last year, the US reaffirmed its bipartisan, bicameral support for the people of Tibet by enacting the Tibet Policy and Support Act, which strengthens diplomatic ties between the US and the Central Tibetan Administration and makes clear that decisions regarding Tibetan religion should be made solely by Tibetan religious leaders, she asserted.Previous US president Donald Trump in December last year had signed into law a bill which called for establishing a US consulate in Tibet and building an international coalition to ensure that the next Dalai Lama is appointed solely by the Tibetan Buddhist community without China's interference. This prompted China to warn that the act will seriously disrupt and hurt bilateral relations.The new Joe Biden administration on Tuesday said the Chinese government should have no role in the succession process of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.“This year, as we mark this solemn anniversary, we continue to take inspiration from the Dalai Lama’s powerful message of peace, faith and love,” Pelosi said.“Guided by His Holiness’s spirit of hope, we will never rest in our efforts to advance freedom and opportunity in Tibet and throughout China – because if we do not stand up for human rights in China due to commercial interests, then we lose all moral authority to talk about human rights in any other place in the world. We will not be deterred in this vital mission,” said the House Speaker.The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader has been demanding meaningful autonomy for Tibetans.The 85-year-old Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 following a crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet. India granted him political asylum and the Tibetan government-in-exile is based on Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh since then.China views the 14th Dalai Lama as a "separatist" working to split Tibet from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-for-decades-waged-campaign-to-destroy-tibet-s-proud-culture-history-nancy-pelosi-101615445248760.html
11-03-2021||World||Porsche’s hometown offers clues to Germany’s Post-Merkel future||When the Green leader of Germany’s third-largest state flouted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coronavirus plan earlier this year, it was the latest sign that the former fringe party is confident enough to challenge the authority of her conservative bloc.“I am fully in line with Merkel, but I have my own way,” Winfried Kretschmann said in a national TV appearance, explaining the move with a mix of independence and respect that’s cementing support among local voters.In a state election on Sunday, the 72-year-old former student radical and anti-nuclear activist is on track to build out his advantage and secure a third term running Baden-Wuerttemberg -- an industrial powerhouse in Germany’s southwest known for fast cars and cuckoo clocks.Current polls suggest Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is set for its worst performance ever in the state. The historic defeat would come with the party on the back foot over a scandal involving claims of politicians profiting off the coronavirus pandemic. If trends continue, the Greens’ unusual strength in Baden-Wuerttemberg could be a sign of things to come.CDU officials in Berlin fear the Greens could abandon their alliance in the state and instead form a coalition with the Social Democrats and the pro-business Free Democrats, according to people familiar with the party’s deliberations.That would leave Merkel’s party out of government in Stuttgart -- the state capital and hometown of Porsche and Mercedes-Benz -- for only the third time since World War II, a tough setback ahead of September’s national election.Falling out with the Greens in a region that represents about 15% of the German economy and 13% of the population could ultimately raise questions about the likeliest coalition in Berlin after Merkel steps down.CDU officials are increasingly concerned that the “Merkel bonus” will evaporate as it moves closer to the September vote, especially if she continues to struggle with the pandemic, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are internal.While similar three-way alliances are unlikely on the federal level, sidelining the CDU in Baden-Wuerttemberg would signal the Greens are ready to battle Germany’s biggest party for control in the post-Merkel era.The scandal over allegations that politicians in Merkel’s bloc benefited financially from face-mask contracts is a significant blow. Two officials, including one from Baden-Wuerttemberg, have resigned in recent days, hitting the group just before the weekend’s elections.Citizens of Rhineland-Palatinate are likewise voting on Sunday, and with corruption claims swirling, the CDU is expected to lose support in that SPD-led western state as well.For the national election, the conservative bloc is also anxious about how voters will react to the group’s chancellor candidate. The choice -- which will make it even clearer that Merkel is no longer the face of the bloc -- is between the CDU’s new chief Armin Laschet and Markus Soeder, the head of the Bavarian CSU sister party. A decision is expected by late May.Around the same time, the Greens will choose their own contender. Co-leaders Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck are both seen as capable challengers.“We can perform miracles” and do nothing less than transform Germany, Baerbock said at a party convention in November.The Greens -- who served as the junior partner to the Social Democrats under Gerhard Schroeder -- have surged in recent years, bolstered by widespread German concerns about climate change. They were briefly neck-and-neck with the CDU/CSU before the coronavirus crisis.A successful run this election cycle could have a ripple effect across Europe and chart a path for other environmental groups to push for power.The cornerstone of the party’s national campaign involves a plan to invest 500 billion euros ($600 billion) over 10 years -- equivalent to an annual boost of about 1.5% to Europe’s largest economy.While the CDU squirms at the prospect of more borrowing, the Greens want to finance the transition to a clean economy by raising debt and taxing big tech companies and the wealthy, who tend to vote for the conservatives.Kretschmann, a former school teacher and devout Catholic, played a key role in the party’s mainstream shift. He was the first Green state premier, when elected in 2011. Despite initial fears of anti-auto policies, his pragmatic approach has contributed to the second-lowest unemployment rate in Germany’s 16 states.The party is now involved in 11 regional governments, but Baden-Wuerttemberg is the only coalition it leads.Heading into the state’s vote, the Greens’ support has risen to 32% from 30.3% in the 2016 state election, according to a poll by INSA. The CDU, which once regular won majorities there, could decline to a new low of 25% from 27%.Despite policy differences, Kretschmann is an advocate for an alliance between the Greens and the CDU/CSU on the national level. He says the mix could help in the fight against climate change, which will only be successful if it “promises prosperity and doesn’t create fear,” he said this week on ZDF television.“Two important parties from different camps would come together,” Kretschmann said. “That’s not a bad thing in difficult times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/porsches-hometown-offers-clues-to-germany-s-post-merkel-future-101615444398672.html
11-03-2021||World||US, China diplomats to hold first in-person talks of Biden presidency||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with top Chinese officials on March 18 in Alaska, the White House said on Wednesday, the first high-level in-person contact between the two sparring countries under the Biden administration.The meeting, taking place on Blinken's return from his first overseas trip to key US allies Japan and South Korea, will come amid what is shaping up to be a major US diplomatic push to solidify alliances in Asia and Europe to counter China.National security adviser Jake Sullivan will join the meeting in Anchorage with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councillor Wang Yi, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, adding that the administration would approach its relations with China "in lockstep" with its partners."It was important to us that this administration's first meeting with Chinese officials be held on American soil, and occur after we have met and consulted closely with partners and allies in both Asia and Europe," Psaki told a news briefing.She said the meeting would be "an opportunity to address a wide range of issues, including ones where we have deep disagreements."China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.President Joe Biden's administration has committed to reviewing elements of US policies toward China, as the world's two largest economies navigate frosty relations that sank to their lowest depths in decades during Donald Trump's presidency.Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a "disaster" for both nations.Testifying before the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Blinken signaled next week's meeting would not be a return to regular senior-level dialogues used under past US administrations, which had been increasingly criticized in Washington for yielding little progress on US grievances with Beijing."There's no intent at this point for a series of follow-on engagements. Those engagements, if they are to follow, really have to be based on the proposition that we're seeing tangible progress and tangible outcomes on the issues of concern to us with China," Blinken said.US DIPLOMATIC PUSHBlinken also said that if China insists it is not violating the human rights of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region, it should provide the world access to the area.UN experts and rights groups say China has detained more than a million Uighurs and other minorities there, actions the United States has deemed a genocide. Beijing denies abuses, saying facilities in the region are for vocational training to counter the threat of terrorism.The talks will follow the visit by Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Japan and South Korea next week, as well as an online summit on Friday between Biden and the leaders of Japan, India and Australia.That will be the first leader-level meeting of the four-country group, known as the Quad, seen as part of US efforts to boost its diplomacy in Asia to balance China's growing military and economic power.Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the timing of the meeting sends the message to Beijing that US alliances are strong.Discussions are likely to focus on China's policies toward Hong Kong, its pressure on Taiwan, its treatment of Uighurs, and what Washington sees as economic coercion against Australia, she said."If the Chinese repeat their messages contained in recent speeches that the US is to blame for the problems in the US-China relationship and therefore the ball is in the US court, then nothing positive will come of this meeting," Glaser said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-diplomats-to-hold-first-in-person-talks-of-biden-presidency-101615443692825.html
11-03-2021||World||'Unforgettable memory': Japan falls silent to mark decade since tsunami disaster||Japan fell silent on Thursday to mark 10 years since the worst natural disaster in the country's living memory: a powerful earthquake, deadly tsunami and nuclear meltdown that traumatised a nation.A minute's silence was observed across the country at 2.46 pm local time (0546 GMT), the precise moment a 9.0 magnitude quake hit off the northeast coast on March 11, 2011.Around 18,500 people were killed or left missing in the disaster, most of them claimed by the towering waves triggered by one of the strongest quakes ever recorded.The ensuing nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant blanketed nearby areas with radiation, rendering some towns uninhabitable for years and displacing tens of thousands of residents.Speaking at a ceremony in Tokyo's national theatre, Emperor Naruhito said the "unforgettable memory of the tragedy" persisted a decade on."Many of those afflicted, in spite of their having suffered from unimaginably enormous damage, have overcome numerous hardships by helping one another," he added.The annual memorial event was held before a smaller audience than usual, with the capital and nearby areas currently under a virus state of emergency.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the challenges faced by survivors had been compounded by the pandemic and natural disasters, including a recent strong quake in the region, classified as an aftershock of the 2011 tremor.But he said Japan had always "overcome every crisis with courage and hope".Private and public commemorations were seen across Japan as bereaved local residents laid flowers at graves and placed letters to missing family members into the sea.As the sun rose in Fukushima prefecture's Hisanohama, 78-year-old Toshio Kumaki walked along a giant sea wall built after the tsunami and offered a prayer.Around 60 people were killed in Ohisa, one of the districts adjacent to the beach, when tsunami waves of seven metres washed ashore, wiping away everything but a tiny shrine.Kumaki's eyes filled with tears as he remembered the disaster. "It was really scary."Tributes and condolences poured in from around the world, with everyone from UN Secretary Antonio Guterres to singer Lady Gaga offering their thoughts on the anniversary.- 'People died before my eyes' -Searches for those still missing are taking place this week, as loved ones refuse to relinquish hope of finding them even a decade on.The chances of success may appear slim, but just last week the remains of a woman missing since the tsunami were identified, in what her surviving son described as a chance to process his emotions and move forward.The disaster is being marked just two weeks before the Olympic torch relay kicks off in Fukushima prefecture, nodding to efforts to cast the event as the 'Reconstruction Games'.The pandemic has cast a long shadow over the Olympics, forcing their unprecedented year-long postponement, but the government and organisers are hoping the relay will bring the spotlight back to the region.A decade on, the disaster has shaped Japan's preparations for natural disasters, with many towns along the coast building new or higher sea walls.Evacuation routes and plans have been refined and improved in a country that regularly deals with disasters ranging from typhoons to earthquakes.Nayuta Ganbe in Miyagi's Sendai city speaks often at events about disaster prevention, sharing his experience of the tsunami, but he usually marks the anniversary privately."It's the day when I lost my classmates. People died before my eyes. March 11 is a day that I hoped would never come again," the 21-year-old told AFP recently.But this year he has decided to participate in an event on the anniversary, hoping it will help him with the ongoing work of processing the trauma he experienced.For others, the anniversary will be a moment for private reflection on a tragedy that continues to reverberate.Tens of thousands of people who evacuated fearing radiation are still displaced, and around two percent of Fukushima remains off-limits.Most of Japan's nuclear reactors are still offline, and government plans to revitalise the sector are controversial.Reverend Akira Sato, who ministered at several churches that in areas still largely off-limits around the Fukushima plant, will be spending the day in reflection at one of the churches he had to abandon."Together with my wife, I will silently think back over the days of the disaster and offer a prayer."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unforgettable-memory-japan-falls-silent-to-mark-decade-since-tsunami-disaster-101615443124920.html

The corridor will facilitate travel for commercial, tourism and official purposes.The talks come as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to travel to the UAE on Thursday, his first known visit to the Gulf country after they normalized their relations last year.Israel and the UAE last year agreed on 28 direct weekly flights connecting Tel Aviv with Abu Dhabi and Dubai before Israel barred foreign flights to limit exposure to new virus strains.Israel leads the race to vaccinate its population. It has fully inoculated more than half its residents, while the UAE is on track for that goal by March-end. Cases in both countries have fallen from a peak in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-uae-weigh-travel-corridor-after-speedy-vaccine-rollouts-101615442697556.html
11-03-2021||World||US blacklists Islamic extremist groups in Congo, Mozambique as terrorist units||The United States on Wednesday blacklisted two Islamist extremist groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique as foreign terrorist organizations over accusations of links to Islamic State (ISIS).The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in Congo and its leader Seka Musa Baluku and Mozambique's Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama and its leader Abu Yasir Hassan were also named "specially designated global terrorists."The designations prevent travel by members to the United States, freeze any US-related assets, ban Americans from doing business with them and make it a crime to provide support or resources to the movements.The United States dubbed the groups ISIS-DRC and ISIS-Mozambique."The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) announced the launch of the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) in April 2019 to promote the presence of ISIS associated elements within Central, East, and Southern Africa," the State Department said in a statement."Although ISIS-associated media portray ISCAP as a unified structure, ISIS-DRC and ISIS-Mozambique are distinct groups with distinct origins," it said. "These groups have committed or pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism."The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan insurgent faction active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has committed a spate of brutal reprisal attacks on civilians since the army began operations against it in late 2019.Also read: US assumes leadership of Quad, says President Joe Biden convened upcoming summitThe ADF has been blamed for the killing of over 140 people since the start of the year, in almost weekly attacks in Congo’s restive east. The group killed around 850 people last year, according to UN figures.Islamic State funding and recognition has driven the ADF into a new phase of deadly expansion, said Laren Poole from the Bridgeway Foundation, a US based thinktank."We believe that targeting the group's financial and recruitment networks will provide the most effective way to reduce the Islamic State in DRC's capacity for violence," Poole told Reuters.Some analysts, though, have questioned links between the ADF and Islamic State."These new sanctions probably won't have much effect on the ground, just as the sanctions on ADF in 2014 changed nothing," said Dan Fahey, a former member of an independent group of experts charged with monitoring UN sanctions on DRC."It is a symbolic act, and a bit surprising because the group of experts has consistently downplayed the nature and strength of the ISIS influence in Congo," he added.Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, known in Mozambique as Al-Shabaab, staged its first attack in 2017. First known mainly for beheadings, the fighters declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2019 and have since increased attacks in scale and frequency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-blacklists-islamic-extremist-groups-in-congo-mozambique-as-terrorist-units-101615428128675.html
11-03-2021||World||Chinese lawmakers set to tighten control on Hong Kong||China’s ceremonial legislature plans to endorse the Communist Party’s latest move to tighten control over Hong Kong by reducing the role of its public in picking the territory’s leaders.The measure adds to a crackdown against a protest movement calling for greater democracy in Hong Kong. The crackdown has prompted complaints Beijing is eroding the autonomy promised when Hong Kong return to China in 1997 and has hurt its status as a global financial center.The National People’s Congress, which was due to end its annual meeting Thursday, will endorse “improvements to the electoral system” of Hong Kong, the body’s Standing Committee said. The plan would give a pro-Beijing committee power to appoint more of Hong Kong’s lawmakers, reducing the number elected by the public.The NPC also was due to endorse the ruling party’s latest five-year development blueprint. It calls for stepping up efforts to transform China into a more self-reliant technology creator — a move that threatens to worsen strains with Washington and Europe over trade and market access.The legislature has no real power but the ruling party uses its annual meeting, the year's highest-profile political event, to showcase economic and political plans.Its approximately 3,000 delegates are picked by the party, not the Chinese public, and routinely endorse decisions already made by party leaders. A symbolic vote of support by the NPC shows an issue is a party priority.Last year, the party used the NPC session to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. Under that law, 47 former legislators and other pro-democracy figures have been arrested on subversion charges that carry a possible maximum penalty of life in prison.On Sunday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi defended the latest proposed changes in Hong Kong as needed to protect its autonomy and defend its “transition from chaos to governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-lawmakers-set-to-tighten-control-on-hong-kong-101615441545611.html
11-03-2021||World||US will speak out forcefully against China committing 'genocide': Official||Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the US will speak out forcefully against China committing "genocide" against the Uyghur Muslims in its Xinjiang province, as several lawmakers expressed concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in the communist nation, ahead of the first face-to-face meeting of top American and Chinese officials next week since President Joe Biden took office.The White House and State Department said on Wednesday that Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan will see China's top foreign policy officials, the foreign affairs chief of the ruling Communist Party of China, Yang Jiechi, and State Councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi on March 18 in Anchorage, Alaska.Blinken told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee during a Congressional hearing that the US will continue to speak out forcefully and shine a light on "egregious violations of human rights" by China.“We have been clear and I've been clear that I see it as genocide, other egregious abuses of human rights, and we'll continue to make that clear,” he said, responding to a question by Congressman Michael McCaul who asked what additional steps is the Biden administration is prepared to take to stop this "genocide".“I think there are a number of things that we can do, should do, and will do. First of all, it's important to speak up and speak out and to make sure that other countries are doing the same thing. The more China hears not just our opprobrium but a chorus of opprobrium from around the world, the better the chance that we'll get some changes,” Blinken said.“We have a number of steps that we have taken or can take going forward, to include for those directly responsible for acts of genocide, gross human rights violations, sanctions, visa restrictions, etc. I think it would be very important, if China claims that there is nothing going on, that it gives access to the international community, to the United Nations."If they have nothing to hide, show it to us, show the world. And so, we'll be calling for that,” he said. "Then there are a series of practical things that are very important. For example, we should make sure that we are not exporting and others are not exporting to China any products that can be used for the repression of their people and their minorities," he said.Similarly, America shouldn't be importing products that are created by forced labor, including from Xinjiang. "So, those are some of the practical things that we can and should do, but for short we're going to start by speaking out forcefully on this,” Blinken said.Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick asked, “What can the administration do to protect the Uighur community and the Uighur minority, bring about the end of this ongoing genocide in China and will you be raising these concerns of grave human rights violations when you meet with the Chinese officials in Alaska?”Blinken responded, “I have spoken already to my Chinese counterpart, raised those concerns directly with him, President Biden has raised those concerns directly with (President) Xi Jinping in his conversation with him. We will certainly be raising them again in Alaska.”The meeting with the Chinese in Alaska will come just just days after Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin see their Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Tokyo and Seoul to reaffirm US treaty alliances with those nations.It will also come less than a week after Biden holds a virtual summit with the top leaders of India, Japan and Australia to discuss Indo-Pacific policy.US-China relations nose-dived while Donald Trump was president, with his administration taking multiple actions against Beijing for its actions against Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in Xinjiang and in Tibet, its crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, aggressive actions toward Taiwan and staking claims to territory in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-speak-out-forcefully-against-china-committing-genocide-official-101615439982601.html

A total of two million Covid-19 doses will be exported to Canada by mid-May under the agreement, while India has not ruled out additional consignments.The organisers of the billboards said they are pleased that their campaign commenced on the eve of the first anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus disease as a pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-billboards-in-canada-thank-indian-pm-modi-for-providing-covid-19-vaccines-101615441052921.html
11-03-2021||World||Families of Boeing crash victims renew push for FAA changes||Relatives of some of the passengers who died in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines marked Wednesday's two-year anniversary of the disaster by seeking the improbable: a reversal of government orders that let Boeing 737 Max jets fly again.They are also seeking the removal of several top officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the plane and let it keep flying after another Max crashed in Indonesia, five months before the Ethiopian accident. A total of 346 people died in both crashes. The family members say they are trying to prevent a third crash.The parents of 24-year-old Samya Rose Stumo met with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for nearly an hour, then joined other families at a vigil outside FAA headquarters in Washington. In Toronto, the family of Danielle Moore, who was also 24, planned to protest outside the U.S. consulate.FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson has personally vouched for the plane's safety. A military and airline pilot before heading FAA, Dickson flew a Max in September. Boeing says Max jets have made 9,000 flights for 14 airlines without incident since returning to service late last year.A longtime FAA engineer wrote to Stumo's parents last month and detailed how a critical flight system was approved despite what he considered a shocking design flaw: It could change the plane's trajectory if a single sensor failed.Joe Jacobsen told the family that FAA delegated the review of most aspects of the flight system to a small number of Boeing engineers. Jacobsen said he and other FAA engineers didn't know about the design of the system, called MCAS, until after the first crash, and that if they knew, they would have flagged the problem.“Please accept my deepest apologies for my inability to stop the chain of events that led to the tragic loss of your beautiful daughter,” Jacobsen wrote to Michael Stumo and Nadia Milleron.Boeing had to revise the system before the FAA and other regulators would allow the plane to fly again, but Jacobsen wrote that more needs to be done — Boeing merely improved the plane's design from an F to a D. His letter was first reported by the Seattle Times.Milleron said it took her hours to read Jacobsen's email, which prints out at five pages — she kept stopping, pacing the room, thinking about her daughter.“It's just really hard to read these things," she said. “You wish you could reach back in time and change it so Samya could be alive and the other people could be alive.”Michael Stumo said the email made him more certain that top FAA officials, particularly the head of the agency's safety office, must go. The couple and their son asked Buttigieg to remove at least four officials including Dickson and the head of the FAA's aviation safety office.A Transportation Department spokesperson said Buttigieg expressed his sympathy to the family and believes the FAA needs to put in effect changes that Congress made last year in its oversight of aircraft manufacturers.The FAA referred to previous comments including a video Dickson made in November, when he announced the end of the 20-month grounding of the Max. Dickson said changes demanded by his agency fixed the problems that played a role in the crashes, and added that he was “100% comfortable with my family flying on it.”In December, Congress approved changes in FAA's process for certifying new planes. The FAA will still rely on Boeing engineers to make critical safety assessments, but will be able to choose those employees and communicate directly with them.Last month, the Transportation Department’s inspector general criticized the FAA's oversight of Boeing in a blistering report. The watchdog issued 14 recommendations to “restore confidence in FAA’s certification process and ensure the highest level of safety.” The FAA said it will follow the recommendations, but it will take nearly five years.The grief of relatives of other passengers has not eased in the last two years either. Nor were they satisfied in January when Chicago-based Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecution for fraud. The company admitted that two former test pilots hid information about changes to MCAS from the FAA.“The truth is that 346 people are now dead because Boeing cut corners, lied to regulators, and simply considers this the cost of doing business,” said Yalena Lopez-Lewis, whose husband Antoine Lewis, died on the Ethiopian plane.“This crash should never have happened, and the people at Boeing should be held accountable for their terrible actions,” said Linet Mwirigi, whose husband Cedrick Asiavugwa was also on the Ethiopian Airlines Max.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/families-of-boeing-crash-victims-renew-push-for-faa-changes-101615440181569.html
11-03-2021||World||Hong Kong court grants bail to 5th pro-democracy activist, jails another||A Hong Kong court on Thursday granted bail to a fifth pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker but revoked bail for another, after both were charged with subversion under the national security law.They're part of a group of 47 activists and former lawmakers who were arrested over their involvement in an unofficial primary election last year, aimed at determining the strongest candidates in a legislative election that was later postponed due to the pandemic.Authorities say the primary was part of a plot to paralyze the government and subvert state power, as at least some of the activists had planned to vote down major bills and force Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to resign if their pro-democracy camp had gained a legislative majority.The city’s High Court on Thursday granted bail to former Democratic Party lawmaker Helena Wong, who was one of the candidates in the primaries.Her bail conditions include surrendering all travel documents and observing a curfew. She is also banned from speaking with foreign officials, making speeches or engaging in acts that violate the national security law, and running for office.Despite releasing Wong, the court revoked bail granted to another activist, district councilor Ng Kin-wai. Ng will be remanded in custody.Both Wong and Ng are part of a group of 15 defendants who were initially granted bail last week, although they were all later kept in custody while the Department of Justice filed an appeal.Prosecutors have since dropped their appeal against four other defendants, who were released last Friday.The other nine defendants will have their bail reviewed on Saturday and Monday.The remaining 32 defendants who last week were either denied bail or withdrew their applications for bail will continue to stay behind bars. The next hearing is May 31.The mass charges against the activists marked the most sweeping action taken against the city’s pro-democracy camp since the national security law was implemented last June.Under Hong Kong’s common law system, defendants are usually granted bail for non-violent crimes. But the national security law removed the presumption of bail, with a clause saying it will not be granted unless the judge has sufficient grounds to believe defendants “will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.”The national security law criminalizes secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city’s affairs as well as terrorism. Serious offenders could face life imprisonment.Critics say the law, which was imposed by Beijing in response to sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019, erodes the rights and freedoms promised to Hong Kong under the “one country, two systems” framework following the handover from British colonial rule in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-court-grants-bail-to-5th-pro-democracy-activist-jails-another-101615440109507.html

11-03-2021||World||Huawei confirms senior executive seeking HSBC records in Hong Kong court||Chinese tech giant Huawei confirmed Thursday that senior executive Meng Wanzhou is taking HSBC to court in Hong Kong to access banking records she says will help her battle extradition from Canada to the US.Chief financial officer Meng -- whose father is the company's founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei -- has been in a two-year battle against extradition over charges Huawei violated US sanctions on Iran.Meng is accused in the US of defrauding HSBC by falsely misrepresenting links between Huawei and a company that sold telecoms equipment to Iran.Last month she lost a similar bid at Britain's High Court, which ruled the court in Canada where the extradition battle is taking place was the "appropriate forum" to decide whether the HSBC records were necessary for a fair hearing.Now her lawyers are hoping Hong Kong's courts will rule in her favour."The application made by Ms. Meng in Hong Kong is a request to obtain evidence under Hong Kong Law to demonstrate her innocence in respect of the allegations made against her by the United States of America," a Huawei spokesperson told AFP."Whatever the court rules, Ms. Meng will continue defending her legitimate rights in the Canadian proceedings."The first hearing will take place on Friday according to the website of Hong Kong's judiciary.HSBC did not respond to requests for comment.Meng's arrest on a US warrant during a Vancouver stopover in December 2018 -- and Beijing's subsequent detention of two Canadians -- caused a major diplomatic rift between Canada and China.She has denied hiding Huawei's relationship with the covert subsidiary Skycom in Iran from HSBC and her lawyers say the documents will help prove that.Her extradition case in Vancouver is expected to end in mid-May, barring appeals.The Hong Kong filing comes at a time of intense scrutiny of Hong Kong's judiciary as Beijing's cracks down on dissent in the semi-autonomous financial hub.The city's independent courts and common law traditions are a core part of its reputation as a reliable and dependable business hub.But China's authoritarian leaders have begun exercising ever greater direct control over the city following huge democracy protests in 2019.Last year it imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, including granting Beijing's courts jurisdiction in some cases.Beijing and Hong Kong authorities are also drawing up broad plans to ensure all politicians and public officials are "staunch patriots", including within the judiciary.HSBC is headquartered in London but has a major presence in Hong Kong.It makes the vast majority of its profits in Asia, especially Hong Kong and China, and has publicly backed Beijing's national security law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-confirms-senior-executive-seeking-hsbc-records-in-hong-kong-court-101615439404332.html

Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will star in two new public service announcements (PSA) for the coronavirus vaccine alongside former First Ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Rosalynn Carter, the Ad Council announced on Thursday."The science is clear. These vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease," said President Bush in one of the PSAs with Obama and Clinton, urging Americans to get vaccinated."That's the first step to ending the pandemic and moving our country forward," said Obama.Noticeably absent in the vaccine PSAs, created by nonprofit the Ad Council, are former President Donald Trump and Melania Trump. During his run for re-election last year, Trump widely touted his administration's role in bringing a vaccine to market.When asked about Trump's absence, a spokesman for the Ad Council said one of the PSAs was filmed at President Joe Biden's inauguration in January, which Trump did not attend.The spokesman added the organization was pleased when Trump recently advised Americans to "go get your shot" after receiving the vaccine.The new ads are part of the Ad Council's nationwide vaccine education campaign titled "It's Up To You." More than 300 partners are supporting the nonprofit in the effort to battle hesitancy about the vaccine's safety and help convince more people to get the shot.A second PSA features each of the presidents and First Ladies wearing masks and receiving a dose of the vaccine."Now it's up to you," Carter says in the ad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-presidents-and-first-ladies-promote-vaccine-in-new-advertisements-101615439323743.html

In between these visits, he has effectively been held under house arrest in Beijing and never been allowed to travel freely or to speak openly with foreigners,” the HRW report said.You, a member of the secretariat of the CPC central committee and head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC central committee, “expressed hope that the Panchen Lama would actively safeguard national and ethnic unity”.According to an official statement, You extended congratulations to the Panchen Lama on the progress he has made in various aspects and encouraged him to further his research on Buddhism.According to the CPC’s mouthpiece, People’s Daily, Gyaltsen Norbu was confirmed and approved by the state council, or the Chinese central government, as the reincarnate of the Tenth Panchen Lama on November 29, 1995 “after the lot drawing from a sacred, golden urn in strict compliance with religious rituals and conventions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panchen-lama-says-buddhism-in-tibet-will-be-sinicised-adopt-socialist-traits-101615439553367.html
11-03-2021||World||UNSC condemns violence against Myanmar protesters, asks army to show restraint||The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday condemned violence against Myanmar protesters and called on the army to show restraint, but failed to denounce the military takeover as a coup or threaten further action due to opposition from China and Russia.More than 60 protesters have been killed and some 2,000 people have been detained by security forces since the Feb. 1 coup against elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group said.On Wednesday, security forces firing teargas and rubber bullets trapped hundreds of anti-junta protesters late into the night in two districts of Yangon.Some protesters who managed to evade blockades set up by police in surrounding streets told of scores of arrests and said that some of those who got caught were beaten.In a bid to increase pressure on the military as it continues its crackdown, the U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two children of military leader Min Aung Hlaing and six companies they control."The indiscriminate violence by Burma's security forces against peaceful protesters is unacceptable," said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Andrea Gacki.Campaign group Justice for Myanmar said in January that Min Aung Hlaing, who has been commander in chief since 2011, had "abused his power to benefit his family, who have profited from their access to state resources and the military's total impunity."The UK is also exploring fresh sanctions, foreign minister Dominic Raab said in a tweet.In New York, the United Nations Security Council said in a statement that it "strongly condemns the violence against peaceful protesters, including against women, youth and children."The council calls for the military to exercise utmost restraint and emphasizes that it is following the situation closely."But language that would have condemned the coup and threatened possible further action was removed from the British-drafted text, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.A junta spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were forcibly repressed.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he hoped the Security Council statement would push the military to realize it "is absolutely essential" that all prisoners are released and that the results of a November election are respected.The army has justified the coup by saying that the election, won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, was marred by fraud - an assertion rejected by the electoral commission. The junta has promised a new election, but has not said when.Guterres acknowledged that Myanmar was not a "perfect democracy" before the coup."It was still heavily under military control in many aspects, which makes this coup even more difficult to understand, especially the accusations of electoral fraud by those that were largely in control of the country," he said.Civil DisobedienceState television MRTV announced arrest warrants against some of the best-known youth protest leaders and showed a picture of 29 wanted protesters. The protesters have been calling for international protection and action against the junta.On Wednesday, police stormed a compound in Yangon housing railway staff and surrounded hundreds of protesters in North Okkalapa district, in another part of the city. More than 100 people were arrested at the two sites, witnesses said.Many of the railway staff are part of a civil disobedience movement that has crippled government business and included strikes at banks, factories and shops.Police and the army did not respond to requests for comment.One youth said in a message to Reuters that other protesters had been beaten and slapped. He escaped by hiding in a large washing machine, he said."Tomorrow I will keep protesting. I will not stop. The goal is very clear that we want democracy. We want our elected government back," he said, not wanting his name published.In the central towns of Mingyan and Monywa, people defied night curfew orders to hold candlelight vigils.One protester told Reuters from the southern coastal town of Myeik that he had been brought to Myeik Air Base and beaten with belts, chains, bamboo sticks and batons."The soldiers said, 'This is the hell room, why don't you guys have a taste?'" he said, declining to give his name for fear of reprisals. Reuters was unable to contact the police in the town or the airbase for comment.Some police have refused orders to fire on unarmed protesters and have fled to neighbouring India, according to an interview with one officer and classified Indian police documents.An Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar's junta will be paid $2 million to "assist in explaining the real situation" of the coup to the United States and other countries, documents filed with the U.S. government show.Ari Ben-Menashe told Reuters on Saturday his task was to convince Washington that Myanmar's generals wanted to move closer to the West and away from China. He said they wanted to resettle Rohingya Muslims who fled a 2017 assault for which the U.N. has accused the military of overseeing a genocide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-condemns-violence-against-myanmar-protesters-asks-army-to-show-restraint-101615438785081.html

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Wednesday said Wilson’s article reflected her “deep-rooted ideological prejudices.”The criticism reflects deep Chinese anger both over the BBC's reporting on sensitive issues such as the coronavirus outbreak and abuses against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, and the British governments decision to open a pathway for residency and eventual citizenship for millions of Hong Kong residents.China last month banned the BBC from the small number of hotels, residential compounds and offices where it had been shown, in apparent retaliation for its reporting on China and Britain's revocation of the license of state-owned Chinese broadcaster CGTN.Britain has condemned a Chinese crackdown on civil liberties in the former British colony of Hong Kong that has gathered pace with the imposition last year of a sweeping national security law and the Chinese parliament's moves to eliminate even the possibility of government critics running for office in the semi-autonomous city.Scores of activists have been rounded up and accused of violating the law, while free speech and assembly have been severely curtailed, seemingly betraying China's commitment to allow Hong Kong to retain its own social, political and legal systems for 50 years following the 1997 handover to Chinese rule.In its letter, the Chinese Embassy singled out a BBC Radio 4 report titled “The Disinformation Dragon” that aired on Tuesday. The report made “groundless accusations against China on issues related to, among others, information, Covid-19 and diplomacy."“China has always been a country of propriety and deeply values harmony. We have never been the one that starts provocations and have no intention to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries. It is the others who keep meddling in our domestic affairs and smearing China," the letter said.In his criticism of Wilson's article, Zhao said China had stated to her its “solemn position on the relevant issue."“Ambassador Wilson’s article, with a confused logic, avoids all the facts, including the British media’s disinformation and false reporting on China," Zhao said.He accused Wilson of ignoring the alleged suppression of Chinese media in the West and of praising "the so-called Western experience in an arrogant tone" and making “irresponsible remarks about China’s system and media."Wilson responded on Twitter, writing: “I stand by my article. No doubt the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to the UK stands by the 170 pieces he was free to place in mainstream British media."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blasts-bbc-report-after-summoning-uk-ambassador-101615439113740.html
11-03-2021||World||Indonesian volcano spews new burst of hot ash, gas clouds||A rumbling volcano on Indonesia’s Sumatra island unleashed an avalanche of searing gas clouds flowing down its slopes during eruption on Thursday. No casualties were reported.Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra province was shooting smoke and ash as high as 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) into the air and hot ash clouds traveled up to 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) southeast, Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center said.There were no casualties from the eruption, said Armen Putra, an official at the Sinabung monitoring post. He said villagers were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the crater’s mouth and should be aware of the peril of lava.The alert is being maintained at the second-highest level while authorities are closely monitoring the volcano after sensors picked up increasing activity in past weeks.The 2,600-metre (8,530-feet) mountain has been rumbling since last year. It was sending volcanic materials more than 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky and depositing ash on nearby villages when erupted early this month.Some 30,000 people have been forced to leave homes around Sinabung in the past few years.Sinabung was dormant for four centuries before exploding in 2010, killing two people. Another eruption in 2014 killed 17 people, while seven died in a 2016 eruption.The volcano, one of two currently erupting in Indonesia, has sporadically come to life since then.Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-volcano-spews-new-burst-of-hot-ash-gas-clouds-101615438643899.html
11-03-2021||World||Numbers behind Japan's recovery from tsunami disaster||Ten years after a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeastern coast, triggering meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, much has been achieved in disaster-hit areas but they are still recovering. Numbers show how much progress has been made and what still remains.___9.0 EARTHQUAKEThe magnitude 9.0 earthquake was one of the strongest temblors on record. It struck off the coast at 2:46 p.m. and generated a towering tsunami that reached land within half an hour.___18,426 DEADThe National Police Agency says 18,426 people died, mostly in the tsunami, including 2,527 whose remains have not been found. Local authorities still regularly conduct searches in the sea and along the coast for traces of those still missing. None of the fatalities has been directly linked to radiation.___42,500 PEOPLE HAVEN'T RETURNEDNearly half a million people were displaced across the northeastern region. Ten years later, 42,565 people, including 35,725 from Fukushima, still haven’t been able to return home.___$295 BILLION COSTThe government has spent 32 trillion yen ($295 billion) for the region's recovery, including construction of roads, seawalls and houses, and support for people's livelihoods. In addition, Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the destroyed nuclear plant, says its costs for decommissioning, compensating evacuees and decontamination of radioactive materials outside the plant will total 21.5 trillion yen ($200 billion), though analysts say it could be much higher.___2.4% OFF-LIMITSA decade after the disaster, no-go zones remain in nine Fukushima municipalities surrounding the wrecked nuclear plant. The area accounts for 2.4% of prefectural land, down from more than 10% in the initial no-go zone. Decontamination efforts, such as the removal of topsoil and tree branches and the washing down of roofs, helped reduce radiation levels. But many residents are reluctant to return because of a lack of jobs and continuing radiation concerns.___14 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTEAbout 14 million tons of radioactive soil, trees and other waste from decontamination efforts across Fukushima are packed in massive numbers of plastic waste bags piled at temporary storage sites. The bags, enough to fill 11 enclosed baseball stadiums, are now being transported to a medium-term storage facility being built in the two towns that are home to the Fukushima nuclear plant. The government has promised to remove the bags from the prefecture in 30 years, but a final repository has not been determined.___432 KILOMETERS (270 MILES) OF SEAWALLMuch of Japan's northeastern coastline hit by the tsunami has been fortified with enormous concrete seawalls as high as 15 meters (50 feet). All of the walls have been completed except for sections of the eastern coast of Fukushima. When completed, the total length will be 432 kilometers (270 miles). Critics say the walls look like giant fortresses and block sea views, while posing a possible risk of preventing water from flowing back to sea if they are breached by a future tsunami.___4,000 NUCLEAR PLANT WORKERSAbout 4,000 workers are employed every day at the damaged nuclear plant to help in its decommissioning, which officials say will take up to 40 years, a target critics say is overly optimistic. They are removing spent fuel rods from cooling pools, reinforcing a seawall to protect from future tsunamis, treating radioactive cooling water leaking from the reactors and removing highly contaminated debris.___1.24 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WATERSince the disaster, contaminated cooling water has leaked from the damaged reactor containment vessels into the basements of reactor buildings, where it mixes with groundwater. Much of the water is treated and stored in 1,000 huge tanks now crowding the plant. The operator, TEPCO, says the tanks currently contain 1.24 million tons of water and will be full in the fall of 2022. It says the water and tanks need to be removed to make room for facilities needed in the decommissioning process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/numbers-behind-japan-s-recovery-from-tsunami-disaster-101615437538971.html

More than one-third of those who signed up for the vaccine, 36%, were no-shows on Tuesday.The BioNTech vaccine, brought into the city by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co., was administered to 91% of those signed up to get it on Wednesday, the first day it was available.The skipping of Sinovac vaccine appointments comes after the city reported three deaths and three critical illnesses among the more than 130,000 people inoculated to date. While none have been linked to the Sinovac vaccines, hesitancy around getting the shots has risen among residents. Authorities preliminarily ruled out a tie between the vaccines and the first two deaths and two critical cases, while they are still analyzing the more recent reports.“It’s understandable some residents are worried about the latest serious adverse events and even deaths following vaccination,” Secretary for the Civil Service Patrick Nip said on Tuesday. All of the serious side effects will be reviewed closely by an expert committee, as is common procedure, he said.India and mainland China also had sluggish starts to their vaccination efforts, due at least in part to distrust and concern over the recently-released Covid-19 vaccines.Hong Kong began its public vaccination campaign on Feb. 26, prioritizing people aged 60 and older, health-care staff and other essential workers. Starting Tuesday, it expanded its priority groups to cover 3.7 million people, about half of its population, adding those in high-risk contact positions like teachers, public transportation drivers and restaurant workers.Other countries also have reported fatalities among people who have received inoculations, though the numbers have been small and nearly all cases involved underlying conditions. None of the deaths or serious complications have been tied to the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-less-residents-turn-up-to-get-vaccinated-amid-reports-of-side-effects-101615438010505.html

"The team scambled to pull together spare parts to rebuild the telescope from scratch."The accident turned out to be a blessing in disguise.A 'freak accident' In reassembling the unit, engineers discovered what Robinson described as a "Hubble-like" flaw in the original mirror.Shortly after the Hubble Space Telescope's launch in 1990, operators realised that the observatory's primary mirror had an aberration -- later corrected -- that affected the clarity of images.Scientists believe that around 3.5 billion years ago the crater in which Perseverance landed was home to a river that flowed into a deep lake, depositing sediment in a fan-shaped delta.The rover is tasked with collecting more than two dozen rock and soil samples in sealed tubes, to be sent back to Earth sometime in the 2030s for analysis.About the size and weight of an SUV, Perseverance is equipped with a two-meter (seven-foot) robotic arm, 19 cameras, two microphones as well as other cutting-edge instruments.A small helicopter drone tucked under its belly will attempt the first powered flight on another planet in a few weeks' time.One instrument on board is designed to make oxygen from Mars' primarily carbon dioxide atmosphere, something that would greatly facilitate human habitation.Perseverance is the fifth rover to set wheels down on Mars, all of them from NASA. The feat was first accomplished in 1997.Its core mission lasts just over two years, but the rover could remain operational well beyond that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-supercam-begins-hunt-for-past-life-on-mars-101615429742226.html
11-03-2021||World||Andrew Cuomo groped female aide in governor's residence: Report||An aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the Democrat groped her in the governor's residence, marking the most serious allegation among those made by a series of women against the embattled governor, according to a report published in a newspaper Wednesday.The Times Union of Albany reported that the woman, who was not identified, was alone with Cuomo late last year when he closed the door, reached under her shirt and fondled her. The newspaper's reporting is based on an unidentified source with direct knowledge of the woman's accusation. The governor had summoned her to the Executive Mansion in Albany, saying he needed help with his cellphone, the newspaper reported.The three-term governor faces harassment allegations from five other women, including former aide Charlotte Bennett. The 25-year-old's attorney, Debra Katz, said in a statement released Wednesday evening that the latest allegations are “eerily similar” to Bennett's own story.Bennett has said she was summoned to the Capitol on a weekend and left alone with Cuomo, who asked her for help with his cellphone. She has said Cuomo asked about her sex life and propositioned her.“The Governor’s sexual harassment, which Charlotte Bennett reported, was buried by his aides and never properly investigated," Katz's statement said. "Because of their enablement, another young woman was left in harm’s way.”The woman whose account was reported by the Times Union also indicated that Cuomo had touched her and made flirtatious comments on multiple occasions. According to the newspaper, her allegations came to light as Cuomo staffers watched the governor's March 3 press conference, his first after initial sexual harassment claims made in late February.In it, he denied ever touching a woman inappropriately. The aide subsequently became emotional, and told a female supervisor who approached her about her encounters with the governor. At least one supervisor reported the allegation to an attorney in the governor's office Monday, the newspaper reported.Prior to Wednesday’s report, the allegations against Cuomo include a combination of claims that he made the workplace an uncomfortable place for young women, ranging from flirtatious comments to a nonconsensual kiss.At least five accusers — Bennett, Lindsey Boylan, Anna Liss and Karen Hinton — worked for the governor in Albany or during his time in President Bill Clinton’s Cabinet. Another, Anna Ruch, told The New York Times that she met Cuomo at a friend’s wedding.The three-term governor has denied inappropriately touching anyone, but said he is sorry if he made anyone uncomfortable and didn’t intend to do so.“As I said yesterday, I have never done anything like this. The details of this report are gut-wrenching," Cuomo said through a spokesperson Wednesday evening. "I am not going to speak to the specifics of this or any other allegation given the ongoing review, but I am confident in the result of the Attorney General’s report.”State Attorney General Letitia James has put together an investigative team to probe Cuomo’s workplace conduct. The governor has called on lawmakers and the public to await the results of that investigation. Federal investigators are also scrutinizing how his administration handled data concerning Covid-19 outbreaks at nursing homes.Cuomo has been under fire for weeks, beginning with revelations that his administration withheld details from the public about the pandemic's death toll among residents in state nursing homes. Scrutiny of the governor — who received accolades during the height of the coronavirus pandemic for leadership that yielded a book deal and calls for a national political career — intensified when former adviser Boylan, 36, reiterated harassment claims made in December, fleshing them out in a late February blog post.It was unclear if the latest allegation would further erode Cuomo’s support in the Legislature. While several state legislators from both parties have called for Cuomo’s resignation or impeachment, most have indicated they will wait for the probe's conclusion.Cuomo has repeatedly maintained he won’t resign."How can we allow this man to lead our state? We must impeach,” Democratic Assembly member Zohran Kwame Mamdani tweeted Wednesday night.Republican Assembly member Mike Lawler on Twitter called Cuomo “a sexual predator" who should be charged.Both lawmakers had previously called for Cuomo's impeachment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/andrew-cuomo-groped-female-aide-in-governor-s-residence-report-101615427970010.html

11-03-2021||World||'We make lives better': Facebook moves to dismiss federal, state antitrust suits||Facebook has asked a court to dismiss state and federal antitrust lawsuits that accuse it of abusing its market power in social networking to crush smaller competitors.The social media giant said Wednesday that the complaints “do not credibly claim" that its conduct harmed either consumers or market competition.The antitrust suits, filed in December by the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states, are seeking remedies that could include a forced spinoff of the social network’s popular Instagram and WhatsApp services.“As we said when the FTC and the state attorneys general announced these lawsuits, people around the world use our products not because they have to, but because we make their lives better," Facebook said in a statement.The FTC suit asserts that Facebook has engaged in a "systematic strategy” to eliminate its competition, including by purchasing smaller up-and-coming rivals like Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. New York Attorney General Letitia James, in announcing the states complaint, echoed this sentiment, saying that Facebook “used its monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users.”The FTC declined to comment.In an emailed statement, James said Facebook is “wrong on the law and wrong on our complaint."“We are confident in our case, which is why almost every state in this nation has joined our bipartisan lawsuit to end Facebook’s illegal conduct," the statement said.Big Tech companies are facing growing opposition from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on the power they have amassed over the past decade. There’s little likelihood the pressure will ease up. President Joe Biden has said that a breakup of tech giants should be seriously considered.Lawmakers and consumer advocates have accused Facebook of anticompetitive behavior, most starkly in buying up aspiring smaller rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp and by copying competitors.Critics say such tactics squash competition and could limit viable alternatives for consumers looking, for instance, for comparable services that do less tracking for targeted advertising. Businesses, including mom and pop shops, might have to pay more for ads if they have fewer choices to reach consumers online.The lawsuits could take years to resolve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-make-lives-better-facebook-moves-to-dismiss-federal-state-antitrust-suits-101615422906636.html

Government agencies “are building on lessons learned from previous rounds of payments to increase the number of households that will get electronic payments, which are substantially faster than checks,” the post said.President Joe Biden plans to sign the $1.9 trillion stimulus legislation into law on Friday, a package that includes more than $410 billion of direct payments for most Americans.Individuals who earn as much as $75,000, or couples making $150,000, plus their children or adult dependents, qualify for the full $1,400 per person. Single parents with at least one dependent who earn $112,500 or less also get the full amount. Families in which some members have different citizenship and immigration classifications are also eligible for a payment, if at least one person has a Social Security number.The payments phase out much more quickly than in previous rounds: An individual with income of $80,000, or a couple with $160,000, get nothing.For those who have already filed their tax returns, the IRS will use income data for 2020 to determine eligibility and size of payments. For people who have yet to file, the IRS will review 2019 tax data to determine the payments.The IRS will send the payments via direct deposit for individuals for whom they have bank-account information on file. Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and other federal benefit recipients will receive their payments the same way they typically get their monthly transfers. Others will be sent paper checks or prepaid debit cards.Other aid in the bill that Biden will sign spans jobless benefits to child tax credits. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “This legislation puts nearly $1 trillion in the pockets of the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-relief-bill-us-households-to-get-1-400-payments-from-this-month-says-white-house-101615421970625.html

Since then, many Americans have been relegated to hermit-like lifestyles in their homes to avoid a disease that's killed over 525,000 people — about the population of Wichita, Kansas — and plunged the economy to its deepest depths since the Great Depression.“Today we have a decision to make of tremendous consequence,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., “a decision that will make a difference for millions of Americans, saving lives and livelihoods.”For Biden and Democrats, the bill is essentially a canvas on which they've painted their core beliefs — that government programs can be a benefit, not a bane, to millions of people and that spending huge sums on such efforts can be a cure, not a curse. The measure so closely tracks Democrats' priorities that several rank it with the top achievements of their careers, and despite their slender congressional majorities there was never real suspense over its fate.They were also empowered by three dynamics: their unfettered control of the White House and Congress, polls showing robust support for Biden's approach and a moment when most voters care little that the national debt is soaring toward a stratospheric $22 trillion. Neither party seems much troubled by surging red ink, either, except when the other is using it to finance its priorities, be they Democratic spending or GOP tax cuts.Republicans noted that they've overwhelmingly supported five previous relief bills that Congress has approved since the pandemic struck a year ago, when divided government under then-President Donald Trump forced the parties to negotiate. They said this one solely reflected Democratic goals by setting aside money for family planning programs and federal workers who take leave to cope with COVID-19 and failing to require that shuttered schools accepting aid reopen their doors.“If you're a member of the swamp, you do pretty well under this bill. But for the American people, it means serious problems immediately on the horizon,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., referring to the added federal borrowing the measure will force.A dominant feature of the 628-page bill is initiatives making it one of the biggest federal efforts in years to assist lower- and middle-income families. Included are expanded tax credits over the next year for children, child care and family leave — some of them credits that Democrats have signaled they'd like to make permanent — plus spending for renters, feeding programs and people's utility bills.Also Read: Biden to order additional 100 million doses of J&J Covid-19 vaccine to boost supplyBesides the direct payments and jobless-benefit extension, t he measure has hundreds of billions for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, schools, state and local governments and ailing industries from airlines to concert halls. There is aid for farmers of color, pension systems and student borrowers, and subsidies for consumers buying health insurance and states expanding Medicaid coverage for lower earners.“Who’s going to help? Do we say this is all survival of the fittest? No,” said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky. “We rise to the occasion. We deliver.”Underscoring the bill's focus, the independent Tax Policy Center said the measure would give almost 70% of its tax breaks this year to households earning $91,000 or less. In contrast, the Trump-era GOP tax bill gave nearly half its 2018 reductions to the top 5% of households earning around $308,000, said the research center, which is run by the liberal-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.The measure was approved amid promising though mixed signs of recovery.Americans are getting vaccinated at increasingly robust rates, though that is tempered by coronavirus variants and people's growing impatience with curbing social activities. The economy created an unexpectedly strong 379,000 jobs last month, though there remain 9.5 million fewer than before the pandemic struck.Republicans said the country will pay a price for the extra spending.“It's certainly good politics to say, ‘Hey, we’re going to hand you a check for $1,400,” said Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina. “But what they don't talk about is what this bill costs.”An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last week that 70% of Americans back Biden’s response to the virus, including a hefty 44% of Republicans. According to a CNN poll released Wednesday, the relief bill is backed by 61% of Americans, including nearly all Democrats, 58% of independents and 26% of Republicans.Yet until November 2022, when control of the Senate and House will be at stake, it will be uncertain whether voters will reward Democrats, punish them for the expenditures or make decisions on other, unforeseen issues.The bill's pathway has underscored Democrats' challenges as they seek to build a legislative record that will persuade voters to support them.Democrats control the Senate, split 50-50, only because Vice President Kamala Harris gives them the winning vote in tied roll calls. They have just a 10-vote advantage in the House.That's almost no wiggle room for a party that ranges from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on the conservative side to progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.On the relief bill, progressives had to swallow big concessions to solidify moderate support.The most painful was dropping the House-approved federal minimum-wage increase to $15 hourly by 2025. Moderates also succeeded in trimming the emergency jobless benefits, which in an earlier version were $400 weekly, and phasing out the $1,400 stimulus checks completely for earners at lower levels than originally proposed.Keeping Democrats united won't get easier as the party tries advancing the rest of its agenda. There are fault lines within the party over priorities like immigration, health care and taxes.At some point it seems likely that progressives will draw their own lines in the sand. They are already demanding that the party revisit the minimum-wage boost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-oks-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-in-win-for-biden-democrats-101615404205231.html
