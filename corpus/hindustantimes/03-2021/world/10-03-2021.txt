Merck has agreed to partner with J&J to produce its vaccine.The United States has already paid over $1 billion for 100 million doses from J&J and had an option to purchase an additional 200 million doses.Biden has sought to speed up the vaccination process since taking office on Jan. 20. The pandemic has killed more than 528,000 people in the United States alone.J&J’s manufacturing has been slower than hoped, and it was not expected to be able to deliver any vaccine doses this week. It is expected to resume shipments later in March.The company indicated that another vaccine purchase by the US administration had not been finalized."Last August, Johnson & Johnson signed an agreement with the US government to deliver 100 million doses of our Covid vaccine, and we are on track to meet that commitment," spokesman Jake Sargent said."The US Government has the option to purchase additional doses under a subsequent agreement. We look forward to any future discussions with the US Government and to participating in the event at the White House later today," he added.J&J has come up short on its shipments to the United States this month, promising to deliver only 20 million of the 37 million doses it had originally promised to have ready by now.Merck will help with the final manufacturing steps called fill and finish - expected to be up and running in May - and the production of the vaccine itself. J&J, which has committed to producing 1 billion doses this year, also said it is continuing to seek more manufacturing partners.The United States approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc vaccines in December, and those companies have been working to increase their production since then.Pfizer and Moderna have committed to supplying the country with 120 million doses and 100 million doses, respectively, by the end of March. They have agreed to supply 300 million doses each by the end of July.As of Tuesday morning, more than 123 million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been distributed in the United States and 93.7 million shots had been administered, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-order-additional-100-million-doses-of-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-101615396639102.html
10-03-2021||World||Britain denies EU charge of 'banning' Covid-19 vaccine exports, summons diplomat||Britain denied an accusation on Wednesay by the European Union that it had banned exports of COVID-19 vaccines, and summoned an EU diplomat to complain.Britain, which quit the EU last year, has provided vaccine doses to more than a third of its population, far outpacing the 27 remaining EU members.They, in turn, have been casting blame on drug companies for failing to meet delivery targets, including AstraZeneca, which makes COVID-19 vaccines both in Britain and the EU and has declined to divert British doses to the bloc to meet a shortfall there.The EU says it has allowed millions of doses of Pfizer vaccines, which Britain does not make, to be exported there. On Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel said Britain, like the United States, had "outright" banned exports of vaccines produced on its territory.London says it has no such ban, and credits the success of its vaccine programme to strong negotiations with drug companies last year and early investment in supply chains. EU officials say London has effectively prevented exports of AstraZeneca vaccines by invoking a clause in its contract that requires the company to fulfil Britain's order first.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament he had to "correct" Michel's suggestion. His government had "not blocked the export of any single COVID-19 vaccine or vaccine components", he said.The foreign office said it had summoned EU charge d'affaires Nicole Mannion "to discuss the issue of incorrect assertions in recent EU communications".Asked whether Britain was using its AstraZeneca contract to effectively block exports, a spokesman for Johnson said: "The movement of vaccines and their components into and out of the UK is driven by contractual obligations that vaccine suppliers have to their customers."After initially saying Britain had imposed an "outright" export ban, Michel later said there were "different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines".An EU official said the bloc had allowed exports of 8 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Britain since Jan. 30, and many more earlier. Manfred Weber, head of the largest political group in the European Parliament, told Britain's foreign secretary to "stop lecturing and to show Britain's export data."The vaccine dispute comes at a time when the bloc and its former member are also quarrelling over Brexit. An EU diplomat said such verbal jousting was "the new normal"."With more economic divergence and more competition ahead, pressure on our Brexit agreements will only grow," the diplomat said.Last week, Britain unilaterally extended a grace period on checks of food arriving in Northern Ireland from other parts of the United Kingdom, required under its Brexit deal. The move is expected to prompt a legal challenge from Brussels this week, two Brussels diplomatic sources said."This was another provocation. It's not the first, and nobody expects it to be the last. The EU will keep calm and react firmly," said a second senior EU diplomat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-denies-eu-charge-of-banning-covid-19-vaccine-exports-summons-diplomat-101615395834047.html

"Instead, the regime’s focus remains on developing weapons of mass destruction and the vehicles for delivering them," he said.North Korea's mission to the UN in Geneva did not respond to Reuters' queries for comment. Pyongyang does not recognise the UN investigator's mandate and boycotted Wednesday's debate.It has previously rejected UN allegations of crimes against humanity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-major-world-powers-ignoring-north-korea-s-crimes-against-humanity-101615395433049.html

Speaking at CNN’s New Day programme, Fauci said that a boost against the “regular virus” as well as a boost against the variant is “going to be promising.”“Boost against the regular virus which will have a spillover and protect you against the variant, or specifically boost against the variant. And I think both of those are going to be promising,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN when asked about the US’ plan of giving people boosters against variants.The 80-year-old immunologist’s comment on vaccine booster comes amid concerns over the efficacy of vaccines against new variants, particularly the one first detected in South Africa. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that it is still learning about the efficacy of vaccines against coronavirus variants. In its guidelines for fully vaccinated people, the CDC warned that the vaccines may work against some variants but could be less effective against others.“We’re still learning how well Covid-19 vaccines keep people from spreading the disease. Early data show that the vaccines may help keep people from spreading Covid-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated,” the federal agency added.Fauci noted that while the antibodies induced by vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna are “quite effective” for B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the UK, the vaccine efficacy appears to be slightly diminished against B.1.351 variant first identified in a lab in South Africa. The B.1.1.7 is currently the dominant variant with its presence identified in at least 111 countries so far, followed by B.1.351 variant in 58 countries, according to the situation report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday.“While many countries worldwide are currently experiencing a decline in overall SARS-CoV-2 infections, an increased number of reports of variants have been noted in a number of countries,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-reveals-two-promising-ways-of-boosting-covid-19-vaccines-against-variants-101615395164816.html

Around 2,000 people have been arrested and at least 60 protesters have been killed since the military takeover."We have seen reports on social media about India's role in deliberations on Myanmar in the UNSC. These reports are mischievous and biased. UNSC is seized of the matter and let us wait for the outcome. India's position on the issue is well-known and has been clearly articulated," the Embassy of India in Yangon said in a tweet on Wednesday.In a February 26 statement in the General Assembly during an informal meeting on Myanmar, India had said that as a close friend and neighbour of Myanmar and its people, New Delhi "will continue to closely monitor the situation and will remain in discussion with like-minded countries so that the hopes and aspirations of the people are respected.""Restoring democratic order should be the priority of all stakeholders in Myanmar. The international community must lend its constructive support to the people of Myanmar at this critical juncture,” India had said.India had said that it remains deeply concerned that the gains made by Myanmar over the last decades on the path towards democracy, should not get undermined."As the largest democracy, we have always been steadfast in our support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar for it to emerge as a stable democratic federal union,” India had said in the UNGA meeting."We believe that the rule of law and democratic process must be upheld, those detained be released and that calm prevails. We call on the Myanmar leadership to work together to resolve their differences in a peaceful and constructive manner,” India had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biased-india-tells-unsc-on-reports-in-social-media-about-its-role-in-myanmar-101615394705172.html

10-03-2021||World||Erdogan, Putin remotely start nuclear reactor construction||The presidents of Turkey and Russia remotely inaugurated the construction of a third nuclear reactor at the Akkuyu power plant in southern Turkey Wednesday, vowing to continue their close cooperation.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the plant would launch Turkey into the ”league of nuclear energy countries” and called it a “symbol of Turkish-Russian cooperation.”Russia is building Turkey’s first nuclear power plant on the Mediterranean coast in Mersin province. The two countries signed a cooperation agreement in 2010 and began construction in 2018.Turkey — whose electricity production is based on gas-burning plants and hydroelectric units — is largely dependent on power imports, buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia, among others.Nuclear power is a “strategic step” for energy security, Erdogan said.Last summer, Turkey announced that it had discovered 405 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Black Sea, and is prospecting for hydrocarbon resources in the Eastern Mediterranean amid tensions with Greece and Cyprus over maritime rights.Energy Minister Fatih Donmez, said the Akkuyu plant would fulfill about 10% of domestic electricity needs. Erdogan said the share of locally produced and renewable energy resources has reached 63.7% in established power networks.Erdogan said the first reactor would become operational in 2023, to coincide with the centennial of the modern Turkish state. A total of four reactors are planned.Russia's Rosatom State Corporation holds a 99.2% stake in the project, whose total cost is estimated at 20 billion US dollars, according to the plant's website.The Turkish president also said cooperation between Ankara and Moscow played a “key role” in regional stability.“We have had the opportunity to see the results of Turkish-Russian dialogue in many fields, including in Libya, in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Syria,” Erdogan said. The two countries back opposing sides in these conflicts.Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at the event via video-conference Wednesday.Speaking from Moscow, Putin called the nuclear plant a “truly flagship project.”Turkey's projects for nuclear power in the earthquake-prone region have triggered concern from neighboring Greece and Cyprus — where both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot environmental groups have voiced strong opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-putin-remotely-start-nuclear-reactor-construction-101615390309019.html
10-03-2021||World||3 hours in 'hell room': Myanmar protester describes beating in custody||A protester in Myanmar who says he was detained by troops for three hours as part of the crackdown against opponents of last month's military coup has described being beaten with belts, chains, bamboo sticks and batons.In a rare first-hand account of the treatment of detained activists, the man told Reuters he was one of about 60 people picked up on Tuesday by police in Myeik, a southern coastal town, as they hid in a house after a protest was broken up by them.A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment on the man's allegations. Myeik police station did not answer its phone. The army has previously said it is dealing with protests lawfully.The man provided photographs which he said were taken by his family showing injuries on his back, neck and shoulders.Reuters has verified that the photographs were of the man and that his family had taken them. The news agency, which spoke to the man by telephone, could not verify his account.The protesters were put in a truck and handed over to troops at Myeik air base, where the men were separated from the women, photographed and taken to a room, the man said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of being detained again.Reuters was unable to reach the air base for comment."We got beaten the whole time even while we were walking to the room," he said. "The soldiers said, 'This is the hell room, why don't you guys have a taste?'"He described being told to kneel and said five of the group were told to face each other while they were beaten on their backs, heads, necks and sides. He said he was later freed along with several others without explanation. Some others were formally arrested and sent to jail.Reuters was unable to contact the jail for comment.Pyae Phyo Aung, a former student union member in Myeik who has been in touch with released protesters, told Reuters 32 people were arrested in the incident, according to a list that he helped compile for civil society groups. He said he saw another protester with injuries on his back and hip."When I met him, he couldn't even sit," Pyae Phyo Aung said. "He was lying face down because of the injuries on his hips."Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in a coup on Feb. 1 and detained her and other politicians.The military says an election in November won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was marred by fraud - a claim rejected by the national electoral commission - and has set up a junta to rule the country pending a new vote on an unspecified date.Security forces have cracked down with increasing force on daily nationwide protests, and more than 60 demonstrators have been killed and 1,900 people arrested since the coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has said.Reuters has not been able to confirm the figures independently.At least two people, both NLD officials, have died in custody since last Saturday after being arrested, according to party sources, although the reason for their deaths is not known. The military has not commented on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-hours-in-hell-room-myanmar-protester-describes-beating-in-custody-101615394098095.html

Tanzania prez who denied Covid-19 goes missing, reports say he is on ventilator||Tanzania's main opposition leader has demanded information on the health of President John Magufuli, a prominent COVID-19 sceptic whose absence from public view has brought speculation he is receiving medical treatment abroad.Tanzania's government has made no official comment.The Nation newspaper in neighbouring Kenya reported that an African leader not seen in public for nearly two weeks was being treated for COVID-19 on a ventilator at Nairobi Hospital, a private hospital in the Kenyan capital.It cited unidentified political and diplomatic sources for the report and did not identify the leader.Magufuli, a 61-year-old leader nicknamed "The Bulldozer," was last seen in public on Feb. 27 looking his normal self as he swore in a new chief secretary at State House in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam.He has been out of public view for periods in the past."The president's wellbeing is a matter of grave public concern. What's it with Magufuli that we don't deserve to know?", opposition leader Tundu Lissu said in a tweet late on Tuesday as rumours flew on Tanzanian social media."It's a sad comment on his stewardship of our country that it's come to this: that he himself had get COVID-19 and be flown out to Kenya in order to prove that prayers, steam inhalations and other unproven herbal concoctions he’s championed are no protection against coronavirus!" added Lissu, without providing evidence.On Wednesday, Lissu told Reuters that multiple sources had told him that Magufuli was in Nairobi Hospital but that there were now plans afoot to move him to India.Reuters was unable to confirm the accounts from the Nation or Lissu. Kenya's Foreign Ministry and Nairobi Hospital both said they had no information to disclose.Magufuli's director of communications Gerson Msigwa and government spokesman Hassan Abbas did not respond to Reuters messages left seeking comment.'VACCINES ARE NOT GOOD'Magufuli has played down the threat of COVID-19 in Tanzania and scoffed at global panic. He urged Tanzanians to put faith in prayer and homespun remedies such as steam inhalation rather than vaccines, which he said were dangerous and part of a Western conspiracy."Vaccines are not good. If they were, then the white man would have brought vaccines for HIV/AIDS," he said earlier this year. Last year he dismissed coronavirus testing kits, which he said had returned positive results on a goat and pawpaw fruit.Tanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it said it had 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to data held at the World Health Organization, which has called on the country to share its information.Fuelling concern about a possible hidden epidemic, a top opposition politician on Tanzania's autonomous Zanzibar archipelago, Seif Sharif Hamad, died last month of what his party said was COVID-19.Even as COVID-19 spread around Africa, Tanzanians were still allowed to gather, for example to watch sport.Magufuli was first elected in 2015 and beat Lissu to win re-election last year. He has faced accusations from Western countries and opposition parties of eroding democracy, which he denies.Magufuli has a history of heart issues, according to a senior Tanzanian medic close to the government who asked not to be identified, and a private security official in Kenya with extensive official contacts in Tanzania.

10-03-2021||World||Congress set to pass Covid rescue plan in major win for Biden||Joe Biden's enormous economic relief package is set to clear Congress Wednesday, delivering a major victory for the US president and a desperately needed cash injection to millions of families and businesses suffering during the coronavirus pandemic.The $1.9 trillion plan, months in the making, is one of the largest US rescue packages ever, and will impact every aspect of the world's biggest economy for years to come.And while Republicans appear to stand in lockstep in opposition, progressive and moderate Democrats have managed to remain united in order to get the measure to Biden's desk for his signature days before critical unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans.A vote is expected in the House of Representatives at around 1:00 pm (1800 GMT), and if the bill reaches his desk, Biden -- who made the American Rescue Plan his top legislative priority -- could sign the historic bill into law by week's end.The plan funds Covid-19 vaccines, preserves unemployment benefits for millions, sends stimulus checks of up to $1,400 to most Americans and expands federal funding for health care.It also extends eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, increases food aid and sets aside $130 billion for schools.And Democrats argue that the bill's child tax credit expansion would slash child poverty by up to 50 percent."We are going to act with the fierce urgency of now (and) we will revive the economy," Democratic caucus chairman Hakeem Jeffries said on the House floor."We will build back better for the people. Help is on the way."Republican lawmakers decry what they call the bill's "socialist agenda" and its massive cost, saying more than 90 percent does not go to directly combatting Covid-19.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the plan "a long laundry list of left-wing priorities that predate the pandemic and do not meet the needs of the American families."House conservative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully sought to derail the vote early Wednesday, called spending so much money "reckless, irresponsible and the wrong thing to do."But Americans outside Washington see it very differently.Polls show overwhelming bipartisan support among voters for the bill, which also includes extensions of rental and mortgage assistance, help for small businesses and schools, and billions of dollars for state and local governments.- 'Keep the faith' -Nevertheless, Biden is signalling that he will soon hit the road on a mission to sell the package to the American people."Keep the faith, folks," Biden tweeted Wednesday. "We will get through this."A day earlier, Biden visited a business billed as Washington's oldest hardware store, which has benefitted from the Paycheck Protection Program begun under Donald Trump's administration to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis."We're going to continue this," Biden said of the PPP as he chatted with store owner Mike Siegel.Biden's administration says it will tailor the program so that it focuses on businesses with 20 employees or fewer.The last congressional plan to fight the coronavirus, which has to date left more than 527,000 dead in the United States and brought the economy to its knees, was enacted in December.It expanded unemployment payments and extended them through March 14.That deadline has loomed as Biden and congressional Democrats crafted their latest package, but it appears they will meet it and extend the benefits until early September.Democratic leaders have hailed the American Rescue Plan as historic and transformative.Progressive Democrats had pushed for higher supplemental unemployment benefits of $400, but after a last-minute standoff with a moderate Democrat, the Senate kept the payments at $300 a week.With the bill's passage likely, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development sharply raised its 2021 global growth forecast Tuesday amid greatly improved economic prospects.OECD says it now expects the global economy to grow by 5.6 percent, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from its December forecast.And it sees the US economy climbing by 6.5 percent this year, nearly double its previous forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-set-to-pass-covid-rescue-plan-in-major-win-for-biden-101615393373628.html
10-03-2021||World||UK parliamentary committee on $32bn Covid test and trace system was ineffective||England's $32 billion test and trace system has not made a significant impact on the Covid-19 pandemic and failed its key goals despite its "unimaginable" cost, a British parliamentary committee said on Wednesday.Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year promised a world beating test and trace system as part of the route out of the pandemic.But it has taken the successful development and deployment of vaccines to let the government plot a definitive route back to normality."Despite the unimaginable resources thrown at this project, test and trace cannot point to a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic," said Meg Hillier, chair of the British parliament's Public Accounts Committee and an opposition Labour party lawmaker."The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown – has been broken, twice."The Public Accounts Committee said that test and trace had cost 23 billion pounds ($32 billion) so far but had not achieved a key goal of avoiding a cycle of national lockdowns.The system has been allocated 37 billion pounds in total to cover two years, a budget which includes the cost of testing people with symptoms and regular testing in schools, care homes and some work places.Johnson said that the system deserved credit for the proposed roadmap for reopening by the summer."It is thanks to NHS test and trace that we're able to send kids back to school and begin cautiously and irreversibly to reopen our economy and restart our lives," Johnson told parliament.Dido Harding, who runs the system, said that regular testing was "a vital tool to stop transmission" and that contact tracing made "a real impact in breaking chains of transmission", having reached more than 9.1 million cases and contacts.Last year, scientific advisers said test and trace was not significantly reducing the spread of the coronavirus. England then entered a second lockdown in the autumn.Test and trace's use of highly paid consultants, at a time when health workers face below-inflation pay rises, has attracted particular ire.The committee's report said that test and trace was overly reliant on expensive contractors. It found that in early February, the scheme was employing around 2,500 consultants from firms such as Deloitte, earning an estimate day rate of around 1,100 pounds, with some paid more than 6,500 pounds."It is concerning that the (health ministry) is still paying such amounts - which it considers to be 'very competitive rates' - to so many consultants," the report said."(Test and trace) should put in place a clear workforce plan and recruitment strategy which aim to reduce significantly, month by month, its reliance on costly consultants and temporary staff."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliamentary-committee-on-32bn-covid-test-and-trace-system-was-ineffective-101615392039838.html

Nationwide mass protests have been met with deadly force, with at least 60 people killed according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group.Jayanath Colombage, secretary to Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Reuters by phone Myanmar’s "incumbent foreign minister" had been invited because the country was a member nation of BIMSTEC and had not been removed or suspended."That doesn’t mean we have accepted the Myanmar military government," he said. "We have not taken a position on that."A spokesman for Myanmar’s junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment. The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were forcibly repressed.BIMSTEC is a grouping of nations – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand – that are dependent on the Bay of Bengal.Myanmar protesters have called on nations across the world to reject the military leadership and deal with a civilian committee set up by ousted lawmakers – the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH)."Every nation in the world needs to clearly understand that the coup in Myanmar is not complete, it's still an attempted coup," Myanmar-based activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters."So I ask Sri Lankan activists to give pressure to the Sri Lankan government not to invite the military junta because they are not the legitimate government of Myanmar," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lanka-denies-endorsing-myanmar-coup-as-junta-representative-invited-for-meet-101615391852348.html

10-03-2021||World||South Korea agrees to pay more for hosting US troops in 2021||Striking a delicate balance, the United States and South Korea have agreed Seoul will pay 13.9% more this year for hosting American troops as part of a multiyear deal crafted to keep Seoul's share of the overall cost within historical norms, officials said Wednesday.The deal, which had been announced earlier this week but without financial details, ends a long stalemate that had strained relations between allies after the Trump administration demanded a five-fold increase in Seoul's contributions.President Joe Biden's willingness to quickly accept smaller increases is cast by the State Department as evidence that the Biden administration wants to repair relations with key allies in East Asia as it focuses on regional unity in confronting China and North Korea.The State Department announced Wednesday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Tokyo and Seoul next week for security consultations to “reaffirm the United States’ commitment to strengthening our alliances.” Blinken will be joined in both meetings by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also will visit India.American and South Korean officials, in separate briefings for reporters in Washington and Seoul, said the 13.9% increase will apply to the South Korean government's payments this year. In each of the following four years, the increase will match increases in Seoul's national defense budget.The previous agreement had expired at the end of 2019; the new deal covers 2020 retroactively by keeping South Korea's payment the same as 2019 at about 1.04 trillion Korean won, or the equivalent of about $910 million at current exchange rates. For this year, Seoul agreed to pay 1.18 trillion won, or about $1 billion. That is a 13.9% increase, which a State Department official said is the largest since 2004.Overall, South Korea will be paying about 44% of the overall cost of having American troops based on the peninsula, not counting US military and civilian salaries. The State Department said that is similar to Seoul's share over many years. The US has about 28,500 troops in South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-agrees-to-pay-more-for-hosting-us-troops-in-2021-101615388901011.html
10-03-2021||World||India, South Africa lock horns with West over bid to waive Covid-19 vaccine patents||A push to increase production of Covid-19 vaccines for poor nations hung in the balance at the World Trade Organization on Wednesday amid disagreement between richer and developing countries over the issue of patent rights.South Africa and India planned to renew their bid at a two-day meeting to waive rules of the WTO's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement, a move that would allow generic or other manufacturers to make more vaccines.Their proposal is backed by dozens of largely developing countries at the WTO, but opposed by Western countries including Britain, Switzerland, EU nations and the United States, which have large domestic pharmaceutical industries.Proposals need backing by a consensus of the WTO's 164 members to pass.The issue was set to come up at the WTO's TRIPS Council on Wednesday afternoon. Members would then hold an eighth discussion on the topic since it was first raised in October.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who became WTO director-general on March 1, called the intensifying TRIPS discussions "vitally important", but said governments and businesses needed to act now to increase production, especially in emerging markets.She said in a speech on Tuesday that manufacturers should come together with bodies such as the World Health Organization and vaccines alliance GAVI, whose board she used to chair, and business associations to look into options."We must make sure that in the end we deliver so that the millions of people who are waiting for us with bated breath know that we are working on concrete solutions," the former Nigerian finance and foreign minister said.The next TRIPS Council meeting is set for June 8-9, but the group will probably be convened again to discuss vaccines before then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-south-africa-lock-horns-with-west-over-bid-to-waive-covid-vaccine-patents-101615388887012.html
10-03-2021||World||Meghan Markle filed formal complaint about UK TV host Piers Morgan comments||Meghan Markle filed a formal complaint with British broadcaster ITV, after a presenter criticised her claims against the royal family and later quit.Piers Morgan left his role as host of Good Morning Britain on Tuesday following a scathing attack on the Duchess of Sussex's interview with US chatshow host Oprah Winfrey.She and her husband, Prince Harry, accused the royal family of racism, while the former television actress said she had suicidal thoughts during her time in Britain.Former CNN host Morgan's comments that he did not believe her sparked 41,000 complaints to Britain's broadcasting regulator Ofcom.Britain's domestic Press Association news agency said it understood Meghan formally complained to ITV before he resigned, confirming a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.The complaint focused on how his remarks may affect those trying to deal with their own mental health problems, it added.It did not concern his repeated criticism of her or allegations of racism, which have rocked the monarchy.Morgan, a former tabloid newspaper editor, has been a consistent critic of Markle after she cut off contact with him after she met Harry and they married in 2018.On Tuesday, Morgan stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain as he clashed with a fellow presenter who defended the duchess.In a tweet as the programme aired on Wednesday, Morgan said he stood by his remarks and said he would fight for freedom of speech."On Monday, I said I didn't believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I've had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don't," he wrote.Buckingham Palace on Tuesday responded to the explosive claims.Queen Elizabeth II said Meghan and Harry, who quit royal life last year, and their son Archie would remain "much-loved family members".But she also said the accusations would be dealt with "privately".Asked to respond to Buckingham Palace's statement, a spokesman for Meghan and Harry said they would not be commenting any further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-filed-formal-complaint-about-uk-tv-host-piers-morgan-comments-101615385755206.html

"I don't know, I haven't seen it. Isn't it something the prime minister should know first?"In the live briefing, Prayuth then left the podium, grabbed a small bottle of sanitiser, casually walked over to the journalists and sprayed each of them while holding a surgical mask in front of his face.Prayuth, a former military coup leader, is known for his casual, at times comical, remarks to media but he often lashes out at reporters.He was later filmed speaking with the same group of journalists and looking increasingly vexed, talking inaudibly while spraying them with broad sweeps of his hand before walking off again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irked-thai-pm-sprays-hand-sanitiser-on-reporters-to-duck-tricky-questions-101615384985995.html
10-03-2021||World||FBI releases new video of bombs left at RNC, DNC offices before Capitol riot||The FBI has released new video showing someone placing two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees the night before the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol.The explosive devices were placed outside the two buildings between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5 and were located by law enforcement the next day.US Capitol Police and agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were called to the Republican National Committee’s office around 12:45 p.m. on Jan. 6. About 30 minutes later, as the agents and bomb technicians were still investigating at the RNC, another call came in for a similar explosive device found at the Democratic National Committee headquarters nearby. The bombs were rendered safe, and no one was hurt.The video, released Tuesday, shows a person in a gray hooded sweatshirt, a face mask and gloves appearing to place one of the explosives under a bench outside the DNC and separately shows the person walking in an alley near RNC before the bomb was placed there. The person also wore black and light grey Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers with a yellow logo.It is unclear whether the bombs were related to planning for the insurrection — when thousands of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden's presidential election win — or whether they were unrelated to the deadly riot. Both buildings are within a few blocks of the Capitol.The pipe bomb suspect carried the explosives in a backpack, according to Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington office. The bombs were made of threaded galvanized pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder, he said.Federal agents hope the new video will spark additional tips to help identify the person. A $100,000 reward is being offered in the case.“We are asking for you to come forward and speak to us about any odd or out-of-character behaviors,” D’Antuono said in a video statement released by the FBI.The placement of the pipe bombs has been particularly concerning for law enforcement as officials continue to secure the Capitol and the number of threats against lawmakers remains high. For weeks, investigators have been worried about the potential for attacks on soft targets in the nation’s capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-releases-new-video-of-bombs-left-at-rnc-dnc-offices-before-capitol-riot-101615383162026.html
10-03-2021||World||Malaysian court rules non-Muslims can use 'Allah' ending a 35-year old govt ban||A Malaysian court ruled Wednesday that non-Muslims can use the word “Allah” to refer to God, in a major decision in a divisive issue for religious freedom in the Muslim-majority country.The High Court decision squashed a 35-year-old government ban on the usage of Allah and three other Arabic words by Christian publications, deeming the ban unconstitutional, said the plaintiff's lawyer, Annou Xavier.The government has previously said Allah should be reserved exclusively for Muslims to avoid confusion that could lead them to convert to other religions, a stance that is unique to Malaysia and hasn't been an issue in other Muslim-majority nations with sizeable Christian minorities.Christian leaders in Malaysia say the ban is unreasonable because Christians who speak the Malay language have long used Allah, a Malay word derived from Arabic, in their Bibles, prayers and songs.The high court ruling appeared to contradict an earlier decision by the country’s Federal Court in 2014 that upheld the government ban following a legal challenge by the Roman Catholic Church, which had used the word Allah in its Malay-language newsletter.“The court has now said the word Allah can be used by all Malaysians,” Xavier said. “Today’s decision entrenches the fundamental freedom of religious rights for non-Muslims in Malaysia" enshrined in the constitution, he added.Muslims account for about two-thirds of Malaysia's 32 million people, with large ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities. Christians comprise about 10% of the population.Most Christians in Malaysia worship in English, Tamil or various Chinese dialects, and refer to God in those languages, but some Malay-speaking people on the island of Borneo have no other word for God but Allah.Three other words — “kaabah" or Islam's holiest shrine in Mecca, “baitullah" or house of God, and “solat" or prayer, were also banned in the 1986 government directive.Government counsel Shamsul Bolhassan was quoted by The Star newspaper as saying that the four words can be used in Christian materials according to the court's ruling, as long as there is a disclaimer saying it is intended for Christians only and a symbol of a cross is displayed.The ruling was a result of a long legal challenge by a Christian woman whose religious materials containing the word Allah were seized by authorities at the airport when she returned home from Indonesia in 2008.The controversy over the usage of Allah has provoked violence in Malaysia. Anger over a lower court ruling against the government ban in 2009 led to a string of arson attacks and vandalism at churches and other places of worship. That ruling was subsequently overturned by higher courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-court-rules-non-muslims-can-use-allah-ending-a-35-year-old-govt-ban-101615383324419.html
10-03-2021||World||US narrows in on organized extremists in Capitol siege probe||As members of the Oath Keepers paramilitary group shouldered their way through the mob and up the steps to the U.S. Capitol, their plans for Jan. 6 were clear, authorities say. “Arrest this assembly, we have probable cause for acts of treason, election fraud,” someone commanded over an encrypted messaging app some extremists used to communicate during the siege.A little while earlier, Proud Boys carrying two-way radios and wearing earpieces spread out and tried to blend in with the crowd as they invaded the Capitol led by a man assigned “war powers” to oversee the group’s attack, prosecutors say.These two extremist groups that traveled to Washington along with thousands of other Trump supporters weren’t whipped into an impulsive frenzy by President Donald Trump that day, officials say. They’d been laying attack plans. And their internal communications and other evidence emerging in court papers and in hearings show how authorities are trying to build a case that small cells hidden within the masses mounted an organized, military-style assault on the heart of American democracy.“This was not simply a march. This was an incredible attack on our institutions of government,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason McCullough said during a recent hearing.The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers make up a fraction of the more than 300 Trump supporters charged so far in the siege that led to Trump’s second impeachment and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer. But several of their leaders, members and associates have become the central targets of the Justice Department’s sprawling investigation.It could mean more serious criminal charges for some rioters. On the other hand, mounting evidence of advance planning could also fuel Trump's and his supporters’ claims that the Republican former president did not incite the riot and therefore should not be liable for it.Defense attorneys have accused prosecutors of distorting their clients’ words and actions to falsely portray the attack as a premeditated, orchestrated insurrection instead of a spontaneous outpouring of election-fueled rage to stop Congress’ certification of Trump’s defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.And prosecutors’ case against a man described as a leader in the Proud Boys’ attack took a hit last week when a judge ordered him released while he awaits trial, calling some of the evidence against him “weak to say the least.”The Oath Keepers began readying for violence as early as November, authorities say. Communications show the group discussing logistics, weapons and training, including “2 days of wargames.”“I need you fighting fit” by the inauguration, one Ohio member, Jessica Watkins, told a recruit in November, according to court documents. “If Biden becomes president our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights,” she said in another message later that month.As the mob swarmed the Capitol, Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, was communicating with some of the alleged rioters.“All I see Trump doing is complaining. I see no intent by him to do anything. So the patriots are taking it into their own hands. They’ve had enough,” he said in a Signal message to a group around 1:40 p.m., authorities say. A little later, Rhodes, who has not been charged in the attack, instructed the group to “come to South Side of Capitol on steps.”Around 2:40 p.m., members of a military-style “stack” who moved up Capitol stairs in a line entered the building through a door on the east side, authorities say. Lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence had been evacuated from the House and Senate chambers just about 20 minutes earlier.“We are in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it. They are throwing grenades, they are fricking shooting people with paint balls. But we are in here,” Watkins declared over a channel called Stop the Steal J6 on the walkie-talkie app Zello, prosecutors say.The Proud Boys met at the Washington Monument and were already at the Capitol before Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House. Listening to the president’s speech wasn’t part of their plan, prosecutors say.Ethan Nordean led the way with a bullhorn while they wore headgear marked with orange tape. Dominic Pezzola appeared to have an earpiece in his right ear. Joseph Biggs had what looked like a walkie-talkie device on his chest.Nordean was spotted having a brief exchange near the Capitol with Robert Gieswein, a bat-wielding Colorado man. Proud Boys planning for Jan. 6 had discussed using non-members, or “normies,” like Gieswein to “burn that city to ash” and “smash some pigs to dust,” prosecutors said.Nine people linked to the Oath Keepers have been indicted on charges that they planned and coordinated with one another in the siege. At least 11 leaders, members or associates of the Proud Boys charged in the riots are accused by the Justice Department of participating in a coordinated attack.Several from both groups remain in federal custody while awaiting trial.In testimony to Congress, the acting Capitol Police chief said officers had worked to intercept “the radio frequency used by some demonstration groups and monitoring the communications of those groups,” though it's unclear if those groups included the Proud Boys or the Oath Keepers.Their defense attorneys claim prosecutors have painted a misleading account of the day’s events based on shaky evidence. Other lawyers for those charged with storming the Capitol have tried to pin the blame on Trump for inciting the rioters.Nordean’s lawyers said prosecutors haven’t presented any evidence that he used encrypted communications to lead a group’s attack on the Capitol.“The government has made repeated claims about Ethan’s activities and then backed away from them without providing any support,” said one of his attorneys, Nicholas Smith.___Richer reported from Boston and Kunzelman reported from College Park, Maryland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-narrows-in-on-organized-extremists-in-capitol-siege-probe-101615376056348.html
10-03-2021||World||Post-Brexit tensions: UK says EU damaged vaccine programme, affects Britons||The UK accused senior European Union politicians of damaging its vaccination program by making “misleading” statements that cast doubt on the AstraZeneca shot, in an escalation of post-Brexit tensions between the two sides.Cabinet minister Grant Shapps said fewer British people had taken up the offer of shots in the UK after EU figures questioned the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine, a clear reference to remarks from French President Emmanuel Macron, among others.Shapps’s intervention risks stoking an already heated row over vaccine nationalism and further souring the atmosphere between the EU and its former member state, who are in a separate dispute over Brexit trade rules that could end up in legal action.The latest chapter in the increasingly acrimonious new relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday, when the British government reacted with dismay to comments from European Council President Charles Michel, who accused London of putting an outright ban on exports of coronavirus vaccines.The British side fiercely denied this, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab writing a letter of protest to Michel and summoning a senior EU diplomat in London for an urgent meeting.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson weighed into the row, saying he wanted to “correct” Michel.“Let me be clear, we have not blocked the export of a single vaccine or vaccine component,” he said in his regular weekly appearance in the UK Parliament. “We oppose vaccine nationalism in all its forms.”European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer refused to comment directly on Michel’s remarks when asked by reporters in Brussels.“We know that different countries have got different measures in place -- this doesn’t concern vaccines, as far as we understand, coming from the UK,” he said. “But we know as well that we, the EU, are a very, very active exporter of vaccines and this is not necessarily the case of all our partners.”During broadcast interviews on Wednesday morning, Shapps, the transport minister, said he presumed Michel had “just a mistake” or didn’t have the right information.“Unfortunately, there’s been a number of different statements made out of Europe, including misleading information on the effectiveness of some of these vaccines, which eventually have been unwound, but not until they’ve done damage to the number of people, the uptake on some of the vaccines, which I think is all very unfortunate,” Shapps told Times Radio.“We just need to get on and vaccinate people,” Shapps said. “We want the rest of the world to vaccinate as well.”At the end of January, President Emmanuel Macron raised doubts about the Astra vaccine’s benefits for the elderly, saying it was “almost ineffective” for those 65 and older. France subsequently endorsed the AstraZeneca vaccine for elderly people to use.In a newsletter published Tuesday, Michel said he was “shocked” by accusations of “vaccine nationalism” against the EU. “The facts do not lie,” he wrote. “The UK and the U.S. have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory.”‘Completely false’Raab hit back in a letter to Michel, saying the claim is “completely false,” according to a person familiar with the matter. “The UK government has not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components,” Raab wrote.Michel appeared to row back later Tuesday, writing on Twitter that he was “glad if the UK reaction leads to more transparency and increased exports.”The spat marks an escalation in tensions between the two sides since Britain completed its departure from the bloc in December.Johnson is facing a legal challenge from the bloc after unilaterally announcing he will not introduce export documents on food crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland from April 1, as previously agreed.European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic outlined details of the action to EU ambassadors meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. Measures could include imposing penalties on the UK that include trade tariffs, an EU official said.Vaccines have become a flashpoint in the relationship as the EU’s program -- dogged by delays -- has struggled to keep pace with the British. About a third of the UK population has received a dose, compared with 6% in the EU, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.In January, the EU briefly threatened to control the flow of vaccines into Northern Ireland, and thus the UK, by using an emergency clause in the Brexit agreement. In doing so, the bloc reopened one of the most sensitive disputes in the entire divorce: how to avoid the return of full customs checks on the island of Ireland.On Monday, Johnson called the tensions “teething problems” which could be “ironed out” with “goodwill and imagination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/postbrexit-tensions-uk-says-eu-damaged-vaccine-programme-affects-britons-101615381591544.html
10-03-2021||World||Russia slows down Twitter, part of social media clampdown||Russian authorities said Wednesday they are slowing down the speed of uploading photos and videos to Twitter over its failure to remove banned content — part of growing efforts to clamp down on social media platforms that have played a major role in amplifying dissent.The state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, said it began the slowdown after it said the platform failed to remove the content encouraging suicide among children and containing information about drugs and child pornography.The agency warned that if Twitter refuses to abide by Russian law it could be blocked entirely, but voiced hope that the platform would “take a constructive stance” and comply with the demand to remove the banned content. Vadim Subbotin, deputy chief of Roskomnadzor, said in televised remarks that Twitter is the only social platform that has “openly ignored the Russian authorities’ demand to remove the banned content.”Twitter’s user policies outline a host of banned behaviors, including prohibiting content that involves child sexual exploitation or material that promotes or encourages suicide or self harm. An email seeking comment on the Russian action was sent to Twitter.The action against Twitter comes as the authorities have criticized social media platforms that have been used to bring tens of thousands of people into the streets across Russia this year to demand the release of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The wave of demonstrations served as a major challenge to the Kremlin.Russian authorities have assailed the platforms for failing to remove calls for children to join opposition protests — which is against the law in Russia.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the government has “no desire to block anything,” but added that it was necessary to enforce compliance with the law.The move against Twitter is part of continuous efforts by the government to tighten control over social platforms.In 2014, the authorities adopted a law requiring online services to store the personal data of Russian users on servers in Russia and have since tried to make Facebook and Twitter to comply with it. Both companies have been repeatedly fined, first small amounts of around $50 and last year the equivalent of $63,000 each, for not complying.The government has stopped short of outright bans even though the law allows it, probably fearing that the move would elicit too much public outrage. Only the social network LinkedIn, which wasn’t very popular in Russia, has been banned by the authorities for the failure to store user data in Russia.As the Russian authorities moved Wednesday to slow down Twitter, some Russian government websites suffered outages and access problems. It's not clear if those are connected, and some experts suggested they could have been the result of unrelated cyberattacks.Russia's Ministry of Digital Development acknowledged that some government websites suffered outages, but charged that they were linked to equipment problems at communications provider Rostelecom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slows-down-twitter-part-of-social-media-clampdown-101615381777070.html
10-03-2021||World||'Ticket to recovery': Australia to offer subsidised flights to support tourism||Australia will subsidise 800,000 domestic flights, help its two main airlines and offer cheap loans to small tourism operators as part of A$1.2 billion ($921 million) package to revive the travel sector, Prime Minister Scott Morrison will say on Thursday.Tourism is one of Australia's biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion and employing about 5% of the country's workforce. But the sector was crippled when the country shut its international borders in March 2020 to curtail the spread of Covid-19 - leaving tens of thousands of people on the country's wage-subsidy scheme.Seeking to prop up the industry when the subsidy scheme ends this month, Morrison will pledge another stimulus package for the travel sector, according to extracts of an announcement seen by Reuters. Morrison will say Australia will subsidise the flights of 800,000 domestic flights between Apr. 1 and July 31 while its international borders remain closed. It will pay 50% of the cost of flying to 13 destinations, he will say. Airlines have agreed to provide additional flights to those places."This is our ticket to recovery - 800,000 half-price air fares to get Australians travelling," Morrison will say. The premier will also say that his government will provide financial support to Qantas and Virgin Airways between Apr. 1 and Oct. 31 - when international flights are expected to resume.Morrison did not disclose the scale of the funds, which will be used to keep 8,600 workers employed, planes in "flight-ready condition" and international passenger services at a pre-pandemic levels.Australia will also offer loans of up to A$5 million to tourism businesses such as tour companies, with two-year repayment holidays, the prime minister will say."We need Australians to do their patriotic duty and book a holiday this year," trade minister Dan Tehan will say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ticket-to-recovery-australia-to-offer-subsidised-flights-to-support-tourism-101615376666324.html

10-03-2021||World||Iranian oil shipments clogs up Chinese ports despite US sanctions||China is gorging Iranian oil even as other nations wait for US President Joe Biden to remove sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Crude shipments from Iran to the province of Shandong, home to a quarter of China’s refining capacity, have surged so much this month they’re causing congestion at ports and filling up storage tanks, according to traders and analysts.Chinese imports of Iranian crude will hit 856,000 barrels a day in March, the most in almost two years and up 129% from last month, said Kevin Wright, a Singapore-based analyst with Kpler. His figures take into account oil that’s undergone ship-to-ship transfers in the Middle East or in waters off Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to obscure their origin.Most refiners and traders are reluctant to purchase Iranian crude for fear of repercussions that can include being cut off from the American banking system and having cargoes seized by the US. Tehran has used aggressive marketing as it tries to increase export income and boost an economy reeling from the sanctions.The waiting time for tankers looking to offload in Shandong was estimated at 12 days last week, compared with eight the week before, according to Kpler. Oil inventory levels at ports in the province climbed to a one-year high last month, data from SCI99 showed.Big discountIranian cargoes are heavily discounted due to the sanctions putting off most buyers around the world. In China, their price is usually between $3 and $5 barrel below benchmark Brent crude, according to traders, who say it’s prompting local companies to stock up as global prices rise.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen since Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled the US out of a nuclear accord with Iran in mid-2018 and tightened sanctions. Iran’s oil exports have cratered since them from around 2.5 million barrels a day. It still produces roughly 2 million barrels a day, but most of those are used domestically.Frictions have remained high since Biden came to power in January. Still, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this week said his country was ready to revert to full or partial compliance with the nuclear deal if the US did the same. His government has repeatedly said the Americans should lift the sanctions before the two sides start talks.Oil surgeBrent prices have leapt since November to more than $65 a barrel as major economies roll-out coronavirus vaccines. They briefly topped $71 a barrel this week after a drone and missile attack on Saudi Arabia’s largest oil export terminal, which the kingdom blamed on Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebel group.The rise in prices has caused importers such as India to call on the OPEC+ cartel of exporters to increase production.In China, fuel consumption has already recovered to pre-pandemic levels. It’s continuing to grow on the back of strong factory activity and infrastructure building that left the capital, Beijing, blanketed in smog this week.China’s imports of crude oil climbed to an average of 11.1 million barrels a day in January and February, up more than 20% from December, according to Bloomberg calculations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-oil-shipments-clogs-up-chinese-ports-despite-us-sanctions-101615380193438.html
10-03-2021||World||Elon Musk makes a new record adds $25 billion in one day, closes gap with Bezos||Elon Musk just hit a new milestone: He made a record $25 billion in one day.Tesla Inc.’s 20% jump on Tuesday -- its biggest in more than a year -- pushed the billionaire founder’s fortune to $174 billion, closing the gap with Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The top 10 largest wealth gainers, all from the tech industry, added $54 billion combined.After three weeks of declines that sent the Nasdaq 100 Index down 11% from a peak, US tech shares staged a stellar rally on Tuesday that lifted almost all of the gauge’s members. The surge in Bezos’s Amazon.com Inc. helped him gain $6 billion, taking his net worth to $180 billion, while Colin Huang of Chinese online shopping platform Pinduoduo Inc. added almost as much.Musk and Bezos have been battling for the top spot on the Bloomberg wealth index since the Tesla founder took over in January, the month his fortune hit $210 billion. Since then, Bezos regained the title of world’s richest as shares of the electric-car maker sank as much as 36%. Now the two tycoons are less than $6 billion apart.On Tuesday, Tesla also benefited from an upgrade by New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who recommended buying the stock, and a rally in Bitcoin.The gains contrast with the remarkable fall of China’s bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan, who in December unseated India’s Mukesh Ambani as Asia’s richest person and surpassed Warren Buffett in January, becoming the sixth-wealthiest in the world. Zhong is now the biggest loser of the year and has dropped off the list of the top 15 on the Bloomberg ranking. Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma is back to being China’s richest, with a fortune of almost $64 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-makes-a-new-record-adds-25-billion-in-one-day-101615379331736.html
10-03-2021||World||US Covid-19 drive fails to reach outs to Black, Hispanic Americans||It’s a life-threatening problem that’s been long predicted - but that few in the government or private sectors have yet done much to solve. Now the consequences are hitting some of America’s most vulnerable communities.America’s Covid-19 vaccine drive is failing to reach Black and Hispanic communities, despite pervasive warnings about their lack of healthcare access and heightened vaccine hesitancy, rooted in distrust of the government and historical episodes of medical exploitation.The issue has been highlighted by polls and government focus groups since last summer. But there’s been no comprehensive national effort to address the problem from the federal government or major philanthropists, leaving a patchwork of underfunded local activists struggling to fill the void, according to Reuters interviews with fifteen nonprofits and philanthropic groups.The results of inaction are stark: While US communities of color are at higher risk for severe or fatal Covid-19 infections, white people have been vaccinated at twice the rate of Blacks and two-and-a-half times the rate of Hispanics, according to a March 1 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation.“We need to get out there and start connecting with people before it’s too late,” said Betsy MacLean, who runs the urban planning nonprofit Hester Street.Grassroots organizers in Black and Hispanic communities have struggled to secure private or public funding for outreach efforts to promote vaccination. Advocates focused on the issue say philanthropists are juggling competing priorities and tend to view such crisis response as largely the government’s job. The federal government, under the new administration of Democratic President Joe Biden, is only now getting started on serious efforts to promote vaccination in minority communities.What’s needed, the advocates say, is a nationally coordinated marketing campaign, combined with critical efforts at personal outreach by respected local influencers in communities of color. An effective effort, they said, could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Some community groups are seeking to revive a nationwide network of nonprofits that helped boost response rates to the 2020 Census in minority communities, saying a similar strategy could work to promote vaccination.The Biden administration announced Monday that it would spend $250 million to “encourage Covid-19 safety and vaccination among underserved populations,” which could include minority communities but also other vulnerable groups, such as rural residents. Localities will have to apply for that money; grants would finance 30 urban projects and 43 rural projects, according to an administration news release.The administration also plans to use money from its proposed Covid-19 stimulus package to promote vaccination, in minority communities and others, but the specifics of that effort remain unclear. The White House plans to partner with local officials and nonprofits to overcome government distrust, said Dr. Cameron Webb, the White House’s senior policy adviser for Covid-19 equity.Roots of distrustA Reuters/Ipsos poll in December showed Black people, in particular, were far more likely to fear vaccination than white people. Their skepticism stems in part from historical traumas such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, when government researchers left hundreds of Black men untreated for the disease to study its effects. Many Hispanic communities are fearful of interacting with the government in an era of widespread anti-immigration sentiment. Both communities have less access to medical care than white populations.Some nonprofits are pushing for funding to reactivate the network that successfully encouraged people in minority communities to fill out the 2020 Census - another federal initiative dogged by fear and distrust.In that effort, hundreds of grassroots groups knocked on doors and held information sessions to dispel fears. They recruited pastors, school teachers and other trusted locals to push the message. A similar model could work for vaccines, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy expert who ran a census outreach effort in southern California.“Just like you had census hesitancy and equity issues, you have vaccine hesitancy and equity issues,” said Ramakrishnan, who now leads a nonprofit devoted to leveraging census infrastructure for future initiatives, including vaccines.The White House acknowledged the parallels between vaccine and census outreach, but stopped short of committing to finance similar NGO-led efforts to boost vaccine trust.“We’re talking about how we can dovetail from the work that was done on the census, not just to learn from it, but also tap into the same human resources and networks,” Webb said.Rosyo Ramirez, deputy public health director for the heavily Hispanic Imperial County, California, said local nonprofit groups could play a key role in raising vaccination rates because they have deep ties in minority communities. “People need to feel comfortable with who the message is coming from,” Ramirez said.Ramakrishnan has held Zoom meetings with nonprofits and philanthropic groups, pitching them on a centralized campaign, modeled on the census efforts. But reactivating that network for vaccine education is “not as simple as snapping your fingers,” said Megan Thomas, interim president of the San Diego-based funders’ coalition Catalyst.The census effort’s financiers had years to plan and fine-tune the census push, whereas the pandemic came as an unexpected and fast-moving crisis - one that Thomas said the government might be better equipped to handle.Hester Street’s MacLean reached out in February to the New York Community Trust, a key donor to her work on census outreach, urging it to revive “the amazing social infrastructure we all built out for the Census for vaccines!”Patricia Swann, who approved MacLean’s census grant, said she was “agnostic” on the new request - not because she doesn’t support the work, but because she is not in charge of the Trust’s public health initiatives. She said she planned to pass MacLean’s request on to a colleague in another department.“The foundation world, unfortunately, is very siloed,” Swann said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-drive-fails-to-reach-outs-to-black-hispanic-americans-101615378244695.html
10-03-2021||World||European parliament to debate on declaring 27 member bloc an LGBT 'freedom zone'||The European Parliament is scheduled to debate a resolution on Wednesday that would declare the entire 27-member European Union to be a “freedom zone” for LGBT people.The resolution comes largely in reaction to developments over the past two years in Poland, where many local communities have adopted largely symbolic resolutions declaring themselves to be free of what Polish conservative authorities have been calling “LGBT ideology.”The towns say they are only seeking to defend their traditional Catholic values, but LGBT rights activists say they are discriminatory and make gays and lesbians feel unwelcome. The areas have come to be colloquially known as “LGBT-free zones.”But the resolution also stresses that it wants to address problems across the bloc faced by gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender, intersex and queer people.The resolution says the fundamental rights of LGBT people have been “severely hindered” recently in Hungary due to a de facto ban on legal gender recognition for trans and intersex people. It cites problems in Latvia, and notes that only two member states — Malta and Germany — have banned “conversion therapy,” a controversial and potentially harmful attempt to change a person's sexual orientation.The resolution is the work of the a cross-party group in the European Parliament, the LGBTI Intergroup, which says it has the support to pass the largely symbolic resolution.Liesje Schreinemacher, the vice chair of the group and a Dutch lawmaker with Renew Europe, a liberal political group, said the resolution is timed to roughly mark the second anniversary of the first Polish community, Swidnik County, passing an anti-LGBT resolution.Also read: Sydney's LGBTQI Mardi Gras goes ahead, with Covid restrictionsShe also referred to problems elsewhere, including suspicious that a man murdered in Belgium recently was the victim of a homophobic attack.“We wanted to send a strong signal in Poland that we consider all of Europe to be an LGBTI freedom zone,” she told The Associated Press. “But every European country has work to do.”Dozens of local governments across conservative eastern and southern Poland began in March 2019 to pass either resolutions declaring themselves to be free from “LGBT ideology” or family charters defending traditional families in the mostly Catholic nations.They have proven hugely costly to Poland's international image, and to the finances of local communities. The EU and Norway — a non-EU member that funds some development in EU nations — have cut off funds to policies they view as discriminatory.Bart Staszewski, a Polish activist who created an art project on the “LGBT zones” that drew the ire of the government and conservatives, said he sees the EU resolution as “important and necessary.”But he also notes that local governments stopped passing such resolutions months ago and some communities have already withdrawn theirs. Others have passed resolutions declaring support for all types of familes.“There is some very good change,” Staszewski said. “I see this as a very good sign for the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-parliament-to-debate-on-declaring-27-member-bloc-an-lgbt-freedom-zone-101615372969796.html
10-03-2021||World||UN urges Houthis to give African migrants access to Yemeni capital||The UN migration agency has urged rebels who control the Yemeni capital Sanaa to provide access to dozens of African migrants who were seriously injured in a weekend hostel fire.The Sunday blaze at an overcrowded holding facility in Sanaa killed an unconfirmed number of migrants and injured more than 170, over half of them seriously, the International Organization for Migration said."As many migrants are in a critical condition, meeting their health needs must be an urgent priority," IOM Middle East and North Africa director Carmela Godeau said in a statement Tuesday."We are facing challenges accessing the injured due to an increased security presence in the hospitals," she said."Humanitarians and health workers must be given access to support the treatment of those affected by the fire."There has still been no word from the Huthi rebel authorities on what caused Sunday's fire or how many people it killed.Also read: 16 million Yemenis going hungry, 5 million on the brink of famine: UN aid chiefThe IOM said more than 350 migrants, most of them from Ethiopia, were in a hangar area where the fire broke out."While the cause of the fire is still unconfirmed, its impact is clearly horrific," said Godeau.Despite more than six years of devastating conflict in Yemen that have created what the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, the impoverished country is still a magnet for migrants from the nearby Horn to Africa seeking a better life in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.Restrictions on movement imposed during the coronavirus pandemic have led to a reduction in migrant arrivals from more than 138,000 in 2019 to just over 37,500 in 2020.But they have also led to "thousands of migrants becoming stranded with little access to basic services or protection," the IOM said.It said it was working with Ethiopian authorities to restart a voluntary repatriation programme for stranded migrants.More than 6,000 have registered to return home from Yemen's government-held second city Aden, of whom a first 1,100 are are expected to leave in the coming weeks, the IOM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-urges-houthis-to-give-african-migrants-access-to-yemeni-capital-101615367963360.html

As its border disputes with China have not been settled, anti-China voices in India still remain a force. The Modi administration intends to divert attention from its domestic contradictions by underlining China’s threat,” Yuan claimed in the opinion piece.Media reports from New Delhi on US defence secretary Lloyd Austin’s likely visit to India in mid-March also has been closely followed in China.Yang Xiyu from the China Institute of International Studies told state media that Washington and New Delhi always have their own interests in their minds.“The US wants to seize India as weight to retake its hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region and counter China; and India plans to showcase its cooperation with the US to bluff China regarding its influence,” Yang added.State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had called it the “so-called Indo-Pacific new Nato”.Wang was quoted in a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry as saying that the “Indo-Pacific strategy” proposed by the US is in essence aimed at building a so-called Indo-Pacific “new Nato” underpinned by the quadrilateral mechanism involving the United States, Japan, India and Australia.“The strategy is to trumpet the old-fashioned Cold War mentality to stir up confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition, in a bid to maintain the dominance and hegemonic system of the United States,” Wang was quoted as saying during a visit to Malaysia last October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uphold-peace-not-the-opposite-china-tells-quad-members-ahead-of-summit-101615378228915.html
10-03-2021||World||Myanmar police raids railway workers' homes in Mingalar Taung Nyunt area||Myanmar security forces early Wednesday raided a neighbourhood in the country's largest city that is home to state railway workers who have gone on strike to protest last month's military coup.Police sealed off the Mingalar Taung Nyunt neighbourhood in Yangon where the Ma Hlwa Kone train station and housing for railway workers are located. Photos and video on social media showed officers blocking streets and what was said to be people escaping. At least three arrests were reported but it was not immediately possible to independently confirm that.The raid comes just days after several Myanmar unions, including the Myanmar Railway Worker's Union Federation, issued a joint call for a nationwide work stoppage. The statement said the strike would be part of a broader effort for “the full, extended shutdown of the Myanmar economy.”Myanmar has been roiled by protests and other acts of civil disobedience since the Feb. 1 coup that toppled elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi's government just as it was to start its second term. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.Also read: Google to review advertisements for Myanmar military-backed telecoms firmSecurity forces have responded with mass arrests and at times lethal force. At least 60 protesters have been killed since the military takeover, according to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.Authorities have also moved to shut down independent reporting on the situation, both through arrests of journalists the closure of media outlets.Despite the increasingly violent tactics of security forces, protests continued Wednesday in cities and towns across the country, including Yangon, Mandalay, Monywa, Dawei and Myitkyina.State railway workers were among the earliest organized supporters of the protest movement and their strike began soon after the coup.Police last month made an effort at intimidating railway workers in Mandalay, the country's second-biggest city, by roaming through their housing area one night, shouting and randomly firing guns.The junta now in control of the country, formally called the State Administration Council, indirectly acknowledged the effectiveness of the rail strike.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper in a Tuesday report on a junta meeting, cited officials as saying that rail transport between Yangon-Mandalay would resume “in the near future.” It also acknowledged that the banking sector has been affected by the protest movement.The dawn raid on the railway workers followed another night of intimidation by police marching through residential areas in several cities after an 8 p.m. curfew, firing guns and stun grenades, and staging selective raids to arrest people.There were more reports Tuesday of protesters dying in custody after being arrested. The latest was a school principal who died of unknown causes after being taken into custody by security forces, according to media reports and an activist who knew him.Previously, an activist with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party died in custody. Witnesses said his body had wounds consistent with torture, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 1,930 people have been arrested in connection with the coup. Dozens of journalists have been arrested, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, who has been charged under a public order law that carries a penalty of up to three years in prison.Authorities continued their assault on the media on Tuesday, raiding the offices of Kamayut Media and detaining its co-founder and editor-in-chief. The military also raided the offices of Mizzima, an online news service. No one was arrested in the latter raid, though equipment was vandalized and property was taken away.The military government on Monday announced that the licenses of five local media outlets — Mizzima, DVB, Khit Thit Media, Myanmar Now and 7Day News — had been canceled. All five had been offering extensive coverage of the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-raids-railway-workers-homes-in-mingalar-taung-nyunt-area-101615362925555.html
10-03-2021||World||US crude oil production slips for 3rd session before inventories: EIA||Oil fell for a third straight session on Wednesday as investors took profits while looking ahead to US inventories data due later in the day for pointers on where prices will head next.Brent crude for May dropped 63 cents, or 0.9%, to $66.89 a barrel by 0721 GMT, after earlier hitting an intraday low of $66.50, while US West Texas Intermediate crude for April was at $63.47 a barrel, down 54 cents, or 0.8%.Prices gained support last week from the OPEC+ decision to largely maintain production cuts in April. They then initially jumped on Monday, with Brent rising above $70 a barrel, after attacks by Yemeni Houthis on Saudi's oil heartland, before settling back as the alarm subsided."It's a realisation that there was no impact on supply from the attack," Virendra Chauhan, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects said.A combination of factors including top importers China and India drawing crude from storage at current high prices and expectations of a return in Iranian supplies have also cooled prices, he added.In the United States, crude inventories rose by 12.8 million barrels in the week to March 5, according to trading sources, citing data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Analysts had expected a build of about 800,000 barrels in a Reuters' poll.Official figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) are expected Wednesday at 10:30 am ET.Meanwhile, higher prices are expected to bring more US crude supplies back online.Also read: Disruption in oil supply from Saudi Arabia causes US oil prices to fallUS crude production is still expected to fall by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.15 million bpd, the EIA said on Tuesday, but that's a smaller decline than its previous monthly forecast for a 290,000-bpd drop.The OPEC+ grouping - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers - may become the victim of its own success, analysts at EFG bank said, as higher prices resulting from supply restraint could incentivise US oil production."The current WTI oil price is well above the level needed to incentivise a substantial increase in US production, which according to surveys by the Dallas Fed and the Kansas City Fed stands at around $56 per barrel," EFG said."The longer it remains above this threshold, the greater the incentive for US and other non-OPEC+ producers to increase production."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-crude-oil-production-slips-for-3rd-session-before-inventories-eia-101615362801584.html
10-03-2021||World||England's $32 bn Covid test and trace not making a difference, overly reliant on contractors and consultants, lawmakers||England's $32 billion test and trace system has not made a clear impact on the Covid-19 pandemic, the British parliament's Public Accounts Committee said on Wednesday, decrying the "unimaginable" costs of the programme.Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year promised a world beating test and trace system as part of the route out of the pandemic. But it has taken the successful development and deployment of vaccines to let the government plot a definitive route back to normality."Despite the unimaginable resources thrown at this project, Test and Trace cannot point to a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic," chair of the committee, opposition Labour party lawmaker Meg Hillier, said."The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown – has been broken, twice."The Public Accounts Committee said that test and trace had cost 23 billion pounds ($32 billion) so far but had not achieved a key goal of avoiding a cycle of national lockdowns.The system has been allocated 37 billion pounds in total to cover two years, a budget which includes the cost of testing people with symptoms and regular testing in schools, care homes and some work places.Dido Harding, who runs the system, said that the team had carried out over 83 million coronavirus tests, more than any other comparable European country, and that testing still had a role to play in lifting lockdown."Test and trace is essential in our fight against Covid-19 and regular testing is a vital tool to stop transmission as we cautiously ease restrictions," she said, adding that contact tracing made "a real impact in breaking chains of transmission".The committee's report said that test and trace was overly reliant on expensive contractors. Consultants working on the system cost 1,000 pounds a day.Last year, scientific advisers said test and trace was not significantly reducing the spread of the coronavirus. England then entered a second lockdown in the autumn.British minister Grant Shapps said on Wednesday the system had been set up from scratch, it was playing a critical role in helping stop the spread of new variants and the pandemic would have been "one heck of a lot worse" without it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/englands-32-bn-covid-test-and-trace-not-making-a-difference-overly-reliant-on-contractors-and-consultants-lawmakers-say-101615377404021.html
10-03-2021||World||China accuses US admiral of 'hyping up' threat of Taiwan invasion||China on Wednesday accused a top US commander of attempting to "hype up" the threat of an invasion of Taiwan to inflate Washington's defence spend and justify its own military chicanery in Asia.The US' top military officer in Asia-Pacific, Admiral Philip Davidson, on Tuesday said China could invade Taiwan within the next six years, as Beijing accelerates its moves to supplant American military power in Asia.Democratic and self-ruled Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by authoritarian China, whose leaders view the island as part of their territory and which they have vowed to one day take back."I worry that they're (China) accelerating their ambitions to supplant the United States and our leadership role in the rules-based international order ... by 2050," Davidson said."Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before that. And I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact, in the next six years," he told a US Senate committee.Taiwan split from China at the end of a civil war in 1949 and exists under the constant threat of invasion by the mainland.Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but remains the island's most important unofficial ally and military backer.Beijing was swift to bat away the admiral's comments."Some US people continue to use the Taiwan issue to hype up China's military threat," foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing."But in essence this is the US searching for a pretext to increase its military spending, expand its forces and interfere in regional affairs."Donald Trump embraced warmer ties with Taiwan as he feuded with China on issues such as trade and national security.President Joe Biden's administration has offered Taiwan cause for optimism for continued support aside from the State Department saying in January that US commitment to the island was "rock-solid".Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the US was formally invited to Biden's inauguration, an unprecedented move since 1979.China also has made expansive territorial claims in the resource-rich South China Sea and even threatens the American island of Guam, Davidson stressed."Guam is a target today," he warned, recalling that the Chinese military released a video simulating an attack on an island base strongly resembling US facilities in Diego Garcia and Guam.He called on lawmakers to approve the installation on Guam of an Aegis Ashore anti-missile battery, capable of intercepting the most powerful Chinese missiles.Guam "needs to be defended and it needs to be prepared for the threats that will come in the future," Davidson said.In addition to other Aegis missile defence systems destined for Australia and Japan, Davidson called on lawmakers to budget for offensive armaments "to let China know that the costs of what they seek to do are too high."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-admiral-of-hyping-up-threat-of-taiwan-invasion-101615367228120.html

A spokeswoman for an inter-ministerial office for digital services told Reuters that teams were investigating the scale of impact. Its website data.gouv.fr appeared to briefly go down.Founded by Klaba in 1999, OVHcloud is the biggest European-based cloud services provider, competing against U.S. giants Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud, which dominate the market.French politicians have championed OVHcloud as a possible alternative to U.S. cloud services providers, but it has so far lacked the scale and financial clout to dent their market share.Klaba said the fire had been extinguished and firefighters were spraying the site with water to cool it down."The goal is to create a plan to restart, at least SBG3/SBG4, maybe SBG1. To do so, we need to check the network rooms too," he said in an update shortly after 0900 GMT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-destroys-some-servers-at-french-data-company-ovhcloud-101615375357289.html
10-03-2021||World||Ukraine faces vaccine resistance from citizens in new struggle against Covid-19||After receiving its first shipment of coronavirus vaccine, Ukraine found itself in a new struggle against the pandemic — persuading its widely reluctant people to get the shot.Although infections are rising sharply, Ukrainians are becoming increasingly opposed to vaccination: an opinion poll released earlier this month by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 60% of the country's people don't want to get vaccinated, up from 40% a month earlier. The nationwide poll of 1,207 had a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.The resistance appears to be rooted in longstanding suspicion of vaccines dating back to the Soviet era, amplified by politicians' allegations about low-quality vaccines, corruption scandals and misinformation spread through social media. Even more surprisingly, the reluctance still appears even among those highest at risk who administer life-saving drugs to others every day: medical workers.In the mining town of Selydove, 700 kilometres (420 miles) east of Kyiv, only 5% of the medical staff agreed to be vaccinated. Those declining included Olena Obyedko, a 26-year-old nurse who works in the hospital's intensive care ward for COVID-19 patients, where people die every week.“I decided not to get vaccinated. I doubt the quality of the vaccine. I’m afraid there will be side effects," she said.So few people chose to get the shots that the mobile brigade who came to Selydove to administer them ended up giving vaccinations to themselves in order not to let the vaccine go to waste.“Such a low number of vaccinated people is associated with low confidence in the vaccine that has entered Ukraine,” brigade head Olena Marchenko said of the AstraZeneca vaccine that was manufactured in India. “This is due to prejudice and information that is spread on social networks. People read a lot, they have a negative attitude towards the Indian vaccine.”Prominent politicians have fed that suspicion.Former President Petro Poroshenko said in parliament this month that he asked doctors in one region about why there was resistance to vaccination and was told: “Because they brought shit. And they brought it because of corruption and incompetence.”Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko added to the discontent by demanding that parliament pass a law to give government compensation to those who face vaccine side effects.Vaccine corruption scandals had started even before the first doses arrived in the country. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine reported that it began an investigation into a September deal to purchase 1.9 million doses of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine at 504 hryvna ($18) per dose. Its Chinese makers have not released full reports on its efficacy and one study in Brazil said it only has a 50% efficiency.“What these attacks lead to are consequences that will affect every Ukrainian," said Health Minister Maxim Stepanov. “We are talking about an attempt to disrupt the vaccination campaign in Ukraine.”Ukraine received its first shipment of vaccine — 500,000 AstraZeneca doses — in late February. Yet, only about 23,500 people have been vaccinated since then.In that same period, as many as 10,000 new infections a day have been recorded. Overall, the country of 41 million has recorded 1.4 million infections and more than 28,000 deaths.The health minister says only about 40% of medical workers treating coronavirus patients have agreed to receive the vaccine.Speaking in parliament, Oleksandr Kornienko, a leading member of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's Servant of the People faction, said medical facilities were forced to destroy many doses of the vaccine — which can only be stored for a few hours after a vial is opened — because the medical professionals who had been prescribed vaccinations did not show up.“Now they are forced to destroy the coveted vaccine because they fail to give it to people in time,” said Kornienko.Zelenskiy, who contracted the virus in November, tried to encourage vaccinations by publicly getting a shot himself.“The vaccine will allow us to live again without restrictions,” Zelensky said. “I believe that this vaccine is of high quality, it is one of the best in the world.”Yet his action seems to have had little effect.The country designated 14,000 doses of its first vaccine shipment for the military, especially those fighting Russia-backed separatists in the east. But only 1,030 troops have been vaccinated thus far.In the front-line town of Krasnohorivka, soldiers widely refused to vaccinate.“I have little faith in a pandemic, I don’t think it’s some kind of serious disease,” said Serhiy Kochuk, a 25-year-old soldier. “I am healthy, but the vaccine can provoke illness. Because of this vaccine, you can get sick.”The head of the Kyiv sociology institute, Volodymyr Paniotto, told The Associated Press that a recent decline in the popularity of Zelenskiy’s government has contributed to vaccine resistance.“The super-critical attitude of Ukrainians to the authorities was superimposed on the struggle of politicians and the information war, which led to a massive distrust in society,” he said.Ukrainians have been sceptical about any vaccinations since Soviet times. In 2019, the country had Europe’s largest measles outbreak due to widespread refusals to get a measles vaccine shot.“Over the past 20 years, Ukraine has been among the European countries most opposed to vaccination as such,” said Vadym Denysenko, an analyst at the Ukrainian Institute for the Future.The United Nations Development Program says the country is suffering an “info-demic” of misinformation about the vaccine and has called on the government to step up its fight.“Conspiracy theories, rumours and malicious disinformation can quickly go viral on social media, especially when there is a low level of public trust in state institutions," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-faces-vaccine-resistance-from-citizens-in-new-struggle-against-covid19-101615373018688.html

He said educational institutions in Islamabad, Peshawar and Muzaffarabad will also be closed.“All educational institutions will remain closed from March 15 to March 28 in specified cities and districts. Half of the students will keep attending classes in other districts,” Mahmood said.The minister said that all steps have to be taken while keeping in mind the nearly 50 million children that attend schools, colleges and universities.He said the situation in Sindh and Balochistan wad satisfactory and the policy of 50 per cent students attending will continue.Covid-19 first emerged in the country in February last year and hit a peak in mid-June. However, it started to decline in the following months but surged again in October 2020, prompting the government to issue a warning of a second wave.Fatalities and confirmed cases from the coronavirus have increased steadily since March 1, when Pakistan resumed regular classes at schools.Pakistan has reported 595,239 coronavirus cases, including 13,324 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pakistan-to-shut-down-educational-institutions-for-2-weeks-from-mar-15-101615367812009.html

UK scientists say it is about 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant circulating coronavirus variants.In the UK study, published in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, infection with the new variant led to 227 deaths in a sample of 54,906 Covid-19 patients, compared with 141 among the same number of patients infected with other variants."Coupled with its ability to spread rapidly, this makes B.1.1.7 a threat that should be taken seriously," said Robert Challen, a researcher at Exeter University who co-led the research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-variant-has-significantly-higher-death-rate-study-finds-101615372810400.html
10-03-2021||World||Sudan officials, Saudi crown prince talk Red Sea investments||Sudan’s prime minister and Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince met Wednesday to discuss Saudi investment opportunities in the Red Sea, the Sudanese government said, as the kingdom seeks to boost its influence across the strategic Horn of Africa.The high-level Sudanese delegation flew to Saudi Arabia this week for a two-day visit as the northeastern African nation struggles to revive its ailing economy and secure a transition to democratic rule. After years as a pariah under now-ousted autocrat Omar al-Bashir, Sudan has increasingly returned to the international fold, overhauling its economy to attract badly needed foreign investment.The meeting between Sudanese officials, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, “was friendly and establishes a new chapter" in the countries' ties, said the sparse Sudanese statement. It did not offer specifics on Saudi investment projects, but said talks focused on the “transformation” of the Red Sea into “a large development area to eradicate the roots of terrorism and poverty” and increase tourism.The Red Sea features heavily in Saudi Arabia’s so-called Vision 2030 to diversify its economy away from oil with business zones along the coast. The Saudi-led military coalition’s intervention in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-backed Houthis has sharpened the kingdom’s focus on wielding influence along the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Thousands of Sudanese troops have fought against the Houthis, a contentious deployment that aided the country's treasury.Sudan’s ruling Supreme Council, which is meant to steer the country toward democratic elections next year, is split between civilians and army generals. This week marks the first time since al-Bashir's overthrow that significant numbers of Sudan’s civilian leaders visited Saudi Arabia, which had cultivated close ties with al-Bashir and previously appeared to favor the country’s military strongmen over its pro-democracy movement.Following al-Bashir’s overthrow, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledged $3 billion in aid to Sudan’s military council, with half of the amount already delivered.Sudanese Finance Minister Gibril Ibrahim praised the “very successful” talks with Prince Mohammed, noting plans for the kingdom to increase investments in Sudanese infrastructure, including agriculture and livestock. Sudanese agricultural land remains a key interest for desert Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which import the majority of their food from abroad.Sudan’s economy has teetered on the brink in recent months, with inflation soaring past 300% in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-officials-saudi-crown-prince-talk-red-sea-investments-101615370720848.html

It has fallen 13% from a peak of 1,185 yuan hit last week.On the Singapore Exchange, the front-month contract slipped 1.4% to $155.40 a tonne after Tuesday's 5.9% fall."The blast furnace production restriction policy in Tangshan area has become stricter, but the time involved is relatively short, and the impact on the demand for raw materials may be relatively limited," Sinosteel Futures analysts said in a note.Also read: China producer prices jump, adding to global inflation risksThe government in Tangshan in the smog-prone northern Chinese province of Hebei has issued several emission-control rules since February restricting steel mills' operations.Tracking steep losses in the futures markets, spot iron ore sank to $166 a tonne on Tuesday, from $176 a day earlier, SteelHome consultancy said.On the supply side, persistent tight supply concerns have eased as imported iron ore piled up at China's ports to a three-month high of 129.50 million tonnes as of last week, based on SteelHome data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dalian-iron-ore-falls-to-its-lowest-due-to-strict-anti-pollution-measures-101615350631891.html

10-03-2021||World||Google to review advertisements for Myanmar military-backed telecoms firm||Google said on Wednesday it is reviewing recent advertisements run by a Myanmar military-backed telecommunications firm and has disabled some army-linked accounts on its services in the wake of the country's coup.The move comes as activists called on the US technology giant to restrict access to its services after dozens of deaths following weeks of protests against the Feb. 1 seizure of power."We have taken action against accounts on our platforms... including disabling accounts on Google services and taking down a number of YouTube channels and videos related to the Myanmar military," a Google spokeswoman said in a response to a Reuters question."Our priority is to help people in Myanmar access information and communicate safely."The disabled accounts connected to the military included those on Gmail, the publishing platform Blogger and the Google Play store, according to Google.A spokesman for the army did not respond to a request for comment.More than 60 protesters have been killed and 1,900 people have been arrested since the coup, an advocacy group said.YouTube said last week it had taken down five channels run by the state network MRTV as well as the military-owned Myawaddy Media. YouTube is owned by Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google. Justice for Myanmar, an advocacy group looking at the army's business interests, said on Wednesday it had found that Google and Rakuten-owned messaging app Viber were running new advertisements for Mytel, a Myanmar telecoms partially owned by the army, following a ban by Facebook.Mytel, Viber and Rakuten did not respond to requests for comment.Justice for Myanmar representative Yadanar Maung said while the group welcomed Google’s recent steps to disable some military-linked accounts on its platforms, it was "appalled" if Google and Viber profited by selling advertisements for "the Myanmar military business" Mytel.Reuters reviewed three Mytel advertisements published on Google and Viber over the last week, soon after Facebook announced it would block the Myanmar army from access to its platforms as well as advertising by all army-linked military entities.Vietnamese operator Viettel, which is partly owned by Vietnam's ministry of defence, is also a backer of Mytel.Viettel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook in 2020 removed more than a dozen user accounts and pages for "coordinated inauthentic behaviour", which it said were being used to covertly promote Mytel and disparage rivals.Documents published by Justice for Myanmar, whose website has been blocked by authorities in Myanmar, found that Mytel is under large control of the Myanmar military, for which it provides a significant source of income."The military's business interests help finance the brutal atrocities they are committing against the people of Myanmar," said Maung, who called on technology firms to ban all military businesses from its platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-review-advertisements-for-myanmar-military-backed-telecoms-firm-101615368259062.html
10-03-2021||World||Qantas Airways Ltd's flying 90% of pre-pandemic domestic schedule: Jetstar CEO||Qantas Airways Ltd's budget arm Jetstar is flying 90% of its pre-pandemic domestic schedule in March amid a rebound in demand as state borders have reopened in Australia, Jetstar's chief executive said on Wednesday."We are feeling certainly more positive than we have in 12 months," Jetstar Group CEO Gareth Evans said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event.The low-cost airline in December had hoped to reach more than 110% of its pre-pandemic domestic schedule by this month, but that was downgraded because of state border closures amid Covid-19 case clusters.Qantas has been boosting capacity at Jetstar more quickly than at its main brand because business travel is taking longer to recover to pre-pandemic levels than leisure travel.Also read: Qantas launches 'mystery flights' to boost tourism amid Covid-19 restrictionsQantas expects its total domestic capacity, including Jetstar, to reach 80% of normal in the fourth quarter, which ends June 30.Qantas is also leveraging Jetstar's lower-cost offering in competition with Regional Express Ltd, a new entrant on the Sydney-Melbourne route.Jetstar has been offering fares as low as A$29 each way to undercut Rex's lowest fares on the route by A$20."We are absolutely going to be watching them very carefully as we do with all competitors," Evans said. "We are always going to have the lowest fares in the market."Australia's international borders are largely closed, meaning domestic travel is the only option for most residents.Qantas does not expect widespread international travel to return until at least Oct. 31, in line with the country's Covid-19 vaccination programme.Jetstar has delayed the delivery of its first Airbus SE A321neoLRs, aimed at the international market, to 2022 or 2023, Evans said. Before the pandemic hit, it had expected the first of 18 of the planes to arrive in August 2020.Jetstar plans to resume using its Boeing Co 787s in the international market as soon as borders reopen, Evans said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qantas-airways-ltd-s-flying-90-of-pre-pandemic-domestic-schedule-jetstar-ceo-101615350610457.html

So this is a capacity that will come online later this year, and it will substantially increase our capacity, collectively," he said.Some of the additional vaccine capacity created in India would be used in vaccination efforts in Southeast Asian countries, the official added.The White House announced earlier on Tuesday that President Joe Biden will participate in an online Quad meeting on Friday, the first leader-level meeting of a group seen as part of efforts to balance China's growing military and economic power.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she expected a range of issues facing the global community to be discussed "from the threat of COVID, to economic cooperation and ... the climate crisis."India has urged the other Quad members to invest in its vaccine production capacity in an attempt to counter China's widening vaccine diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-nations-to-announce-financing-to-boost-india-s-vaccine-output-us-official-101615366958240.html
10-03-2021||World||Bangladesh claims it was successful in protecting Rohingyas from Covid-19||Bangladesh government has been successful in protecting the Rohingyas amid the Covid-19 pandemic despite fears of a spike in the number of affected people living in the congested and unhygienic conditions in Cox's Bazar.According to a report by Dhaka Tribune, advance precautionary measures, strict implementation of Covid-19 protocols and assistance from different United Nations organisations, International NGOs (INGOs) and NGOs have helped the authorities keep the situation under control, earning praise from various sectors.According to Dhaka Tribune, some have opined that the scenario of the whole country would be better if the handling of the Rohingya camps could have been replicated outside the camps.On Tuesday, the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ICSG), which coordinates the UN's humanitarian activities, INGOs and NGOs lauded Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina-led government for successfully handling the Covid-19 situation in Rohingya camps.The government has decided to vaccinate all the refugees, said Mahbubur Rahman, Cox's Bazar civil surgeon."We achieved the success by working in a coordinated manner. We have coordinated with all the stakeholders so that these people are protected," he said.He further said, "From the outset, we were very careful with considering the consequences if the virus spread in a big way. It would have been extremely difficult to control given the living conditions of the Rohingyas."On the government's decision to vaccinate all Rohingyas, the civil surgeon said, "The decision has been taken, but no timeframe has been fixed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-claims-it-was-successful-in-protecting-rohingyas-from-covid19-101615366595467.html
10-03-2021||World||BioNTech sees potential to supply 3 billion doses next year||BioNTech SE could have capacity to make 3 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine with U.S. partner Pfizer Inc. next year, the German company’s chief executive officer said, making their pioneering shot far more widely available around the world.“In principle, we could further increase manufacturing capacity,” Ugur Sahin said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “It depends on demand, it depends on factors such as if an additional boost to vaccinations is required.”Demand is growing around the world for Covid vaccines that countries desperately need to breathe back life into economies, return children to schools and get people back into offices and shops. Both the U.S. and Europe have sought to accelerate vaccine deliveries this year as new, more aggressive variants of the virus spread.“We have an order book of already 1.3 billion orders, which is already fixed,” Sahin said. “We are discussing additional doses -- hundreds of millions of doses as options -- with government organizations.”BioNTech shares rose as much as 1.3% early Wednesday in Frankfurt.The two companies have committed to make 2 billion doses of their two-shot vaccine this year. Pfizer promised to ship two-thirds of the U.S.’s 300 million-dose order by the end of May. In the European Union, the partners have promised to ship at least 500 million doses this year, with an option for an additional 100 million doses.Pfizer has projected about $15 billion in revenue this year from Covid vaccine sales, and CEO Albert Bourla said the price of the shot may increase.Mutant StrainsConcerns about mutated versions of the virus may also drive demand if new variants evolve with the ability to evade current inoculations. BioNTech is already discussing potential orders for boosters, Sahin said.BioNTech and Pfizer have begun laying the groundwork for a booster shot of their vaccine, which uses a new technology called messenger RNA. One trial, begun in February, is examining the safety and immune response of a third dose of the vaccine in people who took part in an early study of the shot last year. The partners have also said they’re planning a human test of a new vaccine that’s specific to a particularly problematic vaccine variant that emerged late last year in South Africa.“We now understand the evolution of the virus can result in new variants that come with new biological and medical features,” Sahin said. “The whole world was not prepared for this pandemic, and we now understand that this could happen again.”In lab studies using blood of people who’ve been inoculated, the existing form of the vaccine seems to be less effective against the South Africa strain than against other mutant versions of the coronavirus. While the vaccine still appears to offer some protection, the implications of the variants remain unclear.The companies will gain more data on the South Africa variant within six to eight weeks, Sahin said.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is cleared in more than 50 countries. Aside from the EU and the U.S., other major orders have come from Japan, Canada and the U.K.EU SolidarityThe BioNTech chief called for continued solidarity among EU countries, despite concerns in countries like Germany that tethering vaccine purchasing and distribution to the bloc has slowed the immunization push. In the U.K., more than a third of the population has received a shot, compared with 6% in Germany, according to Bloomberg’s vaccination tracker.“At the end of the day we have to see that Germany is not an isolated state,” Sahin said. “It’s part of Europe, and Europe decides and has to come to a common solution.”As vaccine campaigns pick up, Sahin said he’s optimistic that inoculations will become more widespread this year and next.“I’m pretty confident that we will be able to provide vaccines in Europe and the U.S. and that everyone who requires a vaccine gets a vaccine by the end of summer,” Sahin said, provided there are no production glitches. “Within 2022, we hope to have enough to vaccinate around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-sees-potential-to-supply-3-billion-doses-next-year-101615364461255.html
10-03-2021||World||South Korean hospitals extract extra Covid-19 vaccine doses from vials||In a handful of South Korean hospitals, designated nurses are using specially designed syringes to squeeze extra doses of coronavirus vaccine out of each vial in a bid to stretch the still limited number of vials to cover more people.The practice has raised debate over medical safety and commercial concerns from the manufacturers who charge by the dose.But at Seoul's National Medical Center, healthcare workers say it's actually a safe and easy process that should be a no-brainer for countries struggling to provide enough vaccines quickly."Two designated nurses take shifts to extract the doses and each of us had no trouble getting seven doses from each vial, vaccinating everyone," said Kim Eun-suk, an intravenous therapy specialist who was taking a shift extracting doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine from vials that officially only hold six.On Tuesday, Kim said the centre vaccinated 629 people with 90 vials of Pfizer vaccine co-developed by its German partner BioNTech, compared with the 540 people possible had they only extracted six doses from each vial.It takes about five minutes to extract the doses using "low dead space" syringes designed to minimise the residual volume, she said.“Extraction itself is not difficult. It requires squeezing the exact amount with the syringe. The most important is sterilization and I think any nurse would be able to pull through."At the suggestion of frontline nurses, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said it was up to providers whether to use of remaining doses, but did not make it a new standard or mandatory because it said it could burden the healthcare workers on site.National Medical Center president Chung Ki-hyun said that the contracts with manufacturers - who sell by the dose - should not be a roadblock for on-site healthcare workers to use the remaining doses when they can save lives."With care and precision, the extra dose isn't as hard to extract," he said.It's not clear how many South Korean clinics are using the extra doses, but Chung said following the official limit means throwing away potentially life-saving vaccines.Experts were divided about the decision to extract extra doses, as pooling leftover vaccine from multiple vials can lead to contamination. With the specialised low dead space syringes, however, a full extra dose can typically be pulled from a single Pfizer vaccine vial, and as many as two extra doses from AstraZeneca's vaccine vials.Urging caution over imprecise extraction, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) has advised its members to discard the remaining doses in the vials, according to a statement seen by Reuters.KDCA said 446,941 people were given first doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots by Tuesday midnight. South Korea has reported 470 new cases on Tuesday, adding to the total coronavirus cases of 93,733, with 1,648 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-hospitals-extract-extra-covid-19-vaccine-doses-from-vials-101615363614883.html
10-03-2021||World||China producer prices jump, adding to global inflation risks||China’s producer prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in February, joining more expensive oil, computer chip shortages and soaring shipping costs as tailwinds for global inflation pressures.The Chinese producer price index rose 1.7% from a year earlier, official data showed Wednesday, stronger than economists’ forecasts for a 1.5% increase and up from 0.3% in January. Consumer prices fell 0.2% last month from a year earlier, slightly better than a projected 0.3% decline.As manufacturer to the world, resurgent producer prices in China raise the prospect it will start exporting inflation globally as factories hike prices for goods sold abroad. Bond markets have already been roiled by expectations that faster global growth and massive fiscal stimulus in the U.S. will push up inflation.Chinese producer prices have been a major contributor to global inflation in recent decades as supply chains became more integrated. Falling prices were a key disinflation driver in 2012-2016, and made it difficult for central banks elsewhere to meet their goals of sustained inflation.This time around, inflation risks are moving in the other direction. Oil has surged close to $70 a barrel, while prices of copper and agricultural goods have rallied. Shipping rates have soared and a global shortage of computer chips could push up prices.“Metal prices were on the rise due to global fiscal stimulus money to be spent on infrastructure projects,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at ING Groep NV in Hong Kong. “If crude oil price keeps increasing it would push up other prices, like transportation, and therefore production cost, then it could generate inflation.”Rising commodity prices were the main boost to China’s producer inflation last month. The biggest gains were in mining, which climbed 6.8% in February from a year ago, while raw material prices rose 2.9% after several months of declines.What Bloomberg Economics Says...Producer price inflation looks set to pick up further on a low base, assuming commodity prices remain buoyant. This would support increases in profits for industrial enterprises -- a positive for the economy.-- David Qu, China economistHowever, the government’s conservative economic growth goal of more than 6% for this year, and its gradual withdrawal of stimulus mean China could play a lesser role in driving demand for commodities this year than in the years following the global financial crisis.“China may play a less dominant role in exporting global inflation, given that the government’s on the course to tighten fiscal stimulus and property measures,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “The recent commodity price upswing to a very large extent is responding to the recovery in major advanced economies on the back of vaccination and Covid-19 containment.”Consumer PricesConsumer deflation in China eased last month, with prices still largely dragged down by cheaper pork, a key element in the country’s CPI basket. Pork prices declined 14.9% in February from a year ago, reflecting the recovery in hog supplies after outbreaks of African swine fever in recent years.That trend could reverse with the re-emergence of the disease in parts of the country. However, the statistics bureau reduced pork’s weighting in the CPI basket last month, and with consumer spending still a weak point in an otherwise strong economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, consumer inflation will likely remain below Beijing’s target of a 3% increase this year.Excluding the volatile energy and food costs, consumer prices were unchanged from a year earlier.“The weak CPI shows that there’s no obvious inflation pressure, unlike in the U.S., where CPI expectations have been revised up,” said Hao Zhou, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.Subdued inflation reduces pressure on the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, to tighten monetary policy, said Peiqian Liu, a China economist at Natwest Markets in Singapore. However, the PBOC has warned about financial risks, such as asset bubbles, suggesting a policy of gradual tightening.“We think the PBOC may continue to normalize monetary policy to neutral as credit growth slows gradually in coming months,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-producer-prices-jump-adding-to-global-inflation-risks-101615352779562.html

Germany and the United States have also ramped up efforts to resolve the shortage.South Korea's leading automaker Hyundai Motor has so far kept factories running, but a Hyundai union official told Reuters on Tuesday that overtime production of less-popular models had stopped and production schedules were changing from week to week.Although the domestic auto industry's situation was good compared to international rivals, "concerns about future production disruptions have increased", the government said in a statement.Chip production capacity could not be increased quickly, with 98% of auto chips used by South Korean automakers coming from abroad, it added.To help deal with the shortage, Koreans and foreigners involved in auto chip imports or production would no longer have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival in the country from abroad, starting April.Covid-19 vaccinations would be available for people departing for essential purposes such as purchasing and procuring auto chips.The government also said it would speed up performance evaluations of auto chip components and modules developed by domestic companies.(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-exempt-auto-chip-buyers-from-covid-19-quarantine-101615355261689.html
10-03-2021||World||South Korea agrees to 13.9% increase in its share of cost for hosting US troops||South Korea has agreed to a 13.9% increase in its contribution to the cost of hosting some 28,500 US troops for 2021, the biggest annual rise in nearly two decades, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday.The increase will take South Korea's contribution this year to 1.18 trillion won ($1.03 billion). Former US President Donald Trump questioned the extent of US funding of the defence of allies and had demanded that South Korea pay as much as $5 billion a year."The agreement resolved a vacuum that had lasted about a year and three months," the foreign ministry said in a statement."It provided a chance to reaffirm the importance of the alliance and the need for stable stationing of US Forces Korea."The six-year Special Measures Agreement with the United States, which came after drawn-out negotiations and will boost South Korea's annual contribution to the bill for 2022 to 2025 in line with its annual defence budget increase, which was 5.4% this year, the foreign ministry said.The pact replaces an arrangement that expired at the end of 2019, under which South Korea paid about $920 million a year. Both sides agreed to freeze South Korea's contribution for 2020, the ministry said.In the last big annual increase, in 2003, South Korea paid 17% more than the previous year, according to data from a defence ministry white paper.On the new link between the contribution to the cost of maintaining US forces and the defence budget, the ministry said the increase in the defence budget was a "reasonable, clearly verifiable standard" that reflected financial and security capabilities.The ministry said it would take swift administrative steps and send the agreement to parliament for approval.About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend it against North Korea. The 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-agrees-to-13-9-increase-in-its-share-of-cost-for-hosting-us-troops-101615361115971.html
10-03-2021||World||Russia restricts use of Twitter, cites 'failure to remove banned content'||Russia's communications watchdog said on Wednesday it had restricted the use of Twitter in the country by moving to slow down the speed of the service after it was accused of failing to remove banned content from its website.Roskomnadzor, the watchdog, said in a statement on its website that it could block the resource entirely if Twitter failed to remove banned content.Authorities will slow access to Twitter on all mobile devices and on half of desktop computers because the company failed to remove content related to teenage suicide attempts, pornography and drug use, internet watchdog Roskomnadzor said in a statement Wednesday. It said access could be blocked altogether if Twitter doesn’t remove the banned content.The move came a day after the regulator announced lawsuits against Twitter and four other social-media companies for not deleting posts about last month’s nationwide protests over the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.President Vladimir Putin slammed U.S. social media giants during his speech at the World Economic Forum in January, calling them monopolies and questioning whether they act in the public interest.“This is so far the softest measure they could have taken to limit access to western social media,” Ilya Klishin, a founder of media consultant KFConsulting. “The target audience is old guys in power, who aren’t Twitter users anyways. I don’t think this will change young people’s habits, and there are serious questions if they have the technical capacity to completely block access to Twitter.”More RestrictionsTwitter couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.Twitter has come under increasing pressure from regulators in some countries. Banned in China, the network was among several fined in Turkey late last year in a move activists called an attempt to stifle dissent.Russia’s regulator said other services could also be targeted for throttling if they continue to defy local laws, Interfax reported. Legislators in parliament Wednesday said Facebook Inc. could be restricted next.“This isn’t an empty threat. Twitter and the other social networks that don’t fulfill the requirements of the law should get ready for serious consequences, including closure,” said Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov, according to RIA Novosti.Tuesday, regulators filed court cases against Twitter, Google, Facebook, TikTok and Telegram for allegedly failing to delete posts that urged minors to attend the January protests, according to Interfax.Russia sought to block Telegram several years ago over failure to share encryption information but was unable to make the ban work technically and ultimately backed down. But under a 2019 law, authorities have since upgraded systems they say would allow Russia to completely cut itself off from the internet if needed.Twitter service in Moscow didn’t immediately appear to have been disrupted Wednesday, although state-run RIA Novosti said its staff experienced some slowness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-restricts-use-of-twitter-cites-failure-to-remove-banned-content-101615361135829.html

If approved by both parties, the contract will be in effect through June 30, 2021", the joint statement added.California's governor said earlier this month that he and Democratic lawmakers had reached a deal to fund the reopening of schools for students up to second grade, as the numbers of new Covid-19 cases in the state and country had dropped.California's $6.6 billion budget package marked an effort to get school children back in class after having been confined to home learning in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-schools-teachers-union-reach-tentative-deal-to-reopen-schools-101615357210709.html
10-03-2021||World||Hawaii declares state of emergency after rains cause floods||Hawaii Governor David Ige declared an emergency in the US state after heavy rains brought floods, landslides and fear of dam failures, prompting evacuations in at least two counties, while flood advisories stayed in effect for a second day.The move came after a dam overflowed on the island of Maui, forcing evacuations and destroying homes, with the dam's "unsatisfactory" condition leading to it being scheduled for removal this year, the land department has said."The emergency proclamation makes state general funds available that can be used quickly and efficiently to help those impacted by the severe weather," Ige said on Tuesday.Poor weather was expected to run until Friday, he added.There were no immediate reports of deaths or casualties.The emergency declaration covers the counties of Hawai'i, Maui, Kalawao, O'ahu and Kaua'i, the governor's office said in a statement, while the disaster relief period runs until May 8.In Maui, heavy rains damaged roads, leaving them impassable, with one bridge completely washed out and another displaced, the governor's office said, as higher water levels boosted the risk of erosion and seepage.State emergency management officials had said the rains led to the cresting of the Kaupakalua dam in the northern region of Haiku, prompting authorities to open evacuation shelters and urge people not to return home.Six homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, said Maui mayor Michael Victorino.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hawaii-declares-state-of-emergency-after-rains-cause-floods-101615360004828.html
10-03-2021||World||Defence Sec Lloyd Austin extends National Guard deployment at US Capitol||Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has formally approved an extension of the National Guard deployment at the US Capitol for about two more months as possible threats of violence remain, the Pentagon said Tuesday.According to a statement issued by the department, close to 2,300 Guard troops will continue to provide security in Washington until May 23, at the request of the Capitol Police. Officials have been scrambling in recent days to determine if and how to fill the request, as the original March 12 deadline for them to leave Washington loomed.There are currently about 5,100 Guard troops in Washington, and they were scheduled to leave this weekend. It was unclear if any of those forces will have to stay an extra day or two while any new troops arrive and get trained and settled in. The Pentagon said defence officials will work with the Capitol Police to incrementally reduce the number of Guard needed in the city as time goes on.The decision to keep Guard members in the city underscores concerns about security at the Capitol, two months after rioters breached the building in an attack that left five people dead. Law enforcement has remained in a heightened security posture in response to intelligence suggesting possible threats to the Capitol by militia groups.Also read: Hire more police officers, improve intelligence capability: Capitol riot reviewThe request to extend the deployment met resistance last week, as some governors expressed reluctance or flatly refused to commit their troops to more time in the city. There now appear to be enough states willing to provide Guard troops for the mission, said defence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Earlier Tuesday, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the decision on maintaining a Guard presence would be based on local law enforcement concerns along with the needs of the Capitol Police.“It's not just about a threat assessment, it's about assisting and supporting capabilities that the Capitol Police may now lack and may need to look at improving,” Kirby said, adding that the extension request was based largely on using the Guard to make up for gaps in the capabilities of the Capitol Police.Army leaders had also initially questioned whether the Capitol Police had exhausted all other options to fill the need, such as asking other federal law enforcement agencies to provide security. But officials said military leaders thought it was important to find ways to work out the details.The threat was tied to the far-right conspiracy theory promoted by QAnon supporters that former President Donald Trump would rise again to power on March 4, the original presidential inauguration day. That day passed with no problems, but law enforcement has said threats to buildings and personnel remain.The Guard's deployment to the Capitol has been troubled. Early on, Guard members were briefly forced to take rest breaks and meals in a nearby cold garage, sparking outrage within the Biden administration. Officials quickly found new spaces within congressional buildings for the on-duty breaks.In addition, Guard members complained of bad food, and some said they became sick. On Monday, Kirby said about 50 Guard troops had been treated for gastrointestinal issues, out of the 26,000 that deployed to Washington. He said six sought outpatient medical treatment, while the rest were treated at aid stations set up for the Capitol Hill mission.Kirby said Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, has been visiting the troops several times a week and eating with them to ensure that they were getting good food.Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman made the request to have the Guard members stay on, setting off a series of discussions with the Pentagon and National Guard leaders.In a statement late Tuesday, the Capitol Police force said it is “extremely grateful for the Department of Defence's continued commitment to support our critical mission to protect Congress.”US military officials have said the cost of deploying about 26,000 Guard troops to the US Capitol from shortly after the January 6 riot to this Friday is close to USD 500 million. No cost estimate for the next two months has been released. The costs include housing, transportation, salaries, benefits and other essentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defence-sec-lloyd-austin-extends-national-guard-deployment-at-us-capitol-101615350594409.html
10-03-2021||World||Former Hong Kong anti-Beijing lawmaker Chi-fung moves to Australia||Former Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker and activist Ted Hui Chi-fung said he had relocated to Australia where he would continue campaigning against the Chinese Communist Party.The 38-year-old fled Hong Kong for Europe in December while he was free on bail on protest-related charges.Hui on Wednesday thanked the Australian government for intervening so that he was allowed to travel from London to Australia this week on a flight that was repatriating Australian citizens.Australia has limited the pandemic spread by denying permission for most people who are not Australian citizens or residents to enter the country.“Honestly, it’s very hard to get here because of the border closure,” Hui told Australian Broadcasting Corp.“I actually couldn’t get any flights on the commercial market so I had to ask the Australian government for assistance and they were so kind for facilitating situations and they put me on the list and gave me the eligibility so that I could actually get on a repatriation flight with other Australians going home,” Hui added.Hui arrived in Australia on a 12-month tourist visa on Tuesday and would remain in hotel quarantine for two weeks, The Australian newspaper reported.Immigration Minister Alex Hawke’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Hui was the only Hong Kong activist to be granted an exemption to enter Australia since the pandemic began, ABC reported.Hui said on social media that “applying for asylum” in Australia “would be my last option.”Hong Kong-based Australian lawyer Antony Dapiran said Hui’s move to Australia would be welcomed by Hong Kong dissidents and condemned by Beijing.Dapiran, who is not representing Hui, said the activist was facing several charges in Hong Kong and was being investigated under the sweeping national security law that Beijing had imposed on the semi-autonomous territory in response to massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy rallies in 2019.Scores of democracy advocates have been arrested for allegedly violating the law, which critics say erodes the rights and freedoms promised to Hong Kong under the “one country, two systems” framework following the handover from British colonial rule in 1997."So from Beijing’s point of view, he is a fugitive from the law as they would see it and they would see Australia as not only interfering in the internal affairs of China and Hong Kong but also of harboring a fugitive from the law,” Dapiran said.Hui di not immediately return The Associated Press' phone call on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-hong-kong-anti-beijing-lawmaker-moves-to-australia-101615356463770.html
10-03-2021||World||End in sight for Imran Khan's 'Naya Pakistan' amid rising inflation in Pakistan||With political turmoil in Pakistan worsening with every passing day, the end seems to be in sight for Prime Minister Imran Khan's 'Naya Pakistan' courtesy rising inflation in the country.According to Imad Zafar, a political commentator for various media outlets and think tanks, the Prime Minister is finding it tough to steer the country out of its political and economic crisis.Khan won a vote of confidence from the National Assembly (NA). Khan needed that vote to confirm his majority in the lower house of parliament after his party suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Senate at the hands of the Pakistan Democratic Alliance, a coalition of opposition parties.Zafar pointed out that not only did the PDM manage to get ex-prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani elected to the Senate, defeating the incumbent finance minister Hafeez Shaikh, but it also managed to secure a majority in the upper house."Though Khan somehow managed to thwart the crisis for the time being by getting a vote of confidence from the NA, for sure the storm is not over for him. The rising inflation and increasing poverty in the country are only making his Naya Pakistan (New Pakistan) project a nightmare for the masses," Zafar wrote for The Asia Times.He added, "Such is the state of affairs that even the military establishment is unable to run the country from behind the scenes."Also read: Imran Khan survives, but with a taintThe frustration of the elite, he said, was evident on the day of the vote of confidence, when parliamentarians of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) were attacked by a mob of supporters of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)."Imran Khan is trying everything possible to stay in power. The question remains, however, how he will survive the onslaught of the opposition at a point when the establishment is about to ditch him and is looking for a new puppet to rule the country on its behalf," the commentator wrote for the Asia Times.He added, "For Khan the game is almost over, as perhaps a few generals will still support him, but he does not enjoy the unconditional support from the establishment that he had after his relaunch in politics in 2011. So probably he knows this is his first and last time to enjoy power, so he is trying everything to stay in charge."The question is how long a few generals will be able to save him from the inevitable, as the growing anger in the masses about inflation, unemployment, and economic turmoil is growing with the passage of time, Zafar said further.He pointed out that this is "perhaps the first time" that the doctrine of the military establishment to rule the country indirectly has backfired, and it has happened in only two and a half years."Though the majority of the mainstream media was behind the hybrid regime, still the opposition managed to produce counter-narratives through international media and digital news platforms, and the inability of Khan and his backers to manage the economy and governance doomed the Naya Pakistan project," he said.Zafar added, "The endgame has started, and the interesting thing is that Khan cannot even get rid of the government until both Sharif and Zardari agree to topple him."This comes as Pakistan's financial debt continues to mount because the Imran Khan government received USD 6.7 billion in gross foreign loans in the first seven months of the current fiscal year, including a new commercial loan of USD 500 million from China last month.According to The Expresss Tribune, Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that during the July-January period of fiscal year 2020-21, the government obtained USD 6.7 billion in external loans from multiple financing sources. The gross loans were higher by 6 per cent or USD 380 million over the same period of the last fiscal year.Pakistan's foreign debt and liabilities have mounted by USD 3 billion or 2.6 per cent during the six months period ended in December last year, the central bank's data reported in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-in-sight-for-imran-khan-s-naya-pakistan-amid-rising-inflation-in-pakistan-101615341506313.html
10-03-2021||World||US House set to vote on Covid-19 relief, Biden on cusp of triumph||Congress is poised to approve a landmark $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill, placing President Joe Biden on the cusp of an early triumph that advances Democratic priorities and showcases the unity his party will need to forge future victories.The House was expected to give final congressional approval Wednesday to the package, which aims to fulfill Democrats' campaign promises to beat the pandemic and revive the enfeebled economy. House and Senate Republicans have unanimously opposed the package as bloated, crammed with liberal policies and heedless of signs the dual crises are easing.“It's a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday.For Biden and Democrats, the bill is essentially a canvas on which they've painted their core beliefs — that government programs can be a benefit, not a bane, to millions of people and that spending huge sums on such efforts can be a cure, not a curse. The measure so closely tracks Democrats' priorities that several rank it with the top achievements of their careers, and despite their slender congressional majorities there was never real suspense over its fate.They were also empowered by three dynamics: their unfettered control of the White House and Congress, polls showing robust support for Biden's approach, and a moment when most voters care little that the national debt is soaring toward a stratospheric $22 trillion. Neither party seems much troubled by surging red ink, either, except when the other is using it to finance its priorities, be they Democratic spending or GOP tax cuts.A dominant feature of the bill is initiatives making it one of the biggest federal thrusts in years to assist lower- and middle-income families. Included are expanded tax credits over the next year for children, child care and family leave plus spending for renters, feeding programs and people's utility bills.The measure provides up to $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, extended emergency unemployment benefits and hundreds of billions for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, schools, state and local governments and ailing industries from airlines to concert halls. There is aid for farmers of color and pension systems, and subsidies for consumers buying health insurance and states expanding Medicaid coverage for lower earners.Its very expansiveness is a chief GOP talking point.“It's not focused on COVID relief. It's focused on pushing more of the far-left agenda," said No. 2 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last week that 70% of Americans back Biden’s response to the virus, including a hefty 44% of Republicans.Yet the bill's pathway has underscored Democrats' challenges as they seek to build a legislative record to persuade voters to keep them running Congress in next year's elections.Democrats control the Senate, split 50-50, only because Vice President Kamala Harris gives them the winning vote in tied roll calls. They have just a 10-vote advantage in the House.That's almost no wiggle room for a party that ranges from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on the conservative side to progressives like Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Progressives had to swallow big concessions in the bill to solidify moderate support. The most painful was dropping the House-approved federal minimum-wage increase to $15 hourly by 2025.Moderates forced tightened eligibility for the $1,400 stimulus checks, now phased out completely for individuals earning $80,000 and couples making $160,000. The House's initial extension of the soon-to-end $400 weekly emergency jobless payments, paid on top of state benefits, was trimmed by the Senate to $300 and will now halt in early September.Manchin was a leading holdout and in the middle of talks that resulted in curbing all of those initiatives. The Senate approved the bill on a party-line 50-49 vote on Saturday.Dropping the minimum-wage boost was “infuriating,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the roughly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus. But she called the overall bill “incredibly bold,” adding, "It hits all of our progressive priorities — putting money in people’s pockets, shots in arms, unemployment insurance, child care, schools.”The independent Tax Policy Center said that the Senate-passed bill would give almost 70% of this year's tax breaks to households earning $91,000 or less. In contrast, the Trump-era GOP tax bill gave nearly half its 2018 reductions to the top 5% of households earning around $308,000, said the research center, which is run by the liberal-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.Yet keeping Democrats united won't get easier as the party tries advancing the rest of its agenda. There are fault lines within the party over priorities like immigration, health care and taxes.At some point it seems likely that progressives will draw their own lines in the sand. They are already demanding that the party revisit the minimum-wage boost, and amid all this Republicans are already demonstrating they are ready to pounce.The American Action Network, tied to House GOP leaders, said it's launched digital ads in mostly moderate districts calling the relief bill “a freight train of frivolous spending to bankroll their liberal cronies.”The bill passed the Senate under budget rules that prevented Republicans from launching filibusters, which require 60 votes for most measures. That process won't be available for much legislation moving forward, but either way any Democratic Senate defections will make most bills there non-starters.Even with their procedural advantage, Democrats' avenue to victory in the Senate was pockmarked with delays. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., forced clerks to spend nearly 11 hours reading the entire 628-page bill; negotiations with Manchin over jobless benefits lasted around nine hours; and votes on three dozen amendments, virtually all fated in advance to lose, took about 12 hours more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-set-to-vote-on-covid-19-relief-biden-on-cusp-of-triumph-101615354292565.html
10-03-2021||World||Air travellers gaining confidence, time to plan for restart: IATA||The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced results from its latest poll of recent travellers, showing growing confidence in a return to air travel, frustration with current travel restrictions and acceptance of a travel app to manage health credentials for travel.While 88 per cent believe that when opening borders, the right balance must be struck between managing Covid-19 risks and getting the economy going again, 85 per cent believe that governments should set Covid-19 targets (like testing capacity or vaccine distribution) to re-open borders.About 84 per cent believe that Covid-19 will not disappear and there is need to manage its risks while living and travelling normally, 68 per cent agreed that their quality of life has suffered with travel restrictions.Nearly 49 per cent believe that air travel restrictions have gone too far.A total of 4,700 interviews were conducted online in 11 markets between February 15 and 23. The sample size was 500 in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, India and Australia. In Chile, Japan, UAE and Singapore the sample size was 300.The poll showed while there is public support for travel restrictions, it is becoming clear that people are feeling more comfortable with managing the risks of Covid-19.People are also feeling frustrated with the loss of freedom to travel with 68 per cent of respondents indicating their quality of life is suffering as a result. Travel restrictions come with health, social and economic consequences.Nearly 40 per cent of respondents reported mental stress and missing an important human moment as a result of travel restrictions. And over a third have said that restrictions prevent them from doing business normally."The top priority of everybody at the moment is staying safe amid the Covid-19 crisis. But it is important that we map a way to being able to re-open borders, manage risks and enable people to get on with their lives," said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO."That includes the freedom to travel. It is becoming clear that we will need to learn to live and travel in a world that has Covid-19. Given the health, social and economic costs of travel restrictions, airlines should be ready to re-connect the world as soon as governments are able to re-open borders."The poll showed that 57 per cent expect to be travelling within two months of the pandemic being contained (improved from 49 per cent in September 2020). About 72 per cent want to travel to see family and friends as soon as possible (improved from 63 per cent in September 2020).Nearly 81 per cent believe that they will be more likely to travel once they are vaccinated and 84 per cent said they will not travel if there is a chance of quarantine at destination (largely unchanged from 83 per cent in September 2020).About 56 per cent believe that they will postpone travel until the economy stabilises (improved from 65 per cent in September 2020).There are some headwinds in travel trends. About 84 per cent of travellers will not travel if it involves quarantine at destination. And there are still indications that the pick-up in business travel will take time with 62 per cent of respondents saying they are likely to travel less for business even after the virus is contained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-travellers-gaining-confidence-time-to-plan-for-restart-iata-101615354256560.html

10-03-2021||World||Biden's first 50 days: Where he stands on key promises||President Joe Biden laid out an ambitious agenda for his first 100 days in office, promising swift action on everything from climate change to immigration reform to the coronavirus pandemic.He hits his 50th day in office on Wednesday as his administration eyes a major milestone: final congressional passage of his massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package. The bill includes direct payments to millions of Americans and money to help the White House deliver on a number of Biden's biggest campaign promises, like reopening schools and getting more Americans vaccinated.Fifty days in, Biden has made major strides on a number of key campaign pledges for his earliest days in office, while others are still awaiting action. Where he stands on some of his major promises:COMPLETED GOALSBiden prioritized addressing the coronavirus pandemic during his first weeks in office, and the focus has paid off. He’s on pace to hit his goal of 100 million vaccine doses administered in his first 100 days as soon as the end of next week. The daily rate of vaccinations now averages more than 2 million shots, and more than 75 million doses have been administered since Biden was sworn in.Read more: 'Indian-Americans taking over US,' says President Joe Biden in NASA meetBiden also took took several early actions that fulfilled pledges on climate policy. He signed an executive order on Inauguration Day that revoked the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, halted development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and ordered the review of Trump-era rules on the environment, public health and science. A Jan. 27 executive order halted new oil and gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters.Biden also easily delivered on top campaign pledges that involved rolling back Trump administration moves on everything from climate change to immigration. Early on, the Biden administration rejoined the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accord, halted construction of the border wall, ended travel restrictions on people from a variety of Muslim-majority countries and created a task force to reunite families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.Read more: In message to China, Joe Biden to meet Australia, India, Japan PMsOn immigration, Biden pledged to deliver a comprehensive reform bill to Congress within his first 100 days, and it was unveiled last month, although Biden already has signaled an openness to a piece-by-piece approach if necessary. Biden also issued an executive order directing the Homeland Security secretary to “preserve and fortify” protections for young immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents.Biden also made some early moves to deliver on a pledge to tighten ethical standards in his administration, including a Jan. 20 executive order imposing an ethics pledge on appointees governing activities such as lobbying and taking gifts, which included prohibiting political interference in the Justice Department.IN PROGRESSStill other Biden promises remain a work in progress.Biden’s national COVID-19 strategy pledged to establish 100 new, federally supported vaccination centers across the nation by the end of February. So far, the administration is at about 20 mass vaccination sites run end-to-end by the federal government and staffed by active-duty troops deployed by the Pentagon. Overall, the administration says, at least 441 vaccination sites are now federally supported. Many of those were not new sites, but nearly all have expanded capacity with the additional federal resources.On immigration, Biden pledged to reverse the “public charge” rule put in place by the Trump administration to discourage immigrants from using public benefits, to streamline the naturalization process and to reform the U.S. asylum system within his first 100 days. An executive order he signed in early February directs the relevant agencies to review those policies and recommend changes within 60 days.The administration has made some moves to reform the asylum system, including a move by the Department of Homeland Security on Biden’s first day in office to suspend a Trump-era program requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims were under review. But Biden has yet to articulate a plan to manage asylum flows beyond proposing that billions of dollars be spent to address root causes in Central America.The president has also kept in place pandemic-related powers that allow his administration to immediately expel people at the border without an opportunity to seek asylum. Biden aides have said they have no immediate plans to end the authority, which Trump introduced a year ago using an obscure 1944 public health law.Biden also promised to end the long-term detention of migrant families. Immigration and Customs Enforcement signaled last week it plans to discontinue the use of one such facility, but ICE will continue to hold families for three days or less at two other facilities in Texas. And the Biden administration is expanding capacity at a number of long-term facilities that hold immigrant children, to address an ongoing surge of unaccompanied minors at the border.On climate change, Biden pledged to establish enforceable commitments from other nations to reduce emissions in global shipping and aviation and to convene a climate world summit to discuss new and more ambitious pledges to address climate change, within his first 100 days. The U.S. will hold such a summit on April 22, Earth Day.Reopening America’s schools is one of Biden’s major campaign promises that’s proven tougher to execute, in part because the decision on whether to return to in-person learning is left up to local officials and teachers’ unions. After some back-and-forth over the details of his goal, Biden said last month that his 100-day mission was to have most elementary schools open five days a week for in-person learning.This month he directed states to prioritize vaccinating teachers and announced he was directing federal resources toward vaccinating teachers in March. The Biden administration hopes that with the passage of the coronavirus relief bill and distribution of millions in aid for schools to improve safety measures, teachers will feel more comfortable returning to in-person learning.According to Burbio, which tracks school reopening plans, about 47% of kindergarten through 12th grade students have access to in-person school every weekday.AWAITING ACTIONThe Biden administration has yet to take significant action on criminal justice reform, aside from an executive order terminating private prison contracts. Biden pledged to set up a police oversight board within his first 100 days, but there's been no clear movement in that direction so far.Other 100-day pledges also awaiting movement: creating a Cabinet-level working group focused on promoting union participation, and ordering an FBI review of issues with gun purchase background checks.Read more: EU to go ahead with tech tax with or without Joe BidenSome of Biden’s 100-day pledges will require congressional action, like his promise to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and increase taxes on corporations. Biden also promised to make passage of the Equality Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, a priority in his first 100 days. That bill has passed the House but not the Senate.And some of his promises are waiting on Biden’s Cabinet secretaries to be confirmed by the Senate. On gun control, Biden has said he would direct his attorney general to deliver recommendations to restructure key Justice Department agencies to more effectively enforce the nation’s gun laws. He also pledged to have his secretary of Housing and Urban Development lead a task force to create recommendations for making housing a right for all Americans.Both his attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, and his nominee to lead the Housing Department, Rep. Marcia Fudge, are expected to win confirmation this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-first-50-days-where-he-stands-on-key-promises-101615353312656.html
10-03-2021||World||US rebuff to China over Dalai Lama signals Biden won’t take eyes off Tibet||The Joe Biden administration’s statement that the Chinese government should have no role in the succession of the Dalai Lama on the day Tibetans in 1959 rose against Beijing’s rule makes it evident that Washington will continue to press the Xi Jinping regime on Lhasa. The 14th Dalai Lama escaped from Lhasa on May 17, 1959, and reached Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by March-end. The refuge given to the 14th Dalai Lama by India was one of the principal triggers of the 1962 border skirmish."We believe that the Chinese government should have no role in the succession process of the Dalai Lama," State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Tuesday. Price recalled Beijing’s interference in the succession of the Panchen Lama more than 25 years ago and called the Chinese effort to impose its successor “an outrageous abuse of religious freedom.”ALSO WATCH | ‘China should have no role in Dalai Lama succession process’: Biden official﻿In December, former US President Donald Trump signed into law a bill to establish a US consulate in Tibet and called for an international coalition to ensure that the next Dalai Lama is solely appointed by the Tibetan Buddhist community without Chinese interference.Irrespective of the statements from Washington, analysts said the Xi Jinping regime will interfere in the Dalai Lama succession and anoint a Chinese Dalai Lama as opposed to one that may be appointed by the 14th Dalai Lama during his lifetime or beyond. It is not very difficult to figure that by having two Dalai Lamas and two Panchen Lama, the Chinese will seek to engineer chaos in the international Buddhist community, particularly in the Gelugpa sect, the most dominant school of Tibetan Buddhism.Given the Chinese political and economic clout, the international community will be only reduced to making noises as in the case of Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan. The Chinese economic clout is such that the Sunni Muslim nations are willing to look the other way to state abuses against the Uighur community in Xinjiang but are prepared to red flag India on Kashmir at the first given opportunity.While India is watching the 14th Dalai Lama succession plan very closely, the Modi government has gone beyond the thinking of past governments who thought, as one former top foreign ministry official put it at a high-level meeting, that this issue was akin to flogging a dead horse.Even though New Delhi has no intentions of deliberately needling China on the Dalai Lama issue despite Beijing’s routine pinpricks on Kashmir, it is unfazed by the routine threats issued by the Xi Jinping regime to anyone raising the so-called core issue of the middle kingdom. Such is the Chinese antipathy towards exiled Tibetan community that the issue of deploying Special Frontier Forces (SFF), made up entirely of Tibetan exiles, in East Ladakh and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was seriously raised by the Peoples’ Liberation Army commanders during the military dialogue with Indian commanders. The SFF was part of the Indian Army mission to occupy the Rezang La -Rechin La heights on the south banks of Pangong Tso last August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rebuff-to-china-over-dalai-lama-signals-biden-won-t-take-eyes-off-tibet-101615352260487.html

10-03-2021||World||China appears to censor ‘stock market’ from social media search as stocks fall||China’s stock rout turned so extreme that state-backed funds intervened to calm the market on Tuesday, but finding any news about what happened proved somewhat difficult on the mainland.On Weibo, the Twitter-like platform with about half a billion active users, a search for Chinese equivalent of “stock market” generated no posts on Wednesday, suggesting the phrase had been censored. Users could still post using the term, and searches for words that mean “plunge,” “A-shares” and “stocks” were successful as of 11 a.m. local time.An article in the Shanghai Securities News, one of China’s most widely circulated financial dailies, said large insurers bought stocks on Tuesday. The report also denied recent “rumors” that insurers had made large-scale redemptions of stock funds, citing investment managers at companies in the sector.Still, mentions of the stock plunge were notably absent from the front pages of China’s major financial newspapers on Wednesday, which instead focused on President Xi Jinping’s comments about national defense during the annual session of the National People’s Congress.The bearish mood in China’s stock market has been a challenge even for state-backed funds, casting a cloud over the Communist Party’s biggest political event of the year. In just 14 trading days the benchmark CSI 300 Index plummeted 14% from a 13-year high, wiping out more than $1.3 trillion of value and hammering the holdings of retail investors who piled in at the peak.Chinese media outlets often influence the market by downplaying recent turbulence or discouraging excess. In 2019, when stocks sank following threats from Donald Trump to impose more tariffs on Chinese exports, one article argued the bull market would resume. Posts about Trump’s comments were removed from social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-appears-to-censor-stock-market-from-social-media-search-as-stocks-fall-101615351165495.html

10-03-2021||World||US envoy urges Sudan to build inclusive govt, ensure peace, support minorities||The United States called on Sudan Tuesday to build an inclusive and representative government that ensures peace, supports people on the margins and helps “those who have suffered achieve justice.”US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield also called for implementation of the historic Juba Peace Agreement signed six months ago by the civilian-led transitional government and rebel groups, saying so far “the Sudanese people have not seen the commitment and engagement by signatory parties necessary for progress.”She told the UN Security Council that Sudan should also complete the formation of an inclusive Transitional Legislative Council, where women comprise at least 40 percent of the representatives.Sudan, which has been on a fragile path to democracy since the military ousted autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 following mass pro-democracy protests, is ruled by a transitional military-civilian government. On Feb. 10, a new Cabinet was sworn in that includes rebel ministers as part of the power-sharing deal the transitional authorities struck in Juba with a rebel alliance.Sudan’s largest single rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-North led by Abdel-Aziz al-Hilu, has been in talks with the transitional government but has yet to reach a deal with the government. Another major rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Army in the restive Darfur region, which is led by Abdel-Wahid Nour, rejects the transitional government and has not taken part in the talks.Thomas-Greenfield said a “shocking attack” in West Darfur in January, which reportedly killed 163 people and displaced some 50,000, was “a tragic reminder of the ongoing threats that civilians face in Sudan.”She called on the government to establish security forces, rule of law and justice institutions in Darfur including the Special Court for Darfur Crimes.Sudan’s transitional government faces towering challenges, including a huge budget deficit and widespread shortages of essential goods and soaring prices of bread and other staples. The country is $70 billion in debt and the rapidly deteriorating economic conditions triggered protests earlier this year in Khartoum and other cities across the country.On Feb. 21, Sudan began a managed flotation of its currency, an unprecedented but expected step to meet a major demand by international financial institutions to help transitional authorities overhaul the battered economy.The Security Council meeting also focused on the end of the joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur known as UNAMID on Dec. 31 and its replacement with a much smaller and solely political mission, known as United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan, or UNITAMS.The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the Arab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination. The government in Khartoum was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes and unleashing them on civilian populations — a charge it denies. UNAMID was established in 2007.Volker Perthes, the new UN special envoy for Sudan and head of UNITAMS, said in his first briefing to the Security Council that “Sudan is making significant advances in its transition. However, the remaining challenges are staggering.”On the plus side, he pointed to the new Cabinet including signatories of the Juba agreement, and the government's agreement on national priorities. These include addressing the dire socioeconomics conditions, fully implementing the Juba agreement and resuming negotiations with the two rebel groups that didn’t sign it, reforming the security sector, protecting civilians, promoting international relations, and advancing Sudan’s democratic transition.On the minus side, Perthes said a diverse Legislative Council needs to be formed swiftly and “is critical to broaden the support for the political transition.” He cited fears that gains for women’s rights in the constitutional document won’t be realized, and he also pointed to “frustration” by Sudanese young people over their lack of participation in transitional institutions.Perthes also warned that “economic hardships are posing a risk to Sudan’s stability.”“Inflation stood at 304% in January,” he said, adding that the country suffers from high rates of unemployment and poverty, with 13.4 million people — a quarter of the population — projected to need humanitarian assistance.Both Perthes and Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy, expressed concern at rising tensions along the Sudan-Ethiopia border.The UN envoy said 70,000 people recently arrived in Sudan, having fled the conflict between Ethiopian and allied forces and those supporting the now-fugitive leaders in embattled Tigray province who once dominated Ethiopia’s government.Thomas-Greenfield pointed to “the recent bellicose rhetoric and the positioning of additional forces around the el-Fashaga area” and warned that “the risk of miscalculation is high.”“So, we call on both sides to expand direct communications to prevent any further military escalation and commit to discussions -- without preconditions,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-urges-sudan-to-build-inclusive-govt-ensure-peace-support-minorities-101615341496341.html

10-03-2021||World||In message to China, Joe Biden to meet Australia, India, Japan PMs||US President Joe Biden will hold first-ever joint talks Friday with the leaders of Australia, India and Japan, boosting an emerging four-way alliance often cast as a bulwark against China.It will be one of the first summits, albeit in virtual format, for Biden, who has vowed to revive US alliances in the wake of the disarray of Donald Trump's administration."That President Biden has made this one of his earliest multilateral engagements speaks to the importance that we place on close cooperation with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday.The meeting of the so-called "Quad" comes amid rising tensions with China, which is seen as flexing its muscle both in trade and security realms.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that Biden was "taking this to another level.""It will be an historic moment in our region and it sends a strong message to the region about our support for a sovereign, independent Indo-Pacific," Morrison told reporters.Both Psaki and India, which earlier announced the participation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said that the talks would take up climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic -- two key priorities for Biden."The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of shared interest, and exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region," the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement.The talks, also involving Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, will touch as well on promoting maritime security and "ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines" to fight Covid-19 in Asia, the Indian statement said.China's growing assertiveness Japan said that Suga spoke separately Thursday to Modi and voiced alarm about China's "unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and China Sea" as well as the status of rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters that the Quad was well-equipped to deal with the world's "urgent challenges" but, asked about China, said, the format is "not about any single competitor."The summit follows talks on February 18 among the foreign ministers of the Quad when they pressed jointly for a restoration of democracy in Myanmar after the military ousted democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1.US officials cast the meeting as a key way of exerting pressure as India and Japan enjoy closer relationships with Myanmar's military -- which has historically counted on China as its main source of support.The Quad foreign ministers, however, were careful not to make an explicit mention of China, which has voiced alarm at what it sees as an effort to gang up on its interests in Asia.After Biden's election, Chinese state media had printed articles calling on India to end the Quad, seeing New Delhi as the most likely opponent.But views have hardened in India after a pitched battle in the Himalayas last year killed at least 20 Indian troops. China has named four dead in confirmation that took half a year.Australia has also shown growing willingness to participate in the Quad as relations deteriorate with Beijing, last year joining naval exercises with the three other nations off India's shores.The Quad was launched in 2007 by Japan's then prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was alarmed at China's growing assertiveness around Asia.Biden has pledged in general terms to continue his predecessor's hawkish line on China, including by pressing on human rights and territorial disputes.But the Biden administration has promised what it considers a more productive approach that includes boosting ties with allies and finding limited areas for cooperation with Beijing such as climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-message-to-china-joe-biden-to-meet-australia-india-japan-pms-101615340342034.html
10-03-2021||World||Arkansas governor signs near-total abortion ban into law||Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday signed into law legislation banning nearly all abortions in the state, a sweeping measure that supporters hope will force the US Supreme Court to revisit its landmark Roe v. Wade decision but opponents vow to block before it takes effect later this year.The Republican governor had expressed reservations about the bill, which only allows the procedure to save the life of the mother and does not provide exceptions for those impregnated in an act of rape or incest. Arkansas is one of at least 14 states where legislators have proposed outright abortion bans this year.Hutchinson said he was signing the bill because of its “overwhelming legislative support and my sincere and long-held pro-life convictions."The bans were pushed by Republicans who want to force the US Supreme Court to revisit its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide. Conservatives believe the court is more open to striking down the decision following former President Donald Trump's three appointments to the court.“We must abolish abortion in this nation just as we abolished slavery in the 19th century – all lives matter," Republican Sen. Jason Rapert, the bill's sponsor said in a statement.Hutchinson has signed several major abortion restrictions into law since taking office in 2015, but he had voiced concerns that this bill directly challenges Roe and about the lack of rape and incest exceptions. He repeated those concerns as he announced his decision.“(The ban) is in contradiction of binding precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, but it is the intent of the legislation to set the stage for the Supreme Court overturning current case law," he said in a statement released by his office. “I would have preferred the legislation to include the exceptions for rape and incest, which has been my consistent view, and such exceptions would increase the chances for a review by the US Supreme Court.”As the Legislature considered the measure, Hutchinson shared with lawmakers a letter written by an attorney for abortion opponents National Right to Life that said the chances of the bill leading to Roe being overturned were “very small and remote.” National Right to Life didn't take a position on the bill, though its Arkansas affiliate supported the ban.The legislation won't take effect until 90 days after the majority-Republican Legislature adjourns this year's session. That means it can't be enforced until this summer at the earliest. Abortion rights supporters said they plan to challenge the ban in court before then.The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas called the ban “cruel and unconstitutional."“Governor Hutchinson: we’ll see you in court," ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Dickson said.“This is politics at its very worst," Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. “At a time when people need economic relief and basic safety precautions, dismantling abortion access is cruel, dangerous, and blatantly unjust."Hutchinson had until Wednesday afternoon to take action on the bill before it would have become law without his signature, a move past governors have taken to express displeasure with a bill without risking an override fight with the Legislature. It takes a simple majority for the Legislature to override a governor's veto in Arkansas.Arkansas has some of the strictest abortion measures in the country and two years ago Hutchinson signed into law a measure that would ban the procedure if the Roe decision was overturned. Another measure Hutchinson signed in 2019 banning abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy is on hold due to a legal challenge.Several other restrictions are still being considered in the Legislature, including one approved by the Senate a day earlier that would require a woman having an abortion to first be shown an ultrasound.Another sweeping abortion ban was signed into law by South Carolina’s governor last month but was quickly blocked by a federal judge due to a legal challenge by Planned Parenthood. Alabama enacted a near-total ban on abortions in 2019 that has been blocked because of court challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arkansas-governor-signs-near-total-abortion-ban-into-law-101615338739073.html
10-03-2021||World||‘He grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me’: Iowa journalist recounts arrest||An Iowa journalist recounted getting pepper-sprayed and arrested while covering a protest for racial justice last year, testifying in her own defense Tuesday at her trial on charges stemming from the incident.Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri told jurors she was running away from a scene where riot police had shot tear gas and were advancing to disperse protesters outside a mall in Des Moines, Iowa. She said that after she rounded the corner of a Verizon store, she saw an officer charging at her and put her hands up.“I wasn't doing anything wrong,” Sahouri said. “I said, ‘I’m press, I'm press, I'm press.' He grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me and as he was doing so said, ‘That's not what I asked'."Sahouri said the pepper spray was “extremely painful” and made her think she was going to go blind.Sahouri’s testimony came on the second day of a trial in which Sahouri and her former boyfriend, Spenser Robnett, are charged with failure to disperse and interference with official acts. The case has drawn widespread criticism from media and human rights advocates, who call the charges an attack on press freedom. The pair face fines and potentially jail time if convicted of the misdemeanors.Judge Lawrence McLellan on Tuesday reserved a ruling on the defense's motion for an acquittal, and could issue one from the bench Wednesday. A six-member jury is expected to begin deliberations Wednesday morning.Body camera video played for jurors before Sahouri's testimony backed up her account, showing that she was temporarily blinded and hurting from pepper spray and repeatedly told police she was a reporter.“This is my job,” Sahouri tells an officer. “I’m just doing my job. I’m a journalist.”The Freedom of the Press Foundation called the video powerful evidence that Sahouri was “arrested while doing her job reporting on historic protests” and should have never faced prosecution.Robnett, who accompanied Sahouri to the protest for safety reasons, also took the stand Tuesday. He said he saw Officer Luke Wilson spray Sahouri from close range, and that he stepped forward to say that Sahouri was a Register reporter. The officer then shot pepper spray at him, knocking him to the ground, before he was handcuffed and jailed, Robnett said.Robnett and Sahouri testified that they did not hear any earlier police orders to leave the scene, and that they did not interfere with the officers who arrested them.The newspaper assigned Sahouri to cover the protest at Merle Hay mall days after the death of George Floyd, a Black Minneapolis man who was declared dead after a white officer put his knee on his neck for about nine minutes.Des Moines Register executive editor Carol Hunter testified that Sahouri did her job “very well” that night, reporting observations and images of the event live on Twitter. She noted the protests were the largest in the city in decades.A second Register reporter who was with Sahouri, Katie Akin, testified that she was surprised to see Sahouri get arrested because “I didn't understand us to be breaking any laws." Akin yelled that they were journalists and showed a press badge, before Akin was told to leave without arrest.Wilson, an 18-year Des Moines Police Department veteran, said he responded to the protest and found a “riotous mob” breaking store windows and throwing rocks and water bottles at officers. He said his unit was told to clear a parking lot, and he used a device known as a fogger to blanket the area with clouds of pepper spray.He said he decided Sahouri needed to be arrested when she did not leave and that he was unaware she was a journalist when he grabbed her. He said that Robnett tried to pull Sahouri out of his grasp, and he deployed more pepper spray that “incapacitated” Robnett.Sahouri had her hands cuffed in zip ties and was taken to jail in a police van.Under cross-examination by defense attorney Nicholas Klinefeldt, Wilson said that he charged Sahouri with interference because she briefly pulled her left arm away while he was arresting her. He acknowledged that he didn't mention that claim in his police report.Wilson said he failed to activate his body camera before arresting Sahouri, saying he mistakenly believed it was recording.The cameras are always capturing video when on and can retrieve video of incidents that were not recorded in some circumstances. Officers who fail to record significant incidents are required by department policy to notify supervisors, who can then try to recover video. Wilson said he didn't do that.Prosecutors say Sahouri and Robnett ignored police orders to leave the area that were broadcast over a public address system about 90 minutes before their arrests.The defense argued those orders intended only to clear an intersection where protesters were surrounding a squad car. Body camera video played for jurors showed officers yelling at protesters to get out of the intersection and be peaceful. Separate orders to disperse could be heard faintly in the background — so quiet that an officer testifying for the prosecution struggled to make them out.Sahouri testified she didn't hear any dispersal orders and continued reporting on what she called a historical moment.“It's important for journalists to be on the scene and document what's happening,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-grabbed-me-pepper-sprayed-me-iowa-journalist-recounts-arrest-101615337984122.html
10-03-2021||World||New owner Buzzfeed lays off 45 from HuffPost newsroom||Buzzfeed announced Tuesday that it has laid off 45 reporters, editors and producers from the newly acquired HuffPost.HuffPost Executive Editor Hillary Frey, the website’s executive editor, and Executive Editor Louise Roug also resigned over the layoffs, Buzzfeed said.The dismissals come just three weeks after Buzzfeed acquired HuffPost, the media outlet founded in 2005 as The Huffington Post, from Verizon Media.“We never got a fair shot to prove our worth,” the HuffPost union said in a statement.According to excerpts released by the company, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti told employees at a meeting that “we will begin to restructure HuffPost today to fast-track its path to profitability. Unfortunately that includes staff reductions, and a number of talented colleagues will be laid off over the next few days.”Peretti said “losses last year exceeded $20M, and would be similar this year without intervention. Though BuzzFeed is a profitable company, we don’t have the resources to support another two years of losses."HuffPost Canada will be shut down under the restructuring.The union said the layoffs included nearly 30 percent of its membership.“We are devastated and infuriated, particularly after an exhausting year of covering a pandemic and working from home," the union's statement said.Many of the laid off employees were lamenting losing their jobs on social media after stints of many years, and objected to the way they were told, saying the password for entering the remote meeting was a variation of “spring is here,” making them blindsided by what would come later.Reporter Rowaida Abdelaziz called it “an absolute cruel and brutal day at HuffPost. I am speechless.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-owner-buzzfeed-lays-off-45-from-huffpost-newsroom-101615337723031.html
10-03-2021||World||Volunteers are key at Covid-19 vaccine sites. It pays off with a shot||When Seattle's largest health care system got a mandate from Washington state to create a mass Covid-19 vaccination site, organizers knew that gathering enough volunteers would be almost as crucial as the vaccine itself.“We could not do this without volunteers,” said Renee Rassilyer-Bomers, chief quality officer for Swedish Health Services and head of its vaccination site at Seattle University. “The sheer volume and number of folks that we wanted to be able to serve and bring in requires … 320 individuals each day."As states ramp up vaccination distribution in the fight against the coronavirus, volunteers are needed to do everything from direct traffic to check people in so vaccination sites run smoothly. In return for their work, they're often given a shot. Many people who don't yet qualify for a vaccine — including those who are young and healthy — have been volunteering in hopes of getting a dose they otherwise may not receive for months. Large vaccination clinics across the country have seen thousands trying to nab limited numbers of volunteer shifts.It's raised questions at a time when supplies are limited and some Americans have struggled to get vaccinated even if they are eligible. But medical ethicists say volunteers are key to the public health effort and there's nothing wrong with them wanting protection from the virus.Ben Dudden, 35, of Roanoke, Virginia, volunteered at a mass vaccination clinic in the nearby city of Salem on a day off from his part-time job at the Roanoke Pinball Museum. His wife, a nurse practitioner who was administering doses, encouraged him to volunteer in case he could get vaccinated.He spent that January day helping people fill out questionnaires, not knowing if he might get the coveted dose.“It wasn’t an official thing like, ‘Everybody who needs a vaccine come this way.’ I kind of had to ask,” Dudden said. “At end of day, I found whoever was in charge of that.”He got what he was hoping for and still wants to volunteer again.“It was a little bit of a selfish thing — ‘I’m gonna get the vaccine if I do this’ — but for me, it wasn’t the only factor,” Dudden said.At the Seattle vaccination clinic, Swedish Health Services considers volunteers part of the state's Phase 1 vaccination group. About 5,000 have been inoculated, and about 1,000 of them have come back to work again, Rassilyer-Bomer said.During their shifts, volunteers are handed colored vests matched to their skill level and experience. The majority wear orange for general tasks, which includes sanitizing clipboards, asking people to fill out forms, taking temperatures and monitoring the newly vaccinated to ensure no dangerous side effects.Some may question whether it’s fair for volunteers to get to the front of the line for what’s often clerical work.Nancy Berlinger, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center, a research institute in Garrison, New York, said the bottom line is that volunteers are interacting with the public and there’s nothing wrong with them wanting protection.They also go through training and other obligations.“There would be easier ways to game the system,” Berlinger said. “If that was really your goal, this could take more work I think than some other routes I can think of.”While many volunteer shifts are several hours on weekdays, Berlinger said that doesn’t necessarily mean only people of a certain class or demographic can sacrifice that much time.“That could apply to students, it could apply to people who are unemployed, people who are retired. It could be people who are family caregivers,” Berlinger said.On a chilly January night in suburban Phoenix, Lou Ann Lovell, a 67-year-old retiree, got the Pfizer vaccine after volunteering from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. at a state-run site at State Farm Stadium, where the Arizona Cardinals play. Her daughter persuaded her and other relatives to volunteer.Lovell committed before realizing those 65 and older would be eligible for vaccines days later. Still, she’s glad she did.“For the first time, I felt I was part of something that was really important and big,” said Lovell, who has since volunteered a second time and hopes to do it a third. “You stand there and see all these headlights and people are just continually pouring in there.”The stadium and another state-run site in metro Phoenix require a combined 3,900 volunteers a week. HandsOn Greater Phoenix, a nonprofit handling online volunteer recruitment, opens 1,400 to 2,000 spots a few times a week, and interest hasn't waned, CEO Rhonda Oliver said. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people try to sign up every time new spots open, she said.Volunteers who have nabbed shifts say they shouldn’t be lumped in with those who believe they’re entitled to a vaccine.In the Seattle area, three King County hospitals came under fire last month after revelations that donors, board members and some hospital volunteers used their connections to get shots. The King County Council approved a measure calling on state lawmakers and Gov. Jay Inslee to make it illegal to grant special access to the vaccine.Berlinger said there’s a clear delineation between a connected official and a volunteer at a vaccine clinic getting a shot.“The volunteers we’re talking about at registration centers are people who are part of the public health effort. They are performing a crucial role,” Berlinger said. “It’s easier to help people who already have privilege. The thing about COVID is we have to push away from that and we have to say, ‘No, we must allocate vaccine and vaccination.'”Lovell, the retired volunteer in Arizona, said critics should target the healthy 20-somethings she saw trying to get the vaccine the night she volunteered.“If you want to volunteer, volunteer and work," she said. "If you say, ‘I don’t want to do that,’ then wait until your number comes up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volunteers-are-key-at-covid-19-vaccine-sites-it-pays-off-with-a-shot-101615337094232.html

This is where the Earth Fund will be helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-plans-to-spend-10-billion-on-climate-change-by-2030-101615336759531.html
10-03-2021||World||Dallas cop charged in alleged murder was under investigation in 2017: Report||A Dallas police officer charged in an alleged murder-for-hire scheme was being investigated for longer than authorities have previously acknowledged, sharpening questions about why he continued to patrol the city while under investigation for the 2017 killings.After Bryan Riser was arrested, former Dallas police Chief U. Reneé Hall said he was “first identified as a person-of-interest in 2019” and was kept on the job to avoid tipping him off to the investigation. But in 2017, a Dallas police detective testified in court that Riser was the “subject” of an investigation into the killing of 31-year-old Liza Saenz, according to a transcript of the proceeding.Riser was charged last week with two counts of capital murder in the killings of Saenz and 61-year-old Albert Douglas. He is being held on a $5 million bond and his attorney, Toby Shook, said the 36-year-old officer is innocent.During the September 2017 court hearing, the detective also said Saenz lived with Riser’s father and that before her death she had been a witness in another murder case. The testimony, which was first reported by the Dallas Morning News, came during a detention hearing in a federal drug case against Riser’s dad, Byron Riser.Shook previously said Saenz lived with the elder Riser at one point, but that his client “didn’t have a relationship with” her.Byron Riser pleaded guilty in 2018 to possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and was sentenced to five years in prison. He’s currently at a residential re-entry center in Texas on community supervision, Shook said.Bryan Riser's arrest was announced Thursday by police Chief Eddie Garcia, who took over the department last month after Hall resigned at the end of 2020. During a news conference, Garcia said Riser became a “suspect” in the case in 2019 and sought to distinguish that from being “a person of interest.”“I think the community should know that this police department wants to be as thorough as possible because we certainly don't want someone slipping through the cracks that has no business wearing this uniform,” Garcia said. He added that the department was reviewing Riser's arrests.Garcia fired Riser for “adverse conduct” on Tuesday, according to a statement from the department. A police spokeswoman, Cpl. Melinda Gutierrez, declined to comment on emailed questions about the 2017 testimony.Authorities have alleged that Riser offered to pay three men to kidnap and kill Douglas and Saenz. The men were later charged with capital murder and one of them came forward and implicated Riser in 2019, according to an affidavit for the officer's arrest.During his 2017 testimony, Detective Kevin Whitworth said he began investigating the officer after the father of Saenz’s child was convicted in a separate murder case.Saenz was supposed to convince witnesses not to testify, Whitworth said, and after the father of her child was found guilty someone was heard in the courtroom blaming her. The detective said Saenz’s body was pulled from a river in southwest Dallas not long after that.He said Riser came under scrutiny because of phone calls around that time between him, his father and “the main suspect” in Saenz’s killing.Shook said Riser knew one of the men charged in Saenz’s killing, Emmanuel Kilpatrick, from high school and that they reconnected in 2017 after a chance encounter. Kilpatrick, 34, is now serving life in prison for the killings of a father and son.The defense lawyer said that case against Riser has “several red flags,” including being based on the word of someone who has “all the reason in the world to lie and try to gain an advantage by trying to implicate a police officer."On Monday, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson formed a City Council committee to investigate why Riser continued to serve while under investigation. The seven-member committee is empowered to subpoena witnesses and compel city employees to turn over records.“This is an awful situation, and the public deserves answers regarding who knew what, when they knew it, and why the officer remained on active duty,” the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dallas-cop-charged-in-alleged-murder-was-under-investigation-in-2017-report-101615336387529.html
10-03-2021||World||Hackers access 150,000 security cams' live feed, expose Tesla, jails, hospitals||A group of hackers say they breached a massive trove of security-camera data collected by Silicon Valley startup Verkada Inc., gaining access to live feeds of 150,000 surveillance cameras inside hospitals, companies, police departments, prisons and schools.Companies whose footage was exposed include carmaker Tesla Inc. and software provider Cloudflare Inc. In addition, hackers were able to view video from inside women’s health clinics, psychiatric hospitals and the offices of Verkada itself. Some of the cameras, including in hospitals, use facial-recognition technology to identify and categorize people captured on the footage. The hackers say they also have access to the full video archive of all Verkada customers.In a video seen by Bloomberg, a Verkada camera inside Florida hospital Halifax Health showed what appeared to be eight hospital staffers tackling a man and pinning him to a bed. Halifax Health is featured on Verkada’s public-facing website in a case study entitled: “How a Florida Healthcare Provider Easily Updated and Deployed a Scalable HIPAA Compliant Security System.”Another video, shot inside a Tesla warehouse in Shanghai, shows workers on an assembly line. The hackers said they obtained access to 222 cameras in Tesla factories and warehouses.The data breach was carried out by an international hacker collective and intended to show the pervasiveness of video surveillance and the ease with which systems could be broken into, said Tillie Kottmann, one of the hackers who claimed credit for breaching San Mateo, California-based Verkada. Kottmann, who uses they/them pronouns, previously claimed credit for hacking chipmaker Intel Corp. and carmaker Nissan Motor Co. Kottmann said their reasons for hacking are “lots of curiosity, fighting for freedom of information and against intellectual property, a huge dose of anti-capitalism, a hint of anarchism -- and it’s also just too much fun not to do it.”“We have disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent any unauthorized access,” a Verkada spokesperson said in a statement. “Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this issue, and we have notified law enforcement.”A person with knowledge of the matter said Verkada’s chief information security officer, an internal team and an external security firm are investigating the incident. The company is working to notify customers and set up a support line to address questions, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.Representatives of Tesla, Cloudflare and other companies identified in this story didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives of the jails, hospitals and schools named in this article either declined to comment or didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.A video seen by Bloomberg shows officers in a police station in Stoughton, Massachusetts, questioning a man in handcuffs. The hackers say they also gained access to the security cameras of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed more than 20 people in 2012.Also available to the hackers were 330 security cameras inside the Madison County Jail in Huntsville, Alabama. Verkada offers a feature called “People Analytics,” which lets a customer “search and filter based on many different attributes, including gender traits, clothing color, and even a person’s face,” according to a Verkada blog post. Images seen by Bloomberg show that the cameras inside the jail, some of which are hidden inside vents, thermostats and defibrillators, track inmates and correctional staff using the facial-recognition technology. The hackers say they were able to access live feeds and archived video, in some cases including audio, of interviews between police officers and criminal suspects, all in the high-definition resolution known as 4K.Kottmann said their group was able to obtain “root” access on the cameras, meaning they could use the cameras to execute their own code. That access could, in some instances, allow them to pivot and obtain access to the broader corporate network of Verkada’s customers, or hijack the cameras and use them as a platform to launch future hacks. Obtaining this degree of access to the camera didn’t require any additional hacking, as it was a built-in feature, Kottmann said.The hackers’ methods were unsophisticated: they gained access to Verkada through a “Super Admin” account, allowing them to peer into the cameras of all of its customers. Kottmann says they found a user name and password for an administrator account publicly exposed on the internet. After Bloomberg contacted Verkada, the hackers lost access to the video feeds and archives, Kottmann said.The hackers say they were able to peer into multiple locations of the luxury gym chain Equinox. At Wadley Regional Medical Center, a hospital in Texarkana, Texas, hackers say they looked through Verkada cameras pointed at nine ICU beds. Hackers also say they watched cameras at Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital, in Arizona, and were also able to see a detailed record of who used Verkada access control cards to open certain doors, and when they did so. A representative of Wadley declined to comment.The hack “exposes just how broadly we’re being surveilled, and how little care is put into at least securing the platforms used to do so, pursuing nothing but profit,” Kottmann said. “It’s just wild how I can just see the things we always knew are happening, but we never got to see.” Kottman said they gained access to Verkada’s system on Monday morning.Verkada, founded in 2016, sells security cameras that customers can access and manage through the web. In January 2020, it raised $80 million in venture capital funding, valuing the company at $1.6 billion. Among the investors was Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley’s oldest firms.Kottmann calls the hacking collective “Advanced Persistent Threat 69420,” a light-hearted reference to the designations cybersecurity firms give to state sponsored hacking groups and criminal cybergangs.In October 2020, Verkada fired three employees after reports surfaced that workers had used its cameras to take pictures of female colleagues inside the Verkada office and make sexually explicit jokes about them. Verkada CEO Filip Kaliszan said in a statement to Vice at the time that the company “terminated the three individuals who instigated this incident, engaged in egregious behavior targeting coworkers, or neglected to report the behavior despite their obligations as managers.”Kottmann said they were able to download the entire list of thousands of Verkada customers, as well as the company’s balance sheet, which lists assets and liabilities. As a closely held company, Verkada does not publish its financial statements. Kottman said hackers watched through the camera of a Verkada employee who had set one of the cameras up inside his home. One of the saved clips from the camera shows the employee completing a puzzle with his family.“If you are a company who has purchased this network of cameras and you are putting them in sensitive places, you may not have the expectation that in addition to being watched by your security team that there is some admin at the camera company who is also watching,” said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who was briefed on the breach by Bloomberg.Inside Arizona’s Graham County detention facility, which has 17 cameras, videos are given titles by the center’s staff and saved to a Verkada account. One video, filmed in the “Commons Area,” is titled “ROUNDHOUSE KICK OOPSIE.” A video filed inside the “Rear Cell Block” is called “SELLERS SNIFFING/KISSING WILLARD???” Another video, filmed inside “Drunk Tank Exterior” is titled “AUTUMN BUMPS HIS OWN HEAD.” Two videos filmed from “Back Cell” are titled “STARE OFF - DONT BLINK!” and “LANCASTER LOSES BLANKET.”The hackers also obtained access to Verkada cameras in Cloudflare offices in San Francisco, Austin, London and New York. The cameras at Cloudflare’s headquarters rely on facial recognition, according to images seen by Bloomberg.Security cameras and facial-recognition technology are often used inside corporate offices and factories to protect proprietary information and guard against an insider threat, said the EFF’s Galperin.“There are many legitimate reasons to have surveillance inside of a company,” Galperin added. “The most important part is to have the informed consent of your employees. Usually this is done inside the employee handbook, which no one reads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-access-150-000-security-cams-live-feed-expose-tesla-jails-hospitals-101615335334179.html

Not all of the ratings are in, and CBS licensed the interview to air in more than 80 territories, the network said.In the United States, the interview was seen by 17.8 million people on CBS, the Nielsen company said. It aired a night later in Britain, where ITV said it had 13.3 million viewers, a huge number for a smaller country.CBS said the interview will be shown again Friday, from 8 to 10 pm.Also Read: Queen Elizabeth responds to Harry and Meghan's racism accusationsIt was still a topic of conversation on Tuesday. In Britain, former CNN personality Piers Morgan quit the “Good Morning, Britain” program following a furor over comments he made criticizing the Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. He was dressed down by the show's weather forecaster and stormed off the set.Winfrey's talk was the rare interview to exceed the hype. CBS had originally set aside 90 minutes for the broadcast but, after the interview actually took place, bumped it up to two hours.The success is likely to have reverberations for the industry, perhaps most immediately bolstering broadcast television's case that it is still a potent force for showing big events.Also Read| Suicide to racism: Harry, Meghan on royal messIt might also have networks looking for more big-name interviews.

It also showed “robust but lower” activity against the South Africa variant, according to a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.The research was supported by Pfizer and BioNTech and performed by scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas.More than 700,000 lives have been lost to Covid-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean since the pandemic began, according to an AFP tally on Monday evening from official sources. The region, which encompasses 34 countries and territories in South and Central America and the Caribbean plus Mexico, recorded 700,022 deaths - the second-highest number of virus fatalities after Europe. Brazil and Mexico account for two-thirds of the region’s coronavirus deaths.For the first time in nearly three and a half months, the United States recorded fewer than 1,000 deaths in a day from Covid-19 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University. In 24 hours, 749 people died from the coronavirus, far below the peak of 4,473 deaths recorded on January 12.Disinfectant spray for journalistsPoliticians are often accused of sanitising the news.

10-03-2021||World||10 years after Fukushima, Japan remembers ‘man-made’ disaster||When a huge earthquake and tsunami struck Japan on March 11, 2011, devastating towns and triggering nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, a stunned world watched the chaotic struggle to contain the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.An onslaught of waves sparked by the 9.0-magnitude quake crashed into the northeastern coast, killing nearly 20,000 people and crippling the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant. More than 160,000 residents fled as radiation spewed into the air.At the time, some – including Prime Minister Naoto Kan – feared Tokyo would need to be evacuated, or worse.“Fukushima is stamped for the rest of the history of nuclear energy,” said Kiyoshi Kurokawa, head of an investigation that concluded the disaster was “profoundly man-made”.The government has spent about $300 billion to rebuild the tsunami-devastated Tohoku region, but areas around the Fukushima plant remain off-limits, worries about radiation levels linger and many who left have settled elsewhere.Japan is again debating the role of nuclear power in its energy mix as the resource-poor country aims to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050 to fight global warming. But an NHK TV survey showed 85% of the public worries about nuclear accidents.Energy policy was left in limbo after Shinzo Abe led his pro-nuclear energy Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) back to power the year after the disaster, ousting the novice Democratic Party of Japan, whose image was tainted by its handling of Fukushima.‘Result of collusion’Kurokawa’s commission, appointed by parliament, concluded in 2012 that the Fukushima accident was “the result of collusion between the government, regulators and Tokyo Electric Power Co” and a lack of governance. Abe resigned last year, citing poor health, and his successor, Yoshihide Suga, has announced a goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050.Proponents say nuclear power is vital to decarbonisation. Critics say cost, safety and the challenge of storing nuclear waste are all reasons to avoid it.“Those talking about atomic power are people in the ‘nuclear village’, who want to protect their vested interests,” former PM Kan said last week.The mass demonstrations against nuclear power seen in the wake of 3/11 have faded, but distrust lingers. A February Asahi newspaper survey found that nationwide, 53% are opposed to restarting reactors, compared with 32% in favour.“Ten years have passed and some people have forgotten. The zeal is gone,” said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo political science professor. “Restarts are not happening, so people think if they just wait, nuclear power will disappear.”Nuclear future bleak?Only nine of Japan’s 33 remaining reactors have been approved for restarts under post-Fukushima safety standards and only four are operating, compared with 54 before the disaster.Nuclear power supplied just 6% of Japan’s energy needs in the first half of 2020 compared with 23.1% for renewable sources – far behind Germany’s 46.3% – and nearly 70% for fossil fuels.Extending the lifespan of Japan’s 33 existing commercial reactors to 60 years, there would be only 18 in 2050 and none by 2069, said Takeo Kikkawa, an adviser to the government on energy policy.“Japan is a resource-poor country so we should not casually abandon the nuclear option,” Kikkawa said. “But in reality, the future of nuclear power is bleak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-years-after-fukushima-japan-remembers-man-made-disaster-101615321493301.html
10-03-2021||World||Pakistan to get 45 million doses of Indian-made vaccine via Gavi: Report||As many as 45 million doses of Indian coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine Covishield will reach in Pakistan in March, according to a report published in Pakistan daily The Nation. This will be the first batch of Covishield, the vaccine developed by the Serum Institute Of India (SII), to reach India's neighbouring country.  The doses will be received under an agreement with Gavi, the vaccine alliance, the report said, adding that additional 16 million doses will be received by June this year.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA total of 27.5m people, including frontline workers and senior citizens, have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in Pakistan, Federal secretary of the Ministry of national health services regulations and coordination Aamir Ashraf Khawaja said in a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The meeting was headed by PAC chairperson Rana Tanveer Hussain.The government has decided to prioritise health workers and people over the age of 65 for vaccination, Khawaja said. Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps provide vaccines to developing countries, had signed an agreement with Pakistan to provide Covid-19 vaccine in September 2020, the report said. According to the health secretary, it was expected earlier that the vaccine doses would arrive under the agreement in the first week of March but the dispatch got delayed.China-made vaccine CanSino, which would cost USD 13 or around Pakistani Rs2,000 per person, had completed its phase-three trials in Pakistan with 75 per cent efficacy and a total of 18,000 people were inoculated using the vaccine, news agency ANI said, quoting a report from The Express Tribune.According to the health authorities, no serious buyers from the private sector had come forward as the applications received so far were incomplete.

10-03-2021||World||China hasn’t withdrawn from several LAC positions, says top US commander||China still hasn’t withdrawn from “several forward positions” it seized during clashes with Indian forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a top US military commander told lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.Admiral Philip S. Davidson, who commands the US military’s Indo-Pacific Command, also told lawmakers that the US had helped India over its border conflict by providing information, cold-weather clothing and other equipment.“The PLA has not yet withdrawn from several forward positions it seized following the initial clash, and the consequent escalation of tensions between the PRC and India has resulted in casualties on both sides,” Davidson said in prepared remarks at a Senate hearing on the US Indo-Pacific Command.The Chinese and Indian armed forces completed the withdrawal of their respective troops from parts of the disputed border in Ladakh - around Pangong Tso - in late February after protracted negotiations.The US commander described Chinese aggression on the LAC as a manifestation of Beijing’s “expansionary territorial ambitions”.He added that the “large-scale mobilisation - which is particularly notable considering the elevation, terrain, and distance involved - has stoked regional concerns that the PRC will increasingly use force to achieve desired outcomes”.Davidson held China responsible for starting the border clashes. “The standoff was predicated by clashes over construction activities near the disputed border. PLA ground manoeuvre and support elements subsequently forward-deployed roughly 50,000 soldiers along the LAC, leading to a counter-deployment by the Indian Army,” he said.Davidson went on to say that the border conflict with China has “opened their (India’s) eyes to what cooperative effort with others might mean for their own defensive needs”.“I think you’ll see India in the very near term, you know, remain committed to their nonaligned approach, but I think they will deepen their engagement with the Quad, and I think that’s a key strategic opportunity for us, Australia and Japan,” the US admiral added.Davidson spoke at length about US military ties with India. The current relationship “presents a historic opportunity to deepen ties and solidify what I consider the ‘defining partnership of the 21st century’,” he said, using a phrase popularised by former US president Barack Obama for the bilateral relationship.He went on to recount the three foundational agreements signed by the two countries in recent years: increasing military cooperation; growing defence purchases by India from the US; and joint exercises.He concluded that the US “defines the security relationship with India as a strategic imperative”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hasn-t-withdrawn-from-several-lac-positions-says-top-us-commander-101615314444113.html
