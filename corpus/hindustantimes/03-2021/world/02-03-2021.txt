Church bells will toll at 8: 45 a.m., the time of the near-simultaneous attacks, and special prayers will be offered for justice for the victims.Two local Muslim groups that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group have been blamed for the attacks at six locations — two Roman Catholic churches, one Protestant church and three top hotels.Of those killed, 171 were attending Easter services at Catholic churches. More than 500 people were wounded in the attacks.Ranjith said the mandate of the commission was to find the people, sources of funding and supporters behind the attacks, but such details were not in the report. He said the church expects the government to carry out a further investigation with vigor.“We want to stress that if there is no concrete action with regard to finding answers to those questions ... we will be forced to call upon the entire nation to protest on the 21st of April, the second anniversary of the bomb attacks," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/easter-sunday-bombings-lankan-catholic-church-declares-black-sunday-on-march-7-101614705665587.html

The new design is very similar, but the adhesive tape strip has been redesigned to look nothing like a moustache.lmao I completely missed that amazon quietly tweaked its new icon to make it look… less like hitler pic.twitter.com/Jh8UC8Yg3uAs reported by Mashable, Amazon would not officially admit that this was the reason behind the redesigning icon.In a statement to The Verge, the company said it "designed the new icon to spark anticipation, excitement, and joy when customers start their shopping journey on their phone, just as they do when they see our boxes on their door step."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-tweaks-its-app-icon-after-hitler-moustache-comparison-101614704114316.html

The previous 7 billion-yuan loan was endorsed and paid in 2020.The Shanghai-based bank had also fully disbursed USD 1 billion loan to India under emergency assistance programme last year, to support the government in containing the Covid-19 outbreak and reduce human, social and economic losses.The latest loan to China will support the restoration of production activities, stabilise employment, promote sustainable economic development, a statement from the bank said.India this year has taken over as the rotating chair of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and is set to hold the annual summit of the five-member bloc.In April 2020, the bank set up a mechanism to offer emergency assistance program loans to its member countries, assisting them in combating the pandemic. It has so far approved seven anti-virus-related emergency loans, totalling about USD 7 billion.The NDB is a multilateral development bank founded in 2014 by BRICS member countries to support infrastructure and sustainable development projects in the BRICS countries and other emerging economies. It formally opened on July 21, 2015 in the eastern Chinese metropolis, Shanghai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brics-new-development-bank-grants-over-usd-1-billion-covid-19-assistance-loan-to-china-101614702873699.html

Researchers at the University of São Paulo, in collaboration with Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, found that a second wave of infection in Manaus, a city thought to have a high level of existing immunity from the first wave, was associated with the emergence of the new P.1 variant.“P.1 accrued 17 mutations, including 3 virologically-important mutations in a region of the spike protein that interacts with the receptor the virus uses to enter human cells," Dr Nuno Faria of Imperial College London said in a statement.Using statistical analysis of genome sequencing data, the researchers found that the P.1 lineage, which has been identified in more than 20 countries worldwide, has likely been circulating in Manaus since early November 2020. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and available as a preprint.They have estimated that the variant evades 25-61 per cent of protective immunity arising from infection with previously circulating variants. This means 25 to 61 out of 100 people previously infected with non-VOCs that circulated in Manaus could be re-infected if they are exposed to P.1. The study further estimated that the variant is associated with a 1.1-1.8 times increased risk of mortality compared to previous variants circulating in the Amazonian region.Read | Covid-19: Which countries have most number of fully vaccinated people?However, the researchers acknowledged the limitation of the study, saying it is unclear whether the increased risk of mortality is due to the variant or the collapse of the health system in Manaus due to the large second wave. The modelling study has only considered acquired immunity from the previous infection and not from vaccination, which means there’s no evidence that current vaccines are less effective against P.1 lineage.The team stressed that enhanced genomic surveillance of variants around the globe remains critical to accelerating pandemic responsiveness. "Global collaborative efforts on rapid virus genome sequencing are allowing us to identify SARS-CoV-2 lineages of concerns in near real-time. Yet, uncertainty in the ways SARS-CoV-2 is changing and implications for vaccine design calls for much more sequencing and analysis of virus genomes globally,” Professor Ester Sabino of Universidade de São Paulo said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-variant-infected-many-already-recovered-from-covid-19-study-101614702401769.html

Three Chinese-made vaccines require two shots, while another one requires a single dose.China, which has approved four locally developed coronavirus vaccines for use on the general public, had administered 52.52 million doses as of Feb. 28, Zhong said.Authorities had aimed to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year in February, official media outlet Global Times reported in January.Sinovac Biotech's vaccine has been used in mass vaccination drives in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. CanSino Biologics Inc has agreed to supply millions of doses to Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aim-to-vaccinate-40-citizens-by-end-of-july-china-101614702858213.html
02-03-2021||World||Sri Lanka offers to develop new port terminal with India, Japan amid differences||Sri Lanka on Tuesday offered to develop a container terminal of Colombo port with investors from India and Japan, almost a month after it cancelled a tripartite agreement signed in 2019 on developing another facility with the two other countries.Caving in to pressure from labour unions, Sri Lanka decided on February 1 to scrap the agreement signed with India and Japan on developing the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo port. The unions had opposed a joint venture with Indian and Japanese investors holding a 49% stake.On Tuesday, a Sri Lankan government spokesperson told the media in Colombo that a meeting of the cabinet on Monday decided to develop the West Container Terminal (WCT) of Colombo port as a public-private limited company with parties nominated by the Indian and Japanese governments.People familiar with developments in New Delhi and Colombo said on condition of anonymity that no decision has been made as yet by authorities in India and Japan regarding participation in the WCT project. The people also pointed out the agreement on ECT was a tripartite mechanism involving all three governments, whereas the Sri Lankan government’s decision on WCT is aimed at private investors.Both India and Japan were irked by Sri Lanka’s sudden move to scrap the ECT agreement. India said at the time it expected Sri Lanka to abide by the agreement on the trilateral development and operation of the key terminal, while Japan said it was “regrettable” that Sri Lanka had opted to hand over operations at ECT to a state-run body instead of sticking to the agreement.The Sri Lankan government spokesperson's announcement on Tuesday said the build, operate and transfer (BOT) plan for WCT was forwarded to the Indian and Japanese missions in Colombo with a request to “nominate investors”.The spokesperson contended a proposal presented by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZ) had been “approved by the Indian high commission” while the Japanese side was yet to name an investor.The spokesperson further contended the Sri Lankan cabinet had approved a proposal to develop WCT on build, operate and transfer basis for 35 years along with APSEZ, its local representative John Keels Holding PLC and Sri Lanka Ports Authority.However, the people cited above said there was “no question” of the Indian mission approving any investor. “This new decision by Sri Lanka is about creating a public-private partnership for attracting investors, and there is no role for the government,” said a person.The Japanese side too has been in touch with the Sri Lankan government on the ECT issue and has not made any decision regarding WCT, the people said.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said the Sri Lankan government’s decision was more of a damage control exercise. “WCT is neither as significant nor as economically viable as ECT. The disposition of Sri Lanka is noteworthy in that it swings away from India whenever a key decision has to be made. At a time when India and Japan are trying to reach out, it rankles that the other side is not upfront about what it is doing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-offers-to-develop-new-port-terminal-with-india-japan-amid-differences-101614698502153.html
02-03-2021||World||China's ex-finance minister says nation's fiscal situation 'extremely severe'||China's fiscal situation is "extremely severe with risks and challenges", former finance minister Lou Jiwei has warned, citing fallout from aggressive US stimulus policies, the global economic slowdown during the pandemic, an ageing Chinese population and mounting domestic local government debt, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).China's revenue is expected to remain low in the next five years, with no prospect of spending cuts, added Lou."The fiscal difficulties are not only a near-term or short-term issue, but also will be serious in the medium term," said Lou.Lou offered his sharp critique in December but the assessment has only been made public more recently, with just days to go before China's political elites meet for their annual legislative session to decide the details of economic policy, reported SCMP.Lou's warning comes as China's National People's Congress (NPC), the country's legislature, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's top political advisory body, prepare for the start of their annual gatherings this week.The meetings, known as the "two sessions", are the most important annual political gatherings in the world's second-largest economy, during which Chinese leaders are expected to announce lower targets for the central government's budget deficit and for the issuance of local government special-purpose bonds this year.Orange Wang, in an article in SCMP, wrote that Beijing is expected to cut back fiscal stimulus.At the annual legislative session, the big issues will be whether to scale back the fiscal stimulus implemented last year to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and instead focus on curbing rising debt risks.Lou, who is director of the CPPCC's foreign affairs committee, said there were further uncertainties and challenges to China's fiscal health on the domestic side.China conducted an expansionary fiscal policy for 11 consecutive years from 2009, resulting in a continuous rise in the fiscal deficit and an explosion in the size of the nation's debt, he said.Moreover, Lou argued that China's ageing population was likely to produce serious challenges to the fiscal sustainability of the world's most populous nation in the coming years."The arrival of the ageing society is speeding up, which will change the size and structure of fiscal spending in China, add to the financial burden of elderly care and put pressure on government finances," Lou said.At the end of 2019, more than 176 million Chinese were aged 65 or older, accounting for 12.6 per cent of the population, while the number of people aged 60 and above was about 177.6 million, making up 13.3 per cent of the total population, according to the National Bureau of Statistics."We are facing major changes unseen in a century," Lou said."No matter the changes in the domestic economic and social situation, or the global economic downturn, soaring government debt and global trade frictions will all create huge uncertainties and severe challenges for China's fiscal sustainability."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-ex-finance-minister-says-nation-s-fiscal-situation-extremely-severe-101614695210741.html

Some were taken from their homes, hundreds were seized by riot police and soldiers who charged down protests against the coup. Many are held incommunicado.Myanmar's junta did not respond to requests for comment on the detentions, but has threatened action against those accused of destabilising the country. The army seized power after its allegations of fraud in Nov. 8 elections were rejected.In one account, Pyae Phyo Naing, the lead doctor at a government hospital, was stitching up a patient's head wound when the police came for him. He had joined the civil disobedience movement encouraging government employees to strike in protest at the new junta and had shut the hospital on Feb. 8, only treating emergency cases.Pyae Phyo Naing asked the police to wait until he had finished the stitches, but they refused. He was dragged backwards out of the clinic, a CCTV video shows."We must be patient and keep fighting against the dictatorship," said his wife Phyu Lei Thu, also a doctor. "We need to keep growing our strength to fight back, and believe we will win."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctors-teachers-a-fortune-teller-amongst-myanmar-s-new-wave-of-detainees-101614696158149.html

We appreciate all of the outpouring of love and affection," the statement said.Jordan worked well into his 80s, going back and forth between the jobs at the Gump Akin international law and lobbying firm in Washington and the Lazard financial management firm in New York. Representatives for Gump Akin did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the report.Jordan's role as a Washington insider took him all the way to the White House, where he was a close friend, golfing buddy and adviser to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.He never held a formal government job, but no one knew better than Jordan how favors, access and requests worked in Washington. In 2018 the Financial Times called him "one of the most connected men in America."Jordan grew up in a housing project in Atlanta before his family bought a home and he was the only black person in his class at DePauw University in rural Greencastle, Indiana.After graduating, Jordan earned a law degree from Howard University and returned to Atlanta to work for a civil rights attorney. Among his cases was one that integrated the University of Georgia and Jordan helped escort his two young black clients past jeering protesters on their first day of class.Jordan later went to work for the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund before becoming head of the National Urban League in 1971.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rights-activist-former-clinton-advisor-vernon-jordan-dies-at-85-report-101614695560415.html
02-03-2021||World||US announces sanctions on Russian officials, businesses for Navalny's poisoning||The Biden administration announced sanctions against Russia over the poisoning and jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny.The penalties -- like those adopted by the European Union -- target senior Russian law enforcement officials, as well as matching sanctions the EU and the UK imposed earlier on other Russians allied with President Vladimir Putin as punishment for the attempted murder of Navalny.The sanctions are the first ordered by President Joe Biden against Russia and will help set the tone for his relations with Putin. The ruble recovered sharply after the news, reversing earlier losses as investors were encouraged by the sanctions’ relatively narrow scope.The US demands the release of Navalny, his allies and others wrongfully detained in Russia and an end to the persecution of his supporters, one senior administration official told reporters in a briefing.Viktor Zolotov, the head of Russia’s National Guard; Igor Krasnov, the country’s prosecutor general; Alexander Kalashnikov, the Federal Penitentiary Service chief; and Alexander Bastrykin, who leads the country’s Investigative Committee, are the targets of the EU’s latest penalties, according to three people familiar with that decision.The 27 EU member states formally adopted the sanctions on Tuesday, according to two officials familiar with the decision. The measures will be published in the afternoon, one of the people said.The US measures will involve the State, Treasury and Commerce Departments, a senior administration official said in the briefing.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would “definitely respond” to the new restrictions, though he didn’t elaborate.The targets of EU and UK asset freezes and travel bans in October were Aleksandr Bortnikov, leader of Russia’s domestic spy agency; Sergei Kiriyenko, first deputy chief of staff in the presidential administration; Andrei Yarin, head of the presidential administration’s domestic policy directorate; Aleksei Krivoruchko and Pavel Popov, two deputy ministers of defense; and Sergei Menyaylo, Putin’s envoy to the Siberian Federal District.The bloc and the UK also froze the assets of one Russian entity: the State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology.Navalny returned to Russia in January after being treated in Germany for a nerve agent attack. He was detained shortly after landing at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. Western governments and Navalny have accused the Kremlin of being behind the attempted assassination. Russia denies that and has said that Navalny’s imprisonment is an internal matter.Last month, Biden called for Navalny’s release, saying he was “targeted for exposing corruption and should be released immediately and without condition.”Since then, Navalny has been sentenced and begun serving a two-and-a-half-year term. Last week, he was moved to a notorious penal camp in the Vladimir region about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of the Russian capital.During his first call with the Russian leader, in late January, Biden said he “made it clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning citizens are over.”Biden called the jailing of Navalny “politically motivated.” His administration also has Moscow in its sights for what US intelligence agencies indicate was Russia’s likely role in the SolarWinds Corp. cyber attack.One of the senior administration officials said that punitive actions related to the SolarWinds hack would likely be announced within weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-sanctions-on-russian-officials-businesses-for-navalny-s-poisoning-101614693916328.html

Not only in FATA, but even in the settled areas like in the important cities Swabi, Mardan, Peshawar, Swat and even in Quetta, there seem to be Taliban activities. They are organising huge gatherings and collecting funds openly and the state is not responding against these activities."Afridi added, "It seems that either the state is responsible for these activities or there is no state in Pakistan. So, in both cases it has to respond to the international community."Last month, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan on the 'grey list' till June for failing to act on six key parameters.Prior to the decision, the global agency had held a three-day meeting to review the progress made by Islamabad in terms of measures taken by its government against money-laundering and terrorist financing.Afridi said, "Whenever there are important meetings of important organisations like the United Nations and FATF, these terrorists and terrorist organisations are banned but the moment these meetings are finished, then again these terrorist organisations resurface".Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist Ehsanullah Ehsan, whose group nine years ago, shot and badly wounded Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, has allegedly threatened a second attempt on her life, tweeting that next time, "there would be no mistake".The threat prompted Malala to tweet herself, asking both the military and Prime Minister Imran Khan to explain how her alleged shooter, Ehsan, had escaped from government custody."Ehsanullah Ehsan is the same case. He threatened openly on Twitter to Malala and the state of Pakistan actually, in the beginning, rejected the claim that it was a fake Twitter account, but it was a genuine Twitter account. So, the state of Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism, it is training Taliban and it seems that in the coming days it wants to destabilise Afghanistan again. And its partnering with other states like Iran, Turkey and Russia in this regard to further destabilise the region and not only Afghanistan," said PTM member."Pakistan Army is very huge and its expenses are not covered by its present economy. So, in that context, it wants to conquer other countries or create instability in the region so that it can earn dollars from the international community as it has done in the so-called war on terror in the last 20 years in which they did not kill the Taliban and other terrorist groups, but they supported them to earn dollars from the international community and instead they killed innocent civilians. Thousands of Pashtuns, Baloch and Sindhis were forcibly disappeared, extra-judicially killed and tortured," he added."So, it is the responsibility of the international community to take notice of it as Manzoor Pashteen (PTM leader) has said openly that if you fund Pakistan, you are indirectly funding terrorism. So, it should be clear to the whole world that action should be taken. Now, even the women are being targeted by terrorists, supported by the Pakistani state. And you have heard of four women workers of an NGO who were killed by these terrorists in North Waziristan region of Pakistan", said the Paris-based Pashtun activist adding that it is the responsibility of UN, FATF, European Union and the US to take action against these terrorist activities of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-collecting-funds-openly-pak-govt-turning-blind-eye-ptm-leader-afridi-101614692183885.html

It said the terminal will be fully owned and developed instead by the state-run Ports Authority.Japan said it regretted the Sri Lankan decision, while India urged that the 2019 agreement be implemented.Sri Lanka announced on Tuesday that it would develop another terminal — West Container Terminal — at the same port with India and Japan.Government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the Cabinet approved the project, to be run as a public-private company with the Ports Authority and companies selected by the governments of India and Japan.India has selected Adani ports, which was earlier chosen to invest in the East Container Terminal. Japan has not yet named its investor in the project, which will be operated on a build, operate and transfer basis for 35 years.Rambukwella said the government was offering foreign participation in the West terminal because it requires a large investment to be developed, while the East terminal is completed and requires little additional money.India was particularly interested in the East terminal because it contributes about 66% of the re-exports from that terminal.India, which considers the Indian ocean region to be its strategic backyard, has for years been worried by rival China’s growing economic and political influence over neighboring Sri Lanka.China considers Sri Lanka to be a critical link in its massive “Belt and Road” global infrastructure building initiative and has provided billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade. The projects include a seaport, airport, port city, highways and power stations.China already operates the Colombo International Container Terminal as a joint venture with the Ports Authority.Critics say the Chinese-funded projects are not financially viable and that Sri Lanka will face difficulty in repaying the loans.In 2017, Sri Lanka leased a Chinese-built port located near busy shipping routes to a Chinese company for 99 years to end the heavy burden of repaying the Chinese loan used to build it.The facility is part of Beijing’s plan for a line of ports stretching from Chinese waters to the Persian Gulf. China has also agreed to provide a $989 million loan to Sri Lanka to build an expressway that will connect its tea-growing central region to the Chinese-run seaport.Japan and India are members of Quad, a group of Indo-Pacific nations that also includes the U.S. and Australia that is seeking to counter Chinese influence in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-approves-new-port-development-with-india-and-japan-101614691478283.html

Here’s the list||Governments around the world are racing to vaccinate their population against the coronavirus disease, with more than 244 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine administered so far. The United Kingdom was the first country to administer a fully tested Covid-19 vaccine, manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech, and since then, several countries have rolled out shots to inoculate their residents.The United States is leading the immunisation drive in absolute terms as it has administered over 75 million shots, nearly one-third of the total doses administered globally, followed by China and the European Union. Meanwhile, Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are ahead of other countries in terms of the number of doses administered per 100 people. According to Our World in Data, a scientific online publication, Israel and the UAE have administered nearly 95 and 61 doses per 100 people respectively.The total number of vaccine doses may not equal the total number of people vaccinated as different vaccines may have different dosing regimens. The number of fully vaccinated people are nowhere near the number of doses administered since most of the countries are using Covid-19 vaccines that require a two-doses regimen.Read | Pfizer, Oxford vaccines reduce severe Covid-19 in elderly, study findsMany countries only report the number of doses administered but some countries have been sharing the breakdown of first and second doses. Our World in Data has collated the latest available data from countries providing a breakdown of doses administered.Here’s the list of countries and territories with the most number of fully vaccinated individuals per 100 people:1.

Under Austrian law, inaction by the Alpine nation's legislature can't be challenged in court, meaning the case is being brought directly to the European court, she said.Kroemer said her client's specific situation would be no hindrance to the court making a ruling that is applicable to the general public.“In a legal context, in a strategic litigation context, it really only takes one person to make a huge difference," she said.Since January 2020, Austria has had a coalition government under center-right Chancellor Sebastian Kurz that includes the environmentalist Green party, which oversees the powerful climate, environment and energy ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-sclerosis-patient-sues-austria-over-health-impact-of-climate-change-101614687994556.html
02-03-2021||World||Media watchdog seeks German investigation of Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi||Global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has accused Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and several top officials of committing crimes against humanity in a criminal complaint filed in Germany.The 500-page complaint, filed on Monday with the German Public Prosecutor General in the Karlsruhe federal court, includes allegations of arbitrary detention of more than 30 journalists and the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing. Other Saudi figures named in the RSF filing could not be reached for comment and the Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."Those responsible for the persecution of journalists in Saudi Arabia, including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, must be held accountable for their crimes," RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement.RSF said it filed the lawsuit in Germany because of its principle of universal jurisdiction, allowing its courts to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere, and that other names could be added to the complaint at a later stage.The German prosecutor's office and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The other officials named in the RSF complaint were Saud al-Qahtani, who was seen as the crown prince's right-hand man; Ahmed Mohammed al-Asiri, a former royal court adviser; Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a general; and Mohammad al-Otaibi, the Saudi Istanbul Consul General at the time of Khashoggi's murder.The filing follows the publishing of a declassified intelligence assessment by the United States last Friday which concluded that Prince Mohammed approved the operation to "kill or capture" Khashoggi.Washington also announced visa bans on some Saudis it believes were involved in the killing and imposed sanctions on others.Saudi Arabia said it completely rejected "the negative, false and unacceptable" intelligence assessment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-watchdog-seeks-german-investigation-of-saudi-crown-prince-over-khashoggi-101614689777616.html

But when her employer offered her a vaccine against the virus, the nurse hesitated."I have some doubts," said Boudret, 48. "I prefer to wait."Around half of health workers in French care homes do not want to be vaccinated, according to the group of experts guiding the state's vaccine rollout - compared to only 20% of the residents who have not been inoculated.If significant numbers of care home workers do not get the jab, they could transmit the disease to residents who are not vaccinated and at high risk of serious illness, say advocates for the elderly.One reason for the scepticism is that those recommending the vaccine are the same people - the French state - whom care home workers blame for their low pay and tough working conditions, said Malika Belarbi, a care worker and trade union official."There's a complete loss of trust," she said.The issue is not unique to France.In Germany, care home operator BeneVit Group surveyed staff in November and found only 30% wanted to get vaccinated.Peter Burri, head of ProSenectute, Switzerland's biggest advocacy group for seniors, said at most half of nursing staff in the medical sector were willing to get inoculated.GETTING THE JAB?At a care home in Clamart, south of Paris, on Monday, 66-year-old Marie-Dominique Chastel was playing a parlour game with residents. Chastel, an activity coordinator at the home, declined the jab because she said her own immune system could fight off Covid-19.She said some relatives of residents had asked if she was going to get vaccinated. "My response was: 'I'm going to wait a bit'," she said.Boudret, the care home nurse, recalled fighting in vain to save her patient during the first wave of the virus. The same day two more of her patients died."That day, I broke. It was the last straw," she said. She said she felt neglected and under-appreciated by the state, citing short-staffing and problems with equipment.Since then, she has had Covid-19. She was unwell for a couple of days, but is now fully recovered.Staff at her care home, in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, were offered appointments to get the vaccine.Boudret said she was not in a high-risk group and felt there had not been time to properly assess the jab.Regulators around the world have repeatedly said speed will not compromise safety and vaccine developers have said they will not cut corners in testing for safety and efficacy.The quicker results have stemmed from conducting in parallel trials that are usually done in sequence and can take years.Trials for the shots developed by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have shown only temporary side-effects.France's state drug safety watchdog has said the procedure for approving the vaccines ensures they are safe and that it monitors side-effects and has seen nothing to warrant stopping their use.The number of French care home workers declining the vaccine is half what it was in December, said Patrick Peretti-Watel, head of research at France's National Institute for Health and Medical Research.But Peretti-Watel, also a member of the government's vaccine strategy steering committee, said getting more of them inoculated would require tackling the harm done by disputes over pay and working conditions."It's a question of winning trust," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-the-covid-19-frontline-half-of-french-care-home-workers-don-t-trust-vaccine-101614686028574.html
02-03-2021||World||China airs video confession of blogger booked for insulting PLA soldiers||The Chinese government on Monday telecast a video of an arrested blogger apologising for slandering PLA soldiers, involved in the deadly brawl against the Indian army at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh last June, on state-run CCTV.In the one-minute long video played during a prime time news programme, the 38-year-old man, identified as Qiu, admitted to “annihilation of conscience” and “arrogance” in insulting the soldiers who were killed and injured in the clash with Indian soldiers. His face was blurred out and he was seen sitting behind bars in prison clothes.“My behaviour was an annihilation of conscience,” Qiu was quoted as saying, according to a version translated to English published by state media.“During the many years I surfed online, my writings have become more and more frivolous and arrogant. Without learning about the whole picture, I spoke ill of the heroes who gave their lives to guard our home. My words not only hurt the reputation and honour of those soldiers, but of all PLA soldiers,” Qiu said.Qiu on Monday became the first person to be booked under the newly changed law on harming the reputation and honour of heroes and martyrs.The ruling Communist Party of China has been frequently criticised for airing confessions of suspects – including critics and activists – before their trial. However, Beijing has continued to do so despite critics calling it a violation of the rights of under-trials.In Qiu’s case, the telecast was aired in less than two weeks after he was detained for allegedly insulting the PLA troops on his Weibo account - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - where he has more than 2 million followers.Police in Nanjing, eastern China’s Jiangsu province, on Monday formally arrested Qiu, who had been in detention since February 20, for violating the law on defaming martyrs’ honour and reputation.Qiu’s is the first reported case of a suspect being charged with violating the law on defaming martyrs under the Criminal Law that came into effect on March 1 after China’s top judicial authorities added the new clause.“According to the supplementary articles, Qiu’s infringement of the reputation and honour of heroes shall be punished with a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention if the circumstances are serious,” the state media report said.In a 2020 report to the United Nations, rights groups, including Safeguard Defenders and Human Rights Watch, said the Communist Party forces critics into confessions that are then aired on state-run television, making a mockery of due process and the right to a fair trial.At least seven, including Qiu, have been arrested or detained for insulting PLA heroes and martyrs. The status of the remaining six is unknown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-airs-video-confession-of-blogger-booked-for-insulting-pla-soldiers-101614688887983.html
02-03-2021||World||Lebanese currency hits record low amid country's worsening crisis||The Lebanese pound hit a record low against the dollar on the black market on Tuesday as the country’s political crisis deepens with no prospects of new Cabinet in the near future and foreign currency reserves dwindle further.The dollar was trading at 9,975 Lebanese pounds around noon Tuesday. The previous record was registered in July, when the dollar briefly sold for 9,900 pounds on the black market. The official price remains 1,520 pounds to the dollar.Lebanon has been hammered by one crisis after another, starting with the outbreak of anti-government protests against the country’s corrupt political class in October 2019. That has been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic and a massive, deadly blast in Beirut’s port last August.In neighboring Syria — where the economy has been hit by the 10-year conflict, corruption and Western sanctions — the dollar also hit a record on Monday, reaching nearly 3,900 Syrian pounds. The economies of the two neighboring countries are connected and many Syrians have had their money blocked in Lebanese banks that have implemented harsh capital controls.The massive blast at Beirut’s port last August, when nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated, killed 211 people and injured more than 6,000. Large parts of the Lebanese capital were badly damaged in the blast.Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s government resigned six days after the Aug. 4 blast, one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history. In October, former Prime Minister Saad Hariri was named to form a new Cabinet but nearly five months later, disagreements between him and President Michel Aoun on the shape of the Cabinet has stood in the way of a new government's formation.Lebanon has also been in desperate need for foreign currency but international donors have said they will only help the country financially if major reforms are implemented to fight widespread corruption, which has brought the nation to the brink of bankruptcy.The crash in the local currency will throw more people into poverty. In Lebanon, the minimum wage is 675,000 pounds, or about $67 a month. Before the protests broke out in 2019, the minimum wage was about 450$.The crisis has driven nearly half the population of the small country of 6 million into poverty. Over 1 million refugees from Syria live in Lebanon.In December, the World Bank warned that Lebanon’s economy faces an “arduous and prolonged depression,” with real GPD projected to plunge by nearly 20% because its politicians refuse to implement reforms that would speed up the country’s recovery.In March last year, Lebanon defaulted for the first time ever on a payment on its massive debt amid ongoing popular unrest. Lebanon’s debt reached $90 billion or 170% of GDP, making it one of the highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-currency-hits-record-low-amid-country-s-worsening-crisis-101614686502689.html

It immediately struck a chord in both India and Pakistan, sparking top trending hashtags on social media, and garnering millions of views and hundreds of spin-offs."It was the most random video. I initially had no intention of uploading it," Mobeen said, expressing surprise at how viral it had gone and adding the trend showed the power and reach of social media."Pawri" monologue renditions have been used by police in India and the Delhi Commission for Women in their social media outreach campaigns.In one video, two Indian soldiers deployed in snowy mountains give it their own spin with "This is us, this is our gun, and we are patrolling here", while popular Bollywood actors Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone each did a version that also went viral.Indian dairy company Amul, known for inculcating trendy takes on current issues in its advertisements, did a "this is our pav-tea" version https://twitter.com/Amul_Coop/status/1362262247809028100?s=20, in a nod to a popular bread snack eaten with tea.Even politicians jumped on the bandwagon, with a leader from India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party using the catchy hook at an election rally."I'm honoured and grateful for all the love across the border," said Mobeen, expressing her happiness at fostering some rare friendly cross-border dialogue.India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed nations, have fought three wars and often had tense relations since gaining independence in 1947.Relations had most recently soured over developments in the northern region of Kashmir, which both countries control in parts but claim in full.Last week, their militaries released a rare joint statement saying they had agreed to observe a ceasefire along the disputed Kashmir border, after exchanging fire hundreds of times over past months.Since the video went viral, Mobeen said she has been inundated with acting and modelling offers, along with requests for product endorsements. Instead, she says she aspires to join Pakistan's foreign services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pawri-power-5-second-social-media-clip-pulls-india-pakistan-closer-101614686067101.html

The military took charge on February 1 and declared a year-long state of emergency following a general election which Suu Kyi's NLD party won by a landslide. The armed forces had backed the opposition which was demanding a rerun of the vote, claiming widespread fraud. The election commission had said that there was no evidence to support these claims after which the coup took place.Read more: Concerned by loss of lives in Myanmar, India calls for restraintWhere is Aung San Suu Kyi?Suu Kyi has been reportedly under house arrest in Naypyidaw, an isolated city that the military built during a previous dictatorship.

02-03-2021||World||Media watchdog files lawsuit in Germany against Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing||An international media rights group has filed a complaint with German prosecutors against Saudi Arabia's crown prince and four other top officials accusing them of crimes against humanity over allegations they were involved in the killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, authorities said Tuesday.The German federal prosecutors office in Karlsruhe told The Associated Press that it received the complaint from Paris-based Reporters Without Borders on Monday.The complaint, relying partially on a newly declassified US intelligence report released Friday, identifies five primary suspects: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his close adviser Saud Al-Qahtani and three other high-ranking Saudi officials, Reporters Without Borders said.They were identified for their “organizational or executive responsibility in Khashoggi's killing, as well as their involvement in developing a state policy to attack and silence journalists,” the group said in a statement.In the US report, intelligence officials stopped short of saying the Saudi crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s slaying in Turkey in October 2018, but described him as having “absolute control” over the kingdom’s intelligence organizations and said it would have been highly unlikely for an operation like the killing to have been carried out without his approval.Saudia Arabia's UN ambassador, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, on Monday disputed the report, saying it didn't come “anywhere close” to proof of any allegations against the crown prince.Saudi Arabia's embassies in Berlin and Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Reporters Without Borders complaint.Under the German legal system, anyone can file an allegation with prosecutors and there is an obligation for them to look into the accusations. It is up to them to determine then whether they justify launching a full investigation.German law allows prosecutors to claim universal jurisdiction in crimes against humanity, and last week they secured the conviction of a former member of Syrian President Bashar Assad's secret police for his involvement in facilitating the torture of prisoners in his homeland.In that case, however, the defendant had been living in Germany. The Khashoggi case has no obvious connections to the country.“Those responsible for the persecution of journalists in Saudi Arabia, including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, must be held accountable for their crimes,” Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement. “While these serious crimes against journalists continue unabated, we call on the German prosecutor to take a stand and open an investigation into the crimes we have revealed."The US document released Friday said a 15-member Saudi team, including seven members of the prince’s elite personal protective team, arrived in Istanbul, though it says it’s unclear how far in advance Saudi officials had decided to harm him.Khashoggi had gone to the Saudi consulate to pick up documents needed for his wedding. Once inside, he died at the hands of more than a dozen Saudi security and intelligence officials and others who had assembled ahead of his arrival. Surveillance cameras had tracked his route and those of his alleged killers in Istanbul in the hours before his killing.A Turkish bug planted at the consulate reportedly captured the sound of a forensic saw, operated by a Saudi colonel who was also a forensics expert, dismembering Khashoggi’s body within an hour of his entering the building. The whereabouts of his remains is unknown.Besides the crown prince and his adviser, the complaint names Saudi Arabi's former deputy head of intelligence Ahmad Mohammed Asiri; Mohammad Al-Otaibi, the Consul General in Istanbul at the time of the murder; and intelligence officer Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-watchdog-files-lawsuit-in-germany-against-saudi-prince-over-khashoggi-101614684897244.html

02-03-2021||World||Xi mobilizes China for tech revolution to cut dependence on west||For US politicians, China’s potential to dominate sensitive cutting-edge technologies poses one of the biggest geopolitical threats of the next few decades. President Xi Jinping is similarly worried the US will block China’s rise, and this week will unveil plans for greater self-sufficiency.At an annual session of China’s legislature, top Communist Party leaders will approve a five-year policy blueprint to cut dependence on the West for crucial components like computer chips while also making big bets on emerging technologies from hydrogen vehicles to biotech. The push to mobilize trillions of dollars could help China surpass the US as the world’s biggest economy this decade and cement Xi’s goal of turning the nation into a superpower.“The most important thing is the magnitude of the ambition -- this is bigger than anything Japan, South Korea or the US ever did,” said Barry Naughton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and one of the world’s top researchers on China’s economy. “The ambition is to push the economy through the gateway of a technological revolution.”The race to develop the most advanced technology is stoking US-China tensions following decades of integration that raised living standards around the globe. Now both countries are aiming for self-sufficiency in strategic areas, each fueled by fear the other wants to upend their political system: One that sees free speech and democracy as essential to prosperity, and another that puts one-party rule above individual liberty to deliver economic growth.At stake for Xi is more than just improving the lives of China’s 1.4 billion people, which is key to the Communist Party’s justification for effectively banning political opposition. He also wants to show the party can play a successful role in guiding the economy, particularly after US President Donald Trump’s administration sought to undermine its legitimacy to rule and destroy national champions such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China’s largest microchip manufacturer.Beijing’s confidence in its political system has grown after it quickly contained Covid-19 following delays by local officials in sharing information that allowed it to spread around the globe. Economists predict China’s economy will expand 8.3% this year, compared with 4.1% in the U.S. “The pandemic once again proves the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” Xi said last year. On Monday, he called the party’s “glorious traditions” a “precious spiritual treasure.”But the U.S. is now looking for allies to help thwart Xi’s aspirations, both through denying Beijing access to key technology and shoring up its own supplies of strategic goods. Last week, US President Joe Biden announced a wide-ranging supply-chain review of semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, rare-earth metals and high-capacity batteries, part of a broader plan to out-compete China that includes $2 trillion in infrastructure spending.“If we don’t get moving, they’re going to eat our lunch,” Biden told reporters in February after holding his first call with Xi. EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis separately highlighted concerns that Beijing was giving unfair advantages to Chinese companies, telling Bloomberg Television last month that the bloc would cooperate with the US on challenges stemming “from the socio-economic model of China.”Global investors are closely watching the National People’s Congress session, which starts Friday and runs for about a week. While the Communist Party has shown it can quickly channel billions of dollars to control the supply chains of emerging sectors like solar power and electric vehicles, it has also swiftly reined in the private sector if risks escalate -- seen most recently by the 11th-hour halt of an initial public offering by billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co.Premier Li Keqiang will outline plans Friday to keep the economy humming over the next 12 months, which may include fresh measures to boost consumption even as he stops short of giving an official growth target for a second straight year. Perhaps more importantly, the legislative session will also reveal details of longer-term plans to develop more than 30 “choke-hold” technologies China currently can’t produce, from chipmaking equipment to mobile-phone operating systems to aircraft design software.The focus on technology is more urgent due to the waning efficiency of China’s economic model, which has relied on channeling credit into property investment and infrastructure to shore up growth. Yet with housing sales peaking as urbanization slows and local governments struggling to find viable infrastructure projects, Beijing must leverage technology to boost productivity in order to meet a 2035 target of doubling the size of its economy from 2020 levels.One key number to watch is spending on research and development: Authorities are expected to reveal a target that will match or exceed US annual spending of around 3% of gross domestic product. More will be allocated to state-funded research, with China’s Science and Technology Ministry announcing priority areas such as hydrogen energy, electric vehicles and supercomputing.From 2014 to 2019, China’s government raised at least 6.7 trillion yuan ($1 trillion) in a series of venture-capital funds to take stakes in hi-tech companies, according to estimates from Naughton at the University of California, San Diego. China has already announced plans to invest $1.4 trillion from 2020 to 2025 in high-tech infrastructure, from artificial intelligence to 5G base stations to high-speed rail.“If that does end up paying off and Xi Jinping is able to engineer a more centrally steered growth model, then China will overcome the long list of challenges that it’s facing domestically,” said Jude Blanchette, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “If the state-led model is as unproductive as many think it is, then China will have wasted a generation’s capital pursuing a dream of centrally planned technological innovation.”China’s record of success is mixed. ​An example of what Beijing has in mind is biotech, which barely existed in China a decade ago and was earmarked as a “strategic industry” in the most recent five-year plan. From 2016 to 2020, the market capitalization of publicly listed Chinese companies developing innovative drugs rose from $1 billion to $217 billion, according to McKinsey. In 2019, the first China-developed cancer treatment was approved in the U.S.​The main area in which China has struggled is chipmaking, with its top companies still at least five years behind global rivals. China’s five-year plan will include measures to boost financing for semiconductors, treating the sector with the same kind of priority it once accorded to building its atomic capability, Bloomberg News reported in September.But there’s no guarantee it will work -- and the avalanche of state-directed investment risks spawning bad debt that destabilizes China’s economy. A taste of such a possibility came last year, when state-owned Tsinghua Unigroup Co., whose investments in chip production failed to pay off, roiled financial markets by defaulting on $2.5 billion of debt.‘Dark Storm Clouds’To reduce waste, Beijing has signaled that it would continue to rely predominately on private companies to meet its technology goals through tax breaks, direct investment in startups and minority stakes in promising but financially troubled companies. Beijing also wants more investment from foreign companies such as Tesla Inc., as long as they help meet the goal of upgrading China’s technology.While the West sees Xi’s ambitions as a threat, Beijing’s push to achieve self-sufficiency is mainly a defensive move by the Chinese Communist Party, according to Meg Rithmire, an associate professor at Harvard Business School.“If the CCP thought there were no dark storm clouds on the horizon,” she said, “I don’t think they would be taking such a heavy hand. It’s a risk-management mindset.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-mobilizes-china-for-tech-revolution-to-cut-dependence-on-west-101614680641104.html

02-03-2021||World||H-1B visa restructuring will be affected if US immigration bill is broken up||Increases in visas for highly skilled foreign workers could fall by the wayside this year if Democrats decide to overhaul immigration through a series of small bills instead of the sweeping one put forward by President Joe Biden.Biden’s immigration plan calls for dramatically boosting the number of green cards and expanding other avenues for high-skilled workers, a move welcomed by business interests, which have long sought reform of the H-1B visa and other programs.But House Democrats are weighing a piecemeal approach to immigration that would put more popular measures like helping refugees, agriculture workers and people brought to the US illegally as children first, leaving no leverage to push through less popular measures like increasing immigration for skilled workers.Tech leaders like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai want Congress to expand and update the H-1B visa system since demand for skilled workers in computer and information technology far outstrips the annual cap of 65,000. But that reform, once backed by lawmakers in both parties, now faces bipartisan skepticism, according to lawmakers.And without a strong advocate on Capitol Hill, any such measures could falter if asked to stand alone instead of as part of a large immigration package.Reform may be easier after pandemic is overRepublican Senator Marco Rubio said passing skilled worker visa reform during the pandemic-sparked economic crisis would be “pretty difficult.” And Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, who introduced Biden’s bill, said any additional foreign worker visas would only get support as part of a broader bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.“I’m happy to consider other things but the key is, how do I get the 11 million or parts thereof on a pathway?” Menendez said. “So it can’t just be high-tech visas and it can’t just be farm workers for growers.”Senate Democrats haven’t settled on a strategy for immigration, either, leaving reforms for high-skilled workers at risk.Support for expanding H-1B visas was broad-based in Congress for many years, as both parties courted business interests.The visas, often used in the tech industry, are available to workers who have specialized training and advanced education. Fashion models “of distinguished merit” are also eligible under a separate category. But industries want the cap expanded, and workers’ rights group argue that tying the visas to a specific employer hurts employees.The sweeping immigration bill Democrats proposed at Biden’s behest does not raise the annual cap on temporary worker visas. Instead, it expands the number of employment-based green cards available, a move that advocates say will take pressure off the guest worker programs like the H-1B visa.Xiao Wang, who heads Boundless Immigration Inc, a Seattle-based startup that works to streamline the immigration application process, said that the current system forces foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges to leave the country, taking their new skills with them. It also creates a bottleneck of skilled workers from India on H-1B visas who face country-based caps on getting green cards.Skilled worker visas a tough sellAny increase in H-1B visas will be a tough sell in the current Congress, amid potential opposition from labor unions on the left, a more hawkish stance on immigration on the right and a sour economy that makes bringing in workers from overseas seem unnecessary to voters.Biden has supported unions, which are generally skeptical of temporary work visas, throughout his long career in politics.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka warned lawmakers not to support immigration bills that would “expand programs that treat workers as disposable commodities in our global economy.”Meantime, Republicans are much less likely to support increases in high-skilled immigration than in the past, as the party shifted from a largely pro-business posture to a more restrictive stance on immigration under former President Donald Trump.Former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller and other hardliners met with conservative House members last week to plot their opposition to Biden’s immigration proposal, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.Trump opposed most immigration as president, adopting restrictions that caused H-1B visa denials to grow from 6% in 2015 to 29% in mid-2020, according to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. Later, they were suspended entirely amid the coronavirus pandemic.Trump also hit Biden on immigration in a speech Sunday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, signaling that Republicans plan to keep up their opposition.Republicans splintered on immigration after a 2007 overhaul collapsed in the Senate. Later, GOP lawmakers aligned with the anti-immigration Tea Party movement began winning seats and holding fast to their opposition.“You’ve lost a number of those more moderate Republicans who are probably more affected by the need for high-skilled visas, I think you’ve lost some of that for sure,” said John Sandweg, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President Barack Obama, citing the absence of Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake.Wang said he’s doubtful that reforms will make it through “this round of policy making,” but he hopes that a strong economic recovery as the pandemic wanes could make it easier to return to the issue later.Sara Blackwell, a labor attorney in Florida who sued The Walt Disney Co over its use of H-1B visas, said that she hopes any changes include tougher requirements to ensure that big businesses aren’t abusing the system to bring in cheap labor from abroad. Since H-1B visas require a worker to have an employer to sponsor them, she argued that they make it difficult for foreign nationals to switch jobs, depressing their wages and hurting American workers in the same field.“I do think there should be more requirements on making sure no American workers are available, especially with Covid right now and people being out of work,” she said.The next steps will depend on whether the Senate tries to pass immigration reform all at once, where high skilled visa expansion could be included in a package, or by breaking it up into separate bills that would have to stand on their own.H-1B Visas could be part of Congress’s horse-tradingAsked if he supports more H-1B visas or green cards for skilled workers, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin said only if it’s part of the horse-trading necessary to get a bigger bill with a citizenship pathway and other provisions.“I’ll try to answer this tactfully: If it brings votes for final passage, it’s a priority,” the Illinois Democrat said in an interview.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden’s aides have not yet had “extensive conversations” with lawmakers on how his immigration proposal will move through Congress but indicated the package could change.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month signaled she would consider taking on immigration changes piece-by-piece while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Feb 23 that he prefers a comprehensive approach to “get as much done as possible.”And while some Republicans are balking at expanding skilled-worker visas without a broader proposal that invests more in border agents and interior enforcement -- a component that Biden didn’t address in his proposal -- others say it’s best to tackle each piece separately.“The problem with immigration is that everybody’s got their piece and they say, I have to have this or I can’t support it,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is top Republican on the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration. “And then it adds up and finally crumbles under its own weight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1b-visa-restructuring-will-be-affected-if-us-immigration-bill-is-broken-up-101614680196838.html
02-03-2021||World||China's electoral reform 'earthquake' set to upend Hong Kong politics||China's plan to dramatically reform Hong Kong's electoral system, expected to be unveiled in a parliamentary session in Beijing starting this week, will upend the territory's political scene, according to more than a dozen politicians from across the spectrum.The proposed reform will put further pressure on pro-democracy activists, who are already the subject of a crackdown on dissent, and has ruffled the feathers of some pro-Beijing loyalists, some of whom may find themselves swept aside by a new and ambitious crop of loyalists, the people said."It will be an earthquake shaking up local political interests," said one person briefed on the impending changes.The measures will be introduced at the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, which starts on Friday, according to media reports.The plan was signalled last week by senior Chinese official Xia Baolong, who said Beijing would introduce systemic changes to only allow what he called "patriots" to hold public office in Hong Kong.In a full transcript of his remarks published this week by the pro-Beijing Bauhinia Magazine, Xia said Hong Kong's electoral system had to be "designed" to fit with the city's situation and shut out what he called non-patriots, some of whom he described as "anti-China agitators" that would bring destruction and terror to the city - a reference to pro-democracy campaigners who took to the streets in sometimes violent demonstrations in 2019.Xia did not announce any specifics, but the plan will likely include changes to how the 70-seat Hong Kong legislature is elected, and the composition of a committee that will select Hong Kong's next leader, according to the person briefed on the plan and local media reports.Veteran democrats have been quick to condemn the plan."It totally destroys any hope for democracy in the future," said Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy former member of Hong Kong’s legislature. "The whole concept of Xia Baolong is that the Communist Party rules Hong Kong and only those that support the party can have any role."Lee learned of the impending reform last week, in the middle of his trial, along with a group of eight other pro-democracy activists, for unlawful assembly charges related to a protest in August 2019."It's no longer for people to decide," Lee told Reuters on a lunch break from the trial last week. "It's one party rule, completely."The prospect of further bending the electoral process to China’s liking has also worried some pro-Beijing figures, who think it may be going too far and ultimately hurt Hong Kong."Don't go too far and kill the patient," Shiu Sin-por, a pro-Beijing politician and former head of Hong Kong's Central Policy Unit, told reporters after a briefing session with Xia on the matter. The opposition camp has already been neutralised by last year’s national security law, Shiu said, allowing the government to "push forward policies smoothly."China's main liaison office in Hong Kong, and China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, did not respond to requests for comment.The Hong Kong government said in a statement that it was prioritising the implementation of the principle of "patriots ruling Hong Kong" and improving the electoral system, and that it will continue to listen to views on the matter.POLITICAL MATHEMATICSElectoral reform is the latest political tremor to hit Hong Kong, a former colony that Britain handed back to China in 1997, which retains some autonomy from Beijing and whose status as a global financial hub was built on the rule of law and civil liberties not allowed in mainland China.The city’s atmosphere has changed radically in the past 18 months. Mass street protests in 2019 against China's intensifying control prompted Beijing to impose a sweeping national security law last June, which authorities have used to jail activists and stifle dissent.On Sunday, Hong Kong police charged 47 pro-democracy campaigners and activists with conspiracy to commit subversion for their roles in organising and participating in an unofficial primary election last July, the biggest single crackdown under the new law.Even though such arrests have already marginalised the pro-democracy camp, China wants to exert greater control over a voting process largely unchanged since 1997, and is still afraid of democrats winning a majority in the legislature at the next election, said the person briefed on the electoral reform plan."They did the mathematics and it was seen as too risky to do nothing," said the person.Two senior pro-Beijing politicians told Reuters the electoral reform plan, coming on top of the broader crackdown that has already provoked international criticism, would ultimately damage Hong Kong, potentially destroying its unique character, pluralism and attractiveness for investors."It's really sad that Hong Kong has degenerated to this stage," said one of the politicians, on the electoral reform. "We're handing Hong Kong over to the next generation in a worse state than we inherited it."The two pro-Beijing politicians spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, due to the sensitivity of the matter. It is rare for pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong to voice any doubt about China’s moves, even anonymously."Nothing is normal anymore,” said the second pro-Beijing politician. “It's a new abnormal."One faction that appears ready to benefit from electoral reform is the new Bauhinia Party, formed in May by Charles Wong and two other mainland-born, pro-Beijing businessmen, pushing policies that Wong says will help revive Hong Kong and its leadership."They (Beijing) never really have any opposition to what we do," Wong told Reuters in his 12th-floor seafront office last week.Wong, 56, was born in mainland China but came to Hong Kong as a youth and speaks fluent Cantonese, the local dialect. Describing himself as a "patriot," Wong embodies China's declared wish to have Hong Kong run at all levels by people with closer ties and sympathy with the mainland."We are Hong Kong people," he told Reuters. "We love Hong Kong."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-electoral-reform-earthquake-set-to-upend-hong-kong-politics-101614663122752.html
02-03-2021||World||Egypt executes 11 convicted of murder||Egyptian authorities on Tuesday executed 11 people convicted of murder, a security source said, in the latest cases of what rights campaigners have labelled "a horrifying execution spree".Capital punishment for civilian convicts in Egypt, the most populous Arab country, is carried out by hanging."Eleven people were executed at Borg al-Arab prison" near the city of Alexandria, the security source told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity."They were all convicted in criminal murder cases" for killings in recent years in the Alexandria and Beheira governorates, he said.The latest executions came after five convicts, including three women, were also hanged Saturday, according to the source.Rights group Amnesty International in December condemned Egypt's "chilling rise in executions" under the reign of President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi.Sisi rose to power following the military overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 and has overseen a wide-ranging, ongoing crackdown aimed at quashing dissent.The London-based rights group said then that at least 57 men and women had been hanged in October and November of 2020."Egyptian authorities have embarked on a horrifying execution spree in recent months, putting scores of people to death, in some cases following grossly unfair mass trials," said Philip Luther, the group's Middle East and North Africa research director."The shocking death toll is likely to be an underestimate, as Egyptian authorities do not publish statistics on executions or the number of prisoners on death row," Amnesty added.New York-based Human Rights Watch at the time also lambasted Egypt's mounting "mass executions", and both groups urged authorities to "immediately halt executions".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-executes-11-convicted-of-murder-101614680269476.html
02-03-2021||World||Pakistan needs legislation to meet three outstanding FATF benchmarks: Report||Pakistan will have to make further legislation on at least two counts to meet three outstanding benchmarks of the 27-point action plan of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog FATF before the new June deadline, a media report said on Tuesday.The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic. The new deadline was set by the FATF last month.Pakistan has been scrambling in recent months to avoid being added to a list of countries deemed non-compliant with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations by the FATF, a measure that officials here fear could further hurt its ailing economy.The Dawn newspaper reported that the government will have to submit an updated report within a month to the FATF on the progress on legislation and other steps to be taken to address the outstanding concerns.Since the government had changed almost three dozen laws over the past year to meet the FATF requirements, there should not be any hurdle in the way of making two more amendments, the report said.Presiding over a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) on Anti-Money Laundering, Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh asked the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and chairman of the FATF Coordination Committee and Industries and Production Minister Hammad Azhar to immediately finalise the timelines for additional legislation in consultation with agencies of the federal government and the armed forces.The deadlines should be reasonable to be shared with the FATF and all agencies and stakeholders should act in close coordination to meet the deadlines well in advance, the report said.It was observed that Pakistan had made progress over the past two years and was being appreciated by the international community, but at the same time it did not send a good message when international commitments and deadlines were missed repeatedly, it said.The NEC was informed that Pakistan had to update the Paris-based global watchdog on financial crimes on the way forward and its timelines on the basis of observations of FATF plenary and shortcomings pointed out by the FATF assessors within 30 days.The additional legislation has to cover some weaknesses in the existing framework that limited the authorities from taking action, including imposing sanction or apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them, within certain deadlines.The three outstanding action points include demonstrating that Terrorism Financing (TF) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities and demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.Thirdly, Pakistan has to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, specifically those acting for or on their behalf, the report said.An official statement said FMU Director General Lubna Malik briefed the committee on the overall progress achieved on the FATF action plan and outlined efforts under the way for the remaining targets to be achieved in due course of time.She said Pakistan had received support for making strides vis-a-vis an exigent action plan given by the FATF.Sources said the meeting was also informed that reasonable progress had already been achieved on one out of three remaining points, but two areas that required additional legislation would be time-consuming.Acknowledging the progress demonstrated by the relevant stakeholders, finance minister Shaikh called for expediting efforts to fulfil the requirements in the remaining areas."The strict adherence to timelines would culminate into the successful completion of the FATF action plan,” he said.In February last year, the FATF gave Pakistan, which missed 13 targets, a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against ML&TF committed with the international community.In its third plenary held virtually in June, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan in the grey list as Islamabad failed to check the flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).With Pakistan's continuation in the 'grey list', it is increasingly becoming difficult for the country to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.If the FATF in its meeting finds that Pakistan has failed to meet its requirements, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country on the 'Black List' along with North Korea and Iran.The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-needs-legislation-to-meet-three-outstanding-fatf-benchmarks-report-101614669450193.html

02-03-2021||World||Explainer: Japan to try US men accused of helping Ghosn flee||Two Americans suspected of helping former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn skip bail and escape to Lebanon in December 2019 have been extradited to Japan.Michael Taylor and his son Peter had been held in a suburban Boston jail since May. They were handed over to Japanese custody on Monday and arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday.Ghosn, who led Nissan Motor Co. for more than two decades, was arrested in 2018, and charged with under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust in diverting Nissan money for personal gain. He says he is innocent.WHAT ARE THE FATHER AND SON ACCUSED OF DOING?Michael Taylor, with the help of another man, George-Antoine Zayek, hid Ghosn in a large black box supposedly containing audio equipment, according to the authorities. The box passed through airport security in Osaka, central Japan, and was loaded onto a private jet that flew Ghosn to Turkey. Peter Taylor is accused of meeting with Ghosn and helping his father carry out the escape. Authorities say the Taylors were paid at least $1.3 million.WHERE WILL THEY BE TAKEN AND WHAT HAPPENS THERE?The Taylors, like other suspects, can be held up to 23 days without any formal charges at the Tokyo Detention Center on the outskirts of the capital and questioned for hours almost daily by prosecutors, without a lawyer present. Their lawyer can visit and they can receive snacks and books. The detention can be extended with “rearrests,” if more charges are tagged on. Ghosn spent more than 100 days at the center before gaining his release on bail. The solitary cells are simple, with Japanese-style futon mattresses. The center, which is different from prisons for people who have been convicted, also has an exercise area and clinic.IS THIS THE ROUTINE TREATMENT OF SUSPECTS IN JAPAN?The Japanese treatment of suspects has been widely criticized as “hostage justice,” designed to coerce suspects to confess and often resulting in false confessions. The Taylors’ lawyers in the U.S. say they worry they may be treated unfairly in Japan and subjected to “mental and physical torture.” They also argue that jumping bail is not a crime under Japanese law. That is technically accurate, but most people who escape are easily caught in Japan. Japanese prosecutors say they have enough evidence to convict the Taylors.WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED IF THEY GO ON TRIAL?Even after formal charges are filed, closed-door pre-trial sessions by the prosecutors and defendants before a judge generally go on for months. The media have no access to such sessions. Jury trials exist in Japan, but only for murders and other heinous crimes. A panel of three judges will hear the Taylors' case in a trial that could last months or even years. English translation will be provided during the trial. Media coverage is allowed, but no filming or recording. If convicted, the Taylors face up to three years in prison and a fine of up to 300,000 yen ($2,900). They could get a suspended sentence and not serve time. In principle, just as in the U.S., people are presumed innocent until proven guilty. But 99% of criminal trials end in convictions.WHERE IS CARLOS GHOSN AND CAN HE BE TRIED?Japan has put Ghosn on Interpol's wanted list, but Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Extradition from the U.S. isn’t common, so the extradition of the Taylors for an alleged nonviolent crime reflects the determination of Japanese prosecutors to pursue the case against Ghosn. Ghosn is almost certain to be extradited if he sets foot in the U.S. Former Nissan senior executive Greg Kelly is on trial in Tokyo on charges he helped under-report Ghosn’s compensation. Kelly, an American, says he is innocent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-japan-to-try-us-men-accused-of-helping-ghosn-flee-101614679242288.html

The White House had no immediate comment on Monday night.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday US sanctions policy “doesn’t attain its goal.” The ruble fell the most among emerging-market currencies on Tuesday, coming under pressure as investors sold riskier assets and crude oil fell for a fourth straight day.Navalny returned to Russia in January after being treated in Germany for a nerve agent attack. He was detained shortly after landing at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. Western governments and Navalny have accused the Kremlin of being behind the attempted assassination. Russia denies that and has said that Navalny’s imprisonment is an internal matter.Last month, Biden called for Navalny’s release, saying he was “targeted for exposing corruption and should be released immediately and without condition.”Since then, Navalny has been sentenced and begun serving a two-and-a-half-year term. Last week, he was moved to a notorious penal camp in the Vladimir region about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of the Russian capital.On Monday, European Union ambassadors approved sanctions against four senior Russian law enforcement officials over Navalny’s detention, according to three people familiar with the decision. The measures are expected to be formally adopted by the bloc’s 27 members later this week, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private process.During his first call with the Russian leader, in late January, Biden said he “made it clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor that the days the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning citizens are over.”Biden called the jailing of Navalny “politically motivated.” His administration also has Moscow in its sights for what U.S. intelligence agencies indicate was Russia’s likely role in the SolarWinds Corp. cyber attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-poised-to-sanction-russia-over-its-treatment-of-kremlin-critic-navalny-101614679218231.html

02-03-2021||World||Nigeria: Kidnappers free all abducted schoolgirls||Gunmen have freed all 279 girls kidnapped from a boarding school in northwest Nigeria, the governor of Zamfara state said on Tuesday, as one of the victims told Reuters how their abductors had beaten her and her schoolmates with their weapons.According to earlier reports, 317 girls from the Government Girls Science Secondary (GGSS) School in the town of Jangebe were abducted by an armed gang at around 1am on Friday.Zamfara state spokesman Sulaiman Tanau Anka told Reuters that some of the missing girls had run into the bush at the time of the assault, and the number of those kidnapped was 279. All had now been freed, Zamfara Governor Bello Matawalle said.Reuters journalists in Zamfara's state capital, Gusau, saw dozens of girls in Muslim veils sitting in a hall in a state government building. A few parents arrived later, and one father wept with joy after seeing his daughter.Most of the girls appeared to be unharmed, but at least a dozen were sent to hospital for treatment. The girls were mostly barefoot, and several had injuries to their feet.Farida Lawali, 15, told how she and the other girls had been taken to a forest, with the kidnappers carrying those unable to walk."They carried the sick ones that cannot move. We were walking in the stones and thorns," she said, sitting in the government house building, covered in a light blue veil."They started hitting us with guns so that we could move," she added. "While they were beating them with guns, some of them were crying and moving at the same time."News of the girls' release brings "overwhelming joy", President Muhammadu Buhari said. "I am pleased that their ordeal has come to a happy end without any incident."One father, whose seven daughters were among those kidnapped and freed, said the incident would not deter him from schooling his children."It's a ploy to deny our girls ... from getting the Western education in which we are far behind," Lawal Abdullahi told Reuters. "We should not succumb to blackmail. My advice to government is that they should take immediate precautions to stop further abductions."On Monday, state officials said they were in talks with the kidnappers.Schools have become targets for mass kidnappings for ransom in northern Nigeria by armed criminal groups, in a trend started by the jihadist group Boko Haram, and later its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province.The government has repeatedly denied paying ransoms. But Buhari on Friday urged state governments "to review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles, warning that the policy might boomerang disastrously".The raid in Zamfara state was the second such kidnapping in little over a week in the northwest, a region increasingly targeted by criminal gangs. On Saturday, gunmen released 27 teenage boys who were kidnapped from their school on Feb. 17 in the north-central state of Niger.In 2014, Boko Haram abducted more than 270 schoolgirls from the northeastern town of Chibok, in Nigeria's most high profile school kidnapping. Around 100 of them remain missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-kidnappers-free-all-abducted-schoolgirls-101614678032163.html
02-03-2021||World||Pandemic-consumed US relapses in drug addiction||Beverly Veres' two sons are addicted to heroin but can't get the help they need, with US health services consumed by the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overdoses are surging."Drugs have just come into this area, and are taking over," says Veres at her Pennsylvania home. "(But) they're not focusing on anything else but Covid," she adds of the authorities.Veres, her husband Steve, and their sons Douglas, 24, and Charles, 29, live in a small house in Houtzdale, a town in rural Clearfield County far from the cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.Coronavirus has officially killed 114 people in this isolated, forested area, where the epidemic is much less visible than in nearby towns.Beverly and Steve say they have only had one contact with someone who had the virus, compared to "a dozen interactions" with people with drug problems.After seeing their sons descend into heroin abuse last summer, the couple is convinced that the pandemic has exacerbated the drug problem in their area.Figures for overdose deaths are not complete for 2020 but the 19 already recorded in the county is higher than in 2018 or 2019.The upward trend is true across the United States.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the number of deaths from overdoses -- mainly because of opiate drugs that have flooded the United States in recent years -- increased by almost 25 percent between July 2019 and July 2020.- 'Downward slide' -Beverly says her younger son Douglas had a long history of drug addiction but was "able to function."He switched to methamphetamines and then last July heroin, resulting in "a downward slide."Incarcerated in early 2020 for driving under the influence of drugs, Douglas did not receive any addiction treatment in prison because of Covid, says Beverly.A drug rehabilitation program that he attempted after his release failed to work in part because family visits and therapy sessions were cut due to the pandemic, she said."I think if we would have gotten to see him and we would have been able to have some type of family counseling with him, (then) we could have helped him along the way," added the 49-year-old auditor.A few miles (kilometers) away in the community of Olanta, Savannah Johnson -- a 26-year-old former drug addict -- explains that she risked relapse at the start of the pandemic.In early 2020, after a year of treatment and unable to resume her nursing profession, Johnson took a small job in a pizzeria. She lost it with the pandemic.Suddenly Johnson was isolated at home with no job and unable to hang out with recovering friends."Those little things, even though they might seem little to somebody else, to a recovering addict are huge," she told AFP.Isolated, she began to reminisce about her time on drugs."You start thinking, 'I wasn't so depressed. I didn't feel so anxious. I was more sociable.' Once you think about that for so long it really does cause you to want to go use now," Johnson said.She suffered six overdoses in 2019 and survived thanks to the Narcan opioid antidote.Johnson has been clean for 13 months now and credits her recovery to her parents, who she now lives with and who have custody of her two young children.- 'Overwhelmed' -The house has become "quite chaotic," said Savannah's mother Bobbie Johnson, who has absolutely no regrets."Her being here and seeing her growth and seeing her rebuild that relationship with her kids, it's priceless, best thing ever," Bobbie said.Bobbie is well aware of the increased difficulties of drug addicts during the pandemic due to her role as local leader of "Parents of Addicted Loved Ones," of which Beverly and Steve Veres are also members.Kim Humphrey, the association's CEO, says the pandemic has caused a "complete explosion" of drug addiction in the United States."You can't get a job... you can't go anywhere, you can't do this, you can't do that. So you can see how the mind of somebody that's in this would go, 'Well, you know, I'll just use something to take away the pain," said Humphrey.The opioid crisis has caused about half a million deaths in the United States since 1999, including 50,000 in 2019 alone.But before the pandemic, it appeared to be stabilizing."We were starting to make some progress but some of that is being lost," said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials."The pandemic has become all consuming. Everybody's just kind of overwhelmed," he told AFP.The pandemic, though, has highlighted some of the "difficult social situations" and "real disparities," which may help the drugs fight in the long run, Plescia added."One of the positives maybe that we now have a society that is perhaps better able to begin to address those issues," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemicconsumed-us-relapses-in-drug-addiction-101614677678097.html

It offers a rare legal avenue for action against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.Attempts by Western powers to set up an international tribunal for Syria have been blocked by Russia and China at the UN Security Council."This is important so that the victims have the possibility to see those responsible being brought to justice and held accountable," Mazen Darwish, who heads the Paris-based Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), told Reuters.The SCM filed the complaint along with two other NGOs: the Open Society Foundation’s Justice Initiative and Syrian Archive.France's intelligence services concluded in 2013 that a sarin gas attack on the Eastern Ghouta region just south east of Damascas that killed 1,400 people had been carried out by Syrian government forces.The Syrian government denies it has used chemical weapons against its own civilians.The complaint is based on what the lawyers say is the most comprehensive body of evidence on the use of substances such as sarin gas in Syria.They include testimonies from survivors and defectors, an analysis of the Syrian military chain of command, and hundreds of items of documentary evidence, including photos and videos."We have compiled extensive evidence establishing exactly who is responsible for these attacks on Douma and Eastern Ghouta, whose horrific effects continue to impact survivors," said Hadi al Khatib, founder and director of Syrian Archive.A UN-commissioned investigation to identify those behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria concluded in 2016 that Syrian government forces had used chlorine and sarin gas.Darwish said he expected another case to be opened in Sweden in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-victims-of-2013-chemical-attacks-file-case-with-french-prosecutors-101614677078939.html

CDC chief Dr Rochelle Walensky also told CNN that the average death rate has increased due to the spread of the new variants.Dr Walensky asked the people "to be strong", "continue wearing face masks" and follow the other protocols needed to prevent themselves from the disease. She also expressed concern about the relaxations being offered in some states. "We stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained," she said.Among the new variants that are spreading fast in the US is the one that emerged in New York City in November. So far, 735 cases of the new variant have been identified, including 585 in the last two weeks, according to federal health officials.The mutation has travelled extensively through the metropolitan New York region, and individual cases have also been found in 14 other states, including Texas, Wyoming and Maryland, Gregory Armstrong, director of the CDC's Advanced Molecular Detection Programme, told Bloomberg.Anthony Fauci, the top medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, said at a briefing on Monday that the variant is known scientifically as B.1.526 and it started off in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. It is one of five concerning variants now being tracked nationally by health officials.Twenty nine out of 50 states reported more new infections last week compared to the previous seven days, whereas only seven states in the prior week reported weekly increases, according to analysis by news agency Reuters.New York had the highest number of new cases per 100,000 residents last week, followed by New Jersey and South Carolina, said Reuters.As of Sunday, 15% of the US population has received at least one dose of a vaccine and 7.5% has received two doses, according to the CDC. The country administered an average of 1.6 million shots per day last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-chief-concerned-over-spread-of-covid-19-variants-says-all-recent-gains-will-be-lost-101614677300032.html

He is also concerned about the support of Afghan Pashtuns to PTM in social media, reported Gandahara British website on April 11, 2018.Durand Line was fixed by British civil servant Sir Henry Mortimer Durand and the then Afghan Emir, Abdur Rahman Khan in 1893. It was established in order to mark the respective spheres of influence and also to improve the diplomatic ties between the British establishment in India and the Afghan Kingdom. Afghanistan has opposed the move since then.For Pakistan Durand Line is a vital subject, the disputed areas (Durand Line) include almost 60 per cent of the country, while for Afghanistan, it is about losing Pashtun's territory and two to three per cent of the population of its largest tribe, reported Afghanistan Times.Earlier, former President Hamid Karzai in a conference in Kabul said that Pakistan's attacks (on the areas located across the Durand Line) "could be to press the people of Afghanistan to set on negotiations on Durand Line and recognize the Line," Karzai said.He further said that any kind of effort to prevent development in Afghanistan and pave the ground for Durand Line's recognition would fail.Forty years ago Afghanistan experienced its second military coup d'etat within five years. This was a golden chance for the Pakistani government to destabilize the Afghan government, abolish the government's infrastructure and the national army. This would ensure that Afghanistan would not be as powerful to lopsidedly determine the borders with Pakistan, reported Afghanistan Times.With the establishment of Mujahideen in 1992, Pakistan reached its goal to destroy the country's infrastructure, security forces and eventually placed the Taliban in power.With the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in 2001, the policy regarding Durand Line was that resolving the issue lies on the tribes living on the two sides and that the Afghan government is not authorized to make any decision about it, reported Afghanistan Times.The possibility of declaring their political independence and forming an independent country by the Pashtuns and Balochs appears high, and therefore, it seems impossible for Pakistan to agree on, reported Afghanistan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pashtun-demand-for-greater-afghanistan-could-ignite-nation-s-rivalry-with-pak-101614674811157.html
02-03-2021||World||FBI chief Christopher Wray to face questions on extremism, US Capitol riot||FBI Director Chris Wray is set to testify for the first time since the deadly Jan. 6 deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, with lawmakers likely to press him on whether the bureau adequately communicated with other law enforcement agencies about the potential for violence that day.Questions about the FBI's preparations for the riot, and investigations into it, are expected to dominate Wray's appearance Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He's also likely to be pressed on how the FBI is confronting the national security threat from white nationalists and domestic violent extremists, and whether the bureau has adequate resources to address the problem.The violence at the Capitol made clear that a law enforcement agency that revolutionized itself after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to deal with international terrorism is now scrambling to address homegrown violence from white Americans. The Biden administration has tasked his national intelligence director to work with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to assess the threat.Wray has kept a notably low profile since a violent mob of insurrectionists stormed the Capitol two months ago. Though he has briefed lawmakers privately and shared information with local law enforcement hearings, Tuesday's oversight hearing will mark Wray's first public appearance before Congress since before November's presidential election.The FBI is facing questions over how it handled intelligence in the days ahead of the riot, and whether warnings it had of potential violence reached the correct officials.Last week, for instance, the acting chief of the Capitol Police said a Jan. 5 report from the FBI made its way to investigators within the police force and to the department’s intelligence unit but was never sent up the chain of command. The report warned about concerning online posts foreshadowing a “war” in Washington the following day. The FBI has said the report, which it says was based on uncorroborated information, was shared through its joint terrorism task force.Wray may also face questions about the FBI's investigation into the massive Russian hack of corporations and U.S. government agencies, which happened when elite hackers injected malicious code into a software update.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-chief-christopher-wray-to-face-questions-on-extremism-capitol-riot-101614663745748.html

He re-emerged in January with a 50-second video appearance.China's current richest man, Zhong, made his first appearance at the top spot largely thanks to the share price performances of Nongfu Spring and vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, which he also controls.Tencent's Ma saw his wealth swell 70% over the year to 480 billion yuan ($74.16 billion) while Pinduoduo's Huang's fortune grew 283% to 450 billion yuan, the list said. In comparison, the wealth of Ma and his family grew 22%, to 360 billion yuan.Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok owner ByteDance, broke into the top five rankings among Chinese billionaires in Hurun's Global Rich List for the first time, with an estimated personal wealth of $54 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jack-ma-loses-title-as-china-s-richest-man-after-coming-under-beijing-s-scrutiny-101614674724207.html

Historically, we have been closer to India. China is also our friend but we don't interact with them that much because they lie on the other side of the Himalayas," said former Nepal PM."Nepal is going through a crisis. Nepal Communist Party that had formed a government with a majority is almost divided into two factions...This is not right for a country's democracy when Parliament is dissolved midway to give way to instability," he said.Asked whether Nepal's ties have strained with India, the former PM said, "India and Nepal have not been able to talk on a high political level. BJP came to power (in 2014) in India in recent past and democracy arrived in Nepal around that time. Talks should be held between the major political parties of the two countries to bring back relation on track.""Also, we need to further strengthen people to people tie between India and Nepal," he added.On the question of political instability in Nepal, Bhattarai said, "This is all happening because democracy arrived a bit late in Nepal. The partial change started in the 1950s. But complete change happened in 2015. Because of this, revolution and counter-revolution are taking place. This is how democracy will flourish. ...All major parties will have to collectively find a democratic solution."Finding a way out of the crisis, former PM Bhattarai stated that, "We will talk to all parties in Nepal to bring stability, economic development and ensure that India-Nepal relations are good. This is our main agenda."Earlier this month, Nepal's Supreme Court reinstated the House of Representatives, which had been dissolved by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in December last year that led the country into a political crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-beijing-only-new-delhi-nepal-s-ex-pm-says-indo-nepal-ties-remain-strong-101614674336621.html
02-03-2021||World||With first dose, PM Modi joins ranks of world leaders vaccinated against Covid||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 70, on Monday became one of the few prominent world leaders to have received the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Among the Group of 20 countries, PM Modi is only the ninth leader to receive at least the first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.Among the first was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 71, closely followed by US President Joe Biden, 78. Netanyahu was the first Israeli to be inoculated. He was administered the vaccine developed Pfizer-BioNTech on live TV as the Prime Minister said he wanted to set a “personal example” to encourage other Israelis to get the shot.Biden received his first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December last year, a month before being officially sworn in. He also took the vaccine on live television to counter vaccine hesitancy in the US, which is the worst-affected by the virus in the world, in a marked contrast to the mixed messages sent by former president Donald Trump. Also Read | PM Modi gets first shot as second leg of inoculation drive begins“I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine,” Biden had told reporters in Newark, Delaware, where he got the jab. “There’s nothing to worry about.” He received the second jab in early January. PM Modi’s first jab follows that of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who also took the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. “Pleased to get my #COVID19 vaccine today along with Australia’s CMO Professor Paul Kelly to give further confidence to Australians in these vaccines, which have been tested and approved by our medical experts, are safe and effective,” PM Morrison, 52, wrote on Twitter after receiving the shot in late February. Saudi King Salman, 85, received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in early January, three weeks after the kingdom started its vaccination programme. The country’s health ministry said the inoculations would be rolled out in three phases, starting with people over 65 and those with chronic ailments or at high risk of infection. His son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, considered the de facto leader of the country, was administered the vaccine in December. After the crown prince, 35, received his first jab of the Pfizer vaccine, registrations in Saudi Arabia to receive the vaccine increased five-fold, according to minister of health Dr Tawfiq Al-Rabiah. In January, President Alberto Fernandez, 61, received the first dose of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine in January, a day after Argentina’s health regulator cleared the vaccine for use among those aged 60 and above. Also Read | US downplays possibility of sharing Covid-19 vaccines with MexicoTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also received the first dose of a vaccine in January in front of TV cameras. He received a shot of the Chinese-developed Sinovac. “I believe it will be vital for political leaders and deputies to encourage the vaccination drive (by getting vaccinated) themselves,” Erdogan told reporters after receiving the vaccine.Indonesian President Joko Widodo, 59, also received his first dose of the Sinovac vaccine in January, after the country approved the vaccine and began its efforts to vaccinate the population. He was vaccinated along with top leaders across the country and even social media influencers in an effort to encourage people to take the vaccine when it is available to them. South African President Cyril Rampahosa was one of the first citizens to vaccinated, in January, with the one-shot Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, which was also rolled out for health case workers. His vaccination was broadcast on live TV to build confidence among people. At the time, Johnson & Johnson was not authorised anywhere in the world and Ramaphosa effectively joined an observational study by taking the jab. Vaccine shot awaitedLeaders of the major European countries, the European Union bloc, Japan, South Korea are facing flak for the slow vaccine roll-outs in their countries. Prime Minster Yoshihide Suga of Japan and Prime Minister Moon Jae In of South Korea have been overseeing the vaccination of frontline workers, which have only recently begun. They have not yet been vaccinated themselves. In Europe, most countries began by vaccinating either the elderly or health workers. Both French President Emmanuel Macron, 43, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, have said they will wait for their turn to be vaccinated. There is no news on when recently sworn-in Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi is expected to receive the vaccine.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, 49, will also wait for vaccinations in the general category to take his shot. “We obviously have to give priority to the most vulnerable but the second I have a chance, like all healthy adults, I will do so very visibly and with enthusiasm,” Trudeau told French-language broadcaster Radio-Canada in December. Also Read | Chinese vaccines sweep much of the world, despite concernsWhile UK approved its first vaccines three weeks before the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 56, is yet to receive the vaccine. Press secretary Allegra Stratton said in December that PM Johnson would not jump the queue and take the vaccine before those in greater need. “I think we also know that he wouldn’t want to take a jab that should be for someone who is extremely vulnerable, clinically vulnerable and who should be getting it before him,” she said. Johnson spent several days in intensive care in April last year after contracting Covid-19. Mexico started vaccinated people over the age of 60 with Sputnik V in mid-February. So far, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 67, has not been vaccinated.Despite actively encouraging the use of Sputnik V globally, President Vladimir Putin has not taken the vaccine yet. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin is following a vaccination schedule that requires him to take other shots first, including against flu and pneumococcal infections, before he can decide to have Sputnik V.It is still unclear whether President Xi Jinping of China, where the virus first emerged, has received the Covid-19 vaccine. China was the first country to begin vaccinations in July last year and has approved five local vaccines since then. However, there is no official comment on whether President Xi has taken any vaccine or whether he intends to take it soon. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, likened to Donald Trump, has said as early as last year that he will not take the vaccine. “I’m telling you, I’m not going to take it. It’s my right,” he said in November last year. The president has been calling the virus a “small flu” and has been fighting virus-related restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic. Brazil is the second-worst affected country in the world.Other world leadersSome world leaders outside the G20, such as Seychelles President Wavel Ramkalawan and UAE Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have been publicly inoculated.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, his family and several senior North Korean officials have also been vaccinated, a US analyst said in December, citing two unidentified Japanese intelligence sources. “Kim Jong Un and multiple other high-ranking officials within the Kim family and leadership network have been vaccinated for coronavirus within the last two to three weeks thanks to a vaccine candidate supplied by the Chinese government,” Harry Kazianis, a North Korea expert at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, wrote in an article for online outlet 19FortyFive.In October, Kim had told the audience at a military parade that “not a single person” in North Korea had contracted the coronavirus.Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo on Monday became the first recipient of a Covid-19 vaccine under the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax) scheme. The global initiative aimed at providing vaccines to poorer countries is using at least 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India. “It is important that I set the example that this vaccine is safe by being the first to have it,” he said. PM Modi was given Covaxin, the vaccine developed by Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech Limited, at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). He was vaccinated on the first day of the second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive that has been rolled out across the nation.

02-03-2021||World||US downplays possibility of sharing Covid-19 vaccines with Mexico||The Biden administration on Monday downplayed the prospect of sharing coronavirus vaccines with Mexico, saying it is focused first on getting its own population protected against a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans.The remarks by White House press secretary Jen Psaki came before a video conference between Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and US President Joe Biden, in which the Mexican leader was expected to ask the United States to consider sharing some of its Covid-19 vaccine supply."The administration's focus is on ensuring that every American is vaccinated. And once we accomplish that objective, we're happy to discuss further steps," Psaki said at a White House news conference.Biden told reporters that the two leaders would discuss the issue at the meeting's outset. But an official statement released after the meeting ended made no mention of vaccine distribution.Biden has predicted the United States will have enough supply by late July to inoculate all Americans. US authorities have administered 76.9 million doses to date, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), enough for 23% of the population to get the two doses recommended for full protection under the vaccines that have been deployed so far.Mexico has vaccinated roughly 2.5 million doses so far, enough for about 1% of the population, according to data compiled by Reuters officials have been frustrated by bottlenecks in supply and raised concerns that wealthy countries are hoarding vaccines.Loprez Obrador said at a news conference before the meeting that he would ask Biden to share the vaccines it has. Mexico would repay Washington once pharmaceutical companies have delivered on their orders, according to Reuters reporting.In a joint statement released after the meeting, the two countries said they would deepen their cooperation on Covid-19 response.They also said they would work together on immigration policies "that recognize the dignity of migrants and the imperative of orderly, safe, and regular migration."Lopez Obrador is pushing for more US work permits for Mexicans and Central Americans, including professionals.The two countries also said they would try to cooperate on efforts to slow climate change and would restart high-level diplomatic talks on trade and labor rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-downplays-possibility-of-sharing-covid-19-vaccines-with-mexico-101614671823667.html
02-03-2021||World||Victims of anti-Asian attacks reflect a year into pandemic||Nearly a year after they were almost stabbed to death inside a Midland, Texas, Sam's Club, Bawi Cung and his two sons all have visible scars.It's the unseen ones though that are harder to get over. Cung can’t walk through any store without constantly looking in all directions. His 6-year-old son, who now can't move one eyebrow, is afraid to sleep alone.On a Saturday evening in March, when Covid-19 panic shopping gripped the nation, Cung was in search of rice at a cheaper price. The family was in the Sam's Club meat section when Cung suddenly felt a punch to the back of his head. A man he didn't know then slashed his face with a knife. The assailant left but soon returned to stab the boys. He wounded the 3-year-old in the back and slashed the 6-year-old from his right eye to a couple of inches past his right ear.The grisly encounter brought home the dangerous climate Asian Americans have faced since the coronavirus entered the US, with racially motivated harassment and assaults occurring from coast to coast.Now, just over a year and thousands of incidents later, some of the early victims find moving forward has been difficult or, at best, bittersweet. A recent wave of attacks on elderly Asian Americans — including the death of an 84-year-old San Francisco man — has fueled worries that hostilities have only worsened.In Cung's case, the man responsible for the attack believed the Myanmar man and his children were Chinese and spreading the virus, according to the FBI.Cung said he’s not sure what would have happened had a Sam’s Club employee, Zach Owen, not intervened.“Maybe I might kill him. Maybe he might kill all of my family. I don’t know,” Cung said. “God protected my family, God sent Zach to protect my family right there at the right time.”Owen, who was stabbed in the leg and deeply cut in his right palm, and an off-duty Border Patrol agent detained the suspect, Jose Gomez, 19.Verbal attacks have also made a lasting mark.In April, a confrontation in a Richmond, California, park left an irrevocable impact not just on Kelly Yang, 36, but her children. She was forced to discuss anti-Asian racism with her son, 10, and daughter, 7 — a talk she didn't think would happen for a few more years. An elderly white couple, upset over her unleashed dog, called Yang, who is Chinese American, an “Oriental” and said the words many Asian Americans dread: “Go back where you came from.”Her children thought the couple meant for them to go home. Torn, Yang eventually explained they meant “for us to go back to Asia.""It means that we’re not welcome here.”Her son burst into tears.Yang believes the couple felt emboldened by then-President Donald Trump’s use of racially charged terms like “Chinese virus." She applauded President Joe Biden's recent executive order condemning anti-Asian xenophobia as a good start. But Yang is afraid a lot of non-Asians have already shrugged off the issue as though it ceased when Trump's presidency did.“I don’t know what can be done,” said Yang, who writes young adult novels and plans to weave her experience into her next book. “But I do know talking about it, acknowledging it, remembering — that’s what we do with wars — we have to remember what happened.”Douglas Kim, 42, chef and owner of Jeju Noodle Bar in New York City, is certain COVID-19-fueled racism was behind the April vandalizing of his Michelin-starred, Korean restaurant. Someone used a Sharpie to scrawl on the winter vestibule “Stop eating dogs,” referring to a stereotype about Asian cuisines. Ultimately, Kim decided not to report it.“At the time it pissed me off, but I have more important things to worry about," Kim said. "Maintaining a business is more important.”He shared a picture of the graffiti on Instagram to call attention to hate crimes. There was a groundswell of support, but he feels like much of it has faded.Yet, Kim is hopeful fewer people are stereotyping Asian Americans as foreigners who don't belong in the U.S.“I think it’s all about education,” Kim said. “If you raise your children that way, they’re gonna learn that way. I think things are changing but it’s not 100% yet. That’s why somebody obviously wrote that on our door.”More than 3,000 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian American Pacific Islanders, and its partner advocacy groups, since mid-March 2020. What's frustrating is that the encounters don't often rise to the legal definition of a hate crime. Still, police in several major cities saw a sharp uptick in Asian-targeted hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, according to data collected by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, California State University, San Bernardino. New York City went from three incidents to 27, Los Angeles from seven to 15, and Denver had three incidents in 2020 — the first reported there in six years.A rash of crimes victimizing elderly Asian Americans in the past two months has renewed outcry for more attention from politicians and the media. On Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on legislation allocating $1.4 million to Stop AAPI Hate and the UCLA Asian American Studies Center. The funding will go toward community resources and further tracking of anti-Asian hate incidents.Local officials and citizens have also taken notice. Initiatives like increased police presence, volunteer patrols and special crime hotlines are coming to fruition. Big-name brands like the Golden State Warriors and Apple, based in the Bay Area, have promised to donate to the cause.Cynthia Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate, wishes news cycles would focus not just on the latest crimes but the solutions being discussed. Policing and prosecution aren't necessarily the answers, she said. COVID-19 vitriol is rooted in more than a century of anti-Chinese and anti-immigrant attitudes. She and other advocates think more investment in education and community resources could help get at those root causes. Anti-Asian xenophobia should be part of the ongoing conversations on racial reckoning, Choi added.“Our work to address anti-Asian racism is inextricably tied to fighting anti-Black racism,” Choi said. “That’s gonna take all of us, it’s gonna take public education efforts, it’s gonna take racial solidarity efforts that really bring our communities together."Before immigrating to the U.S. six years ago, Cung, the Texas hate crime survivor, had never encountered racism. Now, it's difficult for him to hear stories about anti-Asian American violence. Initially after the attack, Cung wrestled with how Gomez tried to kill him simply because of how he looked. Now, he prays for his attacker.As for what should happen to Gomez, who remains jailed on three counts of attempted capital murder, Cung said that's up to the courts.“I can forgive him, but we cannot accept racism or that kind of terrorist attack,” said Cung, who received more than $20,000 in online donations.One thing he is looking ahead to — life as a newly naturalized U.S. citizen in a country where “they respect people.” Cung remains unbothered that he may not fit some people's idea of what America looks like.“Maybe personally they have racism,” Cung said. “I don’t care. I’m proud of being Asian and Asian American.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/victims-of-anti-asian-attacks-reflect-a-year-into-pandemic-101614670818463.html

The plane can also carry weapons and act as a shield to help protect more expensive manned fighter jets.The US Air Force in December awarded multi-million dollar contracts to Boeing, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions to produce unmanned aerial prototypes that can team with crewed jets."The airpower teaming system is the basis for our Skyborg bid," Boeing airpower teaming programme director Shane Arnott told reporters. "Obviously the US market is a big market. That is a focus for us, achieving some sort of contract or programme of record in the United States."Defence contractors are investing increasingly in autonomous technology as militaries around the world look for cheaper and safer ways to maximise their resources.Australia, a staunch US ally, is home to Boeing's largest footprint outside the United States and has vast airspace with relatively low traffic for flight testing.The Australian government said on Tuesday it would invest a further A$115 million ($89 million) to acquire three more Loyal Wingman aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to develop tactics for using the jets with crewed planes, on top of its initial investment of A$40 million."Our aim with Boeing is to understand how we can get these aircraft to team with our existing aircraft to be a force multiplier in the future," RAAF Air-Vice Marshal and head of air force capability Cath Roberts said.Britain in January signed a GBP 30 million ($42 million) contract with the Belfast unit of Spirit AeroSystems for a similar type of pilotless aircraft to have a trial flight in the next three years.During the test flight in Australia, the Loyal Wingman took off under its own power before flying a pre-determined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify its functionality and demonstrate the performance of the design.Arnott said that three Loyal Wingman aircraft would be used for teaming flights this year and that the Australian government's order would take the number available to six.Boeing has said up to 16 Loyal Wingman jets could be teamed with a crewed aircraft for missions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-to-base-us-air-force-prototype-on-australian-pilotless-combat-jet-101614670626277.html

She has been living in Vancouver since then with a court-appointed security detail and restrictions on her movements. Her case has become a flashpoint in US-China relations, with Canada caught in the middle.In seeking the admission of new evidence Monday, Addario argued that HSBC brass had known for some time that Huawei controlled the accounts of Canicula Holdings Ltd., the parent company of Skycom, the entity accused of doing business in Iran.Meng went into the 2013 Hong Kong meeting, which featured a Powerpoint presentation by Meng in Chinese and translated into English, assuming her counterpart from the bank had full knowledge of Huawei’s “non-arm’s-length” relationship with Canicula, Addario said in court.Huawei sold Skycom to Canicula in 2007. Meng’s lawyers argued that Huawei’s continued affiliation with Skycom through its control of Canicula’s accounts was widely known within the bank.Also read: HSBC sees its future occupying 40% less office space after coronavirus pandemic‘Conduit of Information’HSBC’s relationship manager on the Huawei account, who cannot be named because of a court-ordered publication ban, “couldn’t be doing his job and not know about the relationship” between Huawei and Skycom, Addario said. “He’s far more than a gopher. He’s the actual conduit of information between the two institutions.”Last month, Meng’s legal team failed in an attempt in a British court to obtain internal documents from HSBC that might bolster her case.In rebuttal, Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater reminded the court that the extradition hearing is not meant to take the place of the trial Meng might face in the US if she is sent there.The proceedings are expected to continue until at least May and may be subject to further appeals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hsbc-banker-knew-about-dealings-with-iran-meng-s-defense-argues-101614649381587.html

The accused include some of the city’s most prominent activists such as Joshua Wong, Benny Tai and Jimmy Sham and most have objected to government requests to keep them in jail while also delaying further proceedings until at least May 31.The mass hearing before Chief Magistrate Victor So lasted much of the day Monday, with hundreds of supporters staging a defiant rally outside. It adjourned around 3 a.m. after one defendant, Clarisse Yeung, 34, fainted. A small number of protesters gathered outside the courthouse in the West Kowloon area for a second day.Police gave tickets to 42 people for breaching Covid-related restrictions during the protests outside the court Monday, Cable TV reported. One person was arrested for crossing a cordoned area and refusing to produce identification, the broadcaster said.Also read: China asks Australia to abandon its interference in Hong Kong's affairsThe case comes days before an annual meeting of China’s legislature opens in Beijing, with senior officials calling for lawmakers to overhaul the former British colony’s election system to further diminish the influence of pro-democracy politicians.

02-03-2021||World||Fossils of oldest member of huge dinosaur group found in Argentina||Scientists have unearthed in Argentina's Patagonian wilderness fossils of what may be the oldest-known member of the dinosaur group known as titanosaurs that includes the largest land animals in Earth's history.Researchers said on Monday the fossils represent a dinosaur species named Ninjatitan zapatai that lived 140 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period. They identified Ninjatitan as a titanosaur, a group of long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four pillar-like legs.The dinosaur's incomplete skeletal remains were discovered south of the city of Neuquen. The researchers said Ninjatitan demonstrated that the titanosaurs as a group first appeared longer ago than previously known."It is the oldest record known, not only from Argentina but worldwide," study lead author Pablo Gallina, a researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina (CONICET), told Reuters. "Titanosaurs are recorded on various sides of the world, but the oldest-known records were more modern than this find."At a length of about 65 feet (20 meters), Ninjatitan was a large dinosaur, but much smaller than later titanosaurs such as Argentinosaurus that reached a length of around 115 feet (35 meters). The researchers also said the presence of such an early titanosaur in Patagonia supports the idea that titanosaurs originated in the Southern Hemisphere.The findings were published in the scientific journal Ameghiniana.Titanosaurs are part of a larger dinosaur group called sauropods that includes others with similar body designs such as Brontosaurus and Diplodocus that lived in North America during the Jurassic Period, which preceded the Cretaceous Period.A number of the titanosaurs that inhabited Patagonia achieved gigantic proportions such as Argentinosaurus, Patagotitan and Dreadnoughtus.José Luis Carbadillo, another CONICET researcher, told a local university publication http://www.ctys.com.ar/index.php?idPage=20&idArticulo=3796 that the age of Ninjatitan's remains could have led people to assume that the bones belonged to a dinosaur group that pre-dated titanosaurs."In Patagonia, titanosaurs are only known about from less than 120 million years ago," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fossils-of-oldest-member-of-huge-dinosaur-group-found-in-argentina-101614661258541.html

It also issued visa bans on 76 Saudis.Price said he could not disclose the names of the 76 people and declined to say whether or not Mohammed bin Salman was among them. The United States has urged Saudi Arabia to disband the RIF, Price added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-focused-on-future-conduct-of-saudi-arabia-after-khashoggi-sanctions-101614661515650.html

Her condition was not immediately disclosed.Local media reported three other defendants fainted after the hearings were adjourned.On Monday, about 1,000 supporters gathered outside the West Kowloon courthouse as the defendants, charged under the Chinese-ruled city's contentious national security law, faced charges after their arrest over the weekend.The crowd chanted slogans such as "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times" and with many dressed in black, the images were reminiscent of scenes during anti-government demonstrations that roiled the city in 2019.The activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial primary poll last July aimed at selecting the strongest candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.Authorities said the informal poll was part of a plan to "overthrow" the government, stoking concerns alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn since Beijing imposed the security law on the former British colony in June.The detentions have drawn international condemnation and accusations that the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing are using the law to crush dissent and stifle the opposition.US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday Washington called on Hong Kong authorities to release those still held and drop charges against them.Beijing has said the security legislation, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, is necessary to restore stability in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hearing-for-hong-kong-democracy-activists-resumes-after-marathon-session-101614653490413.html

Paul Kelly, their lawyer, confirmed they were en route for Japan aboard a flight from Boston scheduled to arrive in Tokyo around 1600 local time (0700 GMT)."This is a sad day for the family, and for all who believe that veterans deserve better treatment from their own country," he said in a statement.The US Justice Department and the US State Department declined to comment. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which will handle the case, also declined to comment.The two men will not be indicted immediately, but will likely faces charges once an investigation, which will start when they arrive in Japan, is concluded.Also read: US top court rejects bid by Ghosn's accused escape plotters to avoid extraditionJapanese prosecutors have declined to say where the pair will be detained. One potential location is the Tokyo Detention House, the city's main jail where Ghosn was held after his arrest.The Taylors are alleged to have helped Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements and enriching himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services.The Taylors, with the aid of a collection of high-powered lawyers and lobbyists, for months waged a campaign to press their case against extradition in the courts, media, State Department and White House.The Taylors' lawyers argued that their clients could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone "bail jump" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect of relentless interrogations and torture.Under Japanese law, suspects can be held for up to 20 days before being charged or released, and are not allowed to have their lawyers present during questioning by prosecutors.

Eventually, the work will be done by a combination of humans and automation, it said.Twitter had already banned some Covid-related misinformation in December, including falsehoods about how the virus spreads, whether masks are effective and the risk of infection and death."Through the use of the strike system, we hope to educate people on why certain content breaks our rules so they have the opportunity to further consider their behaviour and their impact on the public conversation," Twitter said in a blog post Monday.People with one violation — or strike — will see no action. Two strikes will lead to an account being locked for 12 hours. Five or more will get a user permanently banned from Twitter.Facebook has also stepped up its vaccine misinformation fight after years of half-hearted enforcement. It announced an expanded policy last month that includes all vaccines — not just those against Covid-19.San Francisco-based Twitter did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on whether it also plans to include broader anti-vax misinformation in its policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-cracks-down-on-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-101614653124063.html

Trump also said he is not launching a new political party and called on Republicans to unify.Taking the stage for the first time since leaving office, Trump launched an attack on his successor, President Joe Biden, saying he has had the “most disastrous first month of any president in modern history”.Trump’s remarks came on the closing day of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida.“As you know, they just lost the White House,” said Trump, repeating his claim about the November election, as he set up his 2024 run for the US presidency. “I may even decide to beat them for a third time,” he added, referring to his first win in 2016 and the defeat in 2020, which he continues to portray as a victory.As a straw poll of the attendees at the CPAC showed he is the front-runner for the party’s nomination for president by a wide margin.“We’re not starting new parties,” Trump told the attendees. “We have the Republican Party. It is going to unite and be stronger than ever before.”WH defends decision not to sanction Saudi princeThe Biden administration defended its decision not to sanction Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his role in the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US has not historically sanctioned the leaders of countries “where we have diplomatic relations”.Meanwhile, UN human rights investigator Agnes Callamard has said it was “extremely dangerous” for the US to have named the de facto Saudi ruler as having approved the operation to kill Khashoggi but not to have taken action against him.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-again-hints-at-a-2024-poll-run-101614649437043.html
02-03-2021||World||One in four people will have hearing problems by 2050: WHO||One in four of the world's population will suffer from hearing problems by 2050, the World Health Organization warned Tuesday, calling for extra investment in prevention and treatment.The first-ever global report on hearing said that the causes of many of the problems -- such as infections, diseases, birth defects, noise exposure and lifestyle choices -- could be prevented.The report proposed a package of measures, which it calculated would cost $1.33 per person per year.Against that, it set the figure of nearly a trillion US dollars lost every year because the issue was not being properly addressed."Failure to act will be costly in terms of the health and well-being of those affected, and the financial losses arising from their exclusion from communication, education and employment," said the report.One in five people worldwide have hearing problems currently, it said.But the report warned: "The number of people with hearing loss may increase more than 1.5-fold during the next three decades" to 2.5 billion people -- up from 1.6 billion in 2019.Of the 2.5 billion, 700 million would in 2050 have a serious enough condition to require some kind of treatment, it added -- up from 430 million in 2019.Much of the expected rise is due to demographic and population trends, it added.Poor access to treatmentA major contributor to hearing problems is a lack of access to care, which is particularly striking in low-income countries where there are far fewer professionals available to treat them.Since nearly 80 percent of people with hearing loss live in such countries, most are not getting the help they need.Even in richer countries with better facilities, access to care is often uneven, said the report.And a lack of accurate information and the stigma surrounding ear disease and hearing loss also prevents people getting the care they need."Even among health-care providers, knowledge relevant to prevention, early identification and management of hearing loss and ear diseases is commonly lacking," it noted.The report proposed a package of measures, including public health initiatives from reducing noise in public spaces to increasing vaccinations for diseases such as meningitis that can cause hearing loss.It also recommended systematic screening to identify the problem at key points in people's lives.Among children, it said, hearing loss could be prevented in 60 percent of cases."An estimated one trillion US dollars is lost each year due to our collective failure to adequately address hearing loss," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the report."While the financial burden is enormous, what cannot be quantified is the distress caused by the loss of communication, education and social interaction that accompanies unaddressed hearing loss."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-four-people-will-have-hearing-problems-by-2050-who-101614647809196.html
02-03-2021||World||Donald Trump, Melania vaccinated against Covid-19 before leaving White House||Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, were vaccinated against the coronavirus in January before leaving the White House, an advisor to the former president said on Monday."President Trump and the first lady were vaccinated at the White House in January," the advisor said without providing any further details.Joe Biden, who took over as president on January 20, was vaccinated publicly against the coronavirus on December 21 but the Trumps' vaccinations had not been revealed previously.Trump, in a speech on Sunday, his first since leaving the White House, said everyone should get vaccinated against Covid-19, which has left more than 500,000 people dead in the United States.Some of Trump's supporters have expressed skepticism about being vaccinated.Trump came down with Covid-19 in early October and was hospitalized for several days in a suburb of Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-vaccinated-against-covid-19-before-leaving-white-house-advisor-101614645129754.html
02-03-2021||World||Khashoggi murder: US calls tougher Saudi stance a recalibration, not a rupture||President Joe Biden’s approach to Saudi Arabia represents a “recalibration” and not a break in historically close ties, as the U.S. plans to make respect for human rights more central to its policy toward the kingdom, a State Department spokesman said.“We will never check our values at the door even when it comes to our closest security relationships,” spokesman Ned Price said at a briefing Monday. “We feel we can have the most influence over this partnership when it’s cast as a recalibration, not a rupture.”The new tone follows the administration’s decision last week to declassify and release an intelligence report done during the Trump administration that concluded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill” Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in 2018.It’s also meant to change course after four years in which President Donald Trump placed close ties with Saudi Arabia at the center of U.S. policy in the Middle East. His first overseas trip as president was to the kingdom, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner developed a close relationship with the crown price.At the same time, the Biden administration has indicated it’s only willing to go so far. The U.S. has held off imposing sanctions directly against the crown prince, and Price offered little new information a day after White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the State Department would provide “more details and elaborate” on the administration’s approach.Price declined to detail the list of people who are subject to a new policy, announced Friday, known as the “Khashoggi ban,” which imposes visa limits on anyone who violates the rights of dissidents beyond their country’s borders. On Friday, 76 Saudi individuals were put on that list.The decision not to directly target Prince Mohammed drew criticism from human rights activists and supporters of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who was killed by a Saudi hit team after he visited the country’s consulate in Istanbul to pick up some marriage documents.“It appears as though under the Biden administration, despots who offer momentarily strategic value to the United States might be given a ‘one free murder’ pass,” Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan wrote on Monday. “We should not make exceptions to favor one brutal dictator over another based on favors they do for us or fears that they might not always respond as we would like them to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-tougher-saudi-stance-a-recalibration-not-a-rupture-101614644350175.html
02-03-2021||World||Texas top utility regulator quits in fallout over blackouts||Texas' top utilities regulator resigned Monday in the widening fallout from blackouts triggered by an unusually heavy and widespread winter storm that left millions in the state without power and water for days.DeAnn Walker, the chairwoman of the Public Utility Commission, is the highest-ranking official to step down in the aftermath of one of the largest power failures in US history.Gov. Greg Abbott appointed Walker to the commission in 2017, and she is one of two commissioners who used to work in his office. In a letter to Abbott, Walker said she accepted her role in the outages but that others should acknowledge their responsibility, including gas companies and lawmakers.“I believe others should come forward in dignity and courage and acknowledge how their actions or inactions contributed to the situation," Walker wrote.Also Read | Texas’s power market is $1.3 billion short after energy crisisShe resigned the same day Texas' largest and oldest power cooperative announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and as the state's attorney general launched an investigation into one electricity provider, Griddy, whose customers incurred massive bills during February’s winter storm.Abbott, a Republican, blamed the power failures on the state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, commonly known as ERCOT. But the three-member commission appointed by Abbott has oversight authority over ERCOT.Abbott's spokesman Renae Eze said in a short statement that the governor thanks Walker “for her years of service to the State of Texas." The statement did not reflect on Walker's performance ahead of the outages.Walker struggled in two lengthy appearances before legislative panels investigating the state's electric grid breakdowns, the commission's response and the lack of communication with the public over the approaching storm.She initially said her agency has little control over ERCOT, but later said it has total control. Lawmakers questioned her knowledge of her agency’s authority and the decision to reduce or reassign enforcement staff charged with policing the utility companies.“Despite the treatment I received from some legislators, I am proud that I spoke the truth," Walker wrote.She was also criticized for a lack of communication about the approaching catastrophic storm. Walker testified that she spoke with Abbott’s office, as well as staff for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and others several days before the storm hit to warn them about the weather and its potential impact on power distribution in the state.Texas was hit with historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures in an icy blast that cut across the Deep South for days starting Feb. 14. More than 40 deaths in Texas — and double that toll regionwide — have been blamed on the storm and the resulting blackouts.ERCOT officials have said the entire grid — which is uniquely isolated from the rest of the U.S. — was on the brink of collapse in the early hours of Feb. 15 as power plants froze in the cold and record demand for electricity to heat homes overwhelmed the system.At least six ERCOT board members have resigned in the wake of the power failures.Also Monday, Brazos Electric Power announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing the punishing storm. The state's largest and oldest power cooperative said it received excessively high invoices from ERCOT for collateral and purported cost of electric service during the storm, and that it was not prepared to pass those costs along to its members or customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-top-utility-regulator-quits-in-fallout-over-blackouts-101614643519242.html
02-03-2021||World||Pakistan may witness 3rd wave of Covid-19 amid dull vaccination drive: Experts||Pakistan may witness a resurgence in the number of Covid-19 cases that might lead to a third wave of coronavirus in the country as restrictions related to the virus have been relaxed, Dawn reported citing health experts.Moreover, there has been a lukewarm response of even health workers to the government-run vaccination campaign. As many as 1,176 Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday.The country has reported over 5,81,00 Covid-19 cases and 12,896 deaths so far.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEarlier on Feburary 24, Pakistan's National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Covid-19 relaxed most of the restrictions on commercial activities, schools, offices and other workplaces, allowing them to function at full strength.Under the directives, time limit on commercial activities has been lifted and the condition of 50 per cent attendance at workplaces removed.Schools have been asked to function five days a week with full strength. Permission to hold indoor wedding ceremonies and opening of cinemas and shrines has been granted with effect from March 15.The decision to allow indoor dining will depend on the outcome of the review meeting to be held on March 10.While talking to Dawn, Secretary-General of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Dr Qaisar Sajjad said: "We are living in a society where people do not follow the SOPs. They even laugh at those wearing face masks. We have already observed the results of lifting of restrictions in September last year when 100 to 200 daily cases were being reported, and within a month the government had to declare a second wave of coronavirus.""I believe that restrictions should be lifted after vaccinating 70pc population as only then we can get herd immunity. Just two weeks ago, three cases were reported in Melbourne, Australia. Though all three persons had arrived through foreign flights but the whole Melbourne city was closed for five days. It is unfortunate that we are taking even over 1,000 cases lightly," he added.While pointing out that the response to the vaccination drive in Pakistan was very slow, the PMA secretary-general blamed the government for it and said that no one at the helm had bothered to handle the issue seriously."Actors have been engaged for vaccination campaign rather than renowned doctors. How a person can get medical advice from an actor? Moreover, advertisements should be shown during peak hours. Currently, we see a bombardment of advertisements during PSL matches but we don't see a single ad on vaccination during matches. Also, data of healthcare workers, who have been vaccinated so far, is not being shared. We don't know how many general practitioners, nurses, etc have been vaccinated," he said.Due to the lukewarm response to the vaccination, Islamabad's biggest hospital Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) has warned its employees of disciplinary action.Unfortunately, the government was looking at the issue with a mere focus on the country's economic growth rather than public health, Dr Javaid Usman, a microbiologist, said while talking to Dawn."Possibility of a third wave cannot be ruled out. We are giving another opportunity to the virus to bounce back. We should not forget that now there are more than one variants of the virus in Pakistan and they are more infectious and transmissible. Luckily, they are not as virulent as the previous type. But it is not a good decision to lift restrictions as cases are continuously fluctuating and we have been observing sudden spikes," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-may-witness-third-wave-of-covid-19-amid-dull-vaccination-drive-experts-101614643828847.html
02-03-2021||World||Biden tries to reset relationship with Mexican president amid migration issue||As President Joe Biden looks to dismantle the last administration’s hardline immigration agenda, he worked Monday to build a partnership with someone who found an unexpected understanding with Donald Trump: Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Biden and López Obrador met for a virtual bilateral meeting, with immigration, the coronavirus pandemic and climate issues on the agenda. Looming large was how the two leaders would get along in what has become an increasingly complicated relationship.“We haven’t been perfect neighbors to each other,” Biden acknowledged in brief remarks at the start of his video conference meeting with the Mexican president.López Obrador, for his part, told Biden that he was thankful that the new president was “willing to maintain good relations for the good of our people in North America.”The Mexican president also gave a wink to a rueful observation attributed to José de la Cruz Porfirio Díaz Mori, the Mexican general who served seven terms as the country’s president, about the two countries’ relationship: “Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the U.S.”“I can now say ‘It’s wonderful for Mexico to be close to God and not so far from the United States’” López Obrador said.Lopez Obrador came to the meeting with his own checklist of priorities, including pressing Biden to give pharmaceutical company Pfizer permission to sell his country vaccine produced in the United States, something that Canada has also requested from the White House.“We want to have an answer about a request we made,” Lopez Obrador told reporters at his daily news conference, hours before speaking with Biden.Ahead of the meeting, White House officials reiterated that Biden remained focused on first vaccinating U.S. citizens before turning his attention to assisting other nations. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters at the start of the meeting, said the two leaders would be discussing vaccines.Relations with Biden will be much more complex and multi-faceted than they were with Trump.As a candidate, Trump referred to Mexicans as rapists. The Republican's signature campaign promise was building a “big, beautiful wall’ across the length of the southern border. And leaked conversations showed Trump hectoring López Obrador's predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, against publicly saying that Mexico would never pay for a southern border wall.But López Obrador appeared to reach a one-issue understanding with Trump: Mexico stopped the flow of Central American migrants trying to reach the U.S. border, and Trump often appeared to turn a blind eye to just about every other facet in the complicated relationship.There was no shortage of issues that Trump largely overlooked or played down in exchange for Mexico slowing the flow of undocumented immigrants from the border.López Obrador, who took office in 2018, accused U.S. officials of fabricating drug trafficking charges against the country’s former defense secretary, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, and demanded the general's return after he was arrested in Los Angeles in October. U.S. prosecutors eventually acquiesced.Under his watch, López Obrador has attempted to consolidate the position of Mexico’s national oil company and national electric utility, and prioritized fossil fuel companies amid a global push to curb greenhouse gas emissions.Early in his term, the Mexican president pursued a counter-narcotics strategy that largely ended the pursuit of high-profile arrests and focused more on poverty alleviation.Still, Trump heaped praise on López Obrador, calling him a “friend” and “great president” in one of his final presidential speeches, an address from the border to celebrate progress made on building the wall.The effort to reset the U.S.-Mexico relationship under Biden comes as a flood of migrants have rushed to the border since his victory in November.Biden has backed a bill to give legal status and a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Biden also broke with Trump by supporting efforts to allow hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. illegally as young children to remain in the country.Border Patrol agents are apprehending an average of more than 200 children crossing the border without a parent per day, but nearly all 7,100 beds for immigrant children maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services are full.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday sought to push back against the notion that the situation at the border was spinning out of control.“The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are working around the clock seven days a week to ensure that we do not have a crisis at the border, that we manage the challenge as acute as the challenge is, and they are not doing that alone,” Mayorkas said.Ahead of the meeting, López Obrador also floated a proposal for a Bracero-style immigrant work visa program for 600,000 to 800,000 Mexican and Central American workers annually.Asked about the Mexican president’s proposal, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that reinstituting the Bracero program would require action by Congress.The original Bracero program allowed Mexicans to work temporarily in the United States to fill labor shortages during World War II and for a couple of decades after the war. López Obrador said the U.S. economy needs Mexican workers because of “their strength, their youth.”On Monday, López Obrador added that his new proposal would be a program not only for agriculture workers but for other sectors and professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-tries-to-reset-relationship-with-mexican-president-amid-migration-issue-101614643562039.html

"Hong Kong affairs fall entirely within China's internal affairs.

The school is in the city of Pine Bluff, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock.The school went on lockdown after the shooting. The shooter ran away but was found in a nearby neighborhood by a tracking dog, Sergeant said.The wounded boy, who was also 15, was airlifted to a Little Rock hospital where he was “in very serious condition,” Sergeant said. The boy later died, said Lt. David DeFoor, Pine Bluff's police spokesman.“We don’t have a definite motive right now as to why the incident occurred,” Sergeant said. “However we do believe this was a targeted incident as opposed to a random incident.”The suspect was taken to a juvenile detention center and prosecutors have not yet decided whether charges will be filed in juvenile or adult court, officials said. His name was not released because of his age.Monday was scheduled to be Watson Chapel's first day back for on-site learning in several weeks after winter weather and water issues closed the facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/15yearold-boy-shot-killed-at-arkansas-junior-high-school-101614636440404.html
02-03-2021||World||US presses Saudis over Khashoggi's killing amid calls to punish prince||The United States on Monday pressed Saudi Arabia to take further measures after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as Washington faced growing criticism that it did not directly target Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.President Joe Biden on Friday released an intelligence report that found that Prince Mohammed approved the 2018 killing of Khashoggi, a US-based contributor to The Washington Post who was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was strangled to death and dismembered.The report -- classified under former president Donald Trump, a close ally of the Saudis -- found that seven of the 15 members of the hit squad that flew to Istanbul came from the Rapid Intelligence Force, which it said "exists to defend the crown prince" and "answers only to him.""We have urged Saudi Arabia to disband this group and then adopt institutional, systemic reforms and controls to ensure that anti-dissident activities and operations cease and cease completely," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters."We have made crystal clear -- and will continue to do so -- that the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi 28 months ago remains unacceptable conduct," Price said.He also called on Saudi Arabia to act on other fronts including lifting a travel ban on Loujain al-Hathloul, an advocate for women's right to drive in the ultra-conservative kingdom who was provisionally freed in January after nearly three years in jail.The Biden administration imposed sanctions on the Rapid Intervention Force -- meaning any US transactions with it will be a crime -- and said it was banning entry into the United States of 76 Saudis under a new policy against foreign officials who harass dissidents.Biden has sought to "recalibrate" the decades-old Saudi alliance and has already said the United States will end support for offensive operations in the devastating Saudi war in Yemen.But the administration stopped short of personally targeting the 35-year-old crown prince -- the de facto leader as well as defense minister of the major oil provider.Asked why no action was taken against the prince, also known by his initials MBS, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the United States does not typically sanction foreign leaders -- despite frequent US actions against senior officials of hostile nations.But she hinted that Prince Mohammed was not permanently off the hook, saying: "Of course we reserve the right to take any action at the time and manner of our choosing."Price said that the United States would not "preview" who would be banned in the future but said, "I am not aware of any plans for the crown prince to travel to the United States in the near term."'Punished without delay'Khashoggi's Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said that the crown prince had lost legitimacy after the publication of the report."It is essential that the crown prince, who ordered the brutal murder of a blameless and innocent person, should be punished without delay," Cengiz said in a statement posted on Twitter."This will not only bring the justice we have been seeking for Jamal, but it could also prevent similar acts recurring in the future."Her comments were echoed in Geneva by Agnes Callamard, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions.Callamard called Washington's inaction against Prince Mohammed "extremely worrisome.""It is extremely, in my view, problematic if not dangerous to acknowledge someone's culpability and then to tell that someone that we won't do anything," Callamard told reporters."I am calling on the US government to act on its public findings and to sanction MBS for what he has done."The Saudi government denounced the US report. It insists Khashoggi's killing was a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presses-saudis-over-khashoggi-s-killing-amid-calls-to-punish-prince-101614636125682.html
