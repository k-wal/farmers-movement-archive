He suggested that countries were hastening to loosen those measures, betting on vaccines to bring an end to the Covid-19 pandemic."If countries rely solely on vaccines, they are making a mistake. Basic public health measures remain the foundation of the response," Tedros said.He noted that Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire became the first countries on Monday to begin vaccinating people with doses supplied by COVAX, the international programme to provide vaccines for poor and middle-income countries. But he also criticised rich countries for hoarding vaccine doses."It's regrettable that some countries continue to prioritise vaccinating younger healthier adults at lower risk of diseases in their own populations, ahead of health workers and older people elsewhere," Tedros said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-infections-rise-for-first-time-in-7-weeks-says-who-101614618338203.html
01-03-2021||World||Italy PM Draghi fires Covid-19 commissioner, with vaccination drive in spotlight||Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Monday fired Italy's special COVID-19 commissioner Domenico Arcuri and replaced him with an army logistics expert, in a signal the government wanted to speed up vaccinations.The move followed growing complaints about Arcuri's handling of the crisis and concern that the anti-COVID vaccine campaign was moving forward too slowly.It is one of Draghi's first major decisions since becoming premier last month and follows his firing last week of the chief of the civil protection agency. That step was also seen as an attempt to improve Italy's response to the COVID crisis.The new coronavirus commissioner was named as General Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, a former commander of NATO forces in Kosovo and head of army logistics since 2018.Draghi told parliament last month that he wanted to involve the military in the nationwide vaccine roll-out plan.Italy launched its inoculation campaign at the end of December, and has so far administered 4.3 million jabs including second shots.In all, it has received 6.3 million vaccine doses from manufacturers, but supply delays, which have also affected other European Union states, have hampered efforts.The country is due to receive millions more doses this month, but critics have said there is no coherent plan in place to allow for the sort of massive vaccination programmes that Britain and Israel instigated.Draghi said last month there was a growing case for Italy to follow the British example of making it a priority to give first jabs to as many people as possible.At present many EU countries, including Italy, are following drugmaker recommendations to give people two separate vaccinations and are holding back doses as a result.Arcuri, who also heads the national investments agency Invitalia, was appointed special COVID commissioner last year by the then-prime minister Giuseppe Conte.He has come under pressure in recent months after a judicial investigation alleged that one of his longtime acquaintances had received 12 million euros from a Chinese consortium after it won a major contract from the commissioner's office.Magistrates have placed the friend under investigation for alleged corruption. Arcuri is not under investigation himself, and has denied any wrongdoing.In its statement on Monday, Draghi's office thanked Arcuri for his "commitment and dedication ... in a moment of particular emergency for the country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-pm-draghi-fires-covid-19-commissioner-with-vaccination-drive-in-spotlight-101614617170148.html
01-03-2021||World||329 candidates nominated for 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by Feb 1 deadline||The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Monday that there are 329 candidates — 234 individuals and 95 organisations — that were nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by the February 1 deadline.The Oslo-based organization said that it was the third highest number of candidates ever, adding the current record of 376 candidates was reached in 2016.A vast group of people — heads of state or politicians serving at a national level, university professors, directors of foreign policy institutes, past Nobel Prize recipients and members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee — can submit a nomination for the prize.However, the nominees aren't announced by the very secretive board in Oslo, but those doing the nominating may choose to make it public, raising publicity both for the nominee and the proposer.The Associated Press earlier has reported that the 2021 nominees include exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and two other Belarus democracy activists, Veronika Tsepkalo and Maria Kolesnikova; the Black Lives Matter movement; Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate who has become a leading voting rights advocate; and former White House adviser Jared Kushner and his deputy, Avi Berkowitz, who negotiated a series of Middle East agreements known as the Abraham Accords.Groups nominated in 2021 include the World Health Organization for its role in addressing the coronavirus pandemic; NATO; Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF; and Polish judges defending civil rights.The UN World Food Program won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Committee announces its annual decision in October. The peace prize and other Nobel prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.Five Nobel Prizes were established under the terms of Alfred Nobel's will. A sixth prize, for economics, was created by the Central Bank of Sweden in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel.Each prize carry substantial cash awards that are adjusted each year. In 2020, they came with a 10-milion krona (USD 1.1 million) cash award — which often is shared — along with diplomas and gold medals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/329-candidates-nominated-for-2021-nobel-peace-prize-by-feb-1-deadline-101614617187145.html
01-03-2021||World||China sets aim to vaccinate 40% of population by June||China is lagging in its coronavirus vaccination rollout because it has the disease largely under control, but plans to inoculate 40% of its population by June, Chinese health experts said Monday.Zhong Nanshan, the leader of a group of experts attached to the National Health Commission, said the country has delivered 52.52 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of February 28. He was speaking at an online forum between US and Chinese medical experts hosted by the Brookings Institution and Tsinghua University.The target is the first China has offered publicly since it began its mass immunization campaign for key groups in mid-December.China has been slow to vaccinate its people relative to other countries, inoculating only 3.56% of its population of 1.4 billion so far, according to Zhong. Ranked first in the world in terms of percentage of population is Israel, which has vaccinated over 90% of its people. The US has vaccinated about 22% of its population.Chinese health experts say the country has enough vaccine supply for its population, although the country has pledged to provide close to half a billion doses abroad, roughly 10 times the number it has delivered at home.“The current vaccination pace is very low due to outbreak control (being) so good in China, but I think the capacity is enough,” said Zhang Wenhong, an infectious diseases expert based in Shanghai who also spoke on the panel.Developers of China’s four currently approved vaccines have said they could manufacture up to 2.6 billion doses by the end of this year. Still, vaccinating China’s massive population will be a daunting task.Even at the rate of vaccinating 10 million people a day, it would take roughly seven months to vaccinate 70% of its population, Zhang noted.The experts all acknowledged the complex task of vaccinating the world's population, pointing to the slowness in the global rollout of vaccines.“Demand will outstrip supply for many months, and unless there is more manufacturing, … for years,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.They also cautioned against expecting a quick return to normal.The head of China’s Center for Disease Control, Gao Fu, predicted that life could return to an “approximate normal” in summer next year.Gao, along with Zhong and other Chinese health experts, urged more US-China cooperation. Gao specifically called on the U.S. and China to cooperate on COVAX, an initiative to distribute vaccines more fairly across the developing world.“Let’s work together,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sets-aim-to-vaccinate-40-of-population-by-june-101614615145187.html

Investors were also watching Washington as a big economic stimulus bill moved to the Senate.The S&P 500 added 2.1% as of 10:40 a.m. Eastern. More than 95% of the stocks in the index were higher, led by energy companies and airlines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.Much of the focus on Wall Street is on the bond market.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.43% after going as high as 1.5% last week, the highest level in more than a year. Higher interest rates can slow the economy and discourage borrowing.Bond yields, which influence interest ratest on mortgages and many other kinds of loans, have been steadily climbing much of the year, as investors have bet that vaccination efforts and more government stimulus will lead to strong economic growth this year. However, along with strong economic growth comes concerns of inflation.A handful high-level officials with the Federal Reserve will make speeches this week, which will give investors additional information on how concerned the nation's central bank is about the economy and inflation. Lael Brainard, an advocate for looser monetary policies, will give a monetary policy speech on Tuesday and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give a speech on Thursday.The House of Representatives approved Biden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill on Friday and it now goes to the Senate for approval. The bill infuses cash across the struggling economy to individuals, businesses, schools, states and cities battered by Covid-19.The stimulus bill would include yet another round of one-time payments to most Americans, including an expansion of other refundable tax credits like the child tax credit, and additional aid to state and local governments to combat the pandemic.Johnson & Johnson rose 1.5% after the Food and Drug Administration gave approval for the company's own coronavirus vaccine, one that does not require extensive refrigeration like the ones made by Moderna or Pfizer.Investors will get several big economic reports this week, including February's jobs report on Friday. On Monday a report on manufacturing came in better than expectations, and new orders also came in better than expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stocks-climb-more-than-2-as-investors-get-back-to-buying-101614614322817.html

India produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold in the world.Goldman Sachs-backed Cyfirma, based in Singapore and Tokyo, said Chinese hacking group APT10, also known as Stone Panda, had identified gaps and vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure and supply chain software of Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker."The real motivation here is actually exfiltrating intellectual property and getting competitive advantage over Indian pharmaceutical companies," said Cyfirma Chief Executive Kumar Ritesh, formerly a top cyber official with British foreign intelligence agency MI6.He said APT10 was actively targeting SII, which is making the AstraZeneca vaccine for many countries and will soon start bulk-manufacturing Novavax shots."In the case of Serum Institute, they have found a number of their public servers running weak web servers, these are vulnerable web servers," Ritesh said, referring to the hackers."They have spoken about weak web application, they are also talking about weak content-management system. It's quite alarming."China's foreign ministry did not reply to a request for comment. But responding to a question on whether Chinese hackers had a role in attacking India's power grid which caused a blackout in Mumbai last year, the ministry said it was a staunch defender of cyber security."China firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyber attacks," its embassy in New Delhi said on Twitter, quoting the foreign ministry. "Speculation and fabrication have no role to play on the issue of cyber attacks."SII and Bharat Biotech declined to comment. The office of the director-general of the state-run Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said the matter had been handed to its operations director, S.S. Sarma.Sarma told Reuters CERT was a "legal agency and we can't confirm this thing to media".Cyfirma said in a statement it had informed CERT authorities and that they had acknowledged the threat.The U.S. Department of Justice said https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion in 2018 that APT10 had acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security.Microsoft said https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum in November that it had detected cyber attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting vaccine companies in India, Canada, France, South Korea and the United States. North Korean hackers also tried to break into the systems of British drugmaker AstraZeneca, Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-astrazeneca-no-idUSKBN2871A2 has reported.Ritesh, whose firm follows the activities of some 750 cyber criminals and monitors nearly 2,000 hacking campaigns using a tool called DeCYFIR, said it was not yet clear what information APT10 may have accessed from the Indian companies.Relations between nuclear-armed neighbours China and India soured last June when 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in a Himalayan border fight.

On Monday they inspected two houses outside Barcelona which were illegally occupied and where at least some of the detained appeared to live, the source told Reuters.Police have arrested more than 100 people since the protests over the jailing of rapper Pablo Hasel erupted on February 16. The exact role of the foreigners was unclear.Miquel Samper, interior affairs minister in the Catalan regional government, told reporters on Monday that police face an "unprecedented complex situation" as the protesters could meet and take action quickly. Some were foreign anarchists, he said.The protests escalated on Saturday. A police van was set on fire with an officer inside who managed to escape. Protesters also smashed the fronts of shops and banks, including along Barcelona's central La Rambla boulevard.One of the arrested foreigners was related to the van attack, the source said.Hasel has been sentenced to nine months in prison after being convicted of glorifying terrorism and insulting the monarchy, galvanizing defenders of freedom of speech and sparking protests. The conviction also prompted the government to announce it would relax free speech legal restrictions.He was convicted for lyrics and tweets that included references to Basque separatist group ETA, calling Spain's former King Juan Carlos a mafia boss, and likening Spanish judges to Nazis.Samper said on Sunday a group of 150 and 200 protesters were behind the demonstrations' escalation into riots, some of whom threw petrol bombs, and they had engaged in direct violence with no apparent reason.Business organizations and police unions have demanded a firmer government action against the riots after damages to property already amounts to over two million euros. One protester lost an eye from the impact of a foam bullet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-investigate-possible-role-of-foreigners-in-barcelona-protests-101614613070140.html

"And if President Biden considers it, he can give us an answer in the conversation ... about the vaccines."He did not elaborate on the request, but said vaccines were very important to Mexico. Mexican magazine Proceso said Lopez Obrador had asked Biden for help on vaccines in January.Immigration, security, climate change and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal were also likely to feature in their talks, Lopez Obrador said.Lopez Obrador, a leftist, was also asked whether the two would discuss a contentious electricity bill he has championed which strengthens the position of the state-run electricity utility, the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE).The president has cast the legislation as a matter of national sovereignty, arguing that past governments skewed the electricity market in favor of private operators.Business groups have condemned the bill, saying it risks violating the USMCA and endangers Mexico's renewable energy targets because it puts wind and solar generators at a disadvantage against the CFE, a heavy user of fossil fuels.Lopez Obrador said their dialogue would be open, but that Biden respected Mexico's sovereignty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-hopes-for-us-answer-on-covid-19-vaccines-in-biden-talks-101614612720149.html

Palestinians have been critical of the rapprochement, worried that their own unmet statehood goal might be sidelined.Israel opened an embassy in Abu Dhabi in January. Israel considers Jerusalem its capital but this is not widely recognised abroad. The Palestinians want their own capital in the east of the city, which Israel captured in a 1967 war.The UAE would follow Jordan and Egypt in setting up an embassy in or near coastal metropolis Tel Aviv.According to the UAE Foreign Ministry, Al Khalja has experience in the energy, disarmament, business development and oil investment sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-uae-ambassador-arrives-in-israel-eyes-tel-aviv-embassy-101614609638519.html
01-03-2021||World||Experts urge independent probe into Kremlin critic Navalny's poisoning||Two top human rights officials urged an international probe into the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and called Monday for his immediate release from prison.Agnès Callamard, the Special U.N. Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and Irene Khan, the Special U.N. Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, said Navalny’s poisoning was intended to “send a clear, sinister warning that this would be the fate of anyone who would criticize and oppose the government.”“Given the inadequate response of the domestic authorities, the use of prohibited chemical weapons, and the apparent pattern of attempted targeted killings, we believe that an international investigation should be carried out as a matter of urgency in order to establish the facts and clarify all the circumstances concerning Mr. Navalny’s poisoning," they said in a statement.Navalny, the most prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell sick on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and was flown while still in a coma to Berlin for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have denied any involvement in the poisoning.In December, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as a fake.Callamard and Khan on Monday published their official letter sent to the Russian authorities in December and noted that “the availability of Novichok and the expertise required in handling it and in developing a novel form such as that found in Mr. Navalny’s samples could only be found within and amongst state actors.”The experts emphasized in a statement released by the U.N. that Navalny “was under intensive government surveillance at the time of the attempted killing, making it unlikely that any third party could have administered such a banned chemical without the knowledge of the Russian authorities.”Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 upon returning from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from the nerve agent poisoning. The arrest triggered massive protests, to which the Russian authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown.Last month, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the ECHR has ruled to be unlawful.Last week, Navalny was sent to serve his prison sentence to a prison outside Moscow despite the ECHR's demand for his release.Russian officials have dismissed demands from the United States and the European Union to free Navalny and stop the crackdown on his supporters.The rights experts noted that an international probe into Navalny's poisoning is “especially critical” now when he is in prison. They called for his immediate release and reminded Russia that it's “responsible for the care and protection of Mr. Navalny in prison and that it shall be held responsible for any harm that may befall him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-urge-independent-probe-into-kremlin-critic-navalny-s-poisoning-101614610654229.html
01-03-2021||World||Nepal President summons lower house session on March 7, after top court's order||Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Monday summoned a session of the House of Representatives on March 7, days after the apex court reinstated the lower house in a landmark verdict that annulled embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli's "unconstitutional" decision to dissolve it.President Bhandari called for the commencement of House on recommendation of Government of Nepal, in accordance with Article 93 (1) of the Constitution of Nepal, according to a notice issued by the President’s Office on Monday.As per the notice, the 275-member lower house will begin at 4:00pm on the slated date.The presidential order to summon the House meeting follows the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Prime Minister Oli’s move to dissolve the House on December 20.A five-member constitutional bench led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher last week annulled the Oli government's "unconstitutional" decision to dissolve the lower house of Parliament.The court had ordered the government to summon the House session within the next 13 days.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', also a co-chair of the ruling party.As many as 13 writ petitions including the one by the ruling party's Chief Whip Dev Prasad Gurung were filed in the apex court seeking the restoration of the lower house parliament.In its ruling, the apex court termed the dissolution of the House as "unconstitutional".The ruling party suffered a vertical split following Oli’s decision to dissolve the lower house.Prime Minister Oli on Sunday challenged the splinter faction led by 'Prachanda' to remove him from the top post if he can."Remove me if you can. If I am ousted, I’ll emerge victorious with a two-thirds majority in the next election," 69-year-old Oli said.Prachanda has been making efforts to garner support from the opposition Nepali Congress and Janata Samajbadi parties in an apparent bid to oust Oli from power.Oli's Press Advisor Surya Thapa last week said the prime minister will not resign immediately and implement the Supreme Court’s verdict against him by facing Parliament.Oli is under pressure to step down following the court verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-president-summons-lower-house-session-on-march-7-after-top-court-s-order-101614610556644.html
01-03-2021||World||What we know about the new Brazilian Covid-19 variant P.1||Britain on Monday sent out a public appeal to locate the mystery individual infected with an extremely infectious variant of coronavirus first detected in the Manaus city of Brazil.Britain sent out the 'please get in touch' appeal after the test resulted positive for the individual but failed to be contacted due to improper detailsThe Manaus or P.1 variant is considered to be highly infectious and appears to affect the immune response of the coronavirus vaccines presently available, as per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Till now, six individuals in Britain have been detected infected with the P.1 variant of the novel coronavirus.Here is what we know so far about itThe P.1 variant belongs to the lineage of B.1.1.28, that was first detected in Japan by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in four travellers that had arrived from Brazil, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The cause of concern in the P.1 variant is the three key mutations out of 17 mutations in its spike protein receptor domain-K417T, E484K, and N501Y says CDC.As per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is evidence that suggests the mutations in the P.1 variant can affect the ability of the prevalent antibodies through previous infections or vaccinations to identify and neutralize the virus."There is evidence to suggest that some of the mutations in the P.1 variant may affect its transmissibility and antigenic profile, which may affect the ability of antibodies generated through a previous natural infection or through vaccination to recognize and neutralize the virus," the CDC said.Also Read | Ukraine throws away unused Covid-19 shots as doctors skip their own vaccinationsThe presence of the E484K mutation in the variant which is also the key mutation in the South African variant of the coronavirus makes it more dangerous. "The evidence we have suggests that certainly the South African variant and potentially this Brazilian variant, which is somewhat similar - the vaccines we have at the moment are less effective at reducing at least mild disease and possibly transmission," Reuters quoted Adam Finn, a member of the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as saying.CDC also said that as per a recent study on the cluster found in the Mansaus city of Brazil, 42 per cent of the population was identified with P.1 variant in late December. It is worth noting that in the same region, it is estimated that approximately 75 per cent of the population had been infected by Covid-19 as of October 2020. But since mid-December the region has witnessed a surge in the coronavirus cases. Hence the presence of the variant raises serious concern about the increased transmissibility of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-we-know-about-the-new-brazilian-covid-19-variant-p1-101614605943003.html
01-03-2021||World||Ukraine throws away unused Covid-19 shots as doctors skip their own vaccinations||Ukrainian medical facilities have thrown away some unused Covid-19 vaccines after doctors failed to show up for their own appointments to be vaccinated, ruling party lawmakers said on Monday.Ukraine has just begun vaccinating its 41 million people against Covid-19 after receiving a first batch of 500,000 doses of Indian-made AstraZeneca shots last week, but faces a battle against vaccine scepticism that predates the pandemic.The government has prioritised giving shots to frontline medical workers but cited statistics showing that 47% of Ukrainians do not want the vaccine."It is important for us to understand how all the processes are set up, why doctors refuse to be vaccinated," Oleksandr Korniyenko, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's Servant of the People party, told a televised meeting."This is very bad, but there is no other option... if a person does not come, it (vaccine bottle) can be kept open for 2-3 hours, after which it must be disposed of," the head of parliament's health committee Mykhailo Radutskyi said.A total of 3,141 shots were administered of Feb. 28, including just 90 shots in the past 24 hours, health ministry data showed.Health Minister Maksym Stepanov said the government was working to ensure vaccines do not get thrown away, adding this also happened in other countries.He was vaccinated on television on Monday and said Zelenskiy would take the shot soon."I proved by my own example that the vaccine we are vaccinated with is an absolutely safe vaccine, it is an effective vaccine," he said.A significant part of the population of Ukraine, like many post-Soviet republics, is traditionally wary of vaccines, fearing side effects from poor quality drugs. Such mistrust allowed a measles outbreak to grow into an epidemic in 2019.Covid-19 cases have picked up after a lull during a tight lockdown at the start of the year, especially in Kyiv and western Ukraine, where the government set up mobile hospitals to cope with a sharp spike in cases. Ukraine has registered 1.3 million cases with 26,050 deaths from Covid-19 as of March 1.In the northern city of Chernihiv, only 87 out of 280 doctors agreed to be vaccinated, the secretary of the city council said in a Facebook post on Feb 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-throws-away-unused-covid-19-shots-as-doctors-skip-their-own-vaccinations-101614608421593.html
01-03-2021||World||Elizabeth Warren, other progressives propose ‘ultra-millionaire’ tax||Senator Elizabeth Warren, joined by Representatives Pramila Jayapal and Brendan Boyle, proposed a new wealth tax on households with a net worth of more than $50 million.The lawmakers said Monday the new tax, dubbed the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, would create a “fairer” economy with a 2% annual tax on households and trusts valued at between $50 million and $1 billion. All net worth over $1 billion would be taxed at 3%.“The ultra-rich and powerful have rigged the rules in their favor so much that the top 0.1% pay a lower effective tax rate than the bottom 99%, and billionaire wealth is 40% higher than before the COVID crisis began,” Warren said in a statement. “A wealth tax is popular among voters on both sides for good reason: because they understand the system is rigged to benefit the wealthy and large corporations.”A wealth tax would be difficult to pass in the current U.S. Senate, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats control the agenda, since Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties, but most bills require support from 60 senators to advance.And Democrats have been unable to muster even 50 votes from some administration proposals, including a $15 hourly minimum wage. A wealth tax likely would be even more divisive.However, Democrats are planning to use special budget reconciliation procedures to pass a bill with a simple majority later in the year that will include parts of a massive infrastructure package. At that point, taxes to pay for the build out would be on the table. And under Senate rules, tax increases generally are allowed in budget bills.The bill’s co-sponsors include Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Mazie Hirono, also of Hawaii.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elizabeth-warren-other-progressives-propose-ultra-millionaire-tax-101614607781456.html
01-03-2021||World||US Democrats shelve minimum wage tax to speed work on stimulus||Senate Democrats are jettisoning a proposal to use the tax code to penalize corporations that don’t raise the minimum wage for their lowest-paid workers in an effort to keep President Joe Biden’s broader stimulus plan on track for quick passage, according to two people familiar with the matter.Democrats were left seeking alternatives after the Senate parliamentarian ruled Thursday that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief legislation failed to qualify under fast-track budget rules that Democrats are using to pass the stimulus without Republican support.The Senate could begin consideration of the stimulus measure as soon as Wednesday — with final votes as soon as late Thursday — pending full Democratic support and sign off from the parliamentarian.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders proposed tax penalties on big companies that pay low wages along with incentives for smaller companies as an alternative. But it became clear over the weekend that getting all 50 Senate Democrats to agree on specific language would risk missing the March 14 deadline for extending expiring supplemental unemployment benefits, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.The decision removes a major complication in the Senate and could speed approval of the rest of the package in the chamber. In addition to getting the backing of all 50 senators who caucus with Democrats, the tax language also would have had to pass muster with the parliamentarian, the House and the administration and be signed by Biden -- all in a two-week period.Still, dropping the minimum wage increase from the stimulus could create other headaches for both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.In the House, the stimulus legislation with the $15 an hour minimum wage narrowly passed on Saturday by 219 to 212, without any Republican support. Pelosi lost two moderate Democrats on that vote, and she can’t afford many more defections.Pelosi said Friday she’s “absolutely” confident she could pass a stimulus bill without a minimum-wage provision in it, but that remains to be seen.Progressives in the chamber have made the minimum wage hike a signature issue as they angle to set the party’s future direction. Although there hasn’t been an explicit threat to scuttle the broader stimulus bill, which includes the extra unemployment benefits and $1,400 direct payments to many Americans, the conflict is bound to increase tension between the two wings of the party with Biden in the middle.Progressive lawmakers on Monday sent Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris a letter organized by Representative Ro Khanna demanding that they set aside the parliamentarian’s ruling and include a minimum-wage increase in the Covid-19 relief package.New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the leader of a group of young, vocal progressives, signed the letter and is among those urging Senate Democrats to get rid of a rule that gives the minority power to block most legislation.“Really our options right now, at least our immediate options on this specific issue, is to do something about this parliamentary obstacle or abolish the filibuster,” she said on Friday.The White House has said Vice President Kamala Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, won’t overrule the parliamentarian’s decision. And a few Democrats, including West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, have said they are opposed to overturning Senate rules.Expectations of the stimulus plan’s passage helped propel U.S. equities to record highs last month, and any major setbacks could unsettle investors. While some economic indicators have picked up, legislative delays would disrupt help going to millions of Americans still out of work thanks to the pandemic.The last time Congress voted to increase the minimum wage was in 2007, when a measure phasing in a hike from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 was attached to a war funding bill by Pelosi and signed by President George W. Bush. Since then, many states have raised their wage standard above the federal minimum.There are other possible avenues for Democrats to try, including attaching vetted language to Biden’s “Build Back Better” package later this year, which is also likely to move via the fast-track budget rules. Otherwise, they would need to find 10 Republicans to agree to advance a wage hike. Republicans blocked a $10.10 minimum wage in 2014.But even that may be a difficult road to take. Manchin said last week that he could back $11 an hour, phased in over two years and then indexed to inflation. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema has also expressed opposition to increasing the wage to $15 an hour, but so far has not outlined what she would support. Montana Senator Jon Tester said he is in favor of a different phase-in, but thinks a compromise can be found.Biden so far is hinting that it may be time to move on from the minimum-wage fight for now, given the urgency of the pandemic. Fighting for it once the economy is in better shape may make the increase an easier sell to pro-business moderates.“We have no time to waste,” Biden said Saturday. “If we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus, we can finally get our economy moving again.”Close Biden ally Senator Chris Coons of Delaware on Sunday reinforced that message when asked about the nascent tax proposal.“This isn’t the last bill we will adopt this year. There may be several other chances for us to move a minimum wage bill. But I look forward to hearing from Senators Sanders and Wyden this week,” he said on CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-democrats-shelve-minimum-wage-tax-to-speed-work-on-stimulus-101614609824521.html
01-03-2021||World||Can Southeast Asian diplomacy end crisis in Myanmar?||The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) holds a meeting of foreign ministers on Tuesday to discuss the crisis after Myanmar's Feb. 1 coup, which will include representation from the military government.WHY ASEAN?The United Nations, United States, European Union, China and Asian powers have all identified ASEAN as a potentially pivotal player in resolving the crisis in Myanmar, which is one of its 10 members.The group has the unofficial motto "One Family" and tends to stress stability and development above political rights.Its diverse membership includes Indonesia, the world's third biggest democracy, but also communist Vietnam and Laos and Brunei, one of the world's last absolute monarchies.CAN ASEAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE?Several ASEAN diplomats told Reuters the group's credibility was at stake over Myanmar.ASEAN has advantages in its standing as the region's premier multinational forum and its connections to junta members, but its requirement for consensus and principle of non-interference make agreement harder. As a member, Myanmar must agree with any action too.Critics, including the advocacy group ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, say the body has repeatedly failing to tackle human rights abuses in the region.Diplomats and analysts say the most that might happen in the short-term is the encouragement of dialogue between the junta and its opponents to avoid worse bloodshed.Longer term, an Indonesian plan for ASEAN to oversee a new election to ensure it is fair and inclusive could allow the junta to step down and put Myanmar back on the course to democracy, its proponents say.But ousted parliamentarians and protesters have rejected a new election - demanding respect for a ballot last year that was swept by Aung San Suu Kyi's party.WHAT PART COULD SANCTIONS PLAY?The United States and some Western countries have introduced targeted sanctions on junta leaders and Myanmar's ousted elected leaders and protesters would happily see more.But given its structure - and Myanmar's membership - any sanctions are unlikely from ASEAN.That said, regional businesses could feel the impact of Western sanctions on military-linked businesses.While financial centre Singapore, also a close U.S. ally, said it rejected sanctions itself, its central bank also told financial institutions to be vigilant about the risks of dealing with companies or individuals that could be under sanctions by other nations.WHAT ABOUT ASIA'S BIGGEST POWERS?Both China and India border Myanmar and have big investments there and links to the military. Their promises of coronavirus vaccines gives them added leverage, diplomats and analysts say.China has said the priority must be stability and that other countries should avoid interfering in what calls Myanmar's "internal affairs" to avoid making the situation worse.Democratic India has not been much tougher in public. At the weekend, its embassy in Myanmar called for dialogue and restraint from both sides after security forces killed at least 18 protesters.Some analysts say neither China or India is likely to want to take forceful action against the coup-makers - fearful that it could push Myanmar closer to their strategic rival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-southeast-asian-diplomacy-end-crisis-in-myanmar-101614609376045.html
01-03-2021||World||Joe Biden putting tech over troops at core of US-China policy||The Biden administration is moving to put semiconductors, artificial intelligence and next-generation networks at the heart of US strategy toward Asia, attempting to rally what officials are calling “techno-democracies” to stand up to China and other “techno-autocracies.”The new framing for the US rivalry with China has been given added urgency by the sudden global shortage of microchips needed in products such as cars, mobile phones and refrigerators. The strategy would seek to rally an alliance of nations fighting for an edge in semiconductor fabrication and quantum computing, upending traditional arenas of competition such as missile stockpiles and troop numbers.Current and former government officials, along with outside experts, say the administration’s plans in the technology sphere are a microcosm of its broader plans to take up a more alliance-oriented but still hostile approach to China after a more chaotic approach under President Donald Trump.“There’s a newfound realization about the importance that semiconductors are playing in this geopolitical struggle because chips underlie every tech in the modern era,” said Lindsay Gorman, a fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund of the US. “It’s an effort to double down on the technological comparative advantage that the U.S. and its democratic partners.”It’s an approach partly based partly on denying China access to certain technology for as long as possible, looking to quash Chinese juggernauts like Huawei Technologies Co. and even taking a page from the Communist Party’s playbook by boosting government involvement in key industries when needed.It comes as Chinese Communist Party leaders including President Xi Jinping are expected to lay out how they intend to make technology a centerpiece of future development at the National People’s Congress beginning later this week.Several people familiar with the administration’s planning, and especially that of Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council’s Asia coordinator, say he foresees a broad approach that puts greater emphasis on a few key partners such as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, while offering incentives to bring chip fabrication back to the US.Chips figure in plans to bolster the Quad -- a once-sputtering alliance of the US, Japan, Australia and India that got a boost of support during the Trump era -- including by eventually bringing more technology production to South Asia.The battle over microchips -- and the focus they’re being given in the early days of the Biden administration -- is being forced upon the new White House by necessity. A global shortage of chips, due in part to stockpiling by China and a surge in demand during the pandemic, has forced some American automakers to shutter plants and exposed weaknesses in US supply chains, with their heavy dependence on a few manufacturers in Asia.On Wednesday, President Joe Biden ordered a global supply chain review for microchips as well as large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals and strategic materials such as rare earths. Most US chips come from Taiwan, which China still claims as its territory, and the US gets almost all its rare earths from China. China quickly dismissed the pledge to find alternative supply sources as unrealistic.Officials say it’s too early to detail what the US strategy will look like. The idea of techno-democracies challenging techno-autocracies appeared in a Foreign Affairs magazine report late last year that called for “an overarching forum in which like-minded countries can come together to hammer out joint responses” to the challenge from China.“We have to confront this challenge together -- China’s abuse, China’s predatory practices, China’s export of tools it uses to further its brand of techno-authoritarianism,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a Feb. 22 briefing.The approach is already getting a positive response from Congress, where lawmakers are proposing a number of bills aimed at bolstering US technology, such as the Chips Act, which would offer incentives to bring chip manufacturing back home, and the Endless Frontier Act to invest more broadly in technological advancement.F-35s to Phones”The president was very receptive, as was the vice president,” Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said after meeting Biden at the White House on Wednesday. “We all understand this is important, not only to our economy, but to our national security, because these cutting-edge, high-end semiconductors -- they operate on everything from the F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter to our cell phones.”Although many of the ideas in the emerging plan carry over from the Trump administration, its proponents say one of the differences is the effort to align disparate elements into a unified strategy. Under Trump, getting tough on China often clashed with his focus on securing a trade deal with Beijing, muddling the message.Biden’s supporters say his strategy will include working more closely with other countries. And it’s looking to strengthen existing partnerships that were rarely utilized. Chief among them is the Quad and the belief that India may be newly willing to set itself against China given recent tensions between the world’s two most populous nations.“One of the key objectives is to expand and deepen the foundations of power and influence in the region and we do that best when we are working in concert with allies and partners,” said Rexon Ryu, managing partner of the Asia Group, a Washington-based strategic advisory firm. “It’s less about telling countries what they can’t do in 5G and artificial intelligence but more about what we can do together.”It’s also based on a sense that China has essentially forced the U.S. to start breaking off elements of business and technology relations in a pattern known as decoupling. China has essentially erected its own Internet infrastructure, barring many US media outlets and social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, and has shown a willingness to use the size of its market and its economic might as a weapon to make other nations fall into line.One irony of the state of US-China relations is that for all the traditional hand-wringing in the US about capitalism versus Communism, there’s increasing bipartisan support in Washington for a bigger government role in providing incentives and investments in companies.“In order to compete we’re going to have to change the way we play the game,” said Elizabeth Economy, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. “China’s not going to adapt to the rules of the road as we structured them so we have to adapt.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-putting-tech-over-troops-at-core-of-us-china-policy-101614607366581.html
01-03-2021||World||‘Track, Trace, Expel’: How China treated some foreign journalists in 2020||Working conditions for journalists continued to decline in China in 2020 with the government harassing, intimidating and expelling reporters from the country using all arms of state power, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC) said in its annual report on Monday.The report said China expelled the largest number of foreign journalists since the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 - at least 18 foreign journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post were expelled.“All arms of state power - including surveillance systems introduced to curb coronavirus - were used to harass and intimidate journalists, their Chinese colleagues, and those whom the foreign press sought to interview,” the report said.“Visas became a tit-for-tat fight, as the US government capped visa numbers for Chinese journalists in America, leading to the departure of scores of Chinese, many of whom worked for state media.”Titled “Trace, Trace, Expel: Reporting on China Amid a Pandemic”, the report said that for the third consecutive year, not a single correspondent said working conditions had improved.As many as 150 of 220 correspondent members representing news organisations from 30 countries and regions were interviewed.China, the report added, used the pandemic to control journalists. New surveillance systems and strict controls on movement, implemented for public health reasons, were used to limit foreign journalists, it said.“On many occasions, correspondents were forced to abandon reporting trips after being told to leave or be quarantined on the spot,” the report added.Visa restrictions were also used to put pressure on reporting with at least 13 correspondents given press credentials valid for six months or less. Foreign reporters are usually granted one-year visas to be renewed annually.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin dismissed it as “baseless”.“We always welcome media and journalists from all countries to cover news in China according to the law... what we oppose is ideological bias against China and fake news in the name of press freedom,” Wang was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency on Monday.The Chinese government doesn’t recognise the FCCC and routinely dismisses it’s annual reports on working conditions of journalists in the country.The report said more eyes than ever are trained on China, a rising power whose influence can be felt in every corner of the globe. “China is also slated to host the Winter Olympics in early 2022 – only a year from now. At such a moment, the FCCC urges Chinese authorities to allow foreign journalists to do their jobs - reporting on this extraordinary country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/track-trace-expel-how-china-treated-some-foreign-journalists-in-2020-101614607942425.html
01-03-2021||World||UK factory output grows at slowest since May, consumer lending slides||British manufacturers reported their slowest output growth since May last month, hit by Brexit and Covid-19-related delays, and consumers cut back heavily on borrowing in January as they returned to lockdown.Britain's economy is set to shrink sharply in early 2021 though manufacturers are upbeat about prospects later in the year, when they expect lockdown restrictions to end.The speed of the recovery for households will also be critical. Bank of England data showed consumer borrowing in January suffered its biggest annual decline since records began in 1994, sliding 8.9%.Britain entered a third national lockdown in January, closing schools, non-essential shops, restaurants and most other businesses open to the public, though people can still travel to work if needed.Finance minister Rishi Sunak has announced an extra 5 billion pounds ($7.0 billion) of support for services firms and plans to offer more aid in an annual budget on Wednesday."All eyes are now on Wednesday's budget to see if the chancellor has any surprises up his sleeve that will give the (manufacturing) industry's businesses a boost for the latter part of the year," said Simon Jonsson, a partner at accountants KPMG.The BoE expects the economy to shrink 4% in the first three months of 2021 - a sharper decline than during any quarter of the 2008-09 financial crisis though much less than the 20% drop last spring.The weak consumer borrowing suggests a slump in spending on non-essentials. Official retail sales data showed overall purchases fell by 8.2% in January.Some of the weak borrowing also reflects repayment of loans by better-off households.The BoE expects pent-up household savings to be unleashed when lockdowns end, but the scale of any bounce is uncertain.Manufacturing has fared better than consumer-facing sectors. Nonetheless, February's IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)'s key output component showed growth slipped further after a sharp drop in January."Continued COVID-19 related disruption, now exacerbated by manufacturers' cautious navigation of the new UK-EU trading arrangement, has created a scenario in which logistical and supply-side challenges are limiting the rate of economic recovery," said James Brougham, an economist at industry body Make UK.The broader manufacturing PMI touched a two-month high of 55.1, slightly higher than suggested by a preliminary reading.However, much of the rise reflects longer delivery times and higher costs - which historically were linked with increased activity but more recently have represented a constraint.Confidence for the year ahead was its highest in more than six years. This is despite new post-Brexit customs rules which took effect in January and increased the cost and complexity of trade with the European Union, especially for smaller firms.Materials costs rose at the fastest rate in four years and delivery times lengthened sharply too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-factory-output-grows-at-slowest-since-may-consumer-lending-slides-101614603347274.html

It’s preparing an aid package to the affected businesses.The number and incidence of coronavirus infections have increased fast during February, and mutations may put the health-care system under strain, the government said.

01-03-2021||World||UK's Labour party spokesperson calls Sunak 'economically illiterate'||UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is “economically illiterate,” while his policies have cost jobs and risk strangling the country’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, according to Anneliese Dodds, the opposition Labour party’s finance spokeswoman.Two days before the chancellor is due to deliver his annual budget, Dodds attacked Sunak for overseeing a “year of short-termism” that has led to mass firings, wasted money and uncertainty among businesses and families about support from the government.“After a year of last-minute scrambles, of U-turns, waste and mismanagement, what families and businesses need from the chancellor is a clear plan,” Dodds told a Bloomberg webinar on Monday.She called for a “responsible” budget program rather than continuation of “a rolling cycle of chopping and changing, leaving businesses and families scratching their heads and anxious about what’s coming next.”The chancellor should make his furlough program more flexible, fix gaps in support that means “millions” of people have been excluded, and extend support for people asked to self-isolate because of infection with or exposure to the virus, Dodds said.Sunak has consistently been rated the most popular member of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet after rolling out 300 billion pounds ($418 billion) of spending to fight the coronavirus and support workers through the pandemic. But the UK has also suffered one of the worst economic hits in the world, with output plunging almost 10% last year.Polls still show the Tories remain better rated by voters than Labour on the handling of the economy by a double-digit margin, something Dodds acknowledged as a source of frustration. She said that Sunak’s successive short-term extensions of his furlough program have led to tens of thousands of redundancies.The ‘Sunak Effect’“While he dithers and delays, people right across the country lose their jobs,” she said. “Coronavirus may have closed large parts of our economy. But this government crashed it.”The Treasury didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Conservative government’s willingness to boost public spending during the pandemic has deprived Labour of one of its traditional lines of attack, and even earned Sunak praise at one point from Len McCluskey, the left-wing leader of the Unite Union.The chancellor now faces the thornier and less popular task of unwinding his support programs as the government starts to lift the restrictions it imposed to contain the outbreak. The prime minister has said he hopes the last businesses will be able to reopen from June 21.‘Spectacularly Unjust’With the government’s assistance programs due to end in March and April, Dodds called for Sunak to extend measures including the furlough program, a business rates holiday, as well as a reduction in value-added tax. She also questioned his decision in November to freeze the pay of millions of public sector workers.“That is spectacularly unjust. It’s also economically illiterate,” Dodds said. “If you take money out of people’s pockets, they’ll tighten their belts and spend less.”The chancellor gave a series of interviews at the weekend in which he hinted at the need for tax rises to close a peacetime record budget deficit, while promising to keep supporting companies and workers through the pandemic.Sunak Hints at UK Tax Rises and Vows to Maintain Covid SupportOfficials have suggested US plans to raise corporate taxes give the UK scope to do likewise, while still retaining the lowest rates in the Group of Seven major industrialized economies. UK media have also suggested Sunak may freeze the thresholds at which different rates of income tax kick in, drawing hundreds of thousands of Britons into higher tax brackets.“Now is not the time for tax rises on struggling businesses or families,” Dodds said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-labour-party-spokesperson-calls-sunak-economically-illiterate-101614604952949.html
01-03-2021||World||Germany's Merkel faces growing pressure to ease Covid-19 curbs||Chancellor Angela Merkel faces further pressure to lay out a path to ease Germany’s coronavirus lockdown after Finance Minister Olaf Scholz became the latest senior official to call for a quicker reopening of Europe’s largest economy.Scholz -- the vice chancellor and the Social Democratic candidate to succeed Merkel in September’s election -- threw his weight behind proposals to step away from a reliance on using the seven-day incidence rate to manage Germany’s pandemic.As more aggressive variants spread, the measure of new infections has been inching up, moving the country further away from targets Merkel has set for loosening curbs. Her coronavirus cabinet, which includes Scholz, is meeting on Monday to prepare for a critical meeting with state leaders on Wednesday.Increased testing “must have an impact on what is possible in terms of moves to open up,” Scholz said late Sunday in an interview with the Bild newspaper. “It’s not going to happen all at once, but there must be a step-by-step process that everyone can understand.”To facilitate a faster reopening, he said he wants companies to test workers and citizens to be able to get free Covid-19 checks. His comments indicate a growing consensus in Germany to move away from the incidence rate to determine pandemic policy.Merkel opened the door to the move last week, saying testing could create a “buffer” to allow for opening above her target of 35 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The figure rose to 65.8 on Monday, according to the RKI public health institute.Helge Braun, Merkel’s chief of staff, said Sunday the government is planning to test “significantly more than we have done so far” to help prevent another wave of infections as curbs are lifted.While some children have returned to schools and hairdressers were allowed to reopen on Monday, most of Germany’s lockdown restrictions remain in place. With the pandemic-weary public growing restless ahead of national elections, officials are keen to ease the strain.Markus Soeder -- Bavaria’s premier and a potential chancellor candidate for Merkel’s conservative bloc -- on Monday discussed strategies for tackling the pandemic together with his counterpart from the state of Saxony, warning against a hasty opening.Germany’s infection fell steadily after peaking just before Christmas, but the downward trend has been halted for around two weeks, prompting fears that more virulent strains of the disease could trigger another surge in cases.With the country’s inoculation campaign slowly ramping up, the country’s STIKO vaccination committee is poised to reconsider its decision not to recommend the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine for people aged 65 and older.“There will be a new updated recommendation very soon,” STIKO head Thomas Mertens said at the weekend. Last month, Germany decided to keep it’s recommendation for the vaccine to be administered only to people aged 18-64, saying there were insufficient data on its effectiveness for older recipients.The situation across the European Union is looking increasingly alarming, after a stuttering start to the bloc’s vaccination campaign. Italy is tightening restrictions in Milan, Turin and other areas, the Czech Republic will impose its toughest lockdown yet, and Germany introduced a test requirement at its border with the French Moselle region to tackle the spread of mutations.Austria’s government is meeting with scientists, opposition parties and provincial governors in Vienna on Monday to discuss how to proceed. Since Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s administration eased a strict lockdown three weeks ago, the incidence rate jumped to 162 from around 100 in early February, making the widepspread reopening of restaurants, cafes and hotels before Easter unlikely.EU health ministers will hold a video call later on Monday and the European Commission will urge them to massively scale up testing and genome sequencing for virus variants.While arguing for a cautions lifting of restrictions, Scholz warned that Germany shouldn’t move too fast and risk having to reimpose lockdown measures.“What we cannot allow is an opening up and then shortly after have to close down again because we have miscalculated and the infection rates are rising dramatically again,” Scholz said. “But if we can somehow stabilize things and improve the situation with the help of tests and progress on vaccination, then we have more options.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-merkel-faces-growing-pressure-to-ease-covid-19-curbs-101614591414702.html
01-03-2021||World||Ex-French President Sarkozy found guilty of corruption||Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty by a Paris court of corruption after he offered to pull strings to help a magistrate land a prestigious job in return for a favor.The 66-year-old was also sentenced to a one-year prison term, though under the French system he’s unlikely to serve it, even if he fails to overturn the verdict on appeal.“Sarkozy used his status as former French president,” said Presiding Judge Christine Mée on Monday as she read out the court’s decision. She said the wrongdoing he committed was “particularly serious.”The conviction of Sarkozy -- who still enjoys some popularity in the nation -- is another setback to a political career that stuttered after his failed 2012 re-election bid. The judgment puts the former president on the back-foot weeks before he’s due back in court on separate charges that he illegally exceeded campaign-spending limits ahead of his electoral defeat.He isn’t the first former French president to go on trial in modern times. But the late Jacques Chirac was too sick to attend court before he was found guilty in 2011 of misusing Paris city funds.Aside from the one-year jail term, the judges also gave Sarkozy a two-year suspended sentence.The other defendants -- Sarkozy’s lawyer and the former magistrate -- both received the same sentences as the former president.Defendants aren’t normally incarcerated if the non-suspended portion of their sentence isn’t longer than two years. They typically have to wear electronic bracelets and obey a curfew instead. Additionally, appealing a first-instance sentence suspends its execution.Monday’s judgment centers on tapped phone calls of Sarkozy dating back to 2014, after he’d left high office.Sarkozy was heard telling his lawyer that he would put in a good word to help the now-retired magistrate Gilbert Azibert clinch a sought-after position in Monaco if he helped in a legal fight to stop investigators using the former president’s diaries.In court, Sarkozy had dismissed the conversations at “chatter” that was misinterpreted by prosecutors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exfrench-president-sarkozy-found-guilty-of-corruption-101614605198440.html
01-03-2021||World||Generational gap: What 2 surveys in UK and US reveal about sexual attraction, identity||A survey done by research group Ipsos Mori revealed that only 50 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds are attracted to those of the opposite sex. The survey asked 1,127 adults in the UK and 1,005 in the US and got similar results. The research also added that the proportion of people attracted towards the opposite sex increases with age. According to the survey, 76 per cent of people aged between 41 to 54 were solely attracted to the opposite sex and 81 per cent of 55 to 75 year old gave the same answer.This shows changing ideas of sexuality and increasing acceptability towards different sexual preferences in both the countries.Expert in the psychology of sexual orientation at Trent University in Ontario, Canada, Karen Blair told the Times that the increase shows the ease that young people feel to reveal their sexual preferences. “The increases at least partially represent an increase in willingness and ability to come out. Each recent generation has faced fewer and fewer external pressures to conform to heterosexuality.”Gallup survey in the USA Gallup survey done in the US this week had found that a record 5.6 percent of Americans identify themselves as LGBTQ, of which the majority said that they identified as bisexual. The survey also showed a 1.1 percent increase in the people identifying as LGBTQ which is the largest increase since the survey began in 2012.The results, based on more than 15,000 interviews conducted throughout 2020 with Americans aged 18 and older, found that younger generations were more likely to say that they are LGBTQ with one in six adults aged between 18 and 23 identifying as such. This number dropped to less than two per cent in respondents who were born before 1965.The survey also revealed that of those interviewed 11.7 per cent identified as lesbian and 11.3 per cent as transgender. According to the survey, women are more likely than men to identify as LGBTQ as 6.4 per cent women identified as LGBTQ as opposed to 4.9 per cent men. Political differences also influenced this choice as according to the survey 13 per cent of liberals, 4.4 per cent of moderates and only 2.3 per cent of conservatives identified as LGBTQ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/generational-gap-what-2-surveys-in-uk-and-us-reveal-about-sexual-attraction-identity-101614604218512.html

Iran, he added, “is Israel’s greatest enemy and we are striking it across the region.”Late Sunday, Syria reported that it was dealing with an Israeli missile attack on targets near Damascus. Israeli media said the Israeli air force attacked Iranian targets in response to the assault on the ship. The military had no comment.The Israeli-owned car carrier, which was flying a Bahamas flag, was struck by an unexplained explosion near the Strait of Hormuz. None of its crew was hurt and the ship proceeded to Dubai for repairs.The Associated Press, citing two unidentified American defense officials, said the vessel sustained two holes on its port side and two holes on its starboard side just above the waterline.Frictions between the enemies have been high as the Biden administration explores rejoining the Iran nuclear deal, which Netanyahu opposes. Iran has accused Israel of sabotaging a nuclear facility in July, and of killing a top Iranian nuclear scientist in November, an assassination it has vowed to avenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-pm-netanyahu-accuses-iran-of-attacking-israeli-ship-in-persian-gulf-101614582201580.html

Demonstrators scattered and sought in vain to rinse the irritating gas from their eyes, but later regrouped.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar after five decades of military rule. It came Feb. 1, the same day a newly elected Parliament was supposed to take office. Ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s party would have led that government, but instead she was detained along with President Win Myint and other senior officials.The army has leveled several charges against Suu Kyi — an apparent effort by the military to provide a legal veneer for her detention and potentially to bar her from running in the election the junta has promised to hold in one year. On Monday, Suu Kyi made a court appearance via videoconference and was charged with two more offenses, her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters.Accused of inciting unrest, she was charged under a law that dates from British colonial days and has long been criticized as a vaguely defined catch-all law that inhibits freedom of expression. That charge carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The other charge from Monday carries a one-year sentence.Following her detention on the day of the coup, the 75-year-old Suu Kyi was initially held at her residence in the capital of Naypyitaw, but members of her National League for Democracy party now say they don't know where she is.Since the takeover, a movement of protests in cities across the country has been growing — and the junta's response has become increasingly violent.The UN said it had “credible information” that at least 18 people were killed and 30 were wounded across Myanmar on Sunday. Counts from other sources, such the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent television and online news outlet, put the death toll in the 20s.Any of the reports would make it the highest single-day death toll since the military takeover. The junta has also made mass arrests, and the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported that as many as 1,000 people were detained Sunday, though it has only confirmed 270 of those. Several journalists have been among those detained, including one for The Associated Press.At least five people are believed to have been killed Sunday in Yangon when police shot at protesters, who have remained non-violent despite provocation from the security forces and pro-military counter-demonstrators.People erected makeshift sidewalk shrines Monday at the spots where several of the victims were shot and also paid their respects by standing outside the hospitals where the bodies were being released to families.In Dawei, a small city in southeastern Myanmar where an estimated five people were killed Sunday, the number of protesters on the streets Monday was lower than usual. Marchers there split into smaller groups, parading through the city to the applause of bystanders who also made the three-finger salutes adopted by the resistance movement to show their support.Confirming the deaths of protesters has been difficult amid the chaos and general lack of news from official sources, especially in areas outside Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw. But in many cases, there was evidence posted online such as videos of shootings, photos of bullet casings collected afterwards and gruesome pictures of bodies.In a statement published Monday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper, Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry declared that the junta “is exercising utmost restraint to avoid the use of force in managing the violent protests systematically, in accordance with domestic and international laws in order to keep minimum casualties.”But UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the crackdown, calling the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters and arbitrary arrests “unacceptable,” and expressed serious concern at the increase in deaths and serious injuries, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.“What the world is watching in Myanmar is outrageous and unacceptable,” the UN’s independent expert on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a separate statement. “Words of condemnation are necessary and welcome but insufficient. The world must act. We must all act.”He proposed that countries could institute a global embargo on the sale of arms to Myanmar, “tough targeted and coordinated sanctions” against those responsible for the coup, the crackdown and other rights abuses, and sanctions against the business interests of the military.Social media posts from Myanmar have increasingly urged the international community to invoke the doctrine of the “responsibility to protect” to intervene directly to restrain the junta.Any kind of coordinated measures, however, would be difficult to implement as two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and Russia, would almost certainly veto them on the basis of being opposed to interference in the internal affairs of other countries.In Washington, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan issued a statement saying the US is “alarmed” by the violence and stands in solidarity with Myanmar's people, “who continue to bravely voice their aspirations for democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights.”Washington has imposed sanctions on Myanmar because of the coup, and Sullivan said it would “impose further costs on those responsible,” promising details “in the coming days.”Security forces began employing rougher tactics on Saturday, taking preemptive action to break up protests and make mass arrests. Many of those detained were taken to Insein Prison in Yangon’s northern outskirts, historically notorious for holding political prisoners.Among the arrests made Sunday, the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners was able to identify about 270 people, bringing to 1,132 the total number of people the group has confirmed being arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.An AP journalist was taken into police custody on Saturday morning while providing news coverage of the protests. The journalist, Thein Zaw, remains in police custody.The AP called for his immediate release.“Independent journalists must be allowed to freely and safely report the news without fear of retribution. AP decries in the strongest terms the arbitrary detention of Thein Zaw,” said Ian Phillips, the AP's vice president for international news. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Myanmar also condemned the arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-deadly-crackdown-crowds-again-protest-myanmar-coup-101614602378545.html
01-03-2021||World||Nepal worried about future supply of Covid-19 vaccines||Nepal has had a successful start of its Covid-19 vaccination campaign, but authorities are worried about future supplies as the country competes with dozens of other nations for much-sought vaccines produced by a handful of manufacturers.The government is negotiating with India's Serum Institute to obtain 5 million doses for the second stage of the campaign, in which 3.7 million elderly people are to be inoculated starting this weekend, Health Minister Hridayesh Tripathi said Monday.Nepal received a gift from the Indian government in January of 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine manufactured under license by India's Serum Institute. Nepal also purchased another 2 million doses from the company at a subsidised rate with the help of the Indian government."There is huge worldwide demand for vaccines from a handful of companies and we could be at the very end of the list,” Tripathi said. “So far, we have been able to get vaccines with both political and administrative help from India. However, I am very worried now.”He said he is hopeful that Indian authorities will again help their small northern neighbour.“We will not be able to get the vaccine through simple commercial deals with the company because we are competing with dozens of other countries, so we need the influence of the (Indian) government,” he said.Nepal is also receiving a gift of 500,000 doses of a Chinese vaccine this month. Tripathi, however, said Nepal has not decided whether to purchase more of it.“The AstraZenneca vaccine is the one preferred by the world and also approved and recommended by the World Health Organization,” he said.Russia has also offered to provide 25 million doses of its Sputnik vaccine, but Nepal has asked for additional documents before it can start reviewing it, he said.Nepal has also been promised 2.25 million vaccine doses under COVAX, the ambitious WHO programme to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world's poorest people, of which 300,000 doses are likely to arrive later this month.Tripathi said the government is targeting the inoculation of the country's entire adult population by September.Nepal has reported 274,216 Covid-19 cases, including 2,777 deaths.Health officials are worried that there could be a new wave of infections because of a series of political rallies by tens of thousand of demonstrators over Parliament's dissolution by President Khadga Prasad Oli last December and its restatement by the Supreme Court last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-worried-about-future-supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-101614601948655.html
01-03-2021||World||Voting rights challenged at US Supreme Court as states change rules||Voting-rights advocates are worried as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in an Arizona case that could undercut the landmark law that’s protected the rights of minorities at the polls for a half century.Tuesday’s clash over the 1965 Voting Rights Act comes as Republican-controlled states consider a barrage of new restrictions that could make it harder for minorities to cast ballots in 2022 elections. It follows November’s presidential contest in which Donald Trump refused to concede and instead made baseless assertions of widespread fraud.And the case comes before a Supreme Court that, bolstered by three Trump appointees, has only grown more conservative since it nullified a key component of the law in 2013.“The court could decide this in a number of ways which could include weakening or limiting” the law, said Myrna Perez, a voting rights litigator at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice.The case centers on the law’s Section 2, a provision that’s now the primary tool for challenging voting laws as discriminatory. Section 2 took on heightened importance after the high court’s 2013 Shelby County decision effectively killed a separate section that had required some states to get federal clearance before they changed their voting rules.A federal appeals court invoked Section 2 to invalidate two Arizona policies as having a disproportionate impact on minority voters. The San Francisco-based court struck down a law that made it a crime for most people to collect or deliver another person’s early ballot, a practice critics call “ballot harvesting.” The appeals court also voided Arizona’s longstanding policy of rejecting ballots cast in the wrong precinct.In addition, the majority said the ballot-collection law amounted to intentional discrimination, violating both Section 2 and the Constitution’s 15th Amendment.Racial Disparities“Both restrictions disparately impact minority voters, who disproportionately rely on ballot collection and are twice as likely as white voters to vote out-of-precinct,” according to a brief from the Democratic National Committee, which is challenging the rules. “These disparities are directly attributable to the ongoing effects of Arizona’s documented history of racial discrimination.”But Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, said in an interview the rules don’t deprive anyone of an equal opportunity to cast a ballot.“Arizona, like a lot of states, has common-sense measures designed to protect the integrity of the ballot and the election process,” said Brnovich, who will be arguing for the state on Tuesday. “And you have out-of-state, left-wing groups that are trying to undermine or challenge those rules and regulations.”The argument will be the Supreme Court’s first on election law since the 2020 presidential vote, and the first with three appointees of the losing candidate, Trump. The court is scheduled to rule by June.The case will be as much about the method the court uses as the outcome. The court has never said what standard should apply when Section 2 is invoked to challenge laws that make it harder for minorities to register and vote.Section 2 bars any voting practice that “results in a denial or abridgement” of the right to vote based on race. The measure says courts should look at the “totality of the circumstances” to determine whether some groups “have less opportunity” to participate than other voters.No Biden BriefA lineup of litigants, also including the Arizona Republican Party and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, is presenting the court with an array of tests to implement those words.The Trump administration proposed its own standard before leaving office, and argued for upholding the rules, but President Joe Biden’s administration withdrew the brief this month. The new administration said it agreed that the Arizona restrictions were valid, while disavowing the legal standard the Trump team had urged.“Even the Biden Department of Justice agrees that Arizona’s voting laws don’t violate the Voting Rights Act,” Brnovich said.The new administration chose not to file its own brief and, in a rarity for a Voting Rights Act case, won’t be arguing on Tuesday.The Brennan Center, which filed a brief opposing the Arizona rules, says legislators around the country have introduced more than 165 bills this year to restrict voting access, more than four times the number from a year ago. The swing states of Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia have the largest number of pending bills, according to the policy institute.If those laws can’t be challenged under Section 2, “it would be taking away one of the big tools, in fact the main tool we have left now, to protect voters against racial discrimination,” Perez said.The cases are Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, 19-1257, and Arizona Republican Party v. Democratic National Committee, 19-1258.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/voting-rights-challenged-at-us-supreme-court-as-states-change-rules-101614584143566.html
01-03-2021||World||Some local Beijing communities start giving elderly Covid-19 shots||Some local communities in Beijing have started giving Covid-19 vaccine doses to people older than 60, even as the city's disease-control authorities publicly advises this age group against inoculation.In some countries, including the United States and Britain, people older than 65 are among top priority groups in their Covid-19 vaccination rollouts, as the elderly have a higher risk of death and hospitalisation after contracting the virus compared to younger adults.China's vaccination program, under which 40.5 million doses had been administered as of Feb. 9, excludes those ages above 59 and those younger than 18, with Chinese vaccine makers citing less complete clinical trial data for minors and the elderly.According to notices from staffers of a few communities in Beijing's central Dongcheng district, seen by Reuters, residents older than 60 can go to designated sites to get their shots, without disclosing which the four China-developed vaccines would be available. The vaccinations are not mandatory.However, an article published online by the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control on Sunday categorised these older than 60 as unsuitable for vaccination, in line with national guidelines.It is unclear why the Dongcheng district was telling the elderly to be vaccinated.The city is not fighting the spread of any Covid-19 cluster. Beijing last reported a local case on Jan. 29.China is due to kick off its annual meeting of parliament on Friday, when thousands of delegates from across the country will gather in Beijing.The information office of Beijing Municipal People's Government didn't immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.China has four locally developed vaccines approved for general public vaccination, including two from China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), one from Sinovac Biotech and one from CanSino Biologics Inc (CanSinoBIO), all of which have been used in smaller-scale vaccination programmes before clearance for wider use.The formal approvals for vaccines from CanSinoBIO and Sinovac were for people older than 18, without age cap, according to company statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-local-beijing-communities-start-giving-elderly-covid-19-shots-101614585781623.html
01-03-2021||World||Australian prime minister Morrison stands by minister accused of rape||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday an unidentified cabinet minister accused of rape has "vigorously rejected" the allegation during talks with him.Several opposition lawmakers said late last week they received a letter detailing an allegation of rape by a male cabinet minister before he entered parliament.Morrison said his office also received a letter detailing the allegation.Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier on Monday the alleged crime had been referred to Australian Federal Police for a fresh investigation. A previous investigation by New South Wales police was suspended after the alleged victim committed suicide last year.According to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the rape happened in Sydney in 1988."The individual involved here has vigorously rejected these allegations. And so, it's a matter for the police," Morrison told reporters in Sydney.Australian Federal Police confirmed they had received the complaint but declined any further comment.Morrison said the minister would keep his cabinet position, pending the outcome of the police investigation.Opposition lawmakers have called on Morrison to suspend the minister pending an investigation.The allegation comes as Morrison's government is under public pressure after three former staff members of his ruling Liberal party said they had been raped by an unidentified colleague.One victim who went public with her allegations has made an official police complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-prime-minister-morrison-stands-by-minister-accused-of-rape-101614584190654.html

As a starting point, Iran wants the U.S. to lift sanctions that Trump reimposed, stifling oil exports and hurting the economy. Biden wants the Islamic Republic to first resume its compliance with the multilateral agreement that seeks to curb its nuclear program.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested last month that European Union foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell “choreograph the actions that are needed to be taken by the U.S. and the actions needed to be taken by Iran.”Zarif’s comments had raised the prospect that the two sides could take synchronized steps to return to the deal. Informal talks had been expected to take place this month.Raising the barrier to diplomacy, Iran has restricted snap international inspections of its nuclear sites, providing access only for an additional three-month period under an arrangement with the global atomic watchdog announced Sunday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nuclear-deal-time-not-ripe-for-talks-with-us-and-europe-says-iran-101614592773771.html
01-03-2021||World||Donald Trump raises climate issue; says India, China, Russia not clean||In his first public speech since leaving the White House, former US president Donald Trump has raised the climate issue while criticising his successor Joe Biden for rejoining the "very unfair" Paris Agreement, saying what good does it do when America is "clean" but China, Russia and India are not.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Committee in Orlando, Florida on Sunday, the 74-year-old leader, who left the White House on January 20, came down heavily on the Biden administration for putting the “United States back into the very unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord without negotiating a better deal”.“First of all, China does not kick in for 10 years, Russia goes by an old standard which was not a clean standard… but we get hit right from the beginning when it costs us hundreds of thousands and millions of jobs, it was a disaster... but they go back in.“We have the cleanest air and cleanest water… and what good does it do when we're clean, but China is not and Russia is not and India is not, so they are pouring fumes... you know the world is a small piece of the universe and we're trying to protect everything,” Trump said amidst applause from his supporters.On February 19, the US officially returned to the historic Paris climate accord, 107 days after it left at the behest of former president Trump.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had termed that decision as a “major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.”In the past also, Trump has criticised China, India and Russia for pollution.In October last year, he accused China, India and Russia of not taking care of their "filthy air" as he justified America's withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate agreement.“Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. The air is filthy," Trump had said during the final presidential debate with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden in Nashville, Tennessee.Days earlier while speaking to his cheering supporters at an election rally in North Carolina, he had blamed countries like China, Russia and India for adding to the global air pollution and asserted that his country has the best environmental numbers.China is the world's biggest carbon emitter followed by the US, India and the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-raises-climate-issue-says-india-china-russia-not-clean-101614594447365.html

"I feel ready to go.”She was expected to meet staffers and speak briefly with non-governmental groups that support a key fisheries reform proposal being discussed at the WTO, before attending her first meeting of the General Council — made up of envoys from the international trade body's 164 member states.Some of those meetings with will be limited because of measures to fight Covid-19, and the closed-door General Council meeting is to be largely by videoconference.Okonjo-Iweala's victory in a hotly contested race last fall was delayed largely because the US administration under Donald Trump supported another candidate. Her appointment came through last month when the Biden administration cleared the way for her selection at the trade body, whose rules require consensus.The WTO, which works to craft accords that can ensure smooth international trade, is facing headwinds such as rising protectionism. Its dispute settlement system has been blocked because the United States has almost singlehandedly prevented appointments to its Appellate Body — a rough equivalent to an appeals court.Okonjo-Iweala said last month that “wide-ranging reforms” are needed at the WTO, and that her first priority would be to address the economic and health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic — such as by working to lift export restrictions on supplies and vaccines to get them distributed to countries in need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wtos-first-female-director-general-arrives-for-1st-day-on-job-101614594149673.html

They will confer again on Wednesday to decide how to proceed with the rest of Germany’s coronavirus restrictions, which at present run until March 7.Some states also allowed businesses such as florists and hardware stores to open on Monday. Most stores have been closed nationwide since Dec. 16. Restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities have been closed since Nov. 2 and hotels are allowed only to accommodate business travelers.There are increasing calls for restrictions to be further relaxed, but also a desire to remain cautious. A steady decline in infection figures has stalled, and even been reversed in some areas, as a more contagious variant first discovered in Britain spreads.“This week will set the course for the coming months,” Bavarian governor Markus Soeder, an advocate in recent months of a cautious approach, said. He called the virus situation “unstable.”“It's really important that we make smart decisions this week,” he said. “Smart decisions means that the mood must be taken on board — we must find the right balance between caution and opening, and we absolutely must not lose our nerves ... and simply fulfil all wishes.”Germany’s disease control center reported 4,732 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, compared with 4,369 a week earlier. Another 60 deaths were reported, bringing the total to 70,105.Germany had given 4.7% of its population a first vaccine shot as of Friday, while 2.4% had received a second jab — relatively slow progress that has drawn sharp criticism.Bavaria and two neighboring states plan to give a total 15,000 doses of vaccine to the neighboring Czech Republic, which currently has the highest infection rate in the European Union.Soeder said the “symbolic measure” ultimately helps Germany, because Czech authorities want to use it in high-risk areas near the frontier and vaccinate cross-border commuters.___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-considers-way-ahead-on-covid-19-as-hairdressers-open-across-country-101614592713737.html
01-03-2021||World||UK seeks person infected with Brazilian coronavirus variant||The UK is trying to trace a person infected with a Brazilian variant of the coronavirus that authorities say may be more resistant to vaccines.Six cases of the mutation, which originated in the Amazonian city of Manaus, have been detected in the UK, Public Health England said on Sunday. While five have been found, the identity of the final patient is still unknown because they failed to complete a test registration card, leaving health officials without the information needed to find them.Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi toured the broadcast studios on Monday morning to appeal to anyone who took a Covid-19 test on February 12 or 13 and hasn’t yet had a result to contact the National Health Service. He told Times Radio that the authorities are working with the postal system to try to identify the missing patient.The arrival of the variant in the UK opens the government up to criticism about its quarantine policy, which was finally introduced on February 15 -- several weeks after scientists said blanket restrictions were needed. Compulsory hotel quarantine is now in place for arrivals from 33 countries and territories, including Brazil, while those coming from elsewhere are asked to isolate at home.The latest “variant has been designated ‘of concern’ as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa,” PHE said. “It is possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this.”Health officials are contacting all passengers on the February 10 Swiss Air flight LX318 from Sao Paulo to London Heathrow via Zurich in order to test them and their households, PHE said.Zahawi said surge testing is also taking place in Gloucestershire -- where two of the cases were detected -- as a precaution.“There’s minimal reason to believe that there may be further spread because they have been isolating correctly,” he told Sky News.He defended the UK’s border policy, saying that even in Australia, which has a stricter regime, authorities have had to deal with variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-person-infected-with-brazilian-coronavirus-variant-101614591975502.html

With the third vaccine, the US eyes deliveries of J&J vaccine on Tuesday with the aim of boosting the country’s vaccination drive.The United States reported 51,204 new Covid-19 cases and 1,097 related deaths on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University, taking the national tally to 28,605,669 and the death toll to 513,091 since the pandemic began. At least 96,402,490 vaccine doses have been distributed and at least 75,236,003 doses have been administered, according to CDC. At least 49,772,180 people have received one or more doses of the vaccine and at least 24,779,920 people have received two doses.Read more: US children could receive coronavirus vaccine by year-end: Anthony FauciAlthough there has been a decrease in the number of new cases recorded, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, said that the baseline is too high warning that some Americans are easing up on safety measures too soon, thus threatening the same post-dip surges that the US suffered in 2020.Read more: Fauci worried that US coronavirus cases will stick at 70,000 a dayThe US also faces the challenge of increased spread of Covid-19 variant strains as the country reported at least 2,463 cases of coronavirus variants that were first spotted in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, according to CDC. The CDC warned that these figures don't represent the total number of such cases circulating nationwide -- just those that have been detected by analysing positive samples.Britain announced on Sunday that more than 20 million people had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Health secretary Matt Hancock made the announcement in a video on Twitter. “I’m absolutely delighted that over 20 million people have now been vaccinated,” Hancock said.

01-03-2021||World||China still has ‘major concerns’ about Boeing’s 737 Max planes||China still has major safety concerns about Boeing Co.’s 737 Max, the deputy head of the country’s aviation regulator said Monday when asked if it was considering following others in allowing the plane to fly again.Once issues have been fully addressed, China will conduct a final review of the aircraft, Dong Zhiyi said at a briefing in Beijing. Authorities have been in “full communication” with Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, he said.China, a crucial market for Boeing and the Max, was the first country to impose a ban on the aircraft after a crash in Ethiopia in March 2019 that killed 157 people. The previous October, a Max jet operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea, claiming 189 lives. Both disasters were partly blamed on software that pushed the planes into nosedives.Other nations followed China’s lead on the flight ban, resulting in the Max being grounded globally for about 20 months. Several countries have certified it to fly again in recent months and it is back in service in places including the U.S., Europe and Brazil. Australia lifted its ban on the plane last week, as did Saudi Arabia on Monday, state media reported. But China hasn’t budged.A spokesman for Boeing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Boeing’s China orders largely dried up in the past four years amid heightened tension between Washington and Beijing around trade and other areas, as well as concern over the Max, which was a best-seller.“I do believe that when a constructive relationship is begun, then things will quiet down and the Chinese will want to get airplanes,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun said in December, the same month the Max returned to commercial service in the U.S. for the first time since the grounding.China has three main criteria that need to be met before allowing the Max to fly again: changes in design aimed at fixing the plane’s problems need to be approved by China, pilots need to be retrained to fly the jetliners following those changes, and the conclusions from the Ethiopian and Indonesian crash reports need to be clear.The nation’s major carriers -- Air China Ltd., China Southern Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. -- are all Max customers, along with about 10 other Chinese airlines.In its latest outlook on the Chinese market, Boeing said the country will continue to be the main driver of the aviation industry’s worldwide growth over the next 20 years. China’s airlines are likely to buy 8,600 new airplanes worth $1.4 trillion during the period, the U.S. manufacturer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-still-has-major-concerns-about-boeing-s-737-max-planes-101614591921025.html

At the time, Islamabad's agreeing to pay a higher price had drawn criticism from experts.Many Pakistanis have been rallying, angry over long power cuts in the summer and shortages of natural gas in winter, to demand an uninterrupted supply of electricity and gas. Khan's government has said it was trying its best to overcome an energy shortfall through different measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hopeful-of-saving-3-billion-in-10-years-with-qatar-new-gas-deal-101614589705338.html
01-03-2021||World||Clock is ticking for Joe Biden if he wants to salvage the nuclear deal with Iran||US President Joe Biden has stressed many times that the US will return to the nuclear deal reached in 2015 with Iran -officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - provided that Iran complies with the terms of the deal.For his part, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Tehran would only return to compliance if the US first lifted economic sanctions. However, time is running out and Biden has to act quickly, as there are various developments - such as new restrictions imposed by Iran on UN inspections- that make the reaching of an agreement on the subject very urgent.This is a concern shared by the EU foreign policy Chief Josep Borel, as coordinator of the JCPOA, who stressed last Friday that "we do have a diplomatic window of opportunity to focus on solutions to bring back on track in order for everybody to fulfil their commitments."The US and EU imposed sanctions on Iran in 2010, as there were fears that Iran's nuclear programme was used as a cover to build nuclear weapons. In 2015 Iran reached an agreement with the US, China, Russia, UK, France and Germany, imposing restrictions on uranium enrichment and the type of centrifuges used for enrichment, as well as allowing international inspections of its nuclear facilities, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.Ignoring the opposition of the international community, in May 2018 former US president Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement and imposed draconian sanctions on Iran which had a devastating effect on the country's economy. Responding, the Iranian regime, exceeded the limits set for uranium enrichment and on stockpiles and operated banned centrifuges.Joe Biden in his presidential campaign clearly supported a return to diplomacy with Iran, but the big question now is who will make the first move. Iran insists that the US lift Trump's sanctions first and be compensated for the hardship it suffered as a result of the crippling sanctions, while the US clearly demands that Iran must return to compliance with JCPOA first.Under a law passed by the Iranian Parliament last December, as from February 23, Tehran will stop allowing short notice "intrusive" inspections of sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency", unless there is an easing of US sanctions. It also said it would erase surveillance footage of its nuclear facilities. This, of course, makes the need to reach an agreement on reviving the JCPOA quite urgent.An incident, which aggravated the existing difficulties for the resumption of negotiations was the recent rocket attack by Iran's proxies on US-led forces in northern Iraq, in which a civilian contractor was killed and a US soldier was injured. The US retaliated in a predawn attack on Friday when two US warplanes destroyed nine buildings and damaged two others at a camp used by Iranian-backed militants. Asked what message he was sending to Iran with the airstrike in Syria, Biden told reporters: "You can't act with impunity. Be careful."Another factor that the Biden administration has to take into account is the fact that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a moderate, will not stand as a candidate in the elections scheduled for next June and he may be succeeded by a hardliner who much more hostile to the West.It seems that the Biden Administration has decided to take a two-step process on the nuclear deal. First to stop Iran's acceleration of nuclear activities, by lifting some sanctions and convince Tehran to return to ICPOA and then reach a more comprehensive follow-up agreement, with the new Iranian government.As Dr Ezgi Uzun, of Sabanci University, points out: "The follow-up agreement envisages the negotiation of the collective package of issues (including the Ballistic Missile Programme, Iran's Shia militia recruitment activities in the Middle East and relations with other countries in the region, all irreversibly brought to the world agenda by the Trump Administration, in addition to the nuclear program) on an international platform that will bring together the US, EU, Iran and several other countries in the region. The Biden administration is waiting for the elections in June for the follow-up agreement."It should be stressed, however, that there are people who say that it is not a good idea to include other issues, such as ballistic missiles, Iran proxies etc, as this will harm the chances of reaching an agreement. Josep Borrell, the EU's High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, told the Atlantic Council on February 23, that "maybe there are other issues that have to be taken into consideration, but don't put everything together at the same time. Then you are going to block the process... if you start talking about pending issues in the beginning, you will never restart."Ali Reza Eshraghi, a visiting scholar at the UNC Center for the Middle East says: "It is highly unlikely that the US and Europe will be able to strike a broader agreement with Iran unless they first rejoin the original JCPOA - under either the current or next government in Tehran. The longer the US takes to rejoin the JCPOA, the greater the support in Tehran for accelerating the Iranian nuclear programme. In the coming weeks, European and US efforts should focus on a swift return to the JCPOA rather than holding out for the unlikely prospect of a new nuclear formula with Iran."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clock-is-ticking-for-joe-biden-if-he-wants-to-salvage-the-nuclear-deal-with-iran-101614588730583.html
01-03-2021||World||Xinjiang's birth rate drops sharply as focus grows on Uyghur genocide||Amid growing criticism over human right abuses by the Beijing, population statistics published by the Chinese government shows a significant drop in birth rates in Xinjiang province.The figures, which run up until 2019, cited by Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), show a decrease in birth rate by around two-thirds within two years.The sudden decline in birth rate comes in the backdrop of increasing pressure on Beijing over reports of mass internment and coerced population control of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang.Rhoda Kwan, writing for the HKFP said between 2017 and 2019, the birth rate in Xinjiang almost halved, dropping from 15.88% in 2017 to 8.14% in 2019.According to an annual report compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, "China's national average rate only decreased by around 2% in the same period."The same figures detailed in the China Statistical Yearbook show population growth rate in the Xinjiang shrank by two-thirds from 2017 to 2019, dropping from 11.40% to 6.13% in the first year, and to 3.69% in the second," Kwan said.Last month, the Chinese embassy in the US had shared a report by Chinese state media outlet China Daily and wrote: "Study shows that in the process of eradicating extremism, the minds of Uyghur women in Xinjiang were emancipated and gender equality and reproductive health were promoted, making them no longer baby-making machines. They are more confident and independent."The Chinese Embassy's post was later removed by Twitter after it drew ire and calls for removal given the Chinese government's oppressive campaign against Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.The Chinese government has increased its "groundless prosecutions" with long prison sentences for Uyghurs and other minority communities in recent years in China's Xinjiang province, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).HRW, a non-governmental body that conducts research and advocacy on human rights last week had said since the Chinese government escalated its repressive "Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism" in late 2016, the region's formal criminal justice system has convicted and sentenced more than 250,000 people."While few verdicts and other official documents are publicly available due to Xinjiang authorities' tight control of information, a Human Rights Watch analysis of nearly 60 of these cases suggests that many people have been convicted and imprisoned without committing a genuine offence," HRW said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xinjiangs-birth-rate-drops-sharply-as-focus-grows-on-uyghur-genocide-101614588345690.html
01-03-2021||World||US wasted billions on cars, buildings in Afghanistan: Report||The United States wasted billions of dollars in war-torn Afghanistan on buildings and vehicles that were either abandoned or destroyed, according to a report released Monday by a U.S. government watchdog.The agency said it reviewed $7.8 billion spent since 2008 on buildings and vehicles. Only $343.2 million worth of buildings and vehicles “were maintained in good condition,” said the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, which oversees American taxpayer money spent on the protracted conflict.The report said that just $1.2 billion of the $7.8 billion went to pay for buildings and vehicles that were used as intended.“The fact that so many capital assets wound up not used, deteriorated or abandoned should have been a major cause of concern for the agencies financing these projects," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general, said in his report.The U.S. public is weary of the nearly 20-year-old war and President Joe Biden is reviewing a peace deal his predecessor, Donald Trump, signed with the Taliban a year ago. He must decide whether to withdraw all troops by May 1, as promised in the deal, or stay and possibly prolong the war. Officials say no decision has been made but on Monday, Washington's peace envoy and the American who brokered the U.S.-Taliban deal, Zalmay Khalilzad, was back in the Afghan capital for a tour of the region.Taliban insurgents and the Afghan government have been holding on-again-off-again talks in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar but a deal that could bring peace to Afghanistan after 40 years of relentless war seems far off.After Kabul, Khalilzad will travel to Qatar's capital of Doha and neighboring countries, including Pakistan, to push anew for progress in the Doha talks and a cease-fire to end the relentless violence.Analyst Bill Roggio of the Long War Journal said the findings by SIGAR are not surprising. The reasons for the financial losses include Taliban attacks, corruption and “throwing money at the problem without considering the implications,” he said.“It is one thing to build a clinic and school, it is another to operate, maintain, and in many cases defend this infrastructure from Taliban attacks,” said Roggio. "Additionally, the West has wildly underestimated the impact of Afghan corruption and in many cases incompetence. It was always a recipe for failure.”U.S. agencies responsible for construction didn't even ask the Afghans if they wanted or needed the buildings they ordered built, or if they had the technical ability to keep them running, Sopko said in his report.The waste occurred in violation of “multiple laws stating that U.S. agencies should not construct or procure capital assets until they can show that the benefiting country has the financial and technical resources and capability to use and maintain those assets effectively,” he said.Torek Farhadi, a former adviser to the Afghan government, said a "donor-knows-best” mentality often prevailed and it routinely meant little to no consultation with the Afghan government on projects.He said a lack of coordination among the many international donors aided the wastefulness. For example, he said schools were on occasion built alongside other newly constructed schools financed by other donors. The construction went ahead because once the decision was made — contract awarded and money allocated — the school was built regardless of the need, said Farhadi.The injection of billions of dollars, largely unmonitored, fueled runaway corruption among both Afghans and international contractors. But experts say that despite the waste, the need for assistance is real, given the Afghan governments heavy dependence on international money.The worsening security situation in Afghanistan also greatly impeded the monitoring of projects, with shoddy construction going undetected, said Farhadi, the former Afghan government adviser.“Consult with the locals about their needs and sustainability of the project once the project is complete,” he urged U.S. funding agencies looking to future projects. “Supervise, supervise, supervise project progress and implementation and audit every single layer of expenditure.”Going forward, Roggio said smaller, more manageable projects should be the order of the day. To build big unmanageable projects that Afghanistan has neither the capacity nor technical expertise for after 40 years of relentless war “feeds into the Taliban narrative that the government is corrupt, incompetent, and incapable of providing for the Afghan people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-wasted-billions-on-cars-buildings-in-afghanistan-report-101614587618180.html
01-03-2021||World||China builds system to launch its newer nuclear missiles from underground silos||China appears to be moving faster toward a capability to launch its newer nuclear missiles from underground silos, possibly to improve its ability to respond promptly to a nuclear attack, according to an American expert who analysed satellite images of recent construction at a missile training area.Hans Kristensen, a longtime watcher of US, Russian and Chinese nuclear forces, said the imagery suggests that China is seeking to counter what it may view as a growing threat from the United States. The US in recent years has pointed to China's nuclear modernisation as a key justification for investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming two decades to build an all-new US nuclear arsenal.There's no indication the United States and China are headed toward armed conflict, let alone a nuclear one. But the Kristensen report comes at a time of heightened US-China tensions across a broad spectrum, from trade to national security. A stronger Chinese nuclear force could factor into US calculations for a military response to aggressive Chinese actions, such as in Taiwan or the South China Sea.The Pentagon declined to comment on Kristensen's analysis of the satellite imagery, but it said last summer in its annual report on Chinese military developments that Beijing intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by putting more of them in underground silos and operating on a higher level of alert in which it could launch missiles upon warning of being under attack.“The PRC's nuclear weapons policy prioritises the maintenance of a nuclear force able to survive a first strike and respond with sufficient strength to inflict unacceptable damage on an enemy,” the Pentagon report said.More broadly, the Pentagon asserts that China is modernising its nuclear forces as part of a wider effort to build a military by mid-century that is equal to, and in some respects superior to, the US military.China's nuclear arsenal, estimated by the US government to number in the low 200s, is dwarfed by those of the United States and Russia, which have thousands. The Pentagon predicts that the People's Liberation Army Rocket Forces will at least double the size of its nuclear arsenal over the next 10 years, still leaving it with far fewer than the United States.China does not publicly discuss the size or preparedness of its nuclear force beyond saying it would be used only in response to an attack. The United States, by contrast, does not rule out striking first, although President Joe Biden in the past has embraced removing that ambiguity by adopting a “no first use” policy.Kristensen, an analyst with the Federation of American Scientists, said the commercial satellite photos he acquired appear to show China late last year began construction of 11 underground silos at a vast missile training range near Jilantai in north-central China. Construction of five other silos began there earlier. In its public reports the Pentagon has not cited any specific number of missile silos at that training range.These 16 silos identified by Kristensen would be in addition to the 18-20 that China now operates with an older intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-5.“It should be pointed out that even if China doubles or triples the number of ICBM silos, it would only constitute a fraction of the number of ICBM silos operated by the United States and Russia,” Kristensen wrote on his Federation of American Scientists' blog. “The U.S. Air Force has 450 silos, of which 400 are loaded. Russia has about 130 operational silos.”Nearly all of the new silos detected by Kristensen appear designed to accommodate China's newer-generation DF-41 ICBM, which is built with a solid-fuel component that allows the operator to more quickly prepare the missile for launch, compared to the DF-5's more time-consuming liquid-fuel system. The DF-41 can target Alaska and much of the continental United States.China already has a rail- and road-mobile version of the DF-41 missile.“They're trying to build up the survivability of their force,” by developing silo basing for their advanced missiles, Kristensen said in an interview. “It raises some questions about this fine line in nuclear strategy,” between deterring a U.S. adversary by threatening its highly valued nuclear forces and pushing the adversary into taking countermeasures that makes its force more capable and dangerous.“How do you get out of that vicious cycle?” Kristensen asked.Frank Rose, a State Department arms control official during the Obama administration, said recently there is little prospect of getting China to join an international negotiation to limit nuclear weapons. The Trump administration tried that but failed, and Rose sees no reason to think that will change anytime soon.“They're not going to do it out of the goodness of their heart,” he said, but they might be interested in talking if the United States were willing to consider Chinese concerns about related issues like US missile defenses.Rose says China's main interest is in building up its non-nuclear force of shorter- and intermediate-range missiles, which, combined with a cyberattack capability and systems for damaging or destroying US satellites, could push the United States out of the western Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-developing-tech-to-launch-newer-nuclear-missiles-from-underground-silos-101614587119488.html

01-03-2021||World||Myanmar court files 2 more charges against Suu Kyi; protesters march again||A Myanmar court filed two more charges against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday, a lawyer acting for her said, as protesters marched in defiance of a crackdown by security forces that killed at least 18 people the previous day.Suu Kyi looked well as she took part in a court hearing via video conferencing in the capital, Naypyitaw, and she asked to see her legal team, lawyer Min Min Soe told Reuters.The leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) has not been seen in public since her government was ousted in a Feb. 1 military coup, when she was detained along with other party leaders."I saw A May on the video, she looks healthy," the lawyer said, using an affectionate term that means "mother" to refer to Suu Kyi.Suu Kyi was initially charged with illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Later, a charge of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols was added.On Monday, a charge was added under a section of the colonial-era penal code prohibiting the publication of information that may “cause fear or alarm” or disrupt “public tranquillity”, Min Min Soe said.Another charge was added under a telecommunications law, the lawyer said, which stipulates equipment needs a licence.The next hearing will be on March 15.Myanmar has been in chaos since the military seized power after alleging fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's NLD in a landslide.As Suu Kyi appeared in the video conference court hearing, police in the main city of Yangon used stun grenades and tear gas to disperse protesters, witnesses said, a day after the worst violence since the coup.There were no immediate reports of any casualties on Monday but the previous day, police opened fire on crowds in various parts of the country killing 18 people, the U.N. human rights office said."We have to continue the protest no matter what," Thar Nge said by telephone after police firing tear gas forced him and others to abandon a barricade in a Yangon street."This is my neighbourhood. It's a lovely neighbourhood but now we're hearing gunfire and we don't feel safe at home."The military has not commented on Sunday's violence and police and military spokesmen did not answer calls.Earlier, police with water cannon and military vehicles were mobilised at protest hotspots in Yangon as crowds gathered to chant slogans.'ABHORRENT'Demonstrators marched in the northwestern town of Kale holding up pictures of Suu Kyi and chanting "democracy, our cause, our cause".Live video on Facebook showed a small crowd in hard hats gathered across a street in the northeastern town of Lashio, chanting slogans as police marched towards them. Protesters also marched in the central town of Bagan.The coup, which brought a halt to tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule, has drawn hundreds of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets and the condemnation of Western countries.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced what he called "abhorrent violence" by security forces, while Canada's foreign minister, Marc Garneau, called the military's use of lethal force "appalling". Both urged a united response.Tom Andrews, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said it was clear the junta's assault would continue so the international community should ratchet up its response.He proposed a global arms embargo, more sanctions from more countries on those behind the coup, sanctions on the military's businesses and a U.N Security Council referral to the International Criminal Court."Words of condemnation are welcome but insufficient. We must act," Andrews said in a statement."The nightmare in Myanmar that is unfolding before our eyes will get worse. The world must act."A committee representing lawmakers who won seats in the November election said at least 26 people were killed in the violence on Sunday, a tally Reuters was unable to verify.In a post dated Feb. 28, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper warned "severe action will be inevitably taken" against "anarchic mobs" that the military could not ignore, despite having previously shown restraint.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said at least 270 people were detained on Sunday, from a total 1,132 it said had been arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.While some Western countries have imposed limited sanctions, the generals have traditionally shrugged off diplomatic pressure with support from China and Russia.The junta has promised to hold a new election but not set a date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-court-files-2-more-charges-against-suu-kyi-protesters-march-again-101614586463381.html
01-03-2021||World||Countries call on drug companies to share vaccine blueprint, technical know-how||In an industrial neighborhood on the outskirts of Bangladesh’s largest city lies a factory with gleaming new equipment imported from Germany, its immaculate hallways lined with hermetically sealed rooms. It is operating at just a quarter of its capacity.It is one of three factories that The Associated Press found on three continents whose owners say they could start producing hundreds of millions of Covid-19 vaccines on short notice if only they had the blueprints and technical know-how. But that knowledge belongs to the large pharmaceutical companies who produce the first three vaccines authorized by countries including Britain, the European Union and the US — Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. The factories are all still awaiting responses.Across Africa and Southeast Asia, governments and aid groups, as well as the WHO, are calling on pharmaceutical companies to share their patent information more broadly to meet a yawning global shortfall in a pandemic that already has claimed nearly 2.5 million lives. Pharmaceutical companies that took taxpayer money from the US or Europe to develop inoculations at unprecedented speed say they are negotiating contracts and exclusive licensing deals with producers on a case-by-case basis because they need to protect their intellectual property and ensure safety.Critics say this piecemeal approach is just too slow at a time of urgent need to stop the virus before it mutates into even deadlier forms. Last month, WHO called for vaccine manufacturers to share their know-how to “dramatically increase the global supply.”“If that can be done then immediately overnight every continent will have dozens of companies who would be able to produce these vaccines,” said Abdul Muktadir, whose Incepta plant in Bangladesh already makes vaccines against hepatitis, flu, meningitis, rabies, tetanus and measles.All over the world, the supply of coronavirus vaccines is falling far short of demand, and the limited amount available is going to rich countries. Nearly 80% of the vaccines so far have been administered in just 10 countries, according to WHO. More than 210 countries with a collective population of 2.5 billion haven’t received a single shot.The deal-by-deal approach also means that some poorer countries end up paying more for the same vaccine than richer countries. South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Uganda all pay different amounts per dose for the same AstraZeneca vaccine — more than governments in the European Union, according to studies and publicly available documents. AstraZeneca said in an email that the price of the vaccine will differ depending on factors such as production costs, where the shots are made and how much countries order.“What we see today is a stampede, a survival of the fittest approach, where those with the deepest pockets, with the sharpest elbows are grabbing what is there and leaving others to die,” said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.In South Africa, home to the world’s most worrisome Covid-19 variant, the Biovac factory has said for weeks that it’s in negotiations with an unnamed manufacturer with no contract to show for it. And in Denmark, the Bavarian Nordic factory has capacity to spare and the ability to make more than 200 million doses but is also waiting for word from the producer of a licensed coronavirus vaccine.Governments and health experts offer two potential solutions to the vaccine shortage: One, supported by WHO, is a patent pool modeled after a platform set up for HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis treatments for voluntary sharing of technology, intellectual property and data. But not a single company has offered to share its data or transfer the necessary technology.The other, a proposal to suspend intellectual property rights during the pandemic, has been blocked in the World Trade Organization by the United States and Europe, home to the companies responsible for creating the vaccines described as the best way to stop the spread of coronavirus. That drive has the support of at least 119 countries among the WTO's 164 member states, and the African Union, but is adamantly opposed by vaccine makers.Pharmaceutical companies say that instead of lifting IP restrictions, rich countries should simply give more of the vaccines they have to poorer countries through COVAX, the public-private initiative WHO helped create for equitable vaccine distribution. The organization and its partners delivered its first doses last week — in very limited quantities.But rich countries are not willing to give up what they have. Earlier this month, Ursula Von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, used the phrase “global common good” to describe the vaccines. However, by the end of the week, the European Union had imposed export controls on vaccines, giving countries the power to stop shots from leaving their borders in some cases.The long-held model in the pharmaceutical industry is that companies pour in huge amounts of money and research in return for the right to reap profits from their drugs and vaccines. At an industry forum last May, Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla described the idea of sharing IP rights widely as “nonsense” and even “dangerous.” AstraZeneca’s chief Pascal Soriot said that if intellectual property is not protected, “there is no incentive for anybody to innovate.”Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, called the idea of lifting patent protections “a very bad signal to the future. You signal that if you have a pandemic, your patents are not worth anything.”Advocates of sharing vaccine blueprints argue that, unlike with most drugs, taxpayers paid billions to develop vaccines that are now “global public goods” and should be used to end the biggest public health emergency in living memory.“People are literally dying because we cannot agree on intellectual property rights,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat who has been deeply involved in the WTO discussions.Paul Fehlner, the chief legal officer for biotech company Axcella and a supporter of the WHO patent pool board, said governments that poured billions of dollars into developing vaccines and treatments should have demanded more from the companies they were financing from the beginning.“A condition of taking taxpayer money is not treating them as dupes,” he said.In a Feb. 3 interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading pandemic expert in the United States, said all options need to be on the table, including increasing aid, improving production capacity in the developing world and working with pharmaceutical companies to relax their patents.“Rich countries, ourselves included, have a moral responsibility when you have a global outbreak like this,” Fauci said. “We’ve got to get the entire world vaccinated, not just our own country.”It’s hard to know exactly how much more vaccine could be made worldwide if intellectual property restrictions were lifted, because the spare production capacity of factories has not been publicly shared. But Suhaib Siddiqi, former director of chemistry at Moderna, said that with the blueprint and technical advice, a modern factory should be able to get vaccine production going in at most three to four months.“In my opinion the vaccine belongs to the public,” said Siddiqi, who is still active in the field. “Any company which has experience synthesizing molecules should be able to do it.”Back in Bangladesh, the Incepta factory tried to get what it needed to make more vaccines in two ways, by offering its production lines to Moderna and by reaching out to a WHO partner. Moderna did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the Bangladesh plant, but its CEO, Stéphane Bancel, told European parliamentarians that the company’s engineers are fully occupied on expanding production in Europe.“Doing more tech transfer right now could actually put the production and the increased output for the months to come at great risk,” he said. “We are very open to do it in the future once our current sites are running.”Muktadir said he was also in discussions last May with CEPI, or the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, one of WHO’s partners in a global effort to buy and distribute Covid-19 vaccines fairly, but nothing came of it. CEPI spokesman Tom Mooney said the talks last year with Incepta didn’t raise interest, but that CEPI is still in discussions “about matchmaking opportunities including the possibility of using Incepta’s capacity for second wave vaccines.”Muktadir said he fully appreciates the extraordinary scientific achievement involved in the creation of vaccines this year, wants the rest of the world to be able to share in it, and is willing to pay a fair price.“Nobody should give their property just for nothing,” he said. “A vaccine could be made accessible to people — high quality, effective vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-call-on-drug-companies-to-share-vaccine-blueprint-technical-knowhow-101614586088647.html

And the White House has a reason for that, as explained by press secretary Jen Psaki on Sunday.Psaki told CNN that there are more "effective ways" to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the killing as well as leave room with the Saudis on "areas of mutual agreement".Secretary of State Antony Blinken had earlier explained that Biden wants to "recalibrate" but not "rupture" its relations with Riyadh, a longstanding Middle East partner."This is not the Saudi smack-down that many expected," Varsha Koduvayur, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies think-tank in Washington, told news agency AFP.The US on Friday released fresh declassified file on the killing of Khashoggi, who was critical of the Saudi kingdom and the crown prince, popularly know by his initials MBS, which cited intelligence reports from CIA and other agenies to say that the killing took place on the orders of the crown prince.Khashoggi, a US resident, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018. He had gone to the consulate to get a document that he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee Hatice Cengiz who was waiting outside.Turkish officials say Khashoggi, 59, was strangled and his body was cut into pieces by a 15-man Saudi group inside the kingdom’s mission. His remains have never been found.The conclusion in the report that the prince approved an operation to kill or capture Khashoggi was based on his decision-making role inside the kingdom, the involvement of a key adviser and members of his protective detail and his past support for violently silencing dissidents abroad.After the report was released, Blinken announced sanctions against 76 Saudi individuals under what he called a new “Khashoggi Ban” policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khashoggi-killing-white-house-official-explains-why-saudi-crown-prince-not-sanctioned-101614586244417.html

The three-hour-long car rally featured flags from both the countries and involved 22 Indo-Canadian organisations.The first consignment of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is scheduled to arrive in Toronto on March 3. The shipment will have 500,000 doses. A total of two million shots will be sent to Canada by mid-May.One of the organisers of the car rally, Naresh Chavda, a legal professional from Toronto, said the objective was “to strengthen Indo-Canadian unity because India is helping Canada with vaccines, and to celebrate that”.The Brampton rally took place in the shadow of increasing tensions in Canada as pro-Khalistan elements have been showing solidarity with those demonstrating against farm reform laws passed in India. During the event, some protesters had tried to block the rally, but were cleared by police. Participants at the rally recalled that some of the protesters shouted abusive slogans and caused minor damage. In a flier sent out earlier, the rally’s organisers had warned participants to stay away from reacting to people who opposed the event.“We require peace because of the way in which Khalistanis are destabilising the community in the GTA and Vancouver due to anti-Indian government protests, while, at the same time, India is helping many countries including Canada with vaccines,” said one of the organisers who wished not to be named.Also this weekend, a ‘kisan’ rally (pro-farmer rally) was held with the backing of the Ontario Gurdwara Committee, Sikh Motorcycle Club of Canada, Guru Nanak Mission Canada, and the Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar Canada. One of the organisers, Sukhminder Singh Hansra, a leading pro-Khalistan figure in the country, told HT that there was “amazing enthusiasm” for the rally with a “big gathering” as people listened to speeches and a play on radio.Meanwhile, left-of-centre and union groups took out a full-page advertisement in leading Canadian daily, Toronto Star, criticising the Indian government over the farm laws that have sparked protests in India. Under the headline “Statement of Solidarity with Farmers of India”, the advertisement says the “recent declarations of support for the farm laws by the IMF and the US government indicate the range of forces backing them, adding an anti-imperialist dimension to the struggle against them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-rally-near-toronto-hails-indo-canadian-collaboration-in-covid-vaccine-supply-101614586281453.html
01-03-2021||World||Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's extradition to US enters final round in Canadian court||The high-stakes battle by Chinese Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou against extradition to the United States enters its final stage in a Canadian court on Monday, after more than two years of legal skirmishes and diplomatic barbs.The daughter of Huawei founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei faces charges in the United States of bank fraud and conspiracy over the commercial activities of a former Huawei subsidiary alleged to have violated US sanctions against Iran.As the case enters its final months, Meng's defence lawyers are set to assert that abuses by Canada and the United States have denied her the right to a fair process.The case has roiled Canada's diplomatic relations with China, its second largest trading partner behind the United States.Meng is accused of having lied to the HSBC investment bank about Huawei's relationship with subsidiary Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran. If convicted, she could face more than 30 years in a US prison.Meng and Huawei both deny the charges. Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer.Two Canadian citizens -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- remain imprisoned in China. They were detained days after Meng's December 2018 arrest during a stopover in Vancouver, and after Beijing threatened Canada with severe consequences over what Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng called Meng's "unconscionable" detention.Ottawa has long maintained Kovrig and Spavor were "arbitrarily" jailed in retaliation for Meng's arrest, while affirming the independence of Canada's judicial system in dealing with the US extradition request.Beijing, meanwhile, has called the charges against Meng "completely political," and part of a plot to crush its top global technology firm. Washington last year banned US semiconductor chipmakers from selling to Huawei, which it accuses of stealing American trade secrets.'Bartering chips'The latest hearings begin just days after US President Joe Biden publicly demanded the two Canadians' release, saying Tuesday during a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, "Human beings are not bartering chips."Ottawa recently unveiled a declaration signed by 58 countries against "arbitrary detention in state-to-state relations."And when the Canadian parliament denounced China's treatment of its ethnic Uighurs as genocide, Beijing angrily slammed it as a "malicious provocation.""The Canadian side's attempt to pressure China by using 'Megaphone Diplomacy' or ganging up is totally futile and will only head towards a dead end," China's embassy in Canada said.In the upcoming hearings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Meng's lawyers are expected to argue that former US president Donald Trump "poisoned" the case when he said he might intervene in her prosecution in exchange for Chinese trade concessions.Lawyers for Canada's attorney general have urged the judge to dismiss the allegations, saying in court filings that the remarks were made by "a president no longer in office, about a possible intervention in this case that never occurred."Defence lawyers will then argue that Meng's rights were violated during her Vancouver airport detention and interrogation; that the United States misled Canada when it requested her arrest; and that extraditing her would break international law because none of Huawei's alleged crimes had any direct connection to the United States.Over the past two years, Meng has suffered several legal setbacks.A judge last month rejected her plea to relax her bail conditions, which include a curfew, the wearing of a monitoring anklet, and daytime supervision. Canada argued she might try to escape.Meng remains under house arrest in her Vancouver mansion.Her extradition trial is scheduled to wrap up in mid-May, barring any appeals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-executive-meng-wanzhou-s-extradition-to-us-enters-final-round-101614583716725.html
01-03-2021||World||India Covid-19 cases may rise as summer will force people indoors: Expert||A top Canada-based epidemiologist has cautioned India to guard against a possible surge in coronavirus cases in the months ahead as the summer forces people indoors.The warning came from Toronto-based Prabhat Jha, epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Unity Health St Michael Hospital and executive director of the Centre for Global Health Research.Jha is also the lead investigator in the Million Death Study conducted in India in collaboration with the Registrar General of India.Jha told HT that the principal “element for transmission” is now considered to be “an indoor, closed, less ventilated space”.Just as there was a winter peak in countries such as Canada as falling temperatures drove people indoors, a similar a phenomenon may be relevant to India in the context of the summer’s heat, the expert said.More caution needs to be exercised during the months of May and June as temperatures rise, he said, adding, “The upward tick now seen in many states is a result of people being more lax with masks and indoor gatherings. This may get worse with summer heat.”Jha and his research team are working on a study looking at the possible causes behind the decrease in cases in countries such as India. He said the “most probable” reason for this trend was that “a large number (of people) are already infected”.As per data from 18 large Indian cities covering a population of nearly 110 million, between 50-60% of adults are already infected. He said the trajectory in India has been “atypical” as nearly 75% of cases have been asymptomatic - directly opposite to the trend in the West.Jha cited the inching up of daily cases in India, particularly in Mumbai, as a cause for concern.He said the relatively low mortality rates in India so far could be attributed not just to fewer infections, but also factors like “hyper-stimulation of the immune system” due to multiple reasons, such as the population being exposed to other coronaviruses in the past, and the prevalence of diseases such as measles.“But we have to be very careful,” cautioned Jha, referring to a gradual increase in infection rates over the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-may-spike-in-india-due-to-summer-warns-canada-based-expert-101614580461322.html

"I am confident that if we put our heads together ... we will also be able to wisely resolve issues of the past."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-prez-hopes-tokyo-olympics-may-allow-for-us-north-korea-talks-101614573177899.html
01-03-2021||World||Former US President Donald Trump hints at 2024 run for the White House||Former US President Donald Trump on Sunday hinted at another run for the White House in 2024, as he repeated the discredited claim that the last election was “stolen” from him.The former US president also said that he is not launching a new political party as had been speculated, and called for Republicans to unify.Taking the stage for the first time since leaving office, Trump launched an attack on his successor, President Joe Biden, saying he has had the “most disastrous first month of any president in modern history”.Trump’s remarks came on the closing day of the annual conference of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a popular forum for Republican White House aspirants to hawk their wares. It was held in Orlando, Florida.“As you know, they just lost the White House,” said Trump, repeating his claim about the November election, as he set up his 2024 run for the US presidency. “I may even decide to beat them for a third time,” Trump added, referring to his first win in 2016 and the defeat in 2020, which he continues to portray as a victory.Trump, 74, remains a dominant figure for the Republicans despite the party losing the White House, the Senate and the House since 2018 on his watch. As a straw poll of the attendees at the CPAC showed, he is the frontrunner for the party’s nomination for president by a wide margin. Asked who they will vote for in a Republican primary for the 2024 nominee, 55% of the respondents picked Trump. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, a staunch Trump ally, finished a distant second at 21%, and South Dakota governor Kristi Noem was further behind with 4% for the third slot.Nearly seven out of 10 respondents said they would like Trump to run again; 15% said they would not and 17% were unsure. An overwhelming 95% of the respondents said they wanted the party to pursue Trump’s agenda and policies and only 3% said the party needed to change course. The rest were unsure.“We’re not starting new parties,” Trump told the attendees, refuting reports that were based on suggestions from his aides to counter Republicans who wanted the party to sever ties with him, appalled by his role in the January 6 Capitol riot that earned him the dubious distinction of being the only US president to be impeached twice.“We have the Republican Party. It is going to unite and be stronger than ever before,” Trump said.He named the 10 Republicans who voted with Democrats to impeach him in the House on January 13, and the seven Republicans who voted to convict him in the Senate trial, which failed because it fell short of the two-third majority needed to go through.“We cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country,” said Trump, calling for unity within the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-president-donald-trump-hints-at-2024-run-for-the-white-house-101614572960989.html
01-03-2021||World||Myanmar pro-democracy protests: Military junta kills at least 18||Security forces in Myanmar opened fire and made mass arrests Sunday as they sought to break up protests against the military’s seizure of power, and a UN human rights official said it had “credible information” that at least 18 people were killed and 30 were wounded.That would be the highest single-day death toll among protesters who are demanding that the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi be restored to power after being ousted by a Feb. 1 coup. About 1,000 people are believed to have been detained Sunday.“Deaths reportedly occurred as a result of live ammunition fired into crowds in Yangon, Dawei, Mandalay, Myeik, Bago and Pokokku,” the UN Human Rights Office said in a statement referring to several cities, adding that the forces also used tear gas, flash-bang grenades and stun grenades.An Associated Press journalist was taken into police custody on Saturday morning while providing news coverage of the protests. The journalist, Thein Zaw, remains in police custody.The AP called for his immediate release.“Independent journalists must be allowed to freely and safely report the news without fear of retribution. AP decries in the strongest terms the arbitrary detention of Thein Zaw,” said Ian Phillips, AP vice president for international news. The Foreign Correspondents Club of Myanmar also condemned the arrest.The Democratic Voice of Burma reported that as of 5pm in Myanmar, there had been 19 confirmed deaths in nine cities, with another 10 deaths unconfirmed. The independent media company broadcasts on satellite and digital terrestrial television, as well as online.DVB counted five deaths in Yangon and two in Mandalay, the largest and second-largest cities.It registered five deaths in Dawei, a much smaller city in southeastern Myanmar that has seen tens of thousands of protesters nearly every day since the coup. Witnesses said Sunday’s march was also large and people were determined not to be driven off the streets.Confirming the deaths of protesters has been difficult amid the chaos and general lack of news from official sources, especially in areas outside Yangon, Mandalay and the capital of Naypyitaw. But in many cases, photos and video circulated showed circumstances of the killings and gruesome photos of bodies.The independent Assistance Association of Political Prisoners reported it was aware that about 1,000 people were detained Sunday, of whom they were able to identify 270. That brought to 1,132 the total number of people the group has confirmed being arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.Gunfire was reported almost as soon the protests began Sunday morning in Yangon, as police also fired tear gas and water cannons while trying to clear the streets. Photos of shell casings from live ammunition used in assault rifles were posted on social media.Initial reports on social media identified one young man believed to have been killed. His body was shown in photos and videos lying on a sidewalk until other protesters carried him away.In Dawei, local media reported at least three people were killed during a protest march, supported by photos and video. Photos on social media showed one wounded man in the care of medical personnel.Before Sunday, there had been eight confirmed reports of killings linked to the army’s takeover, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the crackdown, calling the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters and arbitrary arrests “unacceptable,” and expressed serious concern at the increase in deaths and serious injuries, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.“The secretary-general urges the international community to come together and send a clear signal to the military that it must respect the will of the people of Myanmar as expressed through the election and stop the repression,” Dujarric said.US officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken also condemned the violence. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan issued a statement saying the US is “alarmed” by the violence and stands in solidarity with Myanmar people “who continue to bravely voice their aspirations for democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights."Washington has imposed sanctions on Myanmar because of the coup, and Sullivan said it would “impose further costs on those responsible,” promising details “in the coming days.”The Feb. 1 coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party would have been installed for a second five-year term in office, but the army blocked Parliament from convening and detained her and President Win Myint, as well as other top members of Suu Kyi’s government.On Sunday morning, medical students marched in Yangon near the Hledan Center intersection, which has become the gathering point for protesters who then fan out to other parts of the city.Videos and photos showed protesters running as police charged at them, and residents setting up makeshift roadblocks to slow their advance. Some protesters managed to throw tear gas canisters back at police. Nearby, residents were pleading with police to release those they picked up from the street and shoved into police trucks to be taken away. Dozens or more were believed to be detained.“The world is watching the actions of the Myanmar military junta, and will hold them accountable,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for New York-based Human Rights Watch. “Live ammunition should not be used to control or disperse protests and lethal force can only be used to protect life or prevent serious injury.”Security forces began employing rougher tactics on Saturday, taking preemptive actions to break up protests and making scores, if not hundreds, of arrests. Greater numbers of soldiers also joined police. Many of those detained were taken to Insein Prison in Yangon’s northern outskirts, historically notorious for holding political prisoners.According to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, as of Saturday, 854 people had been arrested, charged or sentenced at one point in relation to the coup, and 771 were being detained or sought for arrest. The group said that while it had documented 75 new arrests, it understood that hundreds of other people were also picked up Saturday in Yangon and elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-pro-democracy-protests-military-junta-kills-at-least-18-101614561611754.html

01-03-2021||World||In first post-White House speech, Donald Trump says his political journey 'far from over'||In his first public appearance since leaving office, former US President Donald Trump suggested he may launch a third presidential bid, but said he has no plans to start an alternative to the Republican Party."I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together four years ago is far from over," the former president said in his first speech since leaving the White House last month.Speaking at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, Trump said: "We are gathered this afternoon to talk about the future -- the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country."Trump began his address by asking the crowd: "Do you miss me?" He announced he is "not starting a new party" and, making note of the mostly maskless audience, said "there are no masks, there's no double masks.""Actually, as you know they just lost the White House," Trump said of Democrats, repeating the lie he he won the election last fall. "Who knows, I may even decide to beat them for the third time," he added, stopping short of declaring his 2024 plans.He lashed out at his successor, US President Joe Biden, saying that the new administration is anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science, Sputnik reported.Trump said: "Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history. It was Trump's first major public appearance since leaving office.Trump particularly pointed to the emerging border crisis in the US, criticizing Biden's immigration policy and calling it a betrayal of America's core values."Already the Biden administration has proven that they are anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science," Trump said, adding "In just one short month we have gone from 'America First' to 'America Last.'"The CPAC is an annual forum, held this year in Florida by the American Conservative Union. Sunday is the final chapter of the four-day event, which is expected to give the ex-POTUS a platform to announce his future political plans.The former president said that the Democrats can lose the White House four years from now, and repeated his allegations of election fraud."[US President Joe] Biden has failed in his number one duty as chief executive enforcing America's laws. This alone should be reason enough for Democrats to suffer withering losses in the midterms and to lose the White House decisively four years from now," Trump asserted.

01-03-2021||World||Beijing could be preparing for a full-scale invasion of Taiwan: Report||China's 'gray zone' warfare against Taiwan is now at the highest level, which could mean that Beijing is preparing for a full-scale invasion, Focus Taiwan reported citing local military experts warned on Thursday.Gray zone conflicts are activities by a state that are harmful to another state and are sometimes considered to be acts of war, but are not legally acts of war.Shu Hsiao-huang, an analyst at the government-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said that in gray-zone conflicts, the participants rely on unconventional tools, tactics and the use of non-state entities that do not cross over into formal state-level aggression.Due to ambiguity of the enemy's actions, the targets of 'gray-zone' warfare are often uncertain how to immediately respond, he said.Over the past years, Beijing has been conducting "gray-zone" warfare against Taipei, using tactics such as propaganda campaigns, economic pressure, online rumours, and disinformation via content farms to put political pressure on the Taiwan government, Shu said.That type of warfare against Taiwan is now at its highest level, which could mean that Beijing is preparing for a full-scale invasion, although high tensions do not necessarily mean physical war, he said.At the forum, former Defense Minister Andrew Yang said Beijing has been engaged in a "war of attrition," with the aim of wearing down Taiwan politically, militarily, and psychologically.Fortunately, the international community in recent years has been paying closer attention to China's military manoeuvres near Taiwan, and they are also on high alert over the growing military threat posed by Beijing, Yang said.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-could-be-preparing-for-a-full-scale-invasion-of-taiwan-report-101614559204536.html
01-03-2021||World||China to strengthen global influence campaign amid rising discontent: Report||Facing disapproval around the world over a slew of issues including Xinjiang, Hong Kong, coronavirus handling and Indo-Pacific, Beijing is expected to step up its global influence campaign after the Communist Party of China (CPC) issued revised regulations on united front work in early January.Lin Cheng-jung, a researcher at Taiwan government-funded think tank Institute for National Defense and Security Research, in an article published in the institution's Defense Security Bi-weekly on Feburary 20, said that the CPC is expanding its influence campaign from domestic to international audiences, utilizing modern technology and other creative ways, with Taiwan as one of its primary targets, Focus Taiwan reported.On January 5, the CPC Central Committee published its revised regulations on united front work after a five-year trial period.The united front is defined by the CPC as an alliance of different political forces to advance the party's interests. The united front work, as observed by international experts, however, is achieved largely through using its political influence.In 2021, the CPC is expected to focus on "invisible emotional warfare" against Taiwan by making as many friends as it can in Taiwan and overseas that support the unification of Taiwan and China, he concluded.Lin said the revisions signify that the CPC is aiming to institutionalize its united front work to face domestic and external challenges more effectively, including internal reforms, religious and ethnic conflicts such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet.According to Lin, the scope of the CPC's global influence campaign encompasses politics, economics, the military and education including Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the more than 500 Confucius Institutes all over the world.The CPC hopes to export its cultural values and ideologies to other countries through these Confucius Institutes and to lure developing countries to its side with money through the BRI, he said.Lin pointed out that the CPC's united front tactics evolve through time and that the party now uses the popular app TikTok to air political ads, reaching people in as many as 150 countries around the world.Another social media platform worth watching for the CPC's influence campaign is the Clubhouse, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-strengthen-global-influence-campaign-amid-rising-discontent-report-101614556895825.html
01-03-2021||World||Donald Trump teases possible 2024 run, rejects third-party idea at CPAC||Former President Donald Trump rejected the idea of starting a third political party and instead teased the idea of a 2024 run in a speech Sunday at a conservative conference.“I am not starting a new party. That was fake news, no,” Trump told supporters minutes into his speech that closed the four-day Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida. “Wouldn’t that be brilliant? Let’s start a new party and let’s divide our vote so that you will never win. No, we’re not interested in that.”Trump rattled off the accomplishments of his term in the White House, repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election and added, “Who knows? I may even decide to beat them a third time.”The speech to CPAC was Trump’s first public appearance since he left office 39 days ago. Since then, he’s kept an uncharacteristically low profile, hampered in large part because he is banned from Twitter and Facebook in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that led to his impeachment and subsequent acquittal in the Senate.In emailed statements and a handful of interviews to friendly outlets, he’s blasted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, eulogized talk show host Rush Limbaugh and made unfounded allegations of election fraud — all while avoiding questions about his future in the party.His remarks ratified the consensus of the conference that this is not a conservative movement wallowing in in its loss to Democrat Joe Biden as much as it’s a government-in-waiting, counting down the three years and 11 months for Trump to “Make America Great Again” again.In a straw poll, 97% of attendees approved of his leadership of the party, 70% want him to run again and 55% said he was their preferred candidate in 2024. (The other top contenders were Trump loyalists: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, followed by South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and Donald Trump Jr.)Trump’s rousing reception at the most important conservative gathering on the calendar highlights just how much Trump has transformed the movement in just five years.In 2016, Trump abruptly canceled his appearance at the event amid plans for a walkout from conservatives who questioned his commitment to the cause and demands that he answer questions from a moderator like the other candidates.On Sunday, he was the closer of a three-day festival of Trump-flavored conservatism that bore his undeniable imprint.The conference included at least seven panels credulously discussing Trump’s claims of a stolen 2020 election despite dozens of court rulings finding otherwise.Major figures from the Trump cabinet — at least, those still loyal to the former president — were given speaking slots: Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell and Budget Director Russ Vought.Prominent conservatives who have left Trump’s orbit were nowhere to be found, including McConnell and his wife, former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney. Even Trump’s old running mate, former Vice president Mike Pence, declined an invitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-teases-possible-2024-run-rejects-third-party-idea-at-cpac-101614551557445.html
01-03-2021||World||South Africa to ease Covid-19 restrictions after 'dramatic decline'||South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said the country will start relaxing coronavirus restrictions, moving from alert level three down to level one, after a "dramatic decline" in infections.The easing of the measures, due to begin at midnight, will see most economic activity resume as the country moves to rebuild its virus-shattered economy.In a televised address to the nation, Ramaphosa said the country had made big strides in the past eight weeks, recording a steady drop in infections and hospital admissions."Due to the decline in infections, the country can now ease some of the restrictions on movement and economic activity," Ramaphosa announced."We do so cautiously," he added.Ramaphosa said the country had recorded just under 10,000 new infections over the past week, down from more than 40,000 in the last week of January and some 90,000 in the same week in December.He attributed the "dramatic decline" to the public health measures, changes in behaviour, and accumulating immunity in those that had become infected.Under level one restrictions, the country's curfew will now only run from midnight to 4am.The head of state spoke a day after the country received the second batch of Johnson & Johnson vaccines arrived in the country.So far, more than 63,600 healthcare workers have been vaccinated since the country began inoculations nearly a fortnight ago.The elderly, teachers, miners, police officers, soldiers, civil servants and people older than 18 with co-morbidities will be vaccinated in the next phase of the three-phase rollout campaign from the end of April.The government, which has been accused of being slow to acquire Covid vaccines, has secured an agreement to procure 11 million one-shot doses from Johnson & Johnson, 2.8 million of which are expected in the second quarter.Twenty million Pfizer jabs have also been secured, while an additional 12 million doses expected via the COVAX facility, according to Ramaphosa.Having recorded more than 1.5 million infections of which nearly 50,000 have been fatal, South Africa still has the highest number of cases and deaths on the continent.It aims to inoculate around 40 million people -- 67 percent of the population -- by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-to-ease-covid-19-restrictions-after-dramatic-decline-101614548679023.html
01-03-2021||World||Iran rules out nuclear deal meeting, says time not 'suitable'||Iran on Sunday dismissed Europe's offer for an informal meeting involving the United States on the troubled 2015 nuclear deal, saying the time is not "suitable" as Washington has failed to lift sanctions.The European Union's political director earlier this month proposed the informal meeting involving all parties of the Vienna deal, a proposition accepted by US President Joe Biden's administration.Following Biden's election, the US, the European parties to the deal -- France, Germany and Britain -- and Tehran have been trying to salvage the accord, which granted Iran international sanctions relief in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme.The accord has been nearing collapse since former president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign against Tehran."Considering the recent positions and actions of the United States and the three European countries, (Iran) does not consider the time suitable to hold the informal meeting proposed by the European coordinator," foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement."There has still been no change in the US positions and behaviour yet," he added, saying the Biden administration has continued "Trump's failed policy of maximum pressure".Biden has signalled readiness to revive the deal, but insists Iran first return to all its nuclear commitments, most of which it suspended in response to the sanctions, while Tehran demands Washington take the first step by scrapping the sanctions."While we are disappointed at Iran's response, we remain ready to reengage in meaningful diplomacy to achieve a mutual return to compliance," a White House spokesperson said Sunday."We will be consulting with our P5 1 partners on the best way forward," the spokesperson added, referring to the group of the five permanent members on the UN Security Council, plus Germany.The foreign ministry statement comes ahead of a quarterly meeting Monday of the United Nations nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors, which is likely to discuss Iran's recent restrictions of some nuclear inspections."Remember: Trump failed to meet because of his ill-advised 'Max Failure'," Khatibzadeh wrote on Twitter shortly after his statement.Tehran's position is unchanged "with sanctions in place... Censuring is NOT diplomacy. It doesn't work with Iran", he added.'End sanctions'The US "has not even announced its commitment to fulfilling its responsibilities" under the deal and the UN Security Council resolution that enshrined it, the spokesman said in the statement."America must end its illegal and unilateral sanctions and return to its (deal) commitments. This needs neither negotiations nor resolutions," he added.Iran "will answer action with action, and just as it will return to (deal) commitments in accordance with the lifting of sanctions, it will respond to hostile actions and behaviours in the same way".Khatibzadeh said Tehran would continue to consult with other parties to the nuclear agreement, and European Union Foreign Minister Josep Borrell "in his capacity as the (deal) coordinator, both bilaterally and multilaterally".Iran last Tuesday started to restrict some site inspections by the IAEA, in continuation of suspended nuclear commitments in response to the US failure to lift its sanctions.London, Paris and Berlin said they "deeply regret" the move and that they were "united in underlining the dangerous nature of this decision".IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said last week an interim three-month deal agreed during a visit to Tehran was "far from an ideal situation", but will allow the body to continue monitoring "all the key activities".It will facilitate "time for the indispensable diplomacy that will be deployed", he added.Under the temporary agreement, data on Iran's nuclear programme "will be stored and not handed over to the IAEA," according to Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.The Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation has said that if US sanctions are still not lifted after three months, it will start erasing the recordings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-rules-out-nuclear-deal-meeting-says-time-not-suitable-101614547984196.html
01-03-2021||World||'Not a good idea': Experts concerned about Pope trip to Iraq||Infectious disease experts are expressing concern about Pope Francis' upcoming trip to Iraq, given a sharp rise in coronavirus infections there, a fragile health care system and the unavoidable likelihood that Iraqis will crowd to see him.No one wants to tell Francis to call it off, and the Iraqi government has every interest in showing off its relative stability by welcoming the first pope to the birthplace of Abraham. The March 5-8 trip will provide a sorely-needed spiritual boost to Iraq's beleaguered Christians while furthering the Vatican's bridge-building efforts with the Muslim world.But from a purely epidemiological standpoint, as well as the public health message it sends, a papal trip to Iraq amid a global pandemic is not advisable, health experts say.They note that wars, economic crises and an exodus of Iraqi professionals have devastated the country's hospital system, while studies show most of Iraq's new Covid-19 infections are the highly-contagious variant first identified in Britain.“I just don't think it's a good idea,” said Dr. Navid Madani, virologist and founding director of the Center for Science Health Education in the Middle East and North Africa at Harvard Medical School's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.The Iranian-born Madani co-authored an article in The Lancet last year on the region's uneven response to Covid-19, noting that Iraq, Syria and Yemen were poorly placed to cope given they are still struggling with extremist insurgencies and have 40 million people who need humanitarian aid.In a telephone interview, Madani said Middle Easterners are known for their hospitality, and cautioned that the enthusiasm among Iraqis of welcoming a peace-maker like Francis to a neglected, war-torn part of the world might lead to inadvertent violations of virus control measures.“This could potentially lead to unsafe or superspreading risks,” she said.Dr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious disease control expert at the University of Exeter College of Medicine, concurred.“It's a perfect storm for generating lots of cases which you won't be able to deal with,” he said.Organisers promise to enforce mask mandates, social distancing and limitations on participation in papal events, with the possibility of increased testing sites, two Iraqi government officials said.The health care protocols are “critical but can be managed," one government official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.And the Vatican has taken its own precautions, with the 84-year-old pope, his 20-member Vatican entourage and 70-plus journalists on the papal plane all vaccinated.But the Iraqis who will be gathering in the north, center and south of the country to attend Francis' indoor and outdoor Masses, hear his speeches, participate in his prayer meetings and organize the logistics of a complicated trip, are not.And that, scientists say, is the problem.“We are in the middle of a global pandemic. And it is important to get the correct messages out,” Pankhania said. “The correct messages are: the less interactions with fellow human beings, the better.”He questioned the optics of the Vatican delegation being inoculated while the Iraqis are not, and noted that Iraqis would only take the risk to attend such an event because the pope was there.In words addressed to Vatican officials and media, including AP journalists, he said: “You are all protected from severe disease. So if you get infected, you're not going to die. But the people coming to see you may get infected and may die.”“Is it wise under that circumstance for you to just turn up, and because you turn up, people turn up to see you and they get infected?” he asked.The World Health Organization was diplomatic when asked about the wisdom of a papal trip to Iraq, saying countries should evaluate the risk of an event against the infection situation, and then decide if it should be postponed or can be held safely.“If they're having birthday parties, for example, it's all about managing that risk,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19. “It's about looking at the epidemiologic situation in the country and then making sure that if that event is to take place, that it can take place as safely as possible.”Francis has said he intends to go even if most Iraqis have to watch him on television to avoid infection. The important thing, he told Catholic News Service, is “they will see that the pope is there in their country.”Francis has frequently called for an equitable distribution of vaccines and respect for government health measures, though he himself tends to not wear face masks. Francis for months has eschewed even tightly controlled, socially distanced public audiences at the Vatican to limit the chance of contagion.Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton's Faculty of Medicine, said the number of new daily cases in Iraq is “increasing significantly at the moment” with the Health Ministry reporting around 4,000 a day, close to the height of its first wave in September.Head said for any trip to Iraq, there must be infection control practices in force, including mask-wearing, hand-washing, social distancing and good ventilation in indoor spaces.“Hopefully we will see proactive approaches to infection control in place during the pope's visit to Baghdad,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-good-idea-experts-concerned-about-pope-trip-to-iraq-101614502719994.html
