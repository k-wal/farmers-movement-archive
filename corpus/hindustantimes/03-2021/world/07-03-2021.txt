The UK's Sunday Times newspaper, citing an anonymous source, reported that the queen wouldn't watch it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-stresses-importance-of-friends-family-during-covid-19-pandemic-101615138835648.html

We just need to hang in there a bit longer," Fauci told CBS. "We want to get those death levels of the virus very, very low, and then we'll have a much, much easier time to safely pull back" on mitigation measures.The United States is now vaccinating on average 2.1 million people a day."We project that high school students will very likely be able to be vaccinated by the fall term, maybe not the very first day, but certainly in the early part of the fall," he said.He said elementary school children would likely be ready to receive vaccinations by the first quarter of next year, after studies on safety are finished, he said.The decline in cases had begun to plateau at 60,000 to 70,000 new infections per day, which Fauci said was not acceptable. He pointed to the need to continue mask mandates and other mitigation measures to avoid a resurgence as new variants emerge.A new variant was spreading in the New York City area and was proving "rather vigorous" in its ability to spread and eluded somewhat the protection offered by monoclonal antibodies and the vaccines, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-upbeat-on-vaccinations-for-us-teens-by-autumn-younger-children-next-year-101615137616905.html

07-03-2021||World||Swiss agree to outlaw facial coverings in 'burqa ban' vote||A far-right proposal to ban facial coverings in Switzerland won a narrow victory in a binding referendum on Sunday instigated by the same group that organised a 2009 ban on new minarets.The measure to amend the Swiss constitution passed by a 51.2-48.8% margin, provisional official results showed.The proposal under the Swiss system of direct democracy does not mention Islam directly and also aims to stop violent street protesters from wearing masks, yet local politicians, media and campaigners have dubbed it the burqa ban."In Switzerland, our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms," Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and a member of parliament for the Swiss People's Party, had said before the vote.He called facial covering "a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland".The Central Council of Muslims in Switzerland called the vote a dark day for the community."Today's decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority," it said.It promised legal challenges to laws implementing the ban and a fundraising drive to help women who are fined.The proposal predated the Covid-19 pandemic, which has required adults to wear masks in many settings to prevent the spread of infection.Two cantons already have local bans on face coverings.France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public.Practically no one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates. Muslims make up 5% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people, most with roots in Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo.The government had urged people to vote against a ban."After the ban on minarets, a majority of Swiss voters has once again backed an initiative that discriminates against a single religious community and needlessly stirs up fears and division," Amnesty International said."The veiling ban is not a measure for women's liberation, but a dangerous symbolic policy that violates freedom of expression and religion."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-agree-to-outlaw-facial-coverings-in-burqa-ban-vote-101615137397391.html
07-03-2021||World||Report says Japan planning to send armed forces to East China Sea||Amid escalating tensions in the disputed East China Sea, Japan is mulling to send its armed forces to deal with the surge in Chinese activity in the Japanese-controlled Diaoyu Islands, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.The Chinese Coast Guard has expanded its presence in the contested water near the Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus.The increased activity by China comes after it implements a new law that allows Beijing's quasi-military force to use weapons against foreign ships that Beijing sees as illegally entering its waters.The frequency of Chinese coastguard vessels entering the waters has risen from twice a month last year to twice a week in February, according to the Japan Coast Guard.A Japanese official said Tokyo was alarmed by the Chinese activities and was considering its response."Under our domestic law, the self-defence forces can use weapons as law enforcement against unlawful activities on behalf of our coastguard if the Chinese coastguard enters our territorial waters including surrounding the Senkaku Islands without permission," the SCMP quoted the official as saying.While stressing that Japan did not intend to escalate the situation, the official said Tokyo would try to increase pressure on China on the diplomatic front, such as seeking support from countries like Britain and Canada.The islands in question have long been an object of territorial disputes between China and Japan.Last month, Japan lodged a protest with China after two Chinese ships intruded into Japanese coastal waters near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, local media reported.China has conflicting territorial claims with four of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam -- as well as Taiwan in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, US warships carried out freedom of navigation operations in an apparent bid to challenge Chinese claims and actions in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-says-japan-planning-to-send-armed-forces-to-east-china-sea-101615136017986.html
07-03-2021||World||France ramps up weekend Covid-19 vaccinations after slow start||Thousands of people across France flocked to vaccination centres on Sunday as the government stepped up inoculations against the coronavirus to ease the load on hospitals and stave off further restrictions.French authorities have come under criticism for the slow vaccination rollout, which has so far targeted the most vulnerable only. About 3.58 million people of France's 67 million population have received a first jab compared to neighbouring Britain, which is nearing 23 million.While some European countries have resorted to sweeping national lockdowns to fight a resurgence in the virus spurred by new variants, France has opted for a less severe nightly curfew and the closure of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues.The country continues to see cases rise, averaging about 23,000 new cases a day compared with just over 6,000 in Britain, while intensive care units are increasingly saturated."It's a race against time," Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly told reporters visiting one of four military hospitals opened on Sunday for vaccinations.Some 220,000 people were vaccinated on Saturday, more than twice as many as last week. France expects to deliver 10 million first-round shots by mid-April and 30 million - or two thirds of all adults - by the summer.In Paris on Sunday, where the virus is spreading faster than elsewhere in the country, there was relief among some who have struggled to get their vaccination."It turns out that I had to wait a long time for someone to respond, to give me an appointment," retiree Lucette Ugolini, 87, told Reuters at a vaccine centre after waiting six weeks.Needing to vaccinate 200,000 people a day to reach its targets, it's not clear whether the government will get enough doses to have a quick enough impact to avoid a new lockdown."We can only hope that in four weeks, the government can give us the same allocations for the second injection, but we don't know. We're navigating without a clear roadmap. We do what we can," Ariel Weil, Socialist mayor for four central Paris districts told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-ramps-up-weekend-covid-19-vaccinations-after-slow-start-101615136081550.html
07-03-2021||World||Judge, jury, Covid: Key players in trial of ex-officer charged in George Floyd's death||Jury selection begins Monday for a former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder and manslaughter in George Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin's trial, which is expected to last weeks, will be overseen by an experienced judge and argued by skilled attorneys on both sides. It will be streamed online for the world to see because the Covid-19 pandemic has limited who can attend.Floyd, who was Black, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. Among the key figures and elements at trial:Covid-19, cameras and court securityChauvin's trial, one of the highest-profile criminal cases in Minnesota history, is taking place during a global pandemic that has had a dramatic impact. Precautions to guard against the spread of Covid-19 have limited courtroom space, forcing the judge to try Chauvin ahead of three other fired officers charged with aiding and abetting.And because the pandemic all but wiped out the possibility of public seating, the judge is allowing the trial to be broadcast and livestreamed — a rare occurrence in a state that doesn't routinely allow cameras in court.City, county and state officials are preparing for any sort of reaction that trial testimony or a verdict might elicit. Barbed and razor wire and concrete barriers surround the courthouse, and strict security is in place to protect trial proceedings. City and state leaders want to avoid a repeat of last year's rioting that destroyed dozens of businesses and a police station.The JudgeHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill is respected and has a reputation as a no-nonsense, fair judge. He started in the county public defender’s office in 1984 and worked for 10 years as a prosecutor, serving as top advisor to US Sen. Amy Klobuchar when she was the county’s head prosecutor.Cahill has been a judge since 2007 and has been chief judge. He's known for being decisive and direct. He held firm on his decision to allow video cameras at the trial over the state's objections, and to starting the trial in March despite prosecutors' concerns about the pandemic. He also refused to reinstate a third-degree murder charge, sending prosecutors to the Court of Appeals — which ruled Friday that he must reconsider that decision — and denied defense requests to move the trial out of Hennepin County.ProsecutionDays after Floyd's death, Minnesota's governor announced that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead on prosecuting the case. The county prosecutor's office is still part of the case, but the unusual move was a win for local civil rights advocates who said longtime Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman didn't have the trust of the Black community.Ellison, the state's first African American elected attorney general, previously served in Congress and worked as a defense attorney.His team of prosecutors includes Matthew Frank, an experienced attorney in Ellison’s office who recently won a guilty plea in the case of Lois Riess, a Minnesota woman who got life in prison without parole for killing her husband in 2018. Riess became notorious after she fled the state, killed a woman in Florida, and assumed her identity before she was captured.Also on board are: Jerry Blackwell, who last year won a posthumous pardon for a Black man wrongly convicted of rape before the infamous Duluth lynchings of 1920; and Steven Schleicher, a former federal prosecutor who led prosecution of the man who kidnapped and killed Jacob Wetterling in 1989.DefenseChauvin, 44, started working for the Minneapolis Police Department in 2001, making him by far the most experienced of the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest.He was fired soon after bystander video of Floyd's arrest emerged the following day. He was charged days later, and moved to a state prison for security reasons. He posted $1 million bond in October and was allowed to live out of state due to safety concerns.His attorney, Eric Nelson, is among a handful of attorneys in Minnesota who often represent police officers. One of his bigger cases involved Amy Senser, the wife of former Minnesota Vikings tight end Joe Senser, who was convicted in the 2011 hit-and-run death of a Minneapolis chef. Nelson argued that Senser should be sentenced to probation, but a judge gave her 41 months in prison.Nelson also has tried murder cases. He helped win an acquittal for a Minnesota man who was charged with fatally shooting his unarmed neighbor in 2017. He also won an acquittal for a Wisconsin man who testified that he feared for his safety when he fatally stabbed a man who confronted him in 2015.Nelson has not said whether Chauvin will testify during his trial, but many legal observers predict Chauvin will take the stand.George FloydFloyd, 46, moved to Minneapolis from Houston several years before his death in hopes of finding work but had lost his job as a restaurant bouncer due to Covid-19. On May 25, an employee at a Minneapolis grocery store called the police saying Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.Floyd left behind a young daughter, who lives with her mother in Houston. His friend, Christopher Harris, told The Associated Press last year that Floyd “was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning.”The JuryChauvin's fate will be decided by 12 Hennepin County residents, whose names will be kept confidential until further court order. Two alternate jurors will be selected to listen to testimony, but will not be part of deliberations unless needed.Prospective jurors were sent questionnaires to determine how much they have heard about the case and whether they had formed any opinions. Prosecutors can block up to nine potential jurors without giving a reason, while the defense will be allowed up to 15 objections, with no reason given.Legal experts say since pretrial publicity has been so pervasive, both sides will seek jurors who are willing to have open minds.“You don’t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they're not in tune at all with the world,” Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said in a recent interview. “But what you want is jurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior to walking into the courtroom and give both sides a fair hearing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-players-in-trial-of-ex-officer-charged-in-george-floyd-s-death-101615134189420.html
07-03-2021||World||India, China friends, but ‘rights and wrongs’ of border friction clear: Wang Yi||China on Sunday again blamed India for the border friction in eastern Ladakh but couched its anti-India rhetoric by saying New Delhi and Beijing are friends and partners, not rivals.Addressing his annual press conference, state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi first said India and China should not undercut or be suspicious of each other but went on to add that the rights and wrongs of what happened at the border last year were clear, tactfully putting the blame on India for the worst military standoff between the two countries in decades.The Chinese diplomat did acknowledge that it was on both countries to jointly maintain peace and tranquility along the border.“The right and wrongs of what happened in the border area last year are clear, so are the stakes involved. It again proves that initiating confrontation will not solve the problem. Returning to peaceful negotiation is the right way forward,” Wang said during his press interaction with foreign and local journalists on the sidelines of the ongoing session of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC).“China’s position is very clear. We are committed to settling the boundary dispute through dialogue and consultation. At the same time, we are resolved to safeguard our sovereign rights and interests,” he said.India has consistently denied China’s allegation of provoking friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and have said that Chinese border troops were the first to trespass across the disputed boundary, triggering the faceoff and deaths of border troops on both sides.“It falls on both sides to solidify existing consensus, strengthen dialogue and communication, and improve various management mechanisms to jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border area,” Wang added.One of China’s top diplomats, Wang was responding to a question on the way ahead for Sino-India ties in the backdrop of the partial disengagement of border troops from near the Pangong lake.The first part of Wang’s response gave the impression that China had softened its one-sided narrative against India.“The China India relationship is essentially about how the world’s two largest developing countries get along and pursue development and rejuvenation together,” he said, adding that the two countries have “broad common interests and tremendous potential for cooperation”.“On many important issues, our positions are the same or close due to similar national realities. Therefore, China and India are each other’s friends and partners, not threats, or rivals. The two sides need to help each other succeed instead of undercutting each other. We should intensify cooperation instead of harbouring suspicions of each other,” Wang added.Wang reiterated the point he made to external affairs minister, S Jaishankar during a phone conversation last week that the border dispute is not the entirety of Sino-India ties.“The boundary dispute, an issue left from history, is not the whole story of the China-India relationship. It is important that two sides manage disputes properly and at the same time expand and enhance cooperation to create enabling conditions for the settlement of the issue.”New Delhi has made it clear to Beijing – as recently as on Friday -- that the way to improve bilateral ties only lies through peace and tranquility at the border and the road to normalcy lies only through disengagement and de-escalation all along the LAC.During the phone call with Jaishankar, while Wang had suggested the two sides should set aside the border issue, the Indian minister had insisted bilateral ties could be repaired only by completing disengagement at all friction points.For the year ahead, Wang said: “…we hope India will work with China to truly deliver on important common understanding reached by our leaders that both are not threats to each other but opportunities for each other’s development.Together we can bring great benefits for 2.7 billion people in China and India and make great contributions for the advent of the Asian Century.During his lengthy – and choreographed – press conference, Wang answered about 25 questions on topics ranging from China’s ties with the US, Russia and Asean, electoral reforms in Hong Kong and the situation in Myanmar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-friends-but-rights-and-wrongs-of-border-friction-clear-wang-yi-101615133616744.html

That compares with just over 3.4 million distributed so far to member states since the vaccine was approved in January, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The schedule refers to the 160 million doses procured by the EU in November, before a deal last month to buy an additional 150 million shots both this year and next. The EU has been under pressure to speed up a sluggish vaccine roll-out that’s lagged several peers, including the US and the UK.Gergely Gulyas, the cabinet minister to Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary’s government, published the schedule in defense of a decision to opt out of additional purchases.Nationally procured vaccines from China’s Sinopharm and Russia’s Sputnik V will allow Hungary to inoculate all of its population aged over 18 by the third quarter, Gulyas said in the Facebook post. That gives little reason to buy supplies via the EU that would probably only arrive after that time, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-got-a-third-of-moderna-covid-19-shots-so-far-data-show-101615132508894.html
07-03-2021||World||Mexican camp that was symbol of migrant misery empties out under Biden||A sprawling camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, within sight of the Texan border, has since 2019 been one of the most powerful reminders of the human toll of former President Donald Trump's efforts to keep migrants out of the United States.The camp has dwindled to just a few dozen in residents in recent days, after hundreds of asylum seekers living there were finally allowed to cross the border to press their claim to stay in the United States.   President Joe Biden last month rolled back the program - known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) - that had forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico.Biden's wife, Jill, visited the camp during last year's presidential campaign to witness the difficult conditions first hand."If it hadn't been for this camp, I don't think they would have ever ended MPP," said Honduran asylum seeker Oscar Borjas, one of the last remaining residents.Like hundreds of asylum seekers expelled from the United States to this crime-ridden town, Borjas began sleeping near the foot of the international bridge across the Rio Grande out of fear and necessity.But the migrants also intended to make a statement, he said: a visible reminder of the human toll of the MPP program. "We were there so that people would see us; see it wasn't fair what they were doing to us."As of Friday, some 1,127 people in the MPP program across Mexico have been permitted to enter the United States since Biden rescinded the policy last month. More than half of those were from the Matamoros camp, according to the UN refugee agency.Once home to more than 3,000 people, the camp now stands largely deserted, except for the few whose appeals to enter the United States have been denied, Borjas said."I don't know what I'll do now. I can't go back," said Borjas, who said he faces the threat of murder in Honduras for supporting an opposition party."LET'S UNITE"The Trump administration touted the MPP program as part of its successful efforts to reduce immigration and cut down on what it called fraudulent asylum claims.Since 2019, the policy pushed more than 65,000 migrants back into Mexico as their asylum cases wound through US courts. The majority gave up waiting and left Mexico. Thousands more crowded into shelters or apartments, disappearing from sight.But in Matamoros, which had scant resources for migrants, families opted to sleep in the plaza at the foot of the bridge."We said 'Let's unite' and that's how the camp in Matamoros began," said Honduran asylum seeker Josue Cornejo, who was returned to Matamoros along with his wife and their children in August 2019.Parents scavenged cardboard to stop the summer heat radiating off the pavement from burning their children's skin. The men formed a guard watch.Aid workers arrived. So did Matamoros' criminal groups, which doled out beatings and siphoned off donations, migrants say.As the camp population ballooned, the tents sprawled from the plaza to the wooded banks of the Rio Grande, where residents braved contamination and undercurrents to bathe and wash their clothes.The migrants resisted federal government efforts to house them in a makeshift shelter, miles from the border.Life took root in a way migrants say they had never expected, making the lengthy wait in Mexico slightly more bearable.They formed church groups, supply distribution tents and kitchens with handmade earthen ovens and stoves improvised from old washing machines.Nicaraguan asylum seeker Perla Vargas and other migrants launched a tent school that provided music, dance, English and Spanish classes to dozens of children each day, including her two grandchildren.There were quinceaneras, romances, and at least one wedding.Consuelo Tomas, an indigenous Q'anjob'al Guatemalan asylum seeker, gave birth inside the camp and named her newborn Andrea in honor of the child's grandmother, who died years earlier trying to cross the Sonoran desert to reach the United States.Insecurity and hardship reigned.The weather whiplashed between scorching heat and freezing cold. Human rights groups documented kidnappings and rape of asylum seekers in Matamoros. Occasionally, migrants' bodies washed up along the river bank.Some mothers, including Salvadoran asylum seeker Sandra Andrade, sent their children to cross the US border alone illegally out of concern for their safety."It was one of the most difficult decisions I've had to make, but I wanted to protect them," she said.MATAMOROS TO WASHINGTONAt times, the camp served as the launchpad for protests: from a blockade of the international bridge that halted traffic for hours to demonstrations and all-night vigils opposing Trump's re-election.Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, said that MPP program might have succeeded in obscuring the plight of these migrants from the American public if it were not for the Matamoros camp."It was the one place where you couldn't deny that what we were doing was inflicting harm on people," he said.Last month, the Biden administration said it would allow about 25,000 migrants in MPP to enter the United States to pursue their cases. Matamoros camp residents were to be among the first in line, it added.Buoyed by the news, migrants had prepared for their departure in late February: snapping farewell photographs and snipping haircuts for fellow migrants. The sound of bachata music rang out as children hopped about, rehearsing for their final dance recital. Andrade packed up her remaining protest signs and distributed donated pairs of tiny sneakers."It's so the kids can cross into the United States in brand new shoes," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-camp-that-was-symbol-of-migrant-misery-empties-out-under-biden-101615132494873.html
07-03-2021||World||Hong Kong: 4 people fall ill after receiving China's Sinovac Covid vaccine jabs||Four people in Hong Kong fell ill, including two who had to be put in intensive care, after recently receiving their Chinese vaccine Sinovac shots.This means a total of 15 people have sought medical attention after receiving the vaccines over the past week, according to the government. Some 83,400 people had been vaccinated with the mainland-produced jabs as of Saturday, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.The two people, who were sent to intensive care, had underlying diseases and felt severely ill after receiving their Sinovac jabs, the Department of Health said.The Sinovac vaccine, which was produced by Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech, is 50.4 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19 with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, according to the institute. Experts have raised questions about the effectiveness of the vaccine.An 80-year-old man was in critical condition after receiving his vaccine at a centre in Tin Shui Wai last Monday. After feeling unwell, he sought medical treatment at Caritas Medical Centre in Sham Shui Po, where he was transferred to the intensive care unit on Saturday. Another 72-year-old woman with a history of various illnesses, including diabetes, felt discomfort after receiving her shot at a centre in Tseung Kwan O.She skipped two doses of her insulin medication after feeling weak and found her general health worsened on Sunday morning. She was later admitted to the intensive care unit at Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin and was found to have developed serious diabetic problems.Hong Kong launched its vaccination scheme in late February with the Sinovac shots. About 83,400 city residents received their first doses of the vaccine between February 22 and March 6. The city received its first batch of 585,000 BioNTech vaccine on February 27.Yesterday, Hong Kong health authorities have revealed that a chronically ill woman who had received the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine died after suffering a stroke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-4-people-fall-ill-after-receiving-china-s-sinovac-covid-vaccine-jabs-101615132581892.html
07-03-2021||World||US will do what’s necessary to defend itself after attack in Iraq: Defense secretary Lloyd Austin Lloyd Austin||The United States will do what it sees as necessary to defend its interests after a rocket attack last week against Iraq's Ain al-Sada airbase, which hosts American, coalition and Iraqi forces, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday.Speaking on ABC's "This Week" program, Austin said the United States is urging Iraq to quickly investigate the incident at the base located in western Anbar province and determine who was responsible. U.S. officials have said the incident fit the profile of a strike by Iran-backed militia."We'll strike, if that's what we think we need to do, at a time and place of our own choosing. We demand the right to protect our troops," Austin said.Asked if Iran had been given a message that U.S. retaliation would not constitute an escalation, Austin said that Iran is fully capable of assessing the strike and U.S activities."What they should draw from this, again, is that we're going to defend our troops and our response will be thoughtful. It will be appropriate," Austin said.

07-03-2021||World||India, Iran, Russia to be part of new US push to find settlement in Afghanistan||The US plans to convene a meeting with the foreign ministers of India, Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran to forge a common approach on ending the war in Afghanistan while simultaneously taking steps to speed up a settlement with the Taliban.This was conveyed by US secretary of state Antony Blinken in a letter sent to President Ashraf Ghani. The letter marks the first time the new Biden administration has outlined its approach towards Afghanistan as it undertakes a review of the troubled peace process with the Taliban as well as plans to withdraw all American forces from the war-torn country by May 1.Soon after Blinken’s letter was accessed by Afghanistan’s Tolo News on Sunday afternoon, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke over the phone with external affairs minister S Jaishankar to discuss the peace process.“Received a call from US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad @US4AfghanPeace. Discussed latest developments pertaining to peace talks. We will remain in touch,” Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.There was no other official word on the developments from the US and Indian sides.In his letter, Blinken outlined four elements that he said are part of a “high-level diplomatic effort with the parties and with regional countries and the United Nations” to move matters “more fundamentally and quickly toward a settlement and a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”.As a first step, the US intends to “ask the United Nations to convene Foreign Ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India, and the United States to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan”, Blinken wrote.“It is my belief that these countries share an abiding common interest in a stable Afghanistan and must work together if we are to succeed,” he added.There was a perception in New Delhi that Khalilzad’s efforts under the Trump administration accorded greater significance to Pakistan and skipped over many of India’s concerns related to Afghanistan. Some quarters in New Delhi and Kabul even believed Khalilzad didn’t give adequate importance to the Afghan government in his efforts to push forward the peace process after the US and the Taliban signed an agreement at Doha in February 2020.Blinken’s efforts to rope in both India and Iran appear to indicate a desire to balance the process by roping in all states that have influence in Afghanistan.As the second element of the new effort, Blinken wrote he had asked Khalilzad to prepare and share with Ghani and Taliban leaders “written proposals aimed at accelerating discussions on a negotiated settlement and ceasefire”. These proposals will reflect ideas included in a roadmap for the peace process that Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib shared with the US ambassador to Kabul, Ross Wilson.“In sharing these documents, we do not intend to dictate terms to the parties. Rather, the documents will enable [the Afghan government] and the Taliban to move urgently to the tasks of developing a) the foundational principles that will guide Afghanistan's future constitutional and governing arrangements, b) a roadmap to a new, inclusive government; and c) the terms of a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire,” he wrote.The third element will be the US asking the Turkish government to host a senior-level meeting of the Afghan government and the Taliban in the coming weeks to “finalise a peace agreement”. Blinken added, “I urge you or your authoritative designees to join other representatives of the Islamic Republic in this meeting.”The fourth element of the efforts will be aimed at reducing violence. Blinken wrote he shared Ghani’s view that “every effort must be made to reduce the high levels of violence in Afghanistan, which are exacting an unacceptable toll on the Afghan people and deeply undermining efforts to achieve peace”.He added that the US has prepared a “revised proposal for a 90-day Reduction-in-Violence, which is intended to prevent a Spring Offensive by the Taliban and to coincide with our diplomatic efforts to support a political settlement. He added that Khalilzad would share this proposal with Ghani.At the same time, Blinken called for greater unity among Afghan politicians to take forward the process. “Unity and inclusivity on the [Afghan] side are, I believe, essential for the difficult work that lies ahead. As you and your countrymen know all too well, disunity on the part of Afghan leaders proved disastrous in the early 1990s and must not be allowed to sabotage the opportunity before us,” he said.Blinken urged Ghani to build consensus on specific goals and objectives for a negotiation with the Taliban “about governance, power-sharing, and essential supporting principles”.He also said that as the Biden administration’s review continues, the US “has not ruled out any option” and is still “considering the full withdrawal of our forces by May 1st, as we consider other options”.“Even with the continuation of financial assistance from the United States to your forces after an American military withdrawal, I am concerned that the security situation will worsen and that the Taliban could make rapid territorial gains,” he said.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said this appeared to be a clear attempt by the Biden administration to move way from Donald Trump’s legacy on Afghanistan.“Trump was often accused of not involving regional powers such as India and Iran because of his own foreign policy priorities. If there is to be lasting peace in Afghanistan, regional powers have to be brought in, along with a lessening of the focus on Pakistan. I would say this is a more balanced approach,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-iran-russia-to-be-part-of-new-us-push-to-find-settlement-in-afghanistan-101615131002914.html
07-03-2021||World||George Floyd's friends reflect on his striving, at times stumbling life||Travis Cains looks over to the spot where he and George Floyd watched the world go by when they were young.All that's left of the clubhouse across the street from the Cuney Homes projects where they debated sports and hip hop are two battered concrete steps now leading to nowhere. The clubhouse is long gone.It was on those steps that Cains — who considers himself Floyd's older brother and stuck with him through the highs of sports stardom at school to the lows of addiction and incarceration — became convinced that Floyd was destined to make his mark on the world."The whole neighborhood knew he would make history, but we didn't want it to be this way," Cains said. "But we're breathing for him now. Floyd is a martyr for us. He will forever be a part of a movement."Friends and family of Floyd spoke with Reuters in the days before the trial was set to begin on Monday of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. The Minnesota appeals court on Friday ordered the trial judge to reconsider adding a third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, a late development that could delay the start of proceedings.Chauvin, who is white, used his knee to pin Floyd, who was Black, to the ground by his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25 on a street in Minneapolis, where Floyd had moved from Houston. Police had arrested Floyd after a grocery store employee reported he had allegedly used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Lawyers for Chauvin say he followed his police training and contend that the fentanyl, an opioid, Floyd had recently ingested, was the main cause of his death.Floyd's aunt, Angela Harrelson, lives just outside Minneapolis. As a registered nurse she said she sought to help her nephew in his fight to maintain sobriety."He was just excited, he thought Minnesota was such a clean and nice place," said Harrelson. "This whole movement has been an awakening for Black Americans, but it also has been an awakening for white Americans as well, giving them knowledge that racism, systemic racism, does exist."Floyd's cousin Dexter Brown was traveling to Minneapolis for Chauvin's trial."We don’t want to see somebody else’s child, somebody else’s father, somebody else’s cousin get done like this," Brown said.Jonathan Veal, friends with Floyd since age 12, owns a management consulting business in Oklahoma City. He applauded developments such as the "George Floyd Justice in Policing Act" passed last week by the US House of Representatives.But Veal said what he finds more important are changes on the streets, where whites marched alongside Blacks to protest racism during a summer of demonstrations, and where African Americans lined up to vote in November's elections.Racism embedded in American institutions created segregated and impoverished neighborhoods such as Houston’s Third Ward where Floyd and Veal grew up. Systemic racism can only be truly changed, Veal said, when the people who make up those systems evolve.Veal and three other classmates of Floyd created the "88 CHUMP" community organization — 88 was Floyd’s high school football jersey number and CHUMP stands for Communities Helping Underprivileged Minorities Progress — with goals that include getting more people registered to vote.Cains, a retired bail bondsman, says he has devoted his life to fighting for human rights through the George Floyd Foundation.Cains said he hopes anybody, regardless of race, can understand Floyd’s humanity."For the police to do him like that, it just leaves any Black man to wonder: 'Man, does the world hate me that much? Is my skin color that bad, that you can just do us like that?'" Cains said.Floyd "was trying to get his life right," Cains said. "You could hear him telling the cops who killed him that 'I'm not a bad guy!'"Between 1997 and 2005 Floyd was in and out of jail, mostly on theft and drug charges. He pled guilty in 2009 to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon committed in 2007 and was sentenced to five years in prison. He was paroled in early 2013.Patrick Ngwolo, a Houston criminal defense attorney and pastor who met Floyd after he left prison, described Floyd as his "man of peace" in the Third Ward. Ngwolo said he watched a familiar narrative play out after Floyd's killing."By day three after he was murdered, you already saw the debate in the media: 'Was he a good guy? Is he not a good guy?'" Ngwolo said. "That's shifting the narrative from 'these killings are crazy, we have to do something about them.'"Ngwolo believes that Floyd's death is an inflection point for America."We're either going to master this original sin of racism in this country," he said, "or it's going to master us."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-s-friends-reflect-on-his-striving-at-times-stumbling-life-101615130950886.html
07-03-2021||World||UK schools to reopen, backed by frequent Covid-19 testing||British students, backed by a robust coronavirus testing program, are gearing up to return to school Monday after a two-month closure, in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson says is a plan to get the country “moving closer to a sense of normality.”The reopening of schools is the first step in the U.K. government's plan to gradually ease Covid-19 restrictions as the country's vaccination drive gains critical mass, with all restrictions lifted by June.As part of the plan, millions of high school and college students coming back to U.K. classrooms will be tested for the virus for the first few weeks. Authorities want to quickly detect and isolate asymptomatic cases in order to avoid sending entire schools home.“We are being cautious in our approach so that we do not undo the progress we have made so far,” Johnson said in a statement, urging everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.High schools and colleges will be allowed to reopen in phases to allow for three rounds of testing. Students will then get kits so they can test themselves twice more at home. The U.K. government has distributed nearly 57 million rapid “lateral flow” test kits to schools across the country, but there are concerns about the accuracy of the tests, which may result in pupils being forced to self-isolate unnecessarilyA senior public health official, however, said Sunday that the risk of a false positive was very low. More than 5 million rapid tests have been carried out at schools during lockdown, including 1 million last week, the government said.Evidence from testing over the past eight weeks indicates “the risk of false positives is extremely low, less than 1 in 1,000,” Susan Hopkins, the Covid-19 strategic response director for Public Health England, told the BBC. “And a test that returns less than 1 in 1,000 false positives is a very good test."To help children forced into online learning for months to catch up with their education, officials are considering extending school days, shortening the summer holiday or adding an extra term to the year. British students already have a much shorter summer holiday than American students, usually leaving for summer break after mid-July.“We're looking at a whole range of measures,” U.K. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told Sky News. “We’ve got to look at what is going to have the biggest positive impact on children’s lives.”Britain has Europe's deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with nearly 125,000 lives lost so far. Its coronavirus vaccination program has, however, raced ahead of the United States and the European Union to give at least a first dose to nearly 22 million of the country's adults so far.Britain has approved three vaccines for use: those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, and plans to vaccinate all adults by July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-schools-to-reopen-backed-by-frequent-covid-19-testing-101615127576629.html

Protesters are stringing up women's clothing on lines across the streets to utilise a superstition in their favour.In Myanmar, walking beneath wraparound clothes for women, known as longyi, is traditionally considered bad luck for men. In the photographs and videos circulating on social media, police can be seen taking down the lines of clothes before crossing them.A 20-year-old unnamed protester told news agency Reuters that the younger generation doesn't believe it anymore, but the soldiers still do. The protester said this weakness of soldiers might give more time to run if they charge towards demonstrators. Sometimes, protesters use women's undergarments as well to slow them down.“Women’s longyi and undergarments barricades that Myanmar protesters put up as a non-violent defense tool against police & soldiers who mostly and superstitiously believe that their “phoun” (loosely translated as men’s glory or virtue) will be gone,” tweeted a user with photographs of clothesline.Women’s longyi and undergarments barricades that Myanmar protesters put up as a non-violent defense tool against police & soldiers who mostly and superstitiously believe that their “phoun” (loosely translated as men’s glory or virtue) will be gone pic.twitter.com/ByqaVTdfOQEveryone knows junta ppl are extremely superstitious.

Dozens of anti-coup protesters have died during the demonstrations as reports suggest that police and soldiers are shooting to kill. Myanmar has also been witnessing frequent internet shutdowns as the security forces are trying to quell the protests.According to the United Nations, Myanmar’s security forces have killed more than 50 people to clamp down the daily demonstrations and strikes in the Southeast Asian nation since the military coup. An official from Suu Kyi’s party died overnight in police custody, reported Reuters on Sunday.

It marked the fourth-such bomber deployment into the Mideast this year and the second under President Joe Biden.Flight-tracking data showed the two B-52s flew out of Minot Air Base in North Dakota, something Central Command did not mention in its statement on the flights though authorities later published images of the flight crew preparing its departure there.The military did not directly mention Iran in its statement, saying the flight was to “deter aggression and reassure partners and allies of the US military’s commitment to security in the region.”However, such flights had become common in the last months of former President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump’s 2018 decision to unilaterally withdraw from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers sparked a series of escalating incidents in the region.Biden has expressed a desire to return to the deal if Iran honors the deal’s limits on its nuclear program. However, tensions remain high after militias in Iraq — likely backed by Iran — continue to target American interests.Biden last month launched an airstrike just over the border into Syria in retaliation, joining every American president from Ronald Reagan onward who has ordered a bombardment of countries in the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-flies-two-b-52-bombers-over-iran-as-washington-tehran-tensions-rise-101615125829648.html

We should intensify cooperation instead of harbouring suspicion at each other,” he said.Without directly referring to the eastern Ladakh standoff, Wang said, “the right and wrongs at what happened at the border area last year are clear, so are the stakes involved.”“We are committed to settling the boundary dispute through dialogue and consultation. At the same time we are resolved to safeguard our sovereign rights," he said, reiterating China's stance on the border standoff.Wang said it falls on both sides to solidify the existing consensus, strengthen dialogue and communication and improve the various management mechanisms to jointly safeguard the peace and tranquillity in the border areas.On how China looks to move forward its relations with India after the border standoff, Wang said, “in the year ahead we hope India will work with China to truly deliver on the important common understanding reached by our leaders that the two countries are not threats to each other but opportunities for each other's development.”Both sides should consolidate existing consensus, strengthen dialogue and communication, improve the control mechanism and jointly safeguard peace in the border areas, he said, expressing hope that India will meet China halfway in the new year to benefit both peoples.“Together we can bring greater benefits to the 2.7 billion people in China and India, make greater contributions to the advent of the Asian Century,” he said.He said the China-India relationship is essentially about how the world’s two largest countries get along and pursue development and rejuvenation together.“As two ancient civilisations, next door to each other and as two major emerging economies with each over one billion people, we have broad common interests and tremendous potential for cooperation,” he said.At home, both countries face the “historic mission” of bettering lives, accelerating growth, Wang added.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armies erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake area and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.Subsequently, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in the Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in over four decades. Eight months after the confrontation, China admitted that its four soldiers were killed in the fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-says-india-china-should-create-enabling-conditions-to-resolve-border-issues-101615125130821.html

She has been under house arrest at her parent’s home in Tehran since.“The situation of her leaving the country is not clear yet,” lawyer Hodjat Kermani told The Associated Press.Last fall, Iranian state TV abruptly announced a new indictment against Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but the trial was indefinitely adjourned. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported that Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be summoned to court on March 13 over these new charges, which include “spreading propaganda against the system.”Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s government, a charge that she, her supporters and rights groups vigorously deny. She was taken into custody at the airport with her toddler daughter after visiting family on holiday in the capital of Tehran. At the time, she was working for Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news agency.In what the UN has criticized as an “emerging pattern,” Iran has frequently arrested dual citizens in recent years, often using their cases as bargaining chips for money or influence in negotiations with the West, something Tehran denies.The twists and turns of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s detention have played out against a decades-old debt dispute between Britain and Iran. The countries have been negotiating the release of some 400 million pounds ($530 million) held by London, a payment the late Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi made for Chieftain tanks that were never delivered.The shah abandoned the throne in 1979 and the Islamic Revolution installed the clerically overseen system that endures today.Authorities in London and Tehran deny that Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case is linked to the repayment deal. But a prisoner exchange that freed four American citizens in 2016 saw the US pay a similar sum to Iran the same day of their release.Richard Ratcliffe, who for years has campaigned vocally for his wife’s release, has said that Iran was holding Zaghari-Ratcliffe in retaliation for the tank sale dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-british-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-ends-5-year-sentence-in-spy-case-101615122430415.html
07-03-2021||World||Protests erupt across Myanmar; Suu Kyi party official dies in custody||An official from the party of deposed Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi died overnight in police custody, associates said, while security forces cracked down on demonstrators staging some of the most widespread protests against last month's coup.The cause of Khin Maung Latt's death was not known, but Reuters saw a photograph of his body with a bloodstained cloth around the head. Sithu Maung, a member of the dissolved parliament, said in a Facebook post that Khin Maung Latt was his campaign manager and was arrested on Saturday night in the Pabedan district of Yangon.Police in Pabedan declined to comment.Police fired stun grenades and tear gas to break up a sit-in protest by tens of thousands of people in Mandalay, the Myanmar Now media group said. At least 70 people were arrested. Earlier, troops occupied a university in the city after firing rubber bullets at people there, it said. Two people were injured.Police also launched tear gas and stun grenades in the direction of protesters in Yangon and in the town of Lashio in the northern Shan region, videos posted on Facebook showed.A witness said police opened fire to break up a protest in the historic temple town of Bagan, and several residents said in social media posts that live bullets were used.Video posted by Myanmar Now showed soldiers beating up men in Yangon, where at least three protests were held despite overnight raids by security forces on campaign leaders and opposition activists.The United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people to stamp out daily demonstrations and strikes in the Southeast Asian nation since the military overthrew and detained Suu Kyi on Feb. 1."They are killing people just like killing birds and chickens," one protest leader said to the crowd in Dawei, a town in Myanmar's south. "What will we do if we don't revolt against them? We must revolt."Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.The state-run Global New Light Of Myanmar newspaper quoted a police statement as saying security forces were dealing with the protests in accordance with law. It said the forces were using tear gas and stun grenades to break up rioting and protests that were blocking public roads.'Punched and Kicked'Well over 1,700 people had been detained under the military junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group. It did not give a figure for overnight detentions."Detainees were punched and kicked with military boots, beaten with police batons and then dragged into police vehicles," AAPP said in a statement. "Security forces entered residential areas and tried to arrest further protesters, and shot at the homes, destroying many."The killings have drawn anger in the West and been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta.China, Myanmar's giant neighbour to the northeast, said on Sunday it is prepared to engage with "all parties" to ease the crisis and is not taking sides."China is...willing to contact and communicate with all parties on the basis of respecting Myanmar's sovereignty and the will of the people, so as to play a constructive role in easing tensions," State Councillor Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, told a news conference.Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and respect for November's election - which her party won in a landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, hired by Myanmar's junta, told Reuters the generals are keen to leave politics and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.He said Suu Kyi had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.Ben-Menashe said he had also been tasked with seeking Arab support for a plan to repatriate Muslim Rohingya refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from Myanmar in 2017 in an army crackdown after rebel attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-erupt-across-myanmar-suu-kyi-party-official-dies-in-custody-101615122473878.html

He is preparing a video address to mark Monday's International Women's Day and is expected to stress the need for solidarity with those suffering in the pandemic.Draghi, who took office on Feb. 13, has not spoken publicly since Feb. 17 when he addressed parliament.Italy has established a four-tier colour-coded system (white, yellow, orange and red) with curbs calibrated according to the infection levels and revised every week.Italian newspapers reported on Sunday that the government is now considering automatically turning regions into red zones if the threshold of 250 weekly virus cases per 100,000 inhabitants is breached.Possible measures from mid-March include making the entire country a red zone for three or four weeks, La Repubblica said."The second wave never stopped, we’re seeing a very strong pickup due to the variants, which is leading us to take measures that are ever-more restrictive," Health Minister Roberto Speranza told Il Corriere della Sera in an interview on Sunday.Asked whether the government would introduce a national lockdown at least at weekends, and a stricter curfew, he said: "It’s clear that we will monitor the epidemiological situation, adapting the measures in the light of the variants."Italy reported 307 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday and 23,641 new infections. The country has registered 99,578 deaths linked to Covid-19, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-mario-draghi-prepares-a-video-message-as-new-covid-19-cases-spike-101615122561580.html
07-03-2021||World||Saudi-led coalition jets pound Yemen capital after foiling drone attacks: Report||A Saudi-led military coalition conducted air strikes on the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Sunday, a Reuters witness and residents said, after it said it had destroyed drones launched by the Iran-aligned Houthis, including at least five fired towards Saudi Arabia.Saudi state media reported that the Saudi-led coalition said the drones were aimed at "civilian sites", without giving locations. The US consulate in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah issued an advisory, citing reports of suspected attacks and explosions on Sunday near Jeddah and the southern town of Khamis Mushait.In the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sanaa, a Reuters witness and two residents reported several air strikes. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV station said coalition warplanes conducted seven air raids.There was no immediate confirmation from the coalition, which has in the past conducted air strikes on Houthi military sites in Sanaa in response to cross-border attacks.On Saturday, the coalition said it intercepted seven drones over 24 hours launched towards Khamis Mushait and one towards the southern Saudi city of Jazan.The Houthis, who have been battling the coalition since it intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, recently stepped up cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia.Fighting has also intensified on the ground in Yemen in Marib and Taiz regions.The United States and the United Nations have stepped up diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, which is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Last week, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Houthi military leaders in the first punitive action against the group taken by President Joe Biden's administration.The Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.The war, in a military stalemate for years, has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said on Friday that Al-Thawra hospital in Taiz treated 28 people wounded in intense clashes since Wednesday and that the hospital itself was hit by gun fire, injuring three, including a 12-year-old boy.In Marib, the government's last northern stronghold, hundreds of fighters from both sides have been killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudiled-coalition-jets-pound-yemen-capital-after-foiling-drone-attacks-report-101615121955569.html

07-03-2021||World||Covid-19 : Row over NHS pay overshadows Boris Johnson’s push to open schools||A row over a 1% pay rise for National Health Service staff in England has overshadowed Boris Johnson’s push to re-open schools on Monday, with the nurses fundraising for possible strike action against the government.The low-level pay rise sparked fury among health unions after a year in which NHS hospitals have been deluged with huge numbers of critically ill Covid-19 patients. The Royal College of Nurses has started fund-raising for possible strike action after calling for a pay rise of 12.5%. Meanwhile, according to NHS Providers, an organization for the membership for NHS services, the government had already planned for a pay rise of 2.1% in its long-term plan.The opposition Labour Party’s health spokesman, Jon Ashworth, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr program on Sunday the rise -- which is equivalent to 3.5 pounds ($4.80) a week is -- “disgusting” and nurses should get “at least” the planned for 2.1% increase this year.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson appeared on the Sunday morning politics shows to publicize what he called the “real excitement” about English schools returning on Monday for the first time since last year, but instead was forced to repeatedly defend the NHS pay plan. He did acknowledge that the government was considering eventually lengthening the school day and shortening summer holidays to help children recover classroom time lost in the pandemic.“Over the last few years we have seen record increases in terms of the pay going to our nurses and our doctors, quite rightly and we are effectively facing a much more difficult economic time and economic period,” Williamson told Sky News. “I am certain the Royal College of Nursing wouldn’t want to see industrial action but the government is completely committed to our investment in the NHS.”While Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak exempted health-care workers from a public sector pay freeze announced in November, his budget proposal would raise NHS salaries by little more than the current 0.7% inflation rate, and by less than government forecasts for price rises this year. The 1% recommendation was made by the Department of Health and Social Care to the independent panel that reviews salaries.In its submission, published Thursday, the department said anything higher “would require reprioritization” of funding. That review could overrule the government’s proposal and recommend a higher pay increase.Despite Labour’s efforts to highlight nurses’ pay, they may not be cutting through to voters. Johnson’s Conservatives have enjoyed a significant bounce in the polls since Wednesday’s budget despite announcing the biggest tax rises in decades. A survey by YouGov Plc found that the Tories had established a 13-point lead over Labour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-row-over-nhs-pay-overshadows-boris-johnson-s-push-to-open-schools-101615119702275.html

A pulmonary embolism is an acute lung disease caused by a dislodged blood clot."Currently there is no evidence of a causal relationship with the vaccination," BASG said.Austrian newspaper Niederoesterreichische Nachrichten as well as broadcaster ORF and the APA news agency reported that the women were both nurses who worked at the Zwettl clinic.BASG said blood clotting was not among the known side effects of the vaccine. It was pursuing its investigation vigorously to completely rule out any possible link."As a precautionary measure, the remaining stocks of the affected vaccine batch are no longer being issued or vaccinated," it added.An AstraZeneca spokesman said: "There have been no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine," adding that all batches are subject to strict and rigorous quality controls.Trials and real-world experience so far suggests the vaccine is safe and effective and it had been approved for use in well over 50 countries, he said.AstraZeneca also said it was in contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support the investigation.European Union regulators at the end of January approved the product, saying it was effective and safe to use, while the World Health Organization (WHO) in mid-February listed the product for emergency use.Adverse reactions seen in trials were short-lived for the most part and blood clotting issues were not reported.A safety assessment by Germany’s vaccine regulator of more than 360,000 people who received the Astra vaccine in the country between the launch in early February and February 26 concluded that adverse reactions were in line with the safety profile described in clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-suspends-astrazeneca-vaccine-as-precaution-after-woman-s-death-101615120505260.html
07-03-2021||World||Biden to mark 'Bloody Sunday' by signing voting-rights order||President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order directing federal agencies to take a series of steps to promote voting access, a move that comes as congressional Democrats press for a sweeping voting and elections bill to counter efforts to restrict voting access.Biden will announce the order during a recorded address on the 56th commemoration of “Bloody Sunday,” the 1965 incident in which some 600 civil rights activists were viciously beaten by state troopers as they tried to march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.“Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have it counted,” Biden says in a script of his recorded remarks to Sunday’s Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast.Biden’s order includes several modest provisions. It directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information, calls on the heads of federal agencies to come up with plans to give federal employees time off to vote or volunteer as nonpartisan poll workers, and proscribes an overhaul of the government’s Vote.gov website, according to an administration official who briefed reporters.Democrats are attempting to solidify support for House Resolution 1, which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process. It was approved Wednesday on a near party-line vote, 220-210.The voting-rights bill includes provisions to restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.Democrats say the bill will help stifle voter suppression attempts, while Republicans have cast the bill as unwanted federal interference in states’ authority to conduct their own elections.The bill's fate is far from certain in the closely divided Senate. Conservative groups have mounted a $5 million pressure campaign to try persuade moderate Senate Democrats to oppose rule changes needed to pass the measure.With his executive order, Biden is looking to turn the spotlight on the issue and is using the somber commemoration of Bloody Sunday to make the case that much is at stake.Bloody Sunday proved to be a conscious-shocking turning point in the civil rights movement that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Similarly, Biden is hoping the Jan. 6 sacking of the US Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob will prove to be a clarion call for Congress to take action to improve voter protections.“In 2020 — with our very democracy on the line — even in the midst of a pandemic – more Americans voted than ever before,” Biden says in the script. “Yet instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting — we saw an unprecedented insurrection on our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January 6th. A never-before-seen effort to ignore, undermine and undo the will of the people.”Biden's remarks also pay tribute to the late civil-rights giants Rev. C.T. Vivian, Rev. Joseph Lowery and Rep. John Lewis. All played critical roles in the 1965 organizing efforts in Selma and all died in within the last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-mark-bloody-sunday-by-signing-voting-rights-order-101615118256365.html
07-03-2021||World||Bloody Sunday memorial to honour late US civil rights giants||The commemoration of a pivotal moment in the fight for voting rights for African Americans will honor four giants of the civil rights movement who lost their lives in 2020, including the late US Rep. John Lewis.The Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee will mark the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday — the day on March 7, 1965, that civil rights marchers were brutally beaten by law enforcement officers on Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge. Lewis, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, the Rev. C.T. Vivian, and attorney Bruce Boynton are the late civil rights leaders who will be honored on Sunday.Bloody Sunday became a turning point in the fight for voting rights. Footage of the beatings helped galvanize support for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.This year’s commemoration comes as some states seek to roll back expanded early and mail-in voting access and efforts have been unsuccessful to restore a key section of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of discrimination to get federal approval for any changes to voting procedures.“Those of us who are still living, particularly the young, need to take up the challenge and go forward because there is still so much to be done,” said former state Sen. Hank Sanders, one of the founders of the annual celebration.The event typically brings thousands of people to Selma. However, most of the events are being held virtually this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The annual Martin & Coretta King Unity Breakfast will be held as a drive-in event. The Rev. Bernard LaFayette, Martin Luther King III and the founders of the group Black Voters Matter will speak at the breakfast.President Joe Biden will appear via a pre-recorded message in which he will announce an executive order aimed at promoting voting access.US Sen Raphael Warnock of Georgia and US Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina will also deliver remarks by video.Lowery, a charismatic and fiery preacher, is often considered the dean of the civil rights veterans and led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.Vivian began organizing sit-ins against segregation in the 1940s and later joined forces with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, Vivian led dozens of marchers to a courthouse in Selma, confronting the local sheriff on the courthouse steps and telling him the marchers should be allowed to register to vote. The sheriff responded by punching Vivian in the head.Boynton was arrested for entering the white part of a racially segregated bus station in Virginia, launching a chain reaction that ultimately helped to bring about the abolition of Jim Crow laws in the South. Boynton contested his conviction, and his appeal resulted in a US Supreme Court decision that prohibited bus station segregation.His case inspired the Freedom Riders of 1961 — a group of young activists who went on bus rides throughout the South to test whether court-ruled desegregation was actually being enforced. They faced violence from white mobs and arrest by local authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bloody-sunday-memorial-to-honour-late-us-civil-rights-giants-101615118249356.html
07-03-2021||World||Where IS ruled, Pope calls on Christians to forgive, rebuild||Pope Francis called on Iraq’s Christians to forgive the injustices committed against them by Muslim extremists and to rebuild as he visited the wrecked shells of churches and met ecstatic crowds in the community’s historic heartland, which was nearly erased by the Islamic State group’s horrific reign.At each stop in northern Iraq, the remnants of its Christian population turned out, jubilant, ululating, decked out in colorful dress, though heavy security prevented Francis from plunging into the crowd as he would normally do. Nonetheless, they seemed simply overjoyed that they had not been forgotten.It was a sign of the desperation for support among an ancient community uncertain whether it can hold on. Traditionally Christian towns dotting the Nineveh Plains of the north were emptied as Christians — as well as many Muslims — fled the Islamic State group’s onslaught in 2014. Only a few have returned to their homes since the defeat of IS in Iraq declared four years ago, and the rest remain scattered elsewhere in Iraq or abroad.Bells rang out in the town of Qaraqosh as the pope arrived. Speaking to a packed Church of the Immaculate Conception, Francis said “forgiveness” is a key word for Christians.“The road to a full recovery may still be long, but I ask you, please, not to grow discouraged. What is needed is the ability to forgive, but also the courage not to give up.” The Qaraqosh church has been extensively renovated after being vandalized by IS militants during their takeover of the town, making it a symbol of recovery efforts.For the Vatican, the continued presence of Christians in Iraq is vital to keeping alive faith communities that have existed here since the time of Christ. The population has dwindled from around 1.5 million before the 2003 U-led invasion that plunged the country into chaos to just a few hundred thousand today.Francis came to Iraq to encourage them to stay and help rebuild the country and restore what he called its “intricately designed carpet” of faith and ethnic groups.In striking images earlier Sunday, Francis, dressed in white, took to a red carpet stage in a square in the north’s main city, Mosul, surrounded by the grey hollowed-out shells of four churches, nearly destroyed in the war to oust the Islamic State group from the city.It was a scene that would have been unimaginable years earlier. Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, was at the heart of the IS so-called “caliphate” and witnessed the worst of the group’s rule inflicted on Muslims, Christians and others, including beheadings and mass killings.“How cruel it is that this country, the cradle of civilization, should have been afflicted by so barbarous a blow,” Francis said, “with ancient places of worship destroyed and many thousands of people – Muslims, Christians, Yazidis — who were cruelly annihilated by terrorism — and others forcibly displaced or killed.”He deviated from his prepared speech to address the plight of Iraq’s Yazidi minority, which was subjected to mass killings, abductions and sexual slavery at the hands of IS.“Today, however, we reaffirm our conviction that fraternity is more durable than fratricide, that hope is more powerful than hatred, that peace more powerful than war.”The square where he spoke is home to four different churches — Syriac Catholic, Armenian-Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox and Chaldean — each left in ruins.IS inflicted atrocities against all communities, including Muslims, during its three-year rule across much of northern and western Iraq. But the Christian minority was hit especially hard. The militants forced them to choose among conversion, death or the payment of a special tax for non-Muslims. Thousands fled, leaving behind homes and churches that were destroyed or commandeered by the extremists.Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, became IS’s bureaucratic and financial backbone. It was from Mosul’s al-Nuri mosque that then-IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his only public appearance when he gave a Friday sermon calling on all Muslims to follow him as “caliph.”It took a ferocious nine-month battle to finally free the city in July 2017, during which between 9,000 and 11,000 civilians were killed, according to an AP investigation at the time. Al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. raid in Syria in 2019. The war left a swath of destruction across Mosul and the north, and many Iraqis have been left on their own to rebuild amid a years-long financial crisis.The Rev. Raed Kallo, was among the few Christians who returned to Mosul after IS was defeated. “My Muslim brothers received me after the liberation of the city with great hospitality and love,” he said on stage before the pontiff.Before IS, he had a parish of 500 Christian family. Most emigrated abroad, and now only 70 families remain, he said. “But today I live among 2 million Muslims who call me their Father Raed,” he said.Gutayba Aagha, the Muslim head of the Independent Social and Cultural Council for the Families of Mosul, encouraged other Christians to return.“In the name of the council I invite all our Christian brothers to return to this, their city, their properties and their businesses.”Throughout his four-day visit, Francis has delivered a message of interreligious tolerance and fraternity to Muslim leaders, including in an historic meeting Saturday with Iraq’s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.At Qaraqosh, Francis urged its residents to continue to dream, and forgive.“Forgiveness is necessary to remain in love, to remain Christian,” he said.He spoke after a Qaraqosh resident, Doha Sabah Abdallah, told him how her son and two other young people had been killed in a mortar strike Aug. 6, 2014 as IS was nearing the city. Their death was the alarm for the rest of the residents to flee.“The martyrdom of these three angels was a clear warning: if it weren’t for them, the people of Baghdede would have remained, and would have inevitably fallen into the hands of ISIS,” referring to the name of Qaraqosh used by residents. “The deaths of three saved the entire city.”She said now it was for the survivors to “try to forgive the aggressor.”Before leaving Qaraqosh, the pontiff signed a book of honor, writing, “From this Church, destroyed and rebuilt, a symbol of the hope of Qaraqosh and of all Iraq, I ask of God, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, the gift of peace.”Francis wraps up the day with a Mass in the stadium in Irbil, in the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, that is expected to draw as many as 10,000 people. He arrived in Irbil early Sunday, where he was greeted by children in traditional dress and one outfitted as a pope.Public health experts had expressed concerns ahead of the trip that large gatherings could serve as superspreader events for the coronavirus in a country suffering from a worsening outbreak where few have been vaccinated.The Vatican has said it is taking precautions, including holding the Mass outdoors in a stadium that will only be partially filled. But throughout the visit, crowds have gathered in close proximity, with many people not wearing masks. The pope and members of his delegation have been vaccinated but most Iraqis have not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-is-ruled-pope-calls-on-christians-to-forgive-rebuild-101615117295095.html
07-03-2021||World||Oil price to dictate market trend this week, say analysts||Stock markets will focus on long term bond yield trends, crude oil prices and macroeconomic data this week as investors look for cues amid volatility, according to analysts.Besides, investments by FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) as well as domestic investors, movement of rupee against the US dollar and developments on the coronavirus front are likely to be closely watched for cues."The US 10 Year G-Sec yields have surpassed 1.5 per cent on a closing basis which is somewhat negative for global equities. The Dollar Index has also moved up from 90 to 92 level, which is seen as a negative for emerging market currencies and also equities."In the absence of any major domestic trigger Indian markets could take a cue from global developments and the US markets," said Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.The tone of the market seems to be on the downside, for now, Oza added.On March 5, benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled over 440 points and the NSE Nifty cracked below the psychological 15,000-level amid relentless sell-off in global equities as US bond market turmoil continued to rattle investors.The 30-share Sensex plummeted by 440.76 points or 0.87 per cent to close at 50,405.32, continuing its falling trend for the second day on Friday due to concerns over bond yields. The NSE barometer Nifty ended lower by 142.65 points or 0.95 per cent at 14,938.10.Also read: Tax cut should be joint call of Centre, states: Sitharaman on high fuel prices"In the coming week, the market will be mainly focusing on the expectations on whether the Fed, in its upcoming meeting, will maintain its accommodative stance in a rising bond yield market. Additionally, Fed's measures to maintain low-interest rate and high liquidity will also provide relief to the market sentiments," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.On a weekly basis, the Sensex gained 1,305.33 points or 2.65 per cent.Analysts, however, believe the broader market is expected to consolidate or correct further amid a bearish market sentiment."On a weekly basis, despite the market closing in the positive territory the market mood was sluggish. A substantial jump in the long term treasury yields and upward activity in the dollar index towards 92, resulted in weakness across the globe," said Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities.Further, Chouhan noted that "in the coming week, we could see Nifty/ Sensex touching minimum 14,750/ 50,000 or 14,550/ 49,300 levels. On the higher side, 15,150/ 51,200 and 15,280/ 51,600 would be major hurdles. The focus should be on FMCG and auto companies".Moreover, investors will also track domestic macroeconomic triggers -- CPI, WPI and IIP -- for further cues.Investors will also track movements in Brent crude prices as rising oil prices is another risk for Indian markets. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, is currently hovering around USD 69 per barrel.Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market as they offloaded shares worth ₹2,014.16 crore on Friday, according to exchange data.According to Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, "investors in Indian equities will look at the trend of bond yields abroad to assume higher risk and in the meanwhile, the markets could consolidate/ correct".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-price-to-dictate-market-trend-this-week-say-analysts-101615110068255.html
07-03-2021||World||Pope visits Iraq's war-ravaged north, urges minority to stay despite instability||Pope Francis arrived in northern Iraq on Sunday, where he planned to pray in the ruins of churches damaged or destroyed by Islamic State extremists and celebrate an open-air Mass on the last day of the first-ever papal visit to the country.The Vatican hopes that the landmark visit will rally the country’s Christian communities and encourage them to stay despite decades of war and instability. Francis has also delivered a message of interreligious tolerance and fraternity to Muslim leaders, including in an historic meeting Saturday with Iraq’s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.Francis headed to the northern city of Mosul, which was heavily damaged in the war against IS, to pray for Iraq's war victims. In a scene unimaginable just four years ago, he mounted a stage in a city square surrounded by the remnants of four damaged churches belonging to some of Iraq’s myriad Christian rites and denominations. A jubilant crowd welcomed him.Also read: Pope Francis urges Arab Muslims to embrace Iraq's Christian minorityIS overran Mosul in June 2014 and declared a caliphate stretching from territory in northern Syria deep into Iraq’s north and west. It was from Mosul’s al-Nuri mosque that the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his only public appearance when he gave a Friday sermon calling on all Muslims to follow him as “caliph.”Mosul held deep symbolic importance for IS and became the bureaucratic and financial backbone of the group. It was finally liberated in July 2017 after a ferocious nine-month battle. Between 9,000 and 11,000 civilians were killed, according to an AP investigation at the time. Al-Baghdadi was killed in a US raid in Syria in 2019.Francis will later travel by helicopter across the Nineveh plains to the small Christian community of Qaraqosh, where only a fraction of families have returned after fleeing the IS onslaught in 2014. He will hear testimonies from residents and pray in the Church of the Immaculate Conception, which was torched by IS and restored in recent years.He wraps up the day with a Mass in the stadium in Irbil, in the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, that is expected to draw as many as 10,000 people. He arrived in Irbil early Sunday, where he was greeted by children in traditional dress and one outfitted as a pope.Iraq declared victory over IS in 2017, and while the extremist group no longer controls any territory it still carries out sporadic attacks, especially in the north. The country has also seen a series of recent rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias against U.S. targets, violence linked to tensions between Washington and Tehran.The IS group's brutal three-year rule of much of northern and western Iraq, and the gruelling campaign against it, left a vast swathe of destruction. Reconstruction efforts have stalled amid a years-long financial crisis, and entire neighbourhoods remain in ruins. Many Iraqis have had to rebuild their homes at their own expense.Iraq's Christian minority was hit especially hard. The militants forced them to choose among conversion, death or the payment of a special tax for non-Muslims. Thousands fled, leaving behind homes and churches that were destroyed or commandeered by the extremists.Iraq's Christian population, which traces its history back to the earliest days of the faith, had already rapidly dwindled, from around 1.5 million before the 2003 US led invasion that plunged the country into chaos to just a few hundred thousand today.Francis hopes to deliver a message of hope, one underscored by the historic nature of the visit and the fact that it is his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Public health experts had expressed concerns ahead of the trip that large gatherings could serve as super-spreader events for the coronavirus in a country suffering from a worsening outbreak where few have been vaccinated.The Vatican has said it is taking precautions, including holding the Mass outdoors in a stadium that will only be partially filled.

A video was widely shared on social media in which dozens of villagers were seen using shovels, other tools, and even bare hands to dig ores on a mountain to extract gold. Another clip showed locals washing the dirt off the yellow metal and collecting it in another container.“A video from the Republic of the Congo documents the biggest surprise for some villagers in this country, as an entire mountain filled with gold was discovered! They dig the soil inside the gold deposits and take them to their homes in order to wash the dirt& extract the gold,” Ahmad Algohbary, a freelance journalist, wrote on Twitter as he shared a video.A video from the Republic of the Congo documents the biggest surprise for some villagers in this country, as an entire mountain filled with gold was discovered!They dig the soil inside the gold deposits and take them to their homes in order to wash the dirt& extract the gold. pic.twitter.com/i4UMq94cEhThe mines minister of the province, Venant Burume Muhigirwa, later confirmed that the discovery of gold-rich ore in Luhihi led to the gold rush, putting pressure on the small village situated 50 kilometres from the provincial capital Bukavu, according to news agency Reuters. Muhigirwa said that a decree was issued on Monday to suspend all mining activities in and around the village and miners, traders, and members of the armed forces of DRC were asked to leave the mine sites until further notice.The moment of washing the dirt and extracting the gold. #Congo pic.twitter.com/7L1V1Clm30Artisanal gold mining is common across the African nation in which miners use rudimentary tools to extract minerals. Muhigirwa said the temporary suspension of mining activities in the area would allow authorities to identify the artisanal miners to ensure they are properly registered with mining regulators. Last year, a UN Group of Experts said that North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces reported official production of just over 60 kilograms of artisanal gold in 2019, yet exported over 70 kg, suggesting a massive underreporting of production.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/locals-rush-in-with-shovels-after-mountain-made-of-gold-rich-ores-found-in-congo-101615114346459.html
07-03-2021||World||Angela Merkel's bloc slumps in polls on German Covid-19 woes||Support for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc hit a one-year low on Sunday, a key survey showed, hammered by growing anger over a sluggish vaccine rollout and a mask-procurement scandal.Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc fell to 32 percent in a survey carried out by the Kantar institute for Bild newspaper, a two-percent drop on last week that pushes Germany's biggest political force to its lowest level since March 2020."There are many reasons for the decline, and they all have to do with the pandemic," said Bild.The slump is bad news for the conservatives ahead of regional elections in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg on March 14.The two polls are being closely watched as a test of the national mood ahead of a general election on September 26 -- which will be the first in over 15 years not to feature outgoing chancellor Merkel.Merkel's centre-right CDU and their Bavarian CSU sister party hit a popularity peak of nearly 40 percent last spring, when Germany won plaudits at home and abroad for successfully suppressing the first Covid-19 wave.But Europe's top economy was hit hard by a second wave at the end of 2020 and Merkel's coalition government has increasingly found itself in the firing line.Despite months of painful shutdowns, the country's infection numbers have stopped falling in recent days.The slow pace of Germany's vaccination campaign, snarled by distribution issues and red tape, as well as a delayed start to mass rapid coronavirus testing have further eroded confidence in the government's crisis management.Adding to Merkel's woes is a growing scandal linked to the procurement of face masks early on in the pandemic.A CSU lawmaker, Georg Nuesslein, was last month placed under investigation for bribery following accusations that he accepted some 600,000 euros to lobby for a mask supplier.A similar controversy has embroiled CDU lawmaker Nicolas Loebel whose company took a 250,000 commission for acting as an intermediary in mask contracts. Loebel announced on Sunday that he was bowing out of politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-s-bloc-slumps-in-polls-on-german-covid-19-woes-101615114533396.html
07-03-2021||World||Iran ready to take steps when US lifts sanctions, says Prez Rouhani||Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday his country was prepared to take steps to live up to measures in the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as soon as the United States lifts economic sanctions on Iran.In a meeting with Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, Rouhani said: “Iran is ready to immediately take compensatory measures based on the nuclear deal and fulfill its commitments just after the U.S. illegal sanctions are lifted and it abandons its policy of threats and pressure.”Rouhani criticized the European signatories of the historic nuclear deal for what he said was their inaction on their commitments to the agreement. He said Iran is the only country that kept its side of the bargain.Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Iranian nuclear accord, in which Tehran had agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. When the U.S. then reimposed some sanctions and added others, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal’s limits on its nuclear development.The Republic of Ireland has the role of facilitator in the implementation of the nuclear deal.Coveney said the withdrawal of former President Donald Trump was a mistake and noted that the new U.S. administration is determined to return to the deal.In December, Iran’s parliament approved a bill that calls for the suspension of part of U.N. inspections of its nuclear facilities if European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal do not provide relief from oil and banking sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-ready-to-take-steps-when-us-lifts-sanctions-says-prez-rouhani-101615114271291.html

The move comes after months of government-imposed shutdowns.The Israeli government approved the easing of limitations Saturday night, including the reopening of the main international airport to a limited number of incoming passengers each day.Most large public activities, including dining at restaurants, are available to people vaccinated against the coronavirus. Israel has sped ahead with its immunization campaign. Over 52% of its population has received one dose and almost 40% have had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, one of the highest rates in the world.Israel has confirmed at least 799,000 cases since the start of the pandemic, including 5,856 deaths, according to the Health Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-in-final-phase-of-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown-101615113069708.html
07-03-2021||World||US must work with allies to counter Beijing's military threat: Analysts||The United States must work with allies to ensure it's capable of meeting the challenges and threats posed by China's military and defence programs in wake of Beijing's increased defence spending, according to analysts.Larry Wortzel, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, as quoted by South China Morning Post (SCMP), "The US cannot afford to take its focus off maintaining parity or a lead on China... The US must work with allies to ensure they are capable of meeting the challenges and potential threats posed by China's military and defence programmes."Other analysts have said China's growing capabilities should serve as a catalyst for the United States putting its affairs in order."Instead of fixating on Beijing, or worse, emulating China's top-down, inefficient, state-driven approach to R&D, the US government can use this announcement [of China's military spending plans] as a further nudge to get our own innovation house in order," said Anja Manuel, a former diplomat and partner at Rice, Hadley, Gates & Manuel, a strategic consulting firm."We could also give smart tax credits to the most important technologies," she said and added, "Currently I think you can get roughly the same R&D tax credit for developing a new craft beer and a new microchip."Another expert said that China's increase in military spending should not just be a concern for countries in the US but countries in the Indo-Pacific region as well."China's increased military spending, and related science and technology spending increases, should be taken seriously by policymakers in Washington, as well as by policymakers in Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other countries in the Indo-Pacific," said Rockford Weitz, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and director of the school's maritime studies programme, according to SCMP."The US and its allies in the Indo-Pacific will need to keep pace with those investments," Weitz said.SCMP further reported that a top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee called on the US to step up its own spending in response. Even as the Pentagon has seen a reduction of US$400 billion in "buying power" since 2011, the PLA added more than USD 200 billion, Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said."This kind of sustained investment has helped China jump ahead of us in key technologies," he said. "If America wants to stand up to China, it's going to take not just working with our allies and partners, but the real investment of our own - into innovative capabilities and the forward posture that will send a strong message of deterrence."Wortzel said some spending this year was likely aimed at mitigating the effects of Trump administration restrictions on exports to China and the crackdown on Chinese military students attending US universities."That means that the PLA and defence industries cannot get the technologies they relied on from intellectual property theft or espionage," he said. "The Biden administration will probably not lift those restrictions."According to the news outlet, The State Department confirmed the new administration's concern about US technology being diverted to the PLA."We have to play a better defense, which must include making sure that American technologies are not facilitating China's military buildup or human rights abuses," a representative of the department said."The rapid development and operational focus of China's military constitutes a significant and long-term security threat to the United States and to our allies and partners," the representative added.In January, China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, passed the coastguard law that empowers the coastguard to use "all necessary means" to deter threats posed by foreign vessels in waters "under China's jurisdiction".It allows the coastguards to launch pre-emptive strikes without prior warning if commanders deem it necessary.Under the new law, coastguard personnel can demolish structures built or installed by other countries in Chinese-claimed waters and board and inspect foreign ships in the area.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-must-work-with-allies-to-counter-beijing-s-military-threat-analysts-101615112897922.html
07-03-2021||World||Trump wants top Republican fundraising organizations to stop using his likeness||Former US President Donald Trump is pressing the Republican Party organs to stop using his name and likeness for fundraising and merchandise sales.According to The Hill, two sources confirmed that lawyers for Trump sent cease-and-desist letters on Friday to the Republican National Committee (RNC), the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).The three groups are the largest fundraising bodies for the Republican Party."President Trump remains committed to the Republican Party and electing America First conservatives, but that doesn't give anyone - friend or foe - permission to use his likeness without explicit approval," a Trump adviser told Politico, which was the first to report on the letters, as reported by The Hill.The move came the same day the RNC sent two emails to supporters looking for donations in the form of a thank-you card to Trump."President Trump will ALWAYS stand up for the American People, and I just thought of the perfect way for you to show that you support him!" one email reads, as reported by the news outlet. "As one of President Trump's MOST LOYAL supporters, I think that YOU, deserve the great honor of adding your name to the Official Trump 'Thank You' Card."The letter from the former President's lawyers appears to be part of the former president's efforts to solidify his standing as a top "kingmaker" in the GOP (another name for the Republican Party).Trump has already forecasted that he will be heavily involved in the 2022 midterms while he mulls making a third presidential bid in 2024, and his endorsement is expected to be highly sought after by most Republicans.He has so far most backed incumbents in their reelection bids, though he has warned sitting lawmakers he is ready to throw his weight behind primary challengers running against those he deems insufficiently loyal."Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First. We want brilliant, strong, thoughtful, and compassionate leadership," Trump said in a statement last month.So far, he's endorsed former White House aide Max Miller, who is challenging Representative Anthony Gonzalez Gonzalez was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former President over his role in inciting the deadly January 6 riot on Capitol Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wants-top-republican-fundraising-organizations-to-stop-using-his-likeness-101615111411227.html
07-03-2021||World||Italy mulls tighter restrictions at least on weekends to check virus spread||The government of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi is considering tighter curbs, including making the entire country a high-risk “red” zone at least during weekends, to counter a surge in the coronavirus pandemic.“The second wave never stopped, we’re seeing a very strong pickup due to the variants, which is leading us to take measures that are ever-more restrictive,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza told newspaper Corriere della Sera.Speranza did not rule out turning the whole of Italy into a red zone at least at weekends, and a stricter curfew. “It’s clear that we will monitor the epidemiological situation, adapting the measures in the light of the variants,” he said.Italy has a three-tier system in place that classifies regions by low, medium and high-risk based on the numbers of cases. The system involves closures of bars and restaurants, and strict limits on people’s movements barring them from leaving their city or town. Several regions have already closed schools with the variants spreading faster among young people.Among measures being considered by the government and a panel of medical and science experts are automatically turning regions into red zones if the threshold of 250 weekly virus cases per 100,000 inhabitants is breached, and closing shopping malls during the week, Italian newspapers reported on Sunday.Possible measures from mid-March include making the entire country a red zone for three or four weeks, La Repubblica said.Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank, has made the vaccination effort a priority for his new administration both to slow contagion and restart an economy that contracted 8.9% last year.The government is working on prioritizing first shots instead of holding back doses for a second inoculation, as well as recruiting the armed forces, civil protection volunteers and family doctors to help eradicate differences between regions in the pace of vaccination.The UK strain of Covid-19 is now dominant in the country and cases are rising again, touching two-month highs. Italy reported 23,641 new virus cases on Saturday, and the country has so far administered 5.29 million vaccine doses, with 2.7% of the population fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-mulls-tighter-restrictions-at-least-on-weekends-to-check-virus-spread-101615110579013.html
07-03-2021||World||China willing to engage with all parties to ease Myanmar situation, says top diplomat||China is willing to engage with "all parties" to ease the crisis in neighbouring Myanmar and is not taking sides, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said on Sunday.Beijing has said the situation in Myanmar, where the military seized power last month, was "absolutely not what China wants to see" and has dismissed social media rumours of Chinese involvement in the coup as nonsense."China is ... willing to contact and communicate with all parties on the basis of respecting Myanmar's sovereignty and the will of the people, so as to play a constructive role in easing tensions," Wang told a news conference on the sidelines of China's annual gathering of parliament.While Western countries have strongly condemned the Feb. 1 coup, China has been more cautious, emphasising the importance of stability.China nonetheless agreed to a United Nations Security Council statement that called for the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other detainees and voiced concern over the state of emergency."China has long-term friendly exchanges with all parties and factions in Myanmar, including the National League for Democracy (NLD), and friendship with China has always been the consensus of all sectors in Myanmar," Wang said.The NLD is Suu Kyi's party. Its landslide November victory in national elections has been ignored by the junta."No matter how the situation in Myanmar changes, China's determination to promote China-Myanmar relations will not waver, and China's direction of promoting China-Myanmar friendly cooperation will not change," Wang said.On Saturday, an Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar's junta told Reuters that the generals are keen to leave politics after their coup and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.Some of the protests against the coup, which have drawn hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, have taken place outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon, with protesters accusing Beijing of supporting the junta.Beijing has said it was not informed in advance of the coup.China has traditionally been viewed with suspicion in Myanmar, where it has significant economic and strategic interests and has often backed Myanmar's position against Western criticism.

07-03-2021||World||Thousands of protesters on Myanmar streets after night raids by security forces||Tens of thousands of people came out in Myanmar on Sunday in one of the biggest days of protest against last month's coup despite overnight raids by security forces in the main city Yangon on campaign leaders and opposition activists.Police fired tear gas and stun grenades in Lashio town in the country's northern Shan region, according to live video posted on Facebook. A witness said police opened fire to break up a protest in the historic temple town of Bagan but it was not clear if they were using rubber bullets or live ammunition.There were no immediate reports of casualties. Protests in half a dozen other cities were peaceful.The biggest turnout was in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay, where activists staged a sit-in protest after two minutes of silence in honour of people killed by police and the army, video showed.The United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people to stamp out the daily demonstrations and strikes in the Southeast Asian nation since the military overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1."They are killing people just like killing birds and chickens," one protest leader said to the crowd in Dawei, in the country's south. "What will we do if we don't revolt against them? We must revolt."Also read: ‘Scores from Myanmar trying to flee to India’Protests were also held in at least three places in Yangon, where residents said soldiers and police moved into several districts overnight, firing shots. They arrested at least three in Kyauktada Township, residents there said. They did not know the reason for the arrests."They are asking to take out my father and brother. Is no one going to help us? Don't you even touch my father and brother. Take us too if you want to take them," one woman screamed as two of them, an actor and his son, were led off.Soldiers also came looking for a lawyer who worked for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy but were unable to find him, a member of the now dissolved parliament, Sithu Maung, said in a Facebook post.Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment."PUNCHED AND KICKED"Well over 1,700 people have been detained under the junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group. It did not give a figure for overnight detentions."Detainees were punched and kicked with military boots, beaten with police batons and then dragged into police vehicles," AAPP said in a statement. "Security forces entered residential areas and tried to arrest further protesters, and shot at the homes, destroying many."Myanmar authorities said on Saturday they had exhumed the body of 19-year-old Kyal Sin, who has become an icon of the protest movement after she was shot dead in Mandalay on Wednesday wearing a T-shirt that read "Everything will be OK".State-run MRTV said a surgical investigation showed she could not have been killed by police because the wrong sort of projectile was found in her head and she had been shot from behind, whereas police were in front.Photographs on the day showed her head turned away from security forces moments before she was killed. Opponents of the coup accused authorities of an attempted cover-up.The killings have drawn anger in the West and have been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta. China, meanwhile, has said the priority should be stability and that other countries should not interfere.Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and the respect of November's election - which her party won in landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, hired by Myanmar's junta, told Reuters the generals are keen to leave politics and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.He said Suu Kyi had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.Ben-Menashe said he had also been tasked with seeking Arab support for a plan to repatriate Rohingya refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from Myanmar in 2017 in an army crackdown after rebel attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-protesters-on-myanmar-streets-after-night-raids-by-security-forces-101615094504321.html
07-03-2021||World||Sri Lankan Catholics mark 'Black Sunday' remembering victims of 2019 Easter bombings||COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankan Roman Catholics attended Mass dressed in black on Sunday, with prayers and protests calling for justice for those killed in coordinated suicide bomb attacks on Easter Sunday two years ago.Church bells tolled and prayers were chanted at 8:45 a.m., the time when bombs were detonated almost simultaneously at two Roman Catholic churches and a Protestant church during Easter services on April 21, 2019. Bombs were also set off at three top hotels targeting locals and foreigners who were eating breakfast.More than 260 people, including 171 from the two Catholic churches, were killed in the attacks, which were blamed on two local Islamic extremist groups that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.A presidential inquiry commission has handed its final report to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has shared parts of it with Catholic and Buddhist religious leaders. The report has also been sent to the attorney general for legal action.However, the archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, said the report had concentrated more on the failures of the then-government in preventing the attacks despite early warnings, rather than finding out the handlers of the groups accused of carrying out the bombings.“No one who wants to promote hatred and religious strife will receive our support. We believe there should be unity and brotherhood among different ethnic and religious groups all over the world," Ranjith said Sunday.“Today Holy Father Pope Francis has visited Iraq and has had a discussion with the Shia leaders (in Iran). It shows religious leaders in the world think about unity and brotherhood, not about creating strife. Therefore I request anyone inclined to create conflict on account of religion to give up that idea,” he said.At St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, a predominantly Catholic area north of Colombo where 115 people were killed in the Easter attacks, parishioners attended Mass on Sunday dressed in black and held placards outside the church in a silent “Black Sunday” protest.“The main purpose of this is to show the people and our rulers that justice has not happened for the victims of the Easter attacks," said Auxiliary Bishop the Rev. Maxwell Silva, who celebrated Mass at the church.“We believe the commission report is not genuine and it did not do any justice to those who suffered," said Manilal Ranasinghe, who attended Mass at St. Mary's Church in Dehiwala, south of Colombo.Political infighting between the then-president and prime minister resulting in a communications breakdown and lapse of security coordination was said to have enabled the attacks despite foreign intelligence warnings.Rajapaksa told a public gathering Saturday that the report blamed the government at the time for letting its guard down on national security, and that his government will punish those responsible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lankan-catholics-mark-black-sunday-remembering-victims-of-2019-easter-bombings-101615107550392.html

London ultimately agreed to leave the British-ruled province aligned to the EU's single market for goods to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, fearing it could be detrimental to the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of conflict in the province.This has required checks on some items arriving in Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the United Kingdom, which some businesses say has made it difficult to bring in supplies. To address that issue, the British government extended the grace period for some checks until Oct. 1.The EU disputes that the grace period extension was in line with the agreement, saying London should honour what it signed up to. It has promised to launch legal action, or a so-called "infringement procedure" against Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shake-off-any-remaining-ill-will-britain-tells-eu-over-post-brexit-trade-101615107753448.html

In a report, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said Russian warships in the Mediterranean had fired three missiles that struck primitive oil refineries and tanker trucks in the region.It said more than 180 trucks and tankers were burned in the massive blaze, and at least four people killed and 24 wounded.Satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. analyzed by The Associated Press on Sunday showed what appeared to be the aftermath of a large fire that tore through an area near Jarablus between Friday and Saturday morning.Past satellite photos of the site, some 75 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of the Syrian city of Aleppo, showed hundreds of tanker trucks gathered in the area.An image from Saturday showed char marks across the entire area where the trucks once were. NASA’s fire satellite monitoring, which watches for flashes associated with blazes or explosions, showed fires at the site in the early morning hours of Saturday.The reports of missiles fired from a Russian warship — a rare occurrence — could not be independently verified and Russia, which is a main supporter of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country’s 10-year civil war, has not commented on the accusations.Turkey’s state-owned Anadolu news agency reported they were ballistic missiles, but said it was not clear who carried out the attacks.Turkey and allied Syrian opposition fighters control large parts of northern Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-photos-show-aftermath-of-strike-in-northern-syria-101615107502344.html

The country is one of the world’s biggest drug-makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring coronavirus vaccines.Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in Houston during a webinar this week said that the two mRNA vaccines may not impact the world's low and middle income countries, but India’s vaccines, made in collaboration with universities across the world such as BCM and Oxford University, have “rescued the world” and its contributions must not to be underestimated.During the webinar, “Covid-19: Vaccination and Potential Return to Normalcy - If and When”, Dr Hotez, an internationally-recognised physician-scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine development, said that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is "India's gift' to the world in combating the virus.India’s drugs regulator gave emergency use authorisation to Covishield, produced by Pune-based Serum Institute of India after securing licence from British pharma company AstraZeneca, and Covaxin, indigenously developed jointly by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research scientists.The webinar was organised by Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston (IACCGH).“This is something very special and I see it myself because I'm on weekly teleconferences with our colleagues in India, you make a recommendation, and within days it's done and not only done, but it's done well and with incredible rigor and thought and creativity," Dr Hotez said, stressing that he felt compelled to make this statement because "India's huge efforts in combating global pandemic is a story that's not really getting out in the world."Dr Hotez, considered as the authority on vaccinations, is working on an affordable coronavirus vaccine in collaboration with Indian pharmaceutical companies.There is increasing evidence that vaccines not only “interrupt symptomatic illness and keep you out of the hospital” but halts asymptomatic transmission as well.However, the troubling news is that the vaccines work well against the UK B.1.1.7 variant, which is now accelerating across the US, but doesn’t work quite as well against the variant coming out of South Africa.It is likely that all the vaccines will require a booster for two reasons: the durability of protection for the vaccines is unknown and to create an added immune response that's better tailored towards the South African variant.Consul General of India in Houston, Aseem Mahajan, along with a distinguished panel of doctors participated in this webinar, that tracked the possibilities of a return to some semblance of normality due to the accelerated roll out of vaccines across the country.Appreciating Dr. Hotez for commending India’s efforts in getting vaccines to the world, Consul General Mahajan, said, “in keeping with “our tradition of sharing with the world,” India has exported vaccines to many countries across the world.India has provided 56 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccines under grants assistance to a number of countries. The vaccines were sent to Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles.There has also been a boost in the collaborative medical partnerships emerging between the US and India during this pandemic. In addition, India is one of the fourth largest destinations in Asia for medical devices manufacturing and many US companies have expressed interest in collaborating on this front," Mahajan said.IACCGH Founding Secretary/Executive Director Jagdip Ahluwalia said that “India's response to the Covid crisis, as acknowledged by Dr Hotez, falls in line with Chamber’s vision. Since its inception, 21 years ago, that India would be a future global player in key areas like technology, medicine, manufacturing and international trade. This belief has been proved time and again particularly in the last decade." Chamber President Tarush Anand expressed pride that India has risen to this global challenge by leveraging the brilliance of its scientific community and extensive manufacturing capabilities in the most efficient manner to help the world recover from a deadly pandemic.Describing vaccines as “one of the highest expressions of science in pursuit of humanitarian goals,” Chief Radiation Oncology Officer and moderator Dr Vivek Kavadi noted that over 28 million people had contracted the virus in the US and more than half a million Americans had tragically died. Lives and businesses had been upended but the breakthrough on the vaccine front has been one reason for cautious optimism.More than 73 million vaccine doses have been administered to date, 15 per cent of the population has received 1 dose while 7 per cent have received both doses, Dr Kavadi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-rollout-india-s-gift-to-world-in-combating-pandemic-scientist-101615107284140.html
07-03-2021||World||South Korea, US to start scaled-back combined exercise this week||South Korea and the United States will stage a major springtime combined military exercise starting this week in a scaled-back manner amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said on Sunday.According to Yonhap News Agency, whether to hold the regular exercise has drawn attention as the unification ministry and some civic groups have called for its adjustment to help move forward the stalled inter-Korean ties. North Korea has long demanded a halt to such joint manoeuvres."South Korea and the U.S. decided to conduct the springtime combined exercise from March 8 for nine days, after comprehensively taking into consideration the Covid-19 situation, the maintenance of the combat readiness posture, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of peace," the JCS said in a statement as quoted by Yonhap.The statement added that the computer-simulated command post exercise (CPX) will not include outdoor drills, as such manoeuvres have been carried out throughout the year, and the size of troops and equipment to be involved will be "minimized" due to the pandemic.The upcoming exercise will also include a "rehearsal for theatre operations under the envisioned future Combined Forces Command (CFC)" to prepare for a planned Full Operational Capability (FOC) test, though it will focus mainly on ensuring their combined readiness posture, the news outlet further reported.The FOC test is a crucial step to check if South Korea is on course to meet conditions required for retaking the wartime operational control (OPCON) of its forces from Washington.Seoul hopes to take back the wartime OPCON within the term of the current administration that ends in May 2022 and has called for the test to be a key feature of the upcoming exercise.But the US military reportedly voiced opposition, as troops and military equipment necessary for the test are not able to come to South Korea due to the virus situation, the agency reported.The test was supposed to be held last year, but the two sides were not able to do so, as they were forced to cancel their springtime exercise and hold the summertime one in an adjusted manner."The two sides have had close consultations on the matter and agreed to carry out the rehearsal this time, albeit limitedly, to make progress in the transition process," a defense ministry official said, as quoted by Yonhap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-us-to-start-scaled-back-combined-exercise-this-week-101615106389134.html
07-03-2021||World||Hope US will remove 'unreasonable' restrictions on cooperation, says China||The Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Sunday that Beijing is willing to communicate with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and hopes Washington will remove all "unreasonable" restrictions on cooperation as soon as possible.Last week US President Joe Biden singled out a "growing rivalry with China" as a key challenge facing the United States, with his top diplomat describing the Asian country as "the biggest geopolitical test" of this century.Questioned about recent US-China frictions over Taiwan, Xinjiang and the South China Sea during his annual news conference, Wang said that Beijing "will never accept baseless accusations and smears", and said the United States had used democracy and human rights as a basis for arbitrarily interfering with other countries' affairs."The US should realise this as soon as possible, otherwise the world will continue to experience instability," he said.Wang added that differences between China and the United States must be managed carefully and that the two sides must advocate healthy competition not zero-sum finger-pointing.The United States and China are at odds over influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Beijing's economic practices, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights in China's Xinjiang region.The Biden administration has indicated it will broadly continue a tough approach to China taken by former President Donald Trump, but do so in coordination will allies.During Trump's administration, the United States levied a series of sanctions against China and its officials over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Beijing's economic policies, which have not been lifted under the new administration.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he agrees with his predecessor Mike Pompeo's determination that genocide against Muslims is underway in Xinjiang.Activists and UN experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in Chinese camps. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.During Wang's Sunday news conference, the diplomat also spoke broadly on accusations over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, saying that some Western politicians chose to believe lies about the region.Biden wants to signal a break with Trump's "America First" approach by re-engaging with allies and focussing on multilateral diplomacy, while also recognising the world has changed since he served in the Obama administration that preceded Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-us-will-remove-unreasonable-restrictions-on-cooperation-says-china-101615106332842.html
07-03-2021||World||Russia scores points with vaccine diplomacy, but snags arise||Russia's boast in August that it was the first country to authorize a coronavirus vaccine led to skepticism at the time because of its insufficient testing. Six months later, as demand for the Sputnik V vaccine grows, experts are raising questions again — this time, over whether Moscow can keep up with all the orders from the countries that want it.Slovakia got 200,000 doses on March 1, even though the European Medicines Agency, the European Union's pharmaceutical regulator, only began reviewing its use on Thursday in an expedited process. The president of the hard-hit Czech Republic said he wrote directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin to get a supply. Millions of doses are expected by countries in Latin America, Africa, the former Soviet Union and the Middle East in a wave of Russian vaccine diplomacy.“Sputnik V continues to confidently conquer Europe,” anchor Olga Skabeyeva declared on the Russia-1 state TV channel.Dmitry Kiselev, the network's top pro-Kremlin anchor, heaped on the hyperbole last month, blustering: “The Russian coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, is the best in the world.”State TV channels have covered vaccine exports extensively, citing praise from abroad for Russia and running segments about the difficulties countries are having with Western vaccines.The early criticism of Sputnik V has been blunted by a report in the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet that said large-scale testing showed it to be safe, with an efficacy rate of 91% against the virus.That could help revamp Russia's image to one of a scientific, technological and benevolent power, especially as other countries encounter shortages of Covid-19 vaccines because richer nations are scooping up the Western-made versions or manufacturers struggle with limited production capacity.“The fact that Russia is among five countries that were able to quickly develop a vaccine … allows Moscow to present itself as a high-tech power of knowledge rather than a petrol pump in decline,” said foreign affairs analyst Vladimir Frolov.Some experts say boosting the use of vaccines from China and Russia — which have not been as popular as those from the West — could offer a quicker way to increase the global supply. Others note that Russia wants to score geopolitical points.“Putin is using (the vaccine) to bolster a very tarnished image of Russia’s scientific and technological prowess,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “He’s using it for geostrategic purposes in areas where Russia would like to have spheres of influence.”Whether Russia can deliver is another question. China has supplied millions of doses to other countries, but the output of Sputnik V appears for now to be far lower than the demand.“They succeeded beyond their wildest dreams in terms of this vaccine actually being a viable, marketable product," said Judy Twigg, a political science professor specializing in global health at Virginia Commonwealth University. "They’ve made all of these explicit and implicit promises to people inside and outside Russia about access to this product that now is unexpectedly great. And now they’re stuck trying, scrambling, trying to figure out how to deliver on all those promises.”Russia also must take care of its own. Authorities have announced plans to vaccinate 60% of adults, or roughly 68 million people, by the end of June.The domestic rollout in Russia has been slow, compared with other nations, with about 4 million people, or less than 3% of the population, vaccinated as of late February. Some of that could also be due to widespread reluctance among Russians to trust vaccines.The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which bankrolled and markets the vaccine abroad, has not responded to a request for comment on how many doses are going to other countries. It said earlier that it has received requests for 2.4 billion doses from over 50 nations.Airfinity, a London-based science analytics company, estimates that Russia agreed to supply about 392 million doses abroad, and there are talks with countries for at least another 356 million.Judging by production and exports so far, “Russia is very far from being able to deliver this,” said Airfinity CEO and founder Rasmus Hansen.Russia manufactured just over 2 million doses last year amid reports of local producers having problems with buying equipment and making the second component of the two-shot vaccine.Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Feb. 20 that over 10 million doses of Sputnik V have been produced.Sputnik V is a viral vector vaccine, which uses a harmless virus that carries genetic material to stimulate the immune system. Producing it is a complicated process, said Elena Subbotina, a consultant with the pharma consultancy CBPartners’ Central and Eastern Europe Team. Producers can’t guarantee stable output because working with biological ingredients involves a lot of variability in terms of the quality of the finished product.Some countries that have been offered large batches of Sputnik V have yet to approve it for use.In India, which has been pledged 125 million doses, the vaccine is undergoing studies to determine if it produces a comparable immune response. Brazil’s health ministry said it is negotiating to purchase 10 million doses, but the nation’s regulatory agency has yet to authorize its use. Nepal, which has been offered 25 million doses, also hasn’t given its approval.Other countries have had delays in receiving Sputnik V shipments.Argentina got nearly 2.5 million doses by March 1, even though at one point the government was expecting 5 million in January and over 14 million more in February. Officials in Hungary, who agreed to buy 2 million doses over three months, said Jan. 22 they were expecting 600,000 doses in the first 30 days, but got only 325,600 by early March. Mexico signed a deal for 24 million doses and was hoping to receive 400,000 in February but got only 200,000.The Russian Direct Investment Fund has agreements with manufacturers in countries including Brazil, South Korea and India to boost production, but there are few indications that manufacturers abroad have made any large amounts of the vaccine so far.The Brazilian company Uniao Quimica is in the pilot testing phase, the results of which will be shared with Russia before the company can produce it for sale. Indian drugmaker Hetero Biopharma, with a deal to make 100 million doses, was to begin production at the start of 2021, but it isn’t clear if it has actually started.South Korean company GL Rapha, which expects to make 150 million doses this year, will be manufacturing finished products by sometime in March, said company official Kim Gi-young.Russia so far hasn't faced any criticism for delaying supplies of Sputnik V to other countries, with foreign officials optimistic about the deals.Hungary is still awaiting large shipments, but expressed optimism about receiving them.“The Russian side, with minimal delay, will meet the 600,000 doses agreed to in the first phase, and then the additional 1.4 million doses,” Hungary's State Secretary Tamas Menczer said last month. Prime Minister Viktor Orban added Friday: “The Russians are pretty much keeping their promises.”Promising more than can be delivered appears to be a universal problem with coronavirus vaccines, and it is a real risk for Russia as well, said Theresa Fallon, director of the Brussels-based Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies.“They have won the gold medal for creating this very effective vaccine," she said. "But the problem is, how are they going to implement it?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-scores-points-with-vaccine-diplomacy-but-snags-arise-101615106347474.html

The Rescue personnel is busy in relief activities, aided by the local people, reported Geo News.The rescue sources said several people are still trapped inside the ill-fated train. The personnel are facing problems in the rescue operation owing to the darkness, they said.The train service has been suspended on both tracks, said the Pakistan Railways sources. They said all the Punjab-bound trains that left Karachi have been halted on different stations.Meanwhile, Pakistan Railways had suffered Pakistani ₹1.2 trillion losses during the past 50 years and the government plans to revive the collapsing organisation and have no clue how to proceed.The cash-strapped Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government seems as clueless about its strategy for the railway's revival as any previous administration.It has, apparently, put all its eggs in the Chinese basket, hoping that the investment of USD 6.8 billion on an upgrade of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) connecting Peshawar with Karachi would resuscitate the dying company.Citing the 2019-20 Economic Survey, Dawn reported, the railway owns 474 locomotives (458 diesel engines and 12 steam engines) for 7,791km length of the track. During the first eight months of FY20 (July-February), the number of passengers decreased to 39.4 million against 39.9m from the previous year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-rail-accident-kills-one-injures-several-101615103041910.html
07-03-2021||World||US defence chief Austin likely to visit India soon: Report||US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is likely to visit India next week, an Indian government source told Reuters on Sunday, as the two allies seek to deepen military ties to counter the growing power of China in the Asia-Pacific region.The first person visit by a top official of the new US President Joe Biden's administration will focus on enhancing cooperation, said the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.Austin plans to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during his visit some time in the week of March 15, the official added.The first Black US defence chief will join Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a visit to Japan and South Korea, sources told Reuters on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if Blinken will also visit India.The US Embassy in New Delhi referred a request for comment to the Defence Department, which could not be reached outside regular business hours.For India, closer bilateral military ties could bring greater access to American technology, as New Delhi tries to modernise its defence system amid tensions with neighbouring China in the western Himalayas.India and China last month began to pull back troops and battle tanks from a bitterly contested lake area high in the Himalayas, in a breakthrough after a months-long standoff on the disputed border between the two nuclear-armed giants.The standoff began in April when India said Chinese troops had intruded deep into its side of the Line of Actual Control or the de facto border in the Ladakh area in the western Himalayas.US defence manufacturers hope closer ties will boost their own prospects in India, which is one of the world's biggest defence spenders but still has major gaps in its military capabilities.

07-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Canadian provinces looking to import vaccine tech knowhow from India||A number of Canadian provincial governments, including Alberta, have approached India to explore the possibility of importing technical knowhow on Covid-19 vaccines from Indian manufacturers to establish vaccine-making facilities to tackle the pandemic.An Indian official said “preliminary” discussions have commenced and the provincial governments are interested in the technical expertise developed by companies such as Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech. The two companies are manufacturing Indian-made vaccines. SII is making the Covishield vaccine, its version of the Astra Zeneca-Oxford shot, and Bharat Biotech is producing the Covaxin jab.Canada is importing Pune-based SII’s Covishield shots, with the first consignment of 500,000 doses having arrived last Wednesday and the remaining two million doses expected by mid-May.Canadian provinces have been eyeing Indian-made vaccines even as New Delhi has been dispatching shipments to numerous countries around the world. Canada has been troubled with maintaining a steady flow of doses because of the absence of indigenous manufacturing facilities and provincial governments have been seeking to establish such facilities in potential joint ventures with Indian manufacturers in future.Alberta apart, Indian officials didn’t yet identify the other Canadian provinces that have been in contact with the Indian government to pursue this matter. They said India’s “vaccine internationalism” could pay off in a post-pandemic scenario for its pharma sector as it emerges as a reliable supplier.The arrival of the coronavirus vaccines in Canada is being highlighted by India as its reliability and credulity when it comes to maintaining global supply chains as well as being the “pharmacy of the world”, as one official put it.While the Biden administration in the US has indicated it may not allow its manufacturers to export vaccines till domestic requirements are met, India is attempting to underscore its vaccine diplomacy initiative. Ajay Bisaria, India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, made this point during a series of interviews with the Canadian media as the Covishield vaccines arrived in Canada.Asked by Vassy Kapelos, host of CBC’s Power & Politics, whether there was the possibility that India could renege on contracts like the US seems likely to do, Bisaria said, “You have no worries from India. We have enough going and India is strongly committed and very conscious of its responsibility as the largest vaccine-maker in the world with 62% of the global capacity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canadian-provinces-looking-to-import-vaccine-tech-knowhow-from-india-101615098191925.html
07-03-2021||World||High-speed train from Lhasa to Tibetan city near Arunachal to run from June||Tibet’s first high-speed train service between provincial capital Lhasa and Nyingchi near the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh will be operational by the end of June, a top official Chinese railway official said on Saturday.Construction of the 435km-long high-speed train corridor, also the first electrified railroad in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), linking the two cities began in 2014, Lu Dongfu, chairperson of China State Railway Group Company and a deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC), said on the sidelines of the ongoing annual session of the parliament.The new high-speed rail connection is part of China’s ambitious plan of expanding connectivity across TAR, especially along border areas with India. Nyingchi is located less than 50km from the border with Arunachal Pradesh.China claims the entire Indian state as part of southern Tibet and has been rapidly developing infrastructure in the remote area of Nyingchi, which like the rest of TAR is not accessible to foreign journalists and diplomats. For example, China is building the Sichuan-Tibet railway’s Ya’an-Nyingchi section, which will be 1,011km in length and include 26 stations when completed - taking Chinese railway right up to the disputed boundary with India.Last November, President Xi Jinping identified the Ya’an-Nyingchi railway project as a major measure in facilitating the Communist Party of China’s plan for governing Tibet in the new era, and stressed the project’s role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.“The project would significantly contribute to the economic and social development of the western region, especially in Sichuan province and TAR,” Xi said in November.The Sichuan-Tibet railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.On Saturday, talking about the first high-speed train, Chinese railway official Lu Dongfu said the track-laying work had been completed by the end of 2020.“The railway has a designed speed of 160 kmph, according to its constructor Tibet Railway Construction Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China State Railway Group,” news agency Xinhua said.“China aims to extend the total length in operation (of high speed trains) to around 50,000km by 2025, up from 37,900km by the end of 2020,” Lu said.The high-speed railway network will cover 98% of cities with over 500,000 residents, he added.China’s self-developed Fuxing trains now operate at a speed range of 160kmph to 350kmph.By the end of last year, 1,036 “Fuxing” or “electrical multiple units” (EMU) had run a total of 836 million km and carried 827 million passengers since 2007, when the first bullet train became operational.Under a national blueprint, quoted by state media, China will extend the total length of its rail system to 200,000km and its high-speed rail system to 70,000km by 2035.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highspeed-train-from-lhasa-to-tibetan-city-near-arunachal-to-run-from-june-101615095851767.html
07-03-2021||World||Japan to closely monitor China's increased defense spending||Japanese defense officials on Sunday said that they intend to closely monitor how China will increase its defense spending this year, reported NHK World.As per this year's draft budget at the annual session of the National People's Congress, which opened on Friday, the Chinese government increased its defense budget by 6.8% from last year to about 209 billion dollars. That's around four times Japan's defense budget for fiscal 2021, starting in April, reported NHK World.The increase in defense budget reflects Beijing's urge in maritime activities.China has been claiming the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea and their have been many incidents of incursions of Chinese ships in Japanese territorial waters.Japan controls the islands but China and Taiwan also lay their claim. The Japanese government maintains the islands as an inherent part of Japan's territory, in terms of history and international law. It said that there is no issue of sovereignty to be resolved over them, reported NHK World.The Japanese government plans to call on the Chinese side to increase transparency through security talks and exchanges as they are unaware of the type of equipment Beijing is planning to deploy.Further, they reiterated to closely analyze and monitor the activities of the Chinese military.Meanwhile, amid attempts to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas by China, the United States and Japan on Thursday held bilateral security discussions on Beijing's Coast Guard Law.In January, China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, passed the coastguard law that empowers the coastguard to use "all necessary means" to deter threats posed by foreign vessels in waters "under China's jurisdiction".It allows the coastguards to launch pre-emptive strikes without prior warning if commanders deem it necessary.Under the new law, coastguard personnel can demolish structures built or installed by other countries in Chinese-claimed waters and board and inspect foreign ships in the area.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-closely-monitor-china-s-increased-defense-spending-101615093349202.html

07-03-2021||World||Pressure piles on scandal hit Cuomo as ex-aide calls out office conduct||Another woman who worked for Gov. Andrew Cuomo is describing conduct she felt was inappropriate for the workplace.Ana Liss, 35, told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Saturday that when she worked as a policy aide to the governor between 2013 and 2015, Cuomo called her “sweetheart,” once kissed her hand and asked personal questions, including whether she had a boyfriend. She said he sometimes greeted her with a hug and a kiss on both cheeks.Liss told the Journal she initially thought of Cuomo’s behavior as harmless, but it grew to bother her. She felt it was patronizing.“It’s not appropriate, really, in any setting,” she said. “I wish that he took me seriously.”A spokesman for Cuomo didn’t immediately return a request for comment from The Associated Press, but told the Journal that some of the behavior Liss was describing was the kind of innocent glad-handing that politicians often do at public events.“Reporters and photographers have covered the governor for 14 years watching him kiss men and women and posing for pictures," said Rich Azzopardi, a senior advisor to Cuomo. "At the public open-house mansion reception, there are hundreds of people, and he poses for hundreds of pictures. That’s what people in politics do.”Liss said she never made a formal complaint about the governor’s behavior.Cuomo’s workplace conduct has been under intense scrutiny in recent days as several women have publicly told of feeling sexually harassed, or at least made to feel demeaned and uncomfortable by the Democrat.Former adviser Lindsey Boylan, 36, said he made inappropriate comments on her appearance, once kissed her on the lips at the end of a meeting and suggested a game of strip poker as they sat with other aides on a jet flight. Another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, 25, said Cuomo asked if she ever had sex with older men and made other comments she interpreted as gauging her interest in an affair.Another woman, who did not work for the state, described Cuomo putting his hands on her face and asking if he could kiss her after they met at a wedding.In a news conference Wednesday, Cuomo denied ever touching anyone inappropriately, but apologized for behaving in a way that he now realized had upset women he worked with. He said he’d made jokes and asked personal questions in an attempt to be playful and frequently greeted people with hugs and kisses, as his father, Mario Cuomo, had done when he was governor.“I understand sensitivities have changed. Behavior has changed,” Cuomo said. “I get it and I’m going to learn from it.”The state's attorney general plans to hire an outside law firm to investigate the sexual harassment allegations. Some lawmakers have called for Cuomo to resign over his workplace behavior, and separate allegations that his administration misled the public about coronavirus fatalities in nursing homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-piles-on-scandal-hit-cuomo-as-ex-aide-calls-out-office-conduct-101615091739849.html

His face is displayed on murals all over the United States. Since his brutal death George Floyd has embodied, more than any other, the Black victims of police violence and racism in the United States."Daddy changed the world." The words of Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna summed up the paradox of his killing, in which the end of his life began a moral reckoning on race and white supremacy far beyond the borders of the United States.The 46-year-old died of asphyxiation beneath the knee of a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, on May 25, 2020 in the US city of Minneapolis.Chauvin's trial opens Monday.The horrifying killing, which kicked off the biggest civil rights protests in the US since the 1960s, snuffed out a life marked by hardship but also generosity.Standing at six foot four inches (1.93 meters), Floyd was known to friends and family as a "gentle giant," a rapper and athlete who suffered runs-in with the law and addiction but who wanted the best for his children.His mother, for whom he cried out when he was dying, moved to Houston shortly after he was born in 1973 in North Carolina.He grew up in the Third Ward, a poor and predominantly African American neighborhood in central Houston."We didn't have a whole lot, but we always had each other," his cousin Shareeduh Tate said during a memorial gathering last year in Minneapolis.At Jake Yates High School, he played the role of big brother to a lot of the local boys."He was teaching us how to be a man because he was in the world already before us," said his younger brother Philonise at the memorial.Floyd stood out on the football field and excelled at basketball, playing the latter sport when he went to college."He was a monster on the court," said Philonese. "But in life, in general, talking to people, a gentle giant."'Way with words' He dropped out of college and came back to Houston to help out his family.In the 1990s, he threw himself into Houston's hip-hop circuit under the name of "Big Floyd," where he enjoyed some success.But he could not escape the violence of Houston's underground scene, and was arrested several times for thefts and drug dealing. Local media said he was jailed in the early 2000s for armed burglary, serving four years.After prison, he turned to religion and fell in with the pastor of a church in the Third Ward, using his notoriety and his love of basketball star Lebron James to draw in young men to the ministry, where he taught them religion and coached them in basketball."He was powerful, he had a way with words," said Philonese.Floyd moved to Minneapolis in 2014 for a "change of scenery" and to look for more stable employment to help support the mother of his newborn daughter Gianna.He worked as a truck driver for the Salvation Army and then as a bouncer at a bar, a job he lost when the city's restaurants shut down because of the pandemic."I got my shortcomings and my flaws, and I ain't better than nobody else," Floyd wrote on Instagram in 2017."But, man, the shootings that's going on, man, I don't care what religion you're from, man, or where you're at, man. I love you, and God love you, man. Put them guns down, man."Delivering justice On May 25, Floyd bought a packet of cigarettes from a shop in Minneapolis. The shopkeeper suspected him of using a counterfeit $20 bill, and phoned the police.Floyd -- who had taken fentanyl, a powerful opiate -- resisted his arrest.He did not use violence, but he soon found himself handcuffed and pinned beneath Chauvin's knee anyway.In footage of his killing, filmed by horrified bystanders and later sent around the world, he can be heard begging for his mother and for relief. His final words were "I can't breathe."He was buried in June in Houston, next to his mother Larcenia, who died in 2018 and whose nickname "Cissy" he had tattooed on his chest.Residents of the Third Ward in Houston, where he grew up, have paid their respects with multiple murals.One, painted on the red brick wall of the social housing block where Floyd grew up, shows "Big Floyd" with angel's wings and a halo around his head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-gentle-giant-who-became-symbol-of-fight-against-racism-101615086578041.html

Protests were also held in Yangon, in Kale near the Indian border, and in Dawei, a coastal city in the south. There were no reports of violence.The Southeast Asian country has been plunged into turmoil since the military overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1. Daily demonstrations and strikes have choked business and paralysed administration and the United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people.Into the early hours of Sunday, residents said soldiers and police moved into several districts of Yangon, firing shots. They arrested at least three in Kyauktada Township, residents there said. They did not know the reason for the arrests."They are asking to take out my father and brother. Is no one going to help us? Don't you even touch my father and brother. Take us too if you want to take them," one woman screamed as two of them, an actor and his son, were led off.Soldiers also came looking for a lawyer who worked for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy but were unable to find him, a member of the now dissolved parliament, Sithu Maung, said in a Facebook post.Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.'Punched and kicked'Well over 1,700 people have been detained under the junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group. It did not give a figure for overnight detentions."Detainees were punched and kicked with military boots, beaten with police batons, and then dragged into police vehicles," AAPP said in a statement. "Security forces entered residential areas and tried to arrest further protesters, and shot at the homes, destroying many."Myanmar authorities said on Saturday they had exhumed the body of 19-year-old Kyal Sin, who has become an icon of the protest movement after she was shot dead in Mandalay on Wednesday wearing a T-shirt that read "Everything will be OK".State-run MRTV said a surgical investigation showed she could not have been killed by police because the wrong sort of projectile was found in her head and she had been shot from behind, whereas police were in front.Photographs on the day showed her head turned away from security forces moments before she was killed. Opponents of the coup accused authorities of an attempted cover-up.The killings have drawn anger in the West and have been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta. China, meanwhile, has said the priority should be stability and that other countries should not interfere.Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and the respect of November's election - which her party won in landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, hired by Myanmar's junta, told Reuters the generals are keen to leave politics and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.He said Suu Kyi had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.Ben-Menashe said he also had been tasked with seeking Arab support for a plan to repatriate Rohingya refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from Myanmar in 2017 in an army crackdown after rebel attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-back-on-myanmar-streets-after-night-raids-by-security-forces-101615089588431.html
07-03-2021||World||'We can do big things,' Schumer says as Senate approves aid||Tensions were raw ahead of midnight as Republican leader Mitch McConnell rose in the Senate for the purpose of publicly ridiculing Majority Leader Chuck Schumer over the daylong delay as Democrats argued among themselves over the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package.But 12 hours later, it was Schumer, D-N.Y., reveling in the last word, an unabashedly upbeat “help is on the way” to Americans suffering through the pandemic and lockdowns as the Senate prepared to approve the massive package without a single GOP vote.Senate passage of the sweeping relief bill Saturday puts President Joe Biden’s top priority closer to becoming law, poised to unleash billion for vaccines, $1,400 direct payments and other aid, and shows Schumer, in his first big test as majority leader, can unify the ever-so-slim Democratic majority and deliver the votes.“Lessons learned: If we have unity, we can do big things,” Schumer told The Associated Press in an interview after the vote.The outcome “gives us optimism about doing more big things in the future — because it worked,” he said.Stewardship of the massive pandemic relief package was an inaugural foray of the new power dynamics of Washington, testing Democratic control of the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade, and setting the foundation for what’s possible for Biden’s agenda.So much of Biden's success or failure depends on the Senate, where Democrats are in command of an evenly split chamber, 50-50, a majority so delicate that any one senator can upend the legislative agenda. While Vice President Kamala Harris is able to break tie votes, Schumer has zero slack if Republicans are opposed, voting lockstep as they did Saturday against the virus aid as bloated and unnecessary. One key centrist, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., wavered over an unemployment provision, throwing the proceedings into chaos before a grueling all-night session.Biden has been telling senators privately their vote on pandemic aid will build momentum for the next priorities. An ambitious infrastructure package is emerging, part of his “Build Back Better” campaign agenda, to bring roads, broadband and green-energy projects nationwide. He and Schumer spoke often as the Senate leader steered the pandemic aid to approval. It's now headed back to the House for a final vote, as soon as Monday.While no senators appeared ready to tank Biden’s top priority, the next votes could prove more difficult.“There’s a whole series of issues that that quite a few of us were discussing,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden ally eager for bipartisanship, who spoke to the president a few minutes after the vote.“This was a reminder yesterday that, in a 50-50 Senate, if any one member changes their mind on an amendment, or vote or an issue, it can change the outcome," Coons said.Voting rights, immigration law changes and other bills will be subject to filibuster rules that require 60 votes for passage, rather than 51, a potentially impossible hurdle in the face of Republican opposition that is stoking calls to change the process to ensure Biden’s priorities don’t flame out.“We’re going to have to have discussions about that,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., a member of leadership.But that tough topic was for another day. On Saturday, Democrats elbow-bumped and cheered in the chamber — Stabenow said some were almost in tears -- as they ushered the massive aid package they had promised voters to approval. With 10 million jobs lost and countless schools and businesses shuttered, it includes $300 a week in extra unemployment benefits, money school reopenings, eviction protections and small business assistance.“Only 45 days after Joe Biden became president of the United States, to be able to do something so big, and so significant, that fundamentally is the glue for us,” she said.Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said it was the “best day” he’d ever had in the Senate. That biting speech from McConnell, R-Ky., poking at Democrats' temporary disarray? Brown dismissed it as cynical and unsubstantial.“So what,” Brown said. “Nobody cares about that. What they care about is, did we deliver on unemployment? Did we deliver on vaccines? Did we deliver on pensions? We cut the rate of child poverty in half. Think about that.”McConnell led Republicans to put up a blockade of opposition, reviving a strategy used the last time Democrats held the sweep of power, when Barack Obama was president, against the 2009 financial crisis rescue package.After Donald Trump won the White House, McConnell and Republicans controlling Congress with only a slightly thicker Senate margin used similar procedural tools to pass the $2 trillion GOP tax cuts on a party-line vote in 2017. Their effort to repeal and replace the health care law known as “Obamacare” fizzled when Sen. John McCain and two other Republicans voted with Democrats, and McConnell was unable to hold his party together.From his stately office off the Senate floor, with the lived-in feel of the rumpled New Yorker, Schumer pulled out his not-so-secret weapon, the flat flip-phone, which he uses for his constant calls keeping in touch with senators on their votes."Every member of our caucus, from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin, realize that we had to pull together, that if we failed, we’d all be hurt,” Schumer said, referring to the liberal-most senator from Vermont and the centrist from West Virginia.As Manchin hesitated, Schumer called him, as did other senators, and even Biden. But Manchin also had time — hours dragged on — to make up his mind.“He listens to everybody and then he puts it together,” Brown said of Schumer. “He’s good at it.”When the votes were being tallied Saturday, Schumer spotted the two new senators from Georgia, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and pointed at them. They had stunned the political world by defeating two Republican incumbents in special elections in January that delivered Democrats the majority.“The people of Georgia deserve a great deal of credit for what happened here today,” Warnock said afterward. “Had they not stood up in such a powerful way, in this historic election that sent Jon Ossoff and myself to the Senate, we simply would not be here.”Schumer urged the presiding officer to announce the vote, 50-49. One Republican senator was absent for a family matter. Harris was not needed to break the tie.Schumer turned to his senators and said, “We are a great team.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-can-do-big-things-schumer-says-as-senate-approves-aid-101615076371655.html
07-03-2021||World||Dozens rally before ex-officer put on trial in Floyd's death||Dozens of people gathered in front of the Minnesota governor’s mansion on Saturday to demand accountability for police officers, days before a former Minneapolis officer is scheduled to go on trial in the death of George Floyd.Many of the roughly 150 people who demonstrated in Minnesota were family members of others who died during police encounters. Similar protests were being organized in cities around the country in advance of the trial of Derek Chauvin.Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck while Floyd was held face-down on the ground in handcuffs, saying he couldn’t breathe. Body-camera video time stamps provided by prosecutors show Chauvin held his position for about nine minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter and jury selection in his trial begins Monday.Saturday's protest in Minnesota was organized by Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence, a coalition of families who lost loved ones in police confrontations. The Star Tribune reports that speakers said that in light of Floyd's death, they want other fatal police encounters reopened and examined.In Massachusetts, supporters of families who lost loved ones during police encounters also gathered in Boston's South End. Protest organizer Brock Satter told WBZ radio: “We're demanding convictions. They should go to jail for their crimes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-rally-before-ex-officer-put-on-trial-in-floyd-s-death-101615075976783.html
07-03-2021||World||Oral Covid treatment yields promising trial data: Drugmakers||German pharmaceutical giant Merck and a US partner reported promising results Saturday in trials of a drug administered orally to fight Covid-19, saying it helps reduce patients' viral load."At a time where there is unmet need for antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2, we are encouraged by these preliminary data," said Wendy Painter, chief medical officer of the US firm, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.In January, Merck halted work on two Covid vaccine candidates but has pressed on with research into two products to treat the disease, including a pill-based one called molnupiravir, which it has developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.This drug caused a significant drop in patients' viral load after five days of treatment with it, Merck said at a meeting with infectious disease experts.This Phase 2a test -- drug trials have three stages before a product can be approved -- was carried out among 202 non-hospitalized people with symptoms of Covid-19.There was no alert in terms of safety, and of four serious adverse events that were reported, none were considered to be related to taking this drug, Ridgeback said.Anti-viral oral drugs such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are sometimes prescribed for seasonal flu but researchers have yet to come up with something similar to fight the coronavirus.The findings of this study -- a quicker decrease in viral load among individuals with early-stage Covid-19 who are treated with molnupiravir -- are promising, said William Fischer, lead investigator of the study and a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina."If supported by additional studies, (they) could have important public health implications, particularly as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to spread and evolve globally," Fischer added.Merck is also working on another oral Covid treatment called MK-711.Preliminary results from clinical trials with it show a more than 50 percent reduction in risk of death or respiratory trouble in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe Covid-19, the company said in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oral-covid-treatment-yields-promising-trial-data-drugmakers-101615075592729.html

We’re not,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, told an online briefing. “Countries are going to lurch back into third and fourth surges if we’re not careful.” Record Covid-19 deaths have been reported in Brazil this week and its hospital system is on the brink of collapse, driven partly by a more contagious variant first identified there.The US Senate narrowly approved a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill on Saturday. The chamber set a record in its longest single vote in the modern era at 11 hours and 50 minutes. The fight is not over as the bill needs to return to the House for the final approval.‘AstraZeneca effective against Brazil variant’Preliminary data from a study conducted at the University of Oxford indicates that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca is effective against the P1, or Brazilian, variant, a source with knowledge of the study told Reuters on Friday.The data indicates that the vaccine will not need to be modified in order to protect against the variant, which is believed to have originated in the Amazonian city of Manaus, said the source, who requested anonymity as the results have not yet been made public.

07-03-2021||World||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan wins trust vote||akistan Prime Minister Imran Khan handily won a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on Saturday, days after the embarrassing defeat of his ruling party’s key candidate in Senate elections.Khan secured the votes of 178 members of the lower house of parliament, which is comprised of 340 lawmakers. The 11-party opposition alliance — the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) —boycotted the assembly’s special session.Khan needed 172 votes to show a simple majority and dispel any suggestion he had lost the support of the majority of lawmakers in the National Assembly. In the National Assembly, the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf Party has the support of 180 members, including 157 members from Khan’s party and 20 members from allied parties and two independents.Also read | Mutated Covid-19 variants responsible for spike in cases across EuropeThe need for the confidence vote arose after former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani in Senate elections on Wednesday defeated Hafeez Sheikh, the finance minister in Khan’s cabinet. The Senate vote was seen as a test for Khan, who came to power in the 2018 parliamentary elections. It boosted the number of Senate seats for the opposition, which has a slight, 53-47 majority over Khan and wants Khan to step down.Responding to the opposition demand, Khan decided to seek the vote of confidence.Addressing the House after securing the trust vote, the 68-year-old cricketer-turned politician thanked all lawmakers from his party and allies for supporting him.Top opposition leaders, however, demanded Khan’s resignation and holding of fresh elections. PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Pakistan Peoples Party leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the vote of confidence has no meaning.“This was not a confidence vote. We know which agencies watched the members of the assembly the entire night. [We know] who knocked on the doors of each member to ensure they were present,” Rehman said.His was referring to reports that said the government kept its members in lodges in Islamabad under strict watch so that all of them were present in parliament during the floor test.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz said Khan’s days as prime minister were numbered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-prime-minister-imran-khan-wins-trust-vote-101615055264249.html
