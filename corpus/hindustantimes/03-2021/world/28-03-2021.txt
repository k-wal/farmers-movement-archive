Rabie said he hoped it would not be necessary, but that Egypt would take up offers of international assistance if it did switch to that strategy.A ballast tank at the bow of the ship has been damaged, and the vessel will have to be inspected once it is freed, two people familiar with the salvage operation said.'POSITIVE INDICATORS'"There are positive indicators from yesterday and the day before yesterday," Rabie told Egyptian state TV."The rudder was not moving and it is now moving, the propeller is working now, there was no water underneath the bow, and now there is water under it, and yesterday there was a 4-metre deviation in the bow and the stern."However, two SCA sources told Reuters that a mass of rock had been found at the bow of the ship, complicating salvage efforts.From the dredging done so far it was still unclear whether the ship was stuck on soft sand, compact sand or clay, which will determine how easily it may shift free, said one official involved in the salvage operation.Two more powerful tugs are expected to arrive by Monday. "We believe that is what you are going to need in terms of horse power ... to have a decent attempt, a decent chance of trying to float her," the official said."We're dividing the day into two halves, 12 hours for dredgers and 12 hours for tugs, because not all times are suitable for tugs due to the tide," said Rabie, adding that 14 tug boats in total were being deployed.About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the Suez Canal, which is a key source of foreign currency revenues for Egypt. The current stoppage is costing the canal $14-15 million daily.Shipping rates for oil product tankers nearly doubled after the ship became stranded, and the blockage has disrupted global supply chains, threatening costly delays for companies already dealing with Covid-19 restrictions.If the blockage drags on, shippers may decide to reroute their cargoes around the Cape of Good Hope, adding about two weeks to journeys and extra fuel costs.The SCA has said it can accelerate convoys through the canal once the Ever Given is freed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tugs-dredgers-struggle-to-free-container-ship-evergiven-blocking-suez-canal-101616953737814.html
28-03-2021||World||Paris doctors warn of catastrophic overload of virus cases||Critical care doctors in Paris say surging coronavirus infections could soon overwhelm their ability to care for the sick in the French capital's hospitals, possibly forcing them to choose which patients they have the resources to save.The sobering warnings were delivered Sunday in newspaper opinions signed by dozens of Paris-region doctors. They came as French President Emmanuel Macron has been vigorously defending his decision not to completely lockdown France again as he did last year. Since January, Macron’s government has instead imposed a nationwide overnight curfew and followed that with a grab-bag of other restrictions.But with infections soaring and hospitals increasingly running short of intensive-care beds, doctors have been stepping up the pressure for a full French lockdown.Writing in Le Journal du Dimanche, 41 Paris-region hospital doctors said: “We have never known such a situation, even during the worst (terror) attacks” that targeted the French capital, notably assaults by Islamic State extremists in 2015 that killed 130 people and filled Paris emergency wards with the wounded.The doctors predicted that softer new restrictions imposed this month on Paris and some other regions won't quickly bring the resurgent epidemic under control. They warned that hospital resources won't be able to keep pace with needs, forcing them to practice “catastrophe medicine" in the coming weeks as cases peak.“We already know that our capacity to offer care will be overwhelmed," they wrote. “We will be obliged to triage patients in order to save as many lives as possible. This triage will concern all patients, with and without Covid, in particular for adult patients' access to critical care.”Another group of nine critical-care doctors writing in the newspaper Le Monde also warned that intensive care units in Paris may have to refuse patients.“The current situation is tending toward prioritization, also called ‘triage,’” they wrote. “When just one ICU bed is available but two patients could benefit from it, it consists of deciding which of them will be admitted (and will perhaps survive) and which will not be admitted (and will quite probably die). This is where we are heading.”They also accused Macron's government of hypocrisy “by compelling health care workers to decide which patient should live and which should die, without stating so clearly.”Macron remains adamant that not locking France down again this year, like some other European countries, was sound government policy, even as more than 2,000 deaths per week push the country ever closer to the milestone of 100,000 people lost to the pandemic. The country now counts more than 94,600 virus-related deaths.“We were right not to implement a lockdown in France at the end of January because we didn’t have the explosion of cases that every model predicted,” Macron said last week. “There won’t be a mea culpa from me. I don’t have remorse and won’t acknowledge failure.”Macron's administration has been hoping to outrace the resurgent outbreak with its vaccination campaign, an ambition that appears increasingly unrealistic as hospitals struggle. After a sluggish start in December, France's inoculation drive stepped up this weekend with the start of injections for healthy people aged 70 and above.More than 7.7 million people — close to 15% of all French adults — have had at least one jab of either the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines. The government says the pace will continue to pick up, with France expecting to get nearly 3 million additional Pfizer doses this week.The European Union's vaccine czar, Thierry Breton, told French radio RTL on Sunday that the bloc will deliver 420 million vaccine doses to its member countries by July 15.“The vaccines are coming,” he said.Breton also unveiled a mock-up of a proposed EU health certificate that could allow the bloc’s residents to cross its internal borders more easily. The certificate shows if people have been vaccinated, tested negative for coronavirus or recovered from it. He said the certificate would be optional and could be available by mid-June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-doctors-warn-of-catastrophic-overload-of-virus-cases-101616951200091.html

Facebook said it followed guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) that there is currently no medication that can cure the virus.In a statement on Sunday, Venezuela's information ministry said Facebook was going after "content geared toward combating the pandemic" and described Carvativir as a retroviral of "national production and engineering.""We are witnessing a digital totalitarianism exercised by supranational companies who want to impose their law on the countries of the world," the ministry said.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Venezuelan doctors have warned that Carvativir's effect on coronavirus has not been established. The treatment is derived from thyme, an herb that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine.Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse since taking office in 2013 and is labeled a dictator by Washington and many other Western nations, said in a tweet on Sunday that he would broadcast his daily coronavirus briefing on the Facebook account of his wife, first lady Cilia Flores.The South American country has reported 155,663 cases of the novel coronavirus and 1,555 deaths. Those figures are below the levels of many regional peers, but the political opposition says the true number of cases is likely far higher due to a lack of testing.

28-03-2021||World||China signs 25-year deal with Iran in challenge to US||China and Iran signed an overarching deal aimed at charting the course of their economic, political and trade relations over the next 25 years.The Chinese government plans to invest in Iran and buy oil from the Islamic Republic, further straining ties with the U.S. already frayed by China’s imports of covertly-shipped Iranian crude.The “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” agreement, signed in Tehran on Saturday by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, has been in the works since 2016, when President Xi Jinping became the first Chinese leader to visit the Iranian capital in over a decade.Beijing’s alliance with Tehran is a challenge to U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration as it sets about trying to rally allies against China, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said is the world’s “greatest geopolitical test.”“The document can elevate bilateral ties to a new strategic level,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a televised interview. The deal focuses on boosting private-sector collaboration and Iran’s role in Xi’s flagship infrastructure and investment program, the Belt and Road Initiative, he said.However, the pact drew criticism from many Iranians on social media who accused President Hassan Rouhani’s government of “selling” Iran to China, prompting several of his aides to defend the deal on Twitter.A draft copy of the accord that surfaced on media last year showed plans for long-term supply of Iranian crude to China as well as investment in oil, gas, petrochemical, renewables and nuclear energy infrastructure.Lured by the prospect of cheaper prices, China has already increased its imports of Iranian oil to around 1 million barrels a day, eroding U.S. leverage as it prepares to enter stalled talks with Tehran to revive a nuclear deal.The Biden administration has indicated that it’s open to reengaging with Iran after then-President Donald Trump abandoned the accord nearly three years ago and reimposed economic sanctions, but the two sides have yet to even agree to meet. Iran exported around 2.5 million barrels of oil a day before American penalties resumed.Iran’s closer integration with China may help shore up its economy against the impact of the U.S. sanctions, while sending a clear signal to the White House of Tehran’s intentions. Wang Yi, who arrived in Tehran on Friday, also met with Rouhani to discuss the nuclear deal.In a televised speech, Rouhani raised the prospect of restrictions being eased before the end of his second and final term as president in early August.“We’re ready for the lifting of sanctions,” he said on Saturday. “If obstacles are removed, all or at least some sanctions can be lifted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-signs-25-year-deal-with-iran-in-challenge-to-us-101616950965451.html

28-03-2021||World||White House says it's working on access to migrant centers||White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined to provide a specific date for when the media will get access to Border Patrol facilities temporarily holding thousands of migrant children seeking to live in the United States, but said Sunday the Biden administration was committed to transparency and “we’re working to get that done as soon as we can.”More than 16,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody as of Thursday, including about 5,000 in substandard Customs and Border Protection facilities.Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been calling on the administration to open the facilities to the cameras, asserting that the current policy is designed to keep the public from “fully realizing” what is happening at the border.Republican officials are also blaming the Biden administration for actions they say are leading more people from Central America to seek entry into the United States. “It’s not a crisis, it’s a complete loss of sovereignty down there,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said.Graham recently visited the border and said he saw a facility designed to hold 80 children with about 1,000 in it. He called on the administration to turn away every unaccompanied minor after testing them for “human trafficking abuses.”“If you don’t, we’ll have 150,000 a month by this summer,” Graham said Sunday.U.S. authorities reported encounters with more than 100,000 migrants on the southern border in February, the highest since a four-month streak in 2019.Encounters have averaged about 5,000 people per day throughout March, which would be about a 50% increase over February if those figures hold for the entire month.White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said the surge was cyclical.“They’re not the result of one administration’s policies or another administration’s policies. They’re the result of, for example, weather disasters in the region. They’re the result of people fleeing poverty and violence,” Bedingfield said. “So we saw spikes in 2014. We saw them in 2019 when the Trump administration had perhaps the cruelest imaginable policies in place, family separation to try to deter people from coming, and they still came.”The Biden administration continued to emphasize on the Sunday talk shows that the U.S.-Mexico border “remains closed” and that the majority of adults are being turned away. But Psaki said the administration was not going to force children to go back on a treacherous journey.“They are fleeing challenging economic circumstances, hurricanes, prosecution in some scenarios,' she said. “It does not mean that they get to stay in the United States. It means their cases are adjudicated and we want to treat them humanely, make sure they are in a safe place while their cases are adjudicated. That’s what we’re talking about here.”Former President Donald Trump expanded and fortified border walls while championing “zero tolerance” policies that made it more difficult to seek U.S. asylum and led to some immigrant parents being separated from their children.Under federal law, children arriving at the border without parents should be transferred within three days from U.S. Border Patrol custody to long-term facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services until they can be released to family members or sponsors.Psaki said the administration is committed to transparency and providing access to those temporary Border Patrol facilities as soon as it can.“We are mindful of the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic. We want to keep these kids safe, keep the staff safe,” Psaki said.Psaki and Graham spoke on “Fox News Sunday,” while Bedingfield was interviewed on ABC's “The Week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-it-s-working-on-access-to-migrant-centers-101616950331623.html

Trudeau said in a statement that people will find alternative ways to mark this special day as the residents continue to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and follow public health guidelines.“It is a time to celebrate new beginnings, renew and strengthen relationships, and look forward to the year ahead with optimism and joy,” said Trudeau.The Canadian PM also took the opportunity to recognise the contributions of the Hindu community in the North American country. He said people of the Hindu faith have contributed to the collective effort in many ways, including by helping neighbours, supporting seniors, and following the public health guidelines to protect everyone’s health. Trudeau noted that the celebrations in Canada demonstrate the country’s diversity, and “remind us that inclusion builds a stronger and more vibrant country.”“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating, here in Canada and around the world, a fun, joyous, and happy Holi,” the statement read. “Holi Hai!”Leaders from around the world, including US Vice President Kamala Harris and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have wished people who are celebrating the festival.

28-03-2021||World||US census data delay scrambles plans for state redistricting||Stymied by delayed census data needed for redistricting, some states are considering postponing their 2022 primaries or turning to other population estimates to start the once-a-decade task of redrawing voting districts used for US House and state legislative elections.The US Census Bureau was supposed to provide redistricting data to the states by March 31, but after setbacks from the pandemic, it won't be ready until mid- to late August and might not be available in an easy-to-use format until Sept. 30. That's later than the legal deadlines to complete redistricting in some states and could mean less time for court challenges, candidate filing and ballot creation.The delay has sent states scrambling to adapt. Some face the decision to sidestep their constitutional deadlines or draw stopgap maps that might not fully reflect population shifts in the past decade.“States that have done the exact same thing for decades in a row now have to look for alternatives,” said Wendy Underhill, director of elections and redistricting at the National Conference of State Legislatures.In many states, redistricting is done by lawmakers subject to a gubernatorial veto. A growing number will use independent or bipartisan commissions, but Republicans will have ultimate control over redistricting in more than twice as many states as Democrats. Political control allows officials to draw districts that make it easier for their candidates to win future elections — something Republicans did more effectively than Democrats after the 2010 census.Although the census is typically used for redistricting, only about half the states have laws or constitutional provisions explicitly requiring them to use census data, according to the NCSL.In Oregon, the state constitution requires lawmakers to draw legislative districts “according to population” by July 1. If they fail to do so, then the secretary of state is to complete maps by Aug. 15.Democratic legislative leaders cited “constitutional turmoil” caused by late census data in asking the state Supreme Court to extend redistricting deadlines until three months after the figures are received. But Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, a Democrat, contends that could trigger a chain reaction that could delay the state’s May 2022 primaries.“The resulting cost, confusion, and instability to Oregon’s electoral process could be staggering,” Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum argued in a court filing on Fagan’s behalf.Fagan suggests the Legislature could use population estimates from Portland State University to draft maps by the constitutional deadline and revise them during a likely legal challenge as the 2020 census data becomes available. Officials at the university's Population Research Center told The Associated Press that their statewide estimates were off by just 0.2% — fewer than 8,000 people — during the 2010 census.The Oklahoma Constitution requires the Legislature to redraw its districts within 90 working days of starting its regular session. With the clock ticking, lawmakers have decided to use population estimates from 2015 to 2019 to redraw legislative maps. After the 2020 census data is released, the Legislature may reconvene in a special session if adjustments are needed.“There’s an awful lot you can do with the data that are already available to start on a rough sketch” for redistricting, said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who specializes in redistricting.But relying on anything other than 2020 census data for the final maps poses a “substantial legal risk,” Levitt said.Lawsuits over redistricting are a near certainty in many states as political parties angle to get preferential maps. A decade ago, courts twice delayed the Texas primaries because of legal challenges to the maps drawn by the Republican-led Legislature.Candidate filing for Texas’ March 1 primary is scheduled to run from mid-November to mid-December. But Republican Rep. Phil King is sponsoring legislation that would allow the governor, lieutenant governor and House speaker to agree to delay the primaries to as late as July 1.If census data isn't received until September, "it gets pretty tight,” King said. “This is just a safety net in case we have to back it up a little bit.”North Carolina’s top elections administrator wants lawmakers to postpone November municipal elections and March 2022 primaries. But Key Republican lawmakers say it's too soon to know whether that's necessary. Only about 60 of the hundreds of municipalities will need to redraw wards or districts.“There are elections that are affected by the census and there’s elections that aren’t,” said Republican Sen. Warren Daniel, co-chairman of the Senate Redistricting and Elections Committee. “Personally, I think we should distinguish between the two in terms of what our action is.”The California Supreme Court already has pushed back the deadline for the state’s redistricting commission to finalize new maps from Aug. 15 to Dec. 15.But that was on the assumption census data would be available by July 31. For every day the data is delayed beyond that, the court has automatically extended the deadline by an equal amount. That means it could bump up against California's mid-February deadline for candidates to submit petitions for the 2022 primaries.“Things are going to have to change,” said Paul Mitchell, a redistricting consultant based in Sacramento. “It would be impossible for them to collect signatures when they don’t know what the lines are."It’s not just potential candidates who are affected by the delayed census data. Election administrators need time to align new districts into voting precincts so each voter gets a ballot listing the correct candidates. And officials need to get that done early enough to mail ballots to military and overseas voters at least 45 days before an election.“All these things, they’re all asking for time, and it’s all just getting crazy compressed because of this late census data,” Mitchell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-census-data-delay-scrambles-plans-for-state-redistricting-101616940745741.html

It registered its highest number of new cases since the end of last year on Thursday, although deaths remain at a relatively low level."It will take a bit longer before everyone is fully vaccinated, but maybe five million people will be fully vaccinated by the end of the first half of the year, June 30," vaccine coordinator Richard Bergstrom told Swedish Television."It will take maybe a couple of weeks into July before everyone has had two shots," he said.Bergstrom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sweden, with a total population of 10 million, has so far vaccinated over a million people with one dose and 450,000 people with two doses.The country has more than 13,000 deaths from COVID-19. Sweden's death rate per capita is many times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than in several European countries that opted for lockdowns.A compilation of European excess mortality data on Wednesday showed Sweden had a lower increase in deaths than most European countries in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-says-will-not-meet-vaccine-target-due-to-delay-in-deliveries-101616939982782.html

She won||A court in Brazil ordered president Jair Bolsonaro to pay compensation to journalist Patricia Campos Mello after he made objectionable comments about her work ethics. Campos Mello, an award-winning reporter who works for the Brazilian daily newspaper Folha de S Paulo, hailed the court’s decision as a "victory for all of us women". “Judge asks Bolsonaro to compensate Folha reporter for moral damages - Judge found that the president is guilty of carrying out sexual offences against Patrícia Campos Mello - the first instance of such a decision. It is a victory for all of us women,” she tweeted in Portuguese.Justiça condena Bolsonaro a indenizar repórter da Folha por danos morais - Juíza considerou que presidente é culpado por realizar ofensas de cunho sexual contra Patrícia Campos Mello - decisão, em primeira instância, é vitória pra todas nós, mulheres https://t.co/8wYgYgW8FdThe Journalists against Harassment group said that the ruling was a “great day” for women reporters. “Great day for women journalists. Great day for professional journalism,” the group said in a tweet.Case against BolsonaroBolsonaro, the right-wing president who has been in office since 2019 and has a Trump-like disregard for journalists, said in February that Campos Mello had offered sex to a source in exchange for negative information about him. The Folha newspaper for which Campos Mello works said in its report that the president had said that Mello “wanted a scoop" at "any price against me". This was in response to a series of investigative reports that Campos Mello had written about a group that was using the social media platform WhatsApp for Bolsonaro’s 2018 presidential campaign. Campos Mello brought legal action against Bolsanaro for his comments. The judge said that Bolsonaro’s remarks damaged the journalist’s honour and asked the president to pay 20,000 reais ($3,500) in damages.Not the first win for Campos MelloThis is the second win for Campos Mello within three months as in January she had won an almost identical case against Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo, who is a member of the parliament in Brazil's lower house of Congress.She had filed a case against Eduardo, who had suggested in a YouTube video last May that the reporter had ‘tried to seduce’ a source for damaging information against his father. He was ordered to pay 30,000 reais ($5,200) to the journalist as compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalist-sued-brazil-s-president-bolsonaro-she-won-101616947081437.html
28-03-2021||World||New York lawmakers agree to legalize recreational marijuana||New York is poised the join the growing number of states that have legalized marijuana after state lawmakers reached a late-night deal to allow sales of the drug for recreational use.Democrats who now wield a veto-proof majority in the state Legislature have made passing it a priority this year, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration has estimated legalization could eventually bring the state about $350 million annually.“My goal in carrying this legislation has always been to end the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana prohibition that has taken such a toll on communities of color across our state, and to use the economic windfall of legalization to help heal and repair those same communities,” Sen. Liz Krueger, Senate sponsor of the bill and chair of the Senate’s finance committee, said.At least 14 other states already allow residents to buy marijuana for recreational and not just medical use, but New York’s past efforts to pass marijuana legalization have failed in recent years.The legislation would allow recreational marijuana sales to adults over the age of 21, and set up a licensing process for the delivery of cannabis products to customers. Individual New Yorkers could grow up to three mature and three immature plants for personal consumption, and local governments could opt out of retail sales.The legislation would take effect immediately if passed, though sales wouldn’t start until New York sets up rules and a proposed cannabis board. Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes estimated Friday it could take 18 months to two years for sales to start.Adam Goers, a vice president of Columbia Care, a New York medical marijuana provider that’s interested in getting into the recreational market, said New York’s proposed system would “ensure newcomers have a crack at the marketplace” alongside the state’s existing medical marijuana providers.“There’s a big pie in which a lot of different folks are going to be able to be a part of it,” Goers said.New York would set a 9% sales tax on cannabis, plus an additional 4% tax split between the county and local government. It would also impose an additional tax based on the level of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, ranging from 0.5 cents per milligram for flower to 3 cents per milligram for edibles.New York would eliminate penalties for possession of less than three ounces of cannabis, and automatically expunge records of people with past convictions for marijuana-related offenses that would no longer be criminalized. That’s a step beyond a 2019 law that expunged many past convictions for marijuana possession and reduced the penalty for possessing small amounts.And New York would provide loans, grants and incubator programs to encourage participation in the cannabis industry by people from minority communities, as well as small farmers, women and disabled veterans.Proponents have said the move could create thousands of jobs and begin to address the racial injustice of a decades-long drug war that disproportionately targeted minority and poor communities.“Police, prosecutors, child services and ICE have used criminalization as a weapon against them, and the impact this bill will have on the lives of our oversurveiled clients cannot be overstated,” Alice Fontier, managing director of Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, said in a statement Saturday.New York's Legal Aid Society also hailed the agreement. “This landmark legislation brings justice to New York State by ending prohibition, expunging conviction records that have curtailed the opportunities of countless predominately young Black and Latinx New Yorkers, and delivers economic justice to ensure that communities who have suffered the brunt of aggressive and disparate marijuana enforcement are first in line to reap the economic gain,” the group said in a news release Sunday.Melissa Moore, the Drug Policy Alliance’s director for New York state, said the bill "really puts a nail in the coffin of the drug war that’s been so devastating to communities across New York, and puts in place comprehensive policies that are really grounded in community reinvestment.”Cuomo has pointed to growing acceptance of legalization in the Northeast, including in Massachusetts, Maine and most recently, New Jersey.Past efforts to legalize recreational use have been hurt by a lack of support from suburban Democrats, disagreements over how to distribute marijuana sales tax revenue and questions over how to address drivers suspected of driving high.It also has run into opposition from law enforcement, school and community advocates, who warn legalization would further strain a health care system already overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic and send mixed messages to young people.“We are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the serious crisis of youth vaping and the continuing opioid epidemic, this harmful legislation is counterintuitive,” said an open letter signed by the Medical Society of the State of NY, New York State Parent Teacher Association, New York Sheriff’s Association and several other organizations March 11.New York officials plan to launch an education and prevention campaign aimed at reducing the risk of cannabis among school-aged children, and schools could get grants for anti-vaping and drug prevention and awareness programs.And the state will also launch a study due by Dec. 31, 2022, that examines the extent that cannabis impairs driving, and whether it depends on factors like time and metabolism.“One of the things that no country in the world has and everybody wants is a way to quickly and easily figure out if someone’s high or impaired on cannabis,” University of Buffalo psychologist and professor of community health and health behavior R. Lorraine Collins said. “Research is being done to find systems that can do that. But I think those efforts will not come to fruition for awhile.”The bill also sets aside revenues to cover the costs of everything from regulating marijuana, to substance abuse prevention.State police could also get funding to hire and train more so-called “drug recognition experts.”But there’s no evidence that drug recognition experts can tell whether someone is high or not, according to Collins, who was appointed to Cuomo’s 2018 working group tasked with drafting cannabis regulations.“I think it’s very important that we approach that challenge using science and research and not wishes or unsubstantiated claims,” Collins said.Collins pointed to a 2020 report from the American Civil Liberties Union that found that Blacks are almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession compared to Whites, based on FBI statistics.“Every New Yorker should be concerned about how these laws will be implemented or how those ways of examining drivers will be implemented in different communities,” Collins said. “It’s not likely to be equal.”The bill allows cities, towns and villages to opt out of allowing adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries or on-site consumption licenses by passing a local law by Dec. 31, 2021 or nine months after the effective date of the legislation. They cannot opt out of legalization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-lawmakers-agree-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana-101616947074632.html

The program is critical to plans to reopen an economy that had its deepest contraction last year for more than three centuries.Dowden said the government is on track to offer first doses of a vaccine to all over 50s by the middle of April and to the rest of the adult population by the end of July. There is also no danger of people unable to get their second dose of the same jab within 12 weeks, he said.The culture secretary spoke as the government prepares to relax some lockdown restrictions on Monday. People will be able to meet outdoors in greater numbers and outdoor sports facilities such as tennis and basketball courts will be permitted to reopen. The aim is to remove remaining restrictions on social contact from June 21.Britain and the EU are in talks to resolve a standoff over vaccine sharing as the bloc attempts to get its own immunization program back on track. Last week, the two sides indicated progress in defusing the spat.“We continue to have constructive discussions with the EU,” Dowden said. “Our position is very clear. The EU should not be engaging in blocking exports” and contracts should be honored, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expects-to-receive-first-moderna-vaccines-in-coming-weeks-101616932514454.html

The global death toll has reached 2,791,555 and the number of recoveries has reached 102, 697,755, according to data collated by Worldometer. The cases recorded in the US reached 30,917,339 and the death toll in the country mounted to 562,013, Worldometer data showed on Sunday. There are 23,348,512 Americans who have recovered from the viral disease till now.The United Kingdom which is the fifth worst-affected country by the coronavirus pandemic has 4,329,180 Covid-19 cases and 126,573 deaths, according to Worldometer. The recoveries in the country stand at 3,787,312.Here’s a look at the pandemic situation in both countries:USThe US added 758 deaths from Covid-19 on Saturday, which was the fewest since Monday, and new infections in the country also declined to the lowest in three days and stood at 63,000. The new infections were only a fraction of peaks of more than 300,000 daily cases that were reported in the country in late December and early January.Vaccinations in the country have picked up and about 75 per cent of the population is expected to be inoculated in the next four months, according to a report in Bloomberg. More than 140 million vaccines have been administered in the country so far according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data showed that of the total vaccines administered in the country, 15.1 per cent have been fully vaccinated and 27.6 per cent have received at least one dose of the vaccine.United KingdomThe UK reported 4,715 new Covid-19 cases and 58 related deaths, according to official figures released on Saturday. Nearly 30 million people in Britain have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to official figures. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said that the country is on the "roadmap to freedom" from the virus, but warned about the impact of Europe's third wave of infections on Britain.The country is also set to replace its strict lockdown with a message to “stay local”. From Monday, people will be allowed to meet in groups of six, outdoors and can resume outdoor sports such as basketball, tennis and golf. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also be taking similar steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pace-of-daily-deaths-in-us-slows-down-uk-relaxes-lockdown-101616943515943.html
28-03-2021||World||UK variant hunters lead global race to stay ahead of Covid||On March 4, 2020, when there were just 84 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the U.K., professor Sharon Peacock recognized that the country needed to expand its capacity to analyze the genetic makeup of the virus.The Cambridge University microbiologist understood that genomic sequencing would be crucial in tracking the disease, controlling outbreaks and developing vaccines. So she began working with colleagues around the country to put together a plan. Within a month, the government had provided 20 million pounds ($28 million) to fund their work.The initiative helped make Britain a world leader in rapidly analyzing the genetic material from large numbers of Covid-19 infections, generating more than 40% of the genomic sequences identified to date. These days, their top priority is finding new variants that are more dangerous or resistant to vaccines, information that is critical to helping researchers modify the vaccines or develop new ones to combat the ever-changing virus.“They've shown the world how you do this,” said Dr. Eric Topol, chair of innovative medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego, California.Genomic sequencing is essentially the process of mapping the unique genetic makeup of individual organisms — in this case the virus that causes Covid-19. While the technique is used by researchers to study everything from cancer to outbreaks of food poisoning and the flu virus, this is the first time authorities are using it to provide real-time surveillance of a global pandemic.Peacock, 62, heads Britain’s sequencing effort as executive director and chair of the Covid-19 UK Genomics Consortium, known as COG-UK, the group she helped create a year ago.During the first week of this month, COG-UK sequenced 13,171 viruses, up from 260 during its first 12 days of operation in March last year.Behind that growth is a system that links the science of genomic sequencing with the resources of Britain's national health care system.Positive Covid-19 tests from hospitals and community testing programs around the country are sent to a network of 17 laboratories, where scientists extract the genetic material from each swab and analyze it to identify that virus’ unique genetic code. The sequences are then cross-referenced with public health data to better understand how, where and why Covid-19 is spreading.When mutations in the virus correspond with an otherwise unexplained increase in cases, that’s a clue that a new variant of concern is circulating.The importance of genomic sequencing became obvious late last year as the number of new infections began to spike in southeastern England. When cases continued to rise despite tough local restrictions, public health officials went to work to find out why.Combing through data from genome sequencing, scientists identified a new variant that included a number of mutations that made it easier for the virus to hop from one person to another. Armed with this information, Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a national lockdown, scrapping a strategy of local restrictions that had failed to contain the new variant.The scientific sleuthing is crucial, but it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. Researchers must sift through the genetic sequences from thousands of harmless variants to find the rare dangerous ones, Peacock said.“It’s vital so that we can understand what variants are circulating, both in the United Kingdom and around the world, and therefore the implications of that on vaccine development and the way that we may have to adapt vaccines,” she said.The effort is a worldwide collaboration, with more than 120 countries submitting sequences to GISAID, a data-sharing hub originally created to track influenza viruses.Iceland, Australia, New Zealand and Denmark actually sequence a higher percentage of their Covid-19 cases than Britain, and Denmark does the work faster. But COG-UK’S work, combined with Britain’s size and high number of cases, have made it the world leader in sequencing Covid-19. The U.K. has submitted 379,294 of the almost 898,000 sequences in the GISAID database.That work is paying dividends even for advanced countries like Denmark, where scientists use tools developed in Britain to analyze their own data, said Mads Albertsen, a professor at Denmark’s Aalborg University who is part of the country’s genomic sequencing effort.“What the U.K. has just done by far best is the whole setup,” Albertsen said. “They have many more researchers and a much more professional structure around how to use the data.”The U.S. is also trying to learn from Britain as the Biden administration reverses the anti-science policies of his predecessor that slowed the country’s sequencing efforts, said Topol. Representatives from COG-UK took part in a recent call with American researchers and the Rockefeller Foundation aimed at building capacity in the United States.“To Peacock and the crew’s credit, they didn’t just stop at sequence,” Topol said. “They organized labs to do this other work, which is actually very intensive lab assessment. And then there’s the epidemiologic assessment, too. So everything has to fire on every cylinder, you know. It’s like a car with 12 cylinders. They all have to fire to move.”The U.K.'s sequencing success was built on the foundation of ground-breaking genetic science in Britain, stretching back to the work of James Watson, Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, who were credited with discovering the chemical structure of DNA. Other British scientists developed early sequencing techniques and later new technology that slashed the time and cost of sequencing.That success attracted investment, such as the Wellcome Trust’s 1992 decision to create the Sanger Centre to help map the human genome, further expanding the pool of expertise in Britain. And Britain’s National Health Service provided a wealth of data for researchers to study.Yet colleagues say Peacock personally deserves much of the credit for COG-UK's success, though she prefers to highlight the work of others.A ferociously good organizer, she glued the nation’s DNA detectives together through goodwill and chatrooms. Part of the trick was persuading eminent scientists to put aside their egos and academic rivalries to work together to help fight the pandemic, said Andrew Page, an expert in computer analysis of pathogen genomics who is working with COG-UK.Peacock's work on the project has earned her the moniker of variant-hunter-in-chief. But she prefers a simpler term.“I consider myself, first and foremost, a scientist that’s doing their best to try and help both the population in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to control the pandemic,’’ she said. “Perhaps there’s a better phrase for that, but scientist will do it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-variant-hunters-lead-global-race-to-stay-ahead-of-covid-101616943045465.html
28-03-2021||World||Suez Canal: Egypt president orders to prepare for ‘third scenario’ | All you need to know||After multiple failed attempts to refloat the giant container ship, Ever Given, stuck sideways in the Suez Canal, the head of the canal authority on Sunday said that the officials were preparing for the ‘third scenario’, according to The Washington Post. Osama Rabie, the chairperson of the Suez Canal Authority, reportedly told Egyptian television that President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi has ordered to prepare for the unloading of the Ever Given cargo carrier.While dredgers continue to vacuum up sand from underneath the vessel, two additional tugboats, the Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magna, have been called in to help the tugboats already there attempting to nudge the skyscraper-sized container ship. Leth Agencies, the canal's service provider, tweeted Sunday morning that the tidal conditions didn't help the overnight attempts of refloating Ever Given.Rabei had earlier expressed hope that dredging could free the ship without removing its cargo, however, added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.” Under the third scenario, some of the 18,000 containers will be unloaded from the 200,000-ton container ship which is disrupting a global shipping network. Rabie reportedly told the Egyptian channel that the unloading would require special equipment and the president authorised obtaining it as dredging continues.“His excellency has ordered that we should not wait for the failure of the first and second scenarios to start thinking about implementing the third one," Rabie was quoted by the Post as saying.Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, technical manager of Even Given which oversees the ship’s crew and maintenance, on Saturday announced that “significant progress” was made the previous night to free the vessel’s rudder from sediment. The company said in a statement that initial investigations rule out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.A top pilot with the canal authority told Associated Press that two attempts have been planned for Sunday to free the vessel. “Sunday is very critical. It will determine the next step, which highly likely involves at least the partial offloading of the vessel.” the pilot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-what-is-third-scenario-egypt-president-has-ordered-to-prepare-for-101616941871817.html

I took a thermometer... my temperature was normal," he told the state Rossiya 1 TV channel.He said he also had an uncomfortable feeling on the site of the injection.Putin did not reveal which of three Russian vaccines he had taken, saying only the doctor who inoculated him knows that.The Kremlin announced Putin's decision to get immunised against the coronavirus in December and the president said the delay was due to a need to combine it with other vaccines he planned to receive.Putin said that all three Russian vaccines, the most well-known and widely-available of which is Sputnik V, were almost equal.Nearly two-thirds of Russians are not willing to receive the Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Center, as of March 1, with most respondents citing side effects as the main reason.Russia started its vaccination campaign against the coronavirus in December. Last Monday Putin said that 4.3 million out of 144 million Russians had so far got two shots of a vaccine.Russia has registered over 4.5 million coronavirus infections to date.Putin said he expected Russia to reach herd immunity and lift pandemic-related restrictions by the end of summer.Herd immunity refers to a situation where enough people in a population have immunity to an infection to be able to effectively stop the disease from spreading.With the new coronavirus outbreak, some scientists hope that herd immunity would kick in when between 50% and 70% of a population is immune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-putin-felt-minor-side-effects-from-covid-19-vaccine-101616942183786.html
28-03-2021||World||Covid-19 fight stalls in early hot spots New York and New Jersey||A year after becoming a global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, New York and New Jersey are back atop the list of US states with the highest rates of infection.Even as the vaccination campaign has ramped up, the number of new infections in New Jersey has crept up by 37% in a little more than a month, to about 23,600 every seven days. About 50,000 people per week in New York are testing positive for the virus, a number that hasn’t much changed since mid-February.The two states now rank No. 1 and 2 in new infections per capita. New Jersey has been reporting about 647 new cases for every 100,000 residents over the past 14 days. New York has averaged 548.Neither state is experiencing anything like what they saw last spring, when hospitals — and morgues — were overflowing. And like the rest of the country, both are in a much better place than in January, at the peak of the pandemic's winter spike.But the lack of improvement or even backsliding in recent weeks has raised concerns that the states are opening too quickly and people are letting down their guard too much, just as potentially more contagious variants of the virus are circulating more widely.“When we’re seeing leveling off of cases or increase, that’s when it’s a time to rethink policies,” said Roy Gulick, chief of the infectious diseases division at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center.In February, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo allowed the state's largest stadiums to host sporting events and concerts again, albeit at only 10% of normal capacity. New York City movie theaters have been allowed to reopen. Restaurants can now operate at 50% capacity in New York City and 75% capacity elsewhere in the state. Indoor fitness classes have resumed, too.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has led a similar reopening, with the state's restaurants also allowed to operate at half capacity and barbers, salons and other personal care businesses resuming trade.That's happened in other parts of the country, too.Utah, Alabama, Arkansas and Indiana will end mask mandates in early April, joining states including Arizona, Texas, Mississippi, Montana and Iowa that have eliminated face covering requirements in recent weeks. Some states are allowing businesses to operate at full capacity.But in Illinois, the state public health director on Friday emphasized the need to keep wearing masks and socially distancing amid an increase in cases and hospitalizations. The single-day total of confirmed and probable cases of the illness topped 3,000 Friday for the first time in seven weeks, and hospitalizations have jumped 15% in the past five days.Murphy said in recent days that he is hitting pause on further loosening of the rules because of New Jersey's resurgence.The number of people hospitalized with the virus in New York has plateaued around 4,600 since mid-March. New Jersey hospitals are reporting about 2,200 virus patients — up by roughly 300 in the past couple of weeks.“They’re spreading more quickly and our vaccination rates are improving every week, but they are certainly not where we want them to be,” said Bruce Farber, chief of infectious diseases and public health and epidemiology for Northwell Health.Experts cite several potential factors, including the spread of potentially more contagious variants in the densely populated region.“Is there something different that’s happening in this part of the country compared to some other parts of the country?” asked Dr. Ed Lifshitz, the medical director of New Jersey’s communicable disease service within the state Health Department. “And the answer is probably yes.”New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has questioned whether Cuomo is easing restrictions “for political reasons," despite cause for concern. The governor is facing calls for his resignation over sexual harassment allegations.But then de Blasio himself announced that 80,000 more city employees would no longer work from home, starting in May.New York City's Public Advocate Jumaane Williams urged New York to pause reopening plans.“I ask the governor to stick to the science, trust the experts, and pause the planned reopenings now, before they take effect and more are infected,” Williams said.Experts worry the public is getting the message that increased vaccination means the state is in the clear, even though only a fraction of the public has completed a full course. Vaccines lessen the risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19, but scientists are still studying how well they prevent the spread of the virus.“To allow larger groups to gather, to give the message to the public that we’re over the worst and that we can go back to normal is a mistake,” Farber said.Stony Brook University professor and neuroepidemiologist Sean Clouston said growth in new cases is concentrated in younger people, who can't get vaccinated in New York unless they have specific health conditions or certain jobs. He said their infection rates could drop once they’re eligible, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-fight-stalls-in-early-hot-spots-new-york-and-new-jersey-101616942214564.html

Bild newspaper on Sunday reported that such an emergency meeting may decide on stricter limits to check the spread of the virus.Merkel last week made a rare public apology after she was forced to abandon a five-day hard lockdown over Easter just 33 hours after announcing it, throwing her government’s management of the pandemic further into disarray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rising-covid-19-cases-might-force-germany-into-a-harder-lockdown-101616940186279.html
28-03-2021||World||World Bank re-engages with Sudan following arrears clearance||The World Bank will shortly begin the process of allocating some $2 billion in grants to Sudan, a bank official said, representing the country's return to the international financial system after decades of isolation.Priority areas for the funds will be defined following meetings early next month, and allocations would take into account a peace deal signed last year, Ousmane Dione, World Bank country director for Sudan, said.The peace agreement, signed between the transitional government and several of the groups that fought ousted president Omar al-Bashir across the country, entails extensive development spending.In a statement on Friday, Sudan's cabinet had highlighted agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education as priority areas for investment."Making sure that those resources are being spent where they can contribute to reducing the gap between the centre and the periphery is extremely important," Dione told Reuters in an interview on Saturday.While Sudan's government is expected to "take the driver's seat" for those projects, they could include partnerships with the private sector where advantageous, he added.The World Bank's International Development Agency (IDA) committed on Friday to providing the $2 billion across the coming two years, purely in the form of grants.The new funding was made possible by the clearance of Sudan's arrears to the bank, which was facilitated by a $1.15 billion bridge loan from the United States, which the World Bank has repaid."What Sudan is currently liable for is to make sure the country doesn't fall back into arrears to IDA," said Dione, adding that the country carried no liability for the bridge loan. Some $215 million in direct budget support was allocated to Sudan to cushion the fiscal burden on government, he said.The government ruling following Bashir's ouster has made painful economic reforms including the reduction of energy subsidies and a currency devaluation, as the country implements an IMF-monitored programme amidst an economic crisis.Under Bashir, Sudan's ability to attract foreign lending and investment dried up, and it accumulated external debt estimated at $50 billion by the IMF.Sudan hopes to embark on a debt relief process in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-re-engages-with-sudan-following-arrears-clearance-101616936689722.html

28-03-2021||World||Before the Ever Given: A look at the crises that closed Suez||Since it opened in 1869, Egypt’s Suez Canal has been a source of national pride and a focus of international conflict. It is one of the world’s great maritime shortcuts, connecting the Red and Mediterranean Seas through a narrow passage that chops thousands of miles off most east-west shipping voyages.Now, a different sort of crisis has thrust the Suez Canal into the global spotlight. A skyscraper-sized container ship called the Ever Given got stuck sideways across the waterway last week. The obstruction has halted canal traffic — valued at over $9 billion a day — disrupting a global shipping network already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of ships waiting to cross the canal have piled up in a colossal traffic jam. With the vessel's bow still firmly lodged in the eastern bank, other shippers are opting to take the long route around the Cape of Good Hope.Nearly 19,000 vessels passed through the Suez Canal last year, carrying over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the world’s oil. While its shutdown this week is historic, the canal is no stranger to disruption. Here’s a look at some major incidents that have closed or threatened the bottleneck in the past.THE “SUEZ CRISIS”In 1956, Egypt’s then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal. The seizure, celebrated by Egyptians as a defiant break from European imperialism, prompted Britain, France and Israel to intervene militarily and occupy the canal zone.As fighting raged, sunken ships sealed off the canal for months. The United States and the Soviet Union, which openly opposed the invasion, ultimately forced the three countries to withdraw. Egypt was able to reopen the canal in March 1957, in what was seen across the region as a victory for pan-Arab nationalism.THE 1967 MIDEAST WARA decade later, at the outbreak of the 1967 Mideast war, Egypt closed the canal to international shipping as Israeli forces struck again at the canal zone and entrenched in the Sinai Peninsula. This time, the canal was shut for eight years. Accumulating mines, bombshells and sunken vessels, the waterway became a fortified trench in the war. It was only after peace talks with Israel that Nasser's successor, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, reopened the waterway in 1975.During the closure, over a dozen cargo ships were stranded midway through the canal in the Great Bitter Lake. The closed canal cost the world $1.7 billion in lost trade and increased shipping costs and Egypt $250 million in lost toll revenues annually, according to a U.N. study.The shutdown forced Europe-bound vessels to avoid Suez by rounding the southern tip of Africa, encouraging shippers to find economies of scale by developing increasingly large supertankers — a trend that, ironically, led ships to swell to the size of the stranded Ever Given.A TARGET FOR MILITANT ATTACKSThe canal divides mainland Egypt from the restive Sinai Peninsula, where the Egyptian military has been fighting a yearslong insurgency led by a local affiliate of the Islamic State group. The violence has threatened to spill over and disrupt global trade. In the summer of 2013, a Sinai-based militant group called the Furqan Brigades attacked two vessels in the waterway with rocket-propelled grenades, causing slight damage. Despite repeated vows to target the waterway, Egyptian militants so far have failed to impact maritime traffic there.OTHER SHIPS HAVE RUN AGROUNDGroundings of vessels previously have closed the narrow waterway, which can be difficult to navigate when there’s poor visibility. The first reported accident occurred in 1937, when high winds and rain squalls caused the U.K.-owned passenger liner Viceroy of India to ram into the bank and halt marine traffic for a day. Over the century, several other freighters have crashed or briefly shut down the waterway for up to three days, including a Greek-owned oil tanker in 1954, a Russian tanker in 2004 and a container ship that broke down in 2018 and triggered a multi-ship collision.In all cases, however, the groundings were swiftly resolved. Never before has a ship become wedged athwart the width of the canal, like the Ever Given.THE EVER GIVENThe giant 400-meter-long (quarter-mile-long) Ever Given, a Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship that hauls cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck last Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal. The ship's operators insist it crashed into the bank because of strong winds and a sandstorm, but the circumstances of the grounding remain unclear. Egyptian authorities suggested Saturday that human error may have been a factor.A squadron of tugs and diggers continued their struggle to free the Ever Given on Sunday. But without any significant progress, authorities may be forced to offload the vessel's containers — an operation that could take days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/before-the-ever-given-a-look-at-the-crises-that-closed-suez-101616937534667.html

The Vatican, a sovereign city-state surrounded by Rome, has applied similar measures.Nearly everyone who took part in the Mass, except the pope and the choir, wore masks.The Vatican re-created the traditional Palm Sunday service, albeit on a much smaller scale, with the 84-year-old pope and the cardinals processing to the altar holding palm fronds.Palm Sunday commemorates the day the gospels say Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was hailed by the people, only to be crucified five days later.During the Mass, the pope had a pronounced limp. He suffers from sciatica, which causes pain in his legs when it flares up.In his homily during the Mass, televised and streamed worldwide, Francis encouraged people to keep their faith from growing dull from habit and to let themselves be amazed by God and by good."With the grace of amazement we come to realise that in welcoming the dismissed and discarded, in drawing close to those ill-treated by life, we are loving Jesus. For that is where he is: in the least of our brothers and sisters, in the rejected and discarded," he said.The remainder of the pope's Holy Week services - Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter next Sunday, also will take place with a limited number of participants.Italy has registered 107,636 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-leads-scaled-down-palm-sunday-service-says-remember-the-downtrodden-101616926267305.html
28-03-2021||World||Beijing enveloped in hazardous sandstorm, second time in two weeks||The Chinese capital Beijing woke on Sunday morning shrouded in thick dust carrying extremely high levels of hazardous particles, as a second sandstorm in two weeks hit the city due to winds from drought-hit Mongolia and northwestern China.Visibility in the city was reduced, with the tops of some skyscrapers obscured by the sandstorm, and pedestrians were forced to cover their eyes as gusts of dust swept through the streets."It’s quite serious today. There’s always a day or two like this (of pollution or dust) each month," said Mr. Fan, 39, who did not wish to disclose his full name.Beijing's official air quality index reached a maximum level of 500 on Sunday morning, with floating particles known as PM10 surpassing 2,000 micrograms per cubic metre in some districts.Readings of smaller PM2.5 particles were above 300 micrograms per cubic metre, far higher than China's standard of 35 micrograms.PM2.5 particles are especially harmful because they are very tiny and can enter the bloodstream, while PM10 is a larger particle that can enter the lungs.The China Meteorological Administration issued a yellow alert on Friday, warning that a sandstorm was spreading from Mongolia into northern Chinese provinces including Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Liaoning and Hebei, which surrounds Beijing.The meteorological office said the recent sandstorms to hit Beijing originated from Mongolia, where relatively warmer temperature this spring and reduced rain resulted in larger areas of bare earth, creating favorable conditions for sandstorms.Beijing might face more sandstorms in April due to the unfavorable weather this year, the meteorological office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-enveloped-in-hazardous-sandstorm-second-time-in-two-weeks-101616934333360.html

With the accord, the UAE will become the first Gulf state to set up a coronavirus vaccine production facility, boosting its efforts to become a supply hub to the Middle East and beyond.The company, also known as Julphar, said it signed the agreement with Abu Dhabi’s G42 Medications Trading. G42, which describes itself as an artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm, had helped roll out trials of the Sinopharm vaccine in the country.The state-backed Sinopharm vaccine was approved in the UAE last year after local late-stage trials showed it was 86% effective in preventing infections -- the country has since overseen one of the world’s fastest inoculation drives, with most people having received the Chinese vaccine.The Sinopharm vaccine can be transported and stored at normal refrigerated temperatures, making it a candidate for vaccination programs in the developing world. The company’s annual production capacity for Covid vaccines is set to reach 3 billion doses, its chairman Yu Qingming said this month, without giving a time frame.While the UAE has approved vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc as well as Russia’s Sputnik V, its inoculation program hinged on Sinopharm given early availability and the potential to produce the shots locally -- key to the UAE’s aspirations of becoming a supply hub.In November, Abu Dhabi launched the Hope Consortium, a logistics grouping with the capacity to distribute more than six billion vaccine doses. The consortium includes the emirate’s Department of Health, Etihad Cargo, Abu Dhabi Ports Group, Rafed and SkyCell.In neighboring Dubai, companies including Emirates airline, ports operator DP World and Dubai Airports have also formed an alliance to move two billion doses of vaccines around the world this year, focusing on emerging markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-picks-uae-as-regional-production-hub-for-sinopharm-vaccine-shot-101616933643147.html

The center-left Social Democrats placed third, with 17%, according to the poll of 1,447 voters with a margin of error of up to 3 percentage points.“The situation is very serious,” Markus Soeder, the governor of Bavaria and a possible contender to succeed Merkel in September, told Bild am Sonntag. “The corona numbers are rising and the Union’s ratings are falling.”The grouping of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and Soeder’s Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, which won almost 33% of the vote in 2017, has been hit by a scandal over lawmakers’ allegedly profiting from mask procurement deals and frustration over Germany’s sluggish coronavirus vaccination campaign.By Friday, just over 10% of the population had received at least one shot of Covid-19 vaccine, while 4.5 % had received both doses.Meanwhile, Germany’s disease control agency reported 17,176 newly confirmed cases and 90 deaths over the past day.“A mood for change is arising in the country,” Soeder was quoted as saying. “The Union needs to show that it’s still got strength and ideas, and isn’t exhausted and worn out.”Soeder is trying to position himself ahead of Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, in the race to lead the Union bloc into the Sept. 26 election.Merkel has said she won't run for a fifth term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chancellor-merkel-s-bloc-dips-in-polls-6-months-before-german-vote-101616932647824.html

The country has inoculated 65,000 medical personnel, people age 80 and over, and schoolteachers so far.Albania, which has a population of 2.8 million, has signed contracts for a total of about 2.5 million vaccine doses from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac. The government is continuing to work on securing new vaccine contracts so the entire population can be fully vaccinated by early 2022.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Edi Rama went to Turkey and brought back the 192,000 Sinovac doses. The remainder of the 500,000 Sinovac doses Albania is due to receive will come in two months.Rama also said Sinovac would build a factory in Albania to produce different vaccines.Albania aims to give at least 10,000 shots a day and to complete 500,000 jabs by June, Health Minister Ogerta Manastirliu said.“This process will not stop and our ambitious plan of vaccination aims that in 14 months we complete it (for the entire population) and achieve immunization,” the minister said.The government aims to make the country ready to welcome tourists this summer. In the years before the virus outbreak, tourism became a significant industry in the country’s economy.“I believe that this tourist season will be more relaxed as a result of the attacks against the chain of infections,” Rama told journalists after touring the vaccination center at the square.Foreign tourists coming to Albania won't be required to show proof that they've been inoculated with a coronavirus vaccine.Albania has registered more than 123,000 coronavirus cases and 2,204 confirmed deaths as of Saturday, according to health authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/albania-starts-mass-covid-vaccinations-before-tourist-season-101616932083500.html

When to watch in India||The moon will be at its fullest and brightest on Sunday night in the eastern sky, appearing opposite the Sun in Earth-based longitude. The moon will appear full for about three days, from Saturday morning through Monday night into early Tuesday morning. According to Nasa’s solar system exploration website, this full moon is also called the Worm Moon, the Paschal Moon, the Holi Festival Moon, the Shab-e-Barat Moon, and, by some definitions, a Supermoon.Why is it called Worm Moon?For centuries, people around the world have been naming the full moon after nature’s cues, and the Old Farmer's Almanac, which began publishing Moon names for each month of the year, has named it the Worm Moon. The earthworms start to appear at the beginning of spring due to summer heat underground, allowing birds to feast. As India celebrates Holi during this period, in the Hindu month of Phalguna and the start of spring, the full moon corresponds with this festival.Astrologer Richard Nolle coined the term ‘Supermoon’, which refers to either a new or full moon that occurs when it is within 90% of perigee, its closest approach to Earth. A supermoon can appear as much as 14% larger and 30% brighter than normal, depending on the time of year.Dr Daniel Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, told Daily Mail that supermoons encourage people to go out thinking the moon will be much larger than normal. He said that in reality, “supermoons are never huge at all so don't get fooled in thinking that you can see it being larger than usual”.Worm Moon time in India and the USIn India, the moonrise is expected to occur at around 6.36pm IST on Sunday, March 28, and the Earth’s natural satellite is expected to set at 7.02am on Monday morning, according to Time and Date. It will be at its fullest at 12.18am IST on Monday. In the US, the full Moon will be on Sunday afternoon at 2.48pm EDT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/super-worm-moon-to-glow-in-the-sky-on-sunday-when-to-watch-in-india-101616930705789.html
28-03-2021||World||Did Covid-19 stress, uncertainty stall anti-smoking push?||A year after Covid-19 upended life for millions of Americans, there are troubling signs that the coronavirus may have also slowed progress against another deadly health threat: smoking.Fewer smokers called quit-smoking hotlines last year and some smoked more, contributing to an unusual bump in cigarette sales — all in the middle of the stress, anxiety and uncertainty from the pandemic.“It’s hard for folks to quit using tobacco in the best of times, so what happens when life is suddenly turned upside down?” said Jen Cash, who oversees Minnesota’s anti-tobacco programs.Researchers are already concerned about Covid-19's impact on cancer screenings and opioid overdoses as many Americans were cut off from routine care and examinations. But services to help smokers quit -- delivered via phone and online -- would seem well-positioned to withstand the disruptions of the pandemic. The programs help with devising a plan and often provide free nicotine gums and patches.Yet, calls to states routed through a national hotline fell 27% last year to about 500,000 — the biggest drop in a decade, according to the North American Quitline Consortium. In a recent report, the coalition of anti-smoking counselors cited the pandemic and the drop in public awareness messaging."It's really disturbing to see that the quit line calls have gone down so much because they’re exactly what I hoped would be going up,” said Dr. Nancy Rigotti of Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the report.In a separate survey of 1,000 adult smokers, Rigotti and her colleagues found about a third reported smoking more during the first six months of the pandemic.Alli Comstock of Los Angeles had been smoke-free for seven years when she lost her child care job last March because of the pandemic. Facing her first long-term stretch of unemployment, she started smoking again, out of a combination of boredom and anxiety.“It just felt like something else to do and it made me feel calmer,” said Comstock, 32, adding that she knows cigarettes, which contain the stimulant nicotine, don't help relieve anxiety.Comstock eventually quit again after months of feeling like “we were in a time when it didn't matter.”“In November, I realized it did matter and that I was a smoker, and I didn't want to be that,” she said.Research has linked other traumatic events to relapses among ex-smokers, including after the 9/11 attacks.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it’s too early to gauge the pandemic’s impact on smoking rates. In a statement, the CDC noted that although cigarette sales spiked around the first lockdowns last March, they have since fallen back to earlier levels. That suggests the rise was mainly smokers stocking up on cigarettes.The US smoking rate has held steady at around 14% in recent years after a decades-long decline from over 40% in the 1960s. Smoking, which can cause cancer, strokes and heart attacks, is blamed for about 480,000 annual deaths.Because smoking overlaps with many other forms of addiction, the data on quit attempts is being closely watched by doctors who treat people who abuse drugs and alcohol, many of whom also suffer from depression and anxiety.Dr. Brian Hurley of Los Angeles County's health department says those with addictions are less likely to recover if they continue to smoke. Last year’s drop in hotline calls suggests “a maelstrom of worse outcomes" said Hurley, a board member of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.Quitting, though, is notoriously difficult with just 7% succeeding, according to CDC figures. Many smokers are referred to quit-smoking hotlines at their annual checkup. Those appointments largely stopped last spring along with most other non-essential care.Still, last year’s data on quit-smoking calls includes glints of positive news. Smokers who called Minnesota’s hotline reported smoking more, but also said they were more motivated to quit because of Covid-19. That mirrored national data showing smokers are aware that smoking can make them more vulnerable to serious illness from a coronavirus infection.Experts seeking to explain last year's trends also point to a drop in anti-smoking advertising campaigns from public health departments. In many cases, those promotions were replaced by messages about masking, social distancing and hand-washing.The CDC recently resumed its national “Tips from Smokers” advertising campaign and is conducting its annual surveys of tobacco use among adults and teenagers, the definitive snapshot of US smoking and vaping.Prior to the virus outbreak, much of the focus was on the alarming rise in electronic cigarette use among high schoolers and middle schoolers. Survey data conducted before classrooms closed showed teen vaping was already falling compared to 2019, following new flavor bans and raising the legal age to buy them.With teenagers unable to attend school or regularly socialize with their friends, researchers speculate the pandemic may have further slowed the social spread of vaping.“I have a feeling it may have had a positive effect on teen vaping, but a negative effect for adult smoking,” said Rigotti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-covid-19-stress-uncertainty-stall-anti-smoking-push-101616931475622.html

He was arrested as he returned to Russia from Germany in January, where he had been recovering from what doctors said was a nerve agent poisoning.The 44-year old opposition politician has said in a statement that his request for treatment by a civilian doctor had been rejected and that he was being woken up by a guard every hour during the night in a deliberate attempt to undermine his health.Members of a local Public Monitoring Commission, a semi-official body with access to Russian prisons, visited Navalny in his penal colony 100 km (60 miles) east of Moscow on Friday."From a conversation (with Navalny) we learned that he feels pain in his leg and he asked for help in getting injections of Diclofenac to reduce pain. He is still able to walk," said Vyacheslav Kulikov, the head of the commission, in an online statement.A spokeswoman for a regional department of Russia's prison authority declined any immediate comment.Diclofenac is a medicine that reduces inflammation and pain and is used to treat problems with joints, muscles and bones, information on Britain's National Health Service website said.Navalny has said that his only treatment was two Ibuprofen pills per day and his diagnosis was unclear.The commission did not say if Navalny received the painkiller injections he asked for."We... made sure that his request had been recorded officially," Kulikov said.Navalny's lawyer Vadim Kobzev, who visited the politician the day before the public monitors, said he was not aware of his request for the painkiller injection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-navalny-currently-in-jail-asks-for-painkiller-injections-101616930850357.html

28-03-2021||World||Troops fire at funeral of 144 killed in Myanmar on bloodiest day since coup||Myanmar security forces opened fire on Sunday, witnesses said, at people gathered for the funeral of one of the 114 people killed the previous day, the bloodiest day of protests since the military coup on Feb. 1.There were no immediate reports of casualties in the firing on the funeral in the town of Bago, near the commercial capital Yangon, according to three people who spoke to Reuters."While we are singing the revolution song for him, security forces just arrived and shot at us," said a woman called Aye, who was at the service for Thae Maung Maung, a 20-year-old student who was shot on Saturday. "People, including us, run away as they opened fire."Two people were killed in firing on protests on Sunday in separate incidents elsewhere, witnesses and news reports said. One person was killed when troops opened fire overnight on a group of protesters near the capital Naypyitaw, Myanmar Now news reported.Also Read: Myanmar forces kill 114 people on deadliest daySo far on Sunday there were no reports of large-scale protests in Yangon or in the country's second city, Mandalay, which bore the brunt of the casualties on Saturday, Myanmar's Armed Forces Day. Funerals were held in many places.At least six children between the ages of 10 and 16 were among those killed on Saturday, according to news reports and witnesses.The bloodshed drew renewed Western condemnation. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Myanmar said the army was carrying out "mass murder" and called on the world to isolate the junta and halt its access to weapons.Foreign criticism and sanctions imposed by some Western nations have failed so far to sway the military leaders, as have almost daily protests around the country since the junta took power and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi."We salute our heroes who sacrificed lives during this revolution and We Must Win This REVOLUTION," one of the main protest groups, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities (GSCN), posted on Facebook.Saturday also brought some of the heaviest fighting since the coup between the army and the ethnic armed groups that control swathes of the country.Military jets had killed at least three people in a raid on a village controlled by an armed group from the Karen minority, a civil society group said on Sunday, after the Karen National Union faction earlier said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people. The air strikes sent villagers fleeing into the jungle.Fighting erupted on Sunday between another armed group, the Kachin Independence Army, and the military in the jade-mining area of Hpakant in the north. The Kachin forces attacked a police station and the military responded with an aerial assault, Kachinwaves media reported.There were no reports of casualties.A junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment on the killings or the fighting.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta leader, said during a parade to mark Armed Forces Day that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.'RINGING HOLLOW'Saturday's dead included 40 people in Mandalay and at least 27 in Yangon, Myanmar Now said. The casualties took the overall number of civilians reported killed since the coup to more than 440.Countries including the United States, Britain and the European Union strongly condemned the violence.Also Read: Myanmar army launches air strikes in Karen state, group saysU.N. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said it was time for the world to take action - if not through the UN Security Council then through an international emergency summit. He said the junta should be cut off from funding, such as oil and gas revenues, and from access to weapons."Words of condemnation or concern are frankly ringing hollow to the people of Myanmar while the military junta commits mass murder against them," he said in a statement.U.N. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu and U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet called the killings "shameful, cowardly, brutal actions of the military and police, who have been filmed shooting at protesters as they flee, and who have not even spared young children".The top military officer from the United States and nearly a dozen of his counterparts said in a statement that a professional military must follow international standards for conduct "and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves".The military took power saying that November elections won by Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the country's election commission. Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also in custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/troops-fire-at-funeral-of-144-killed-in-myanmar-on-bloodiest-day-since-coup-101616929358971.html

South Africa has been slow to secure vaccines, with just over 230,000 people inoculated so far.“During the mass vaccination phases we will need to be targeting about 200,000 people per day nationally, with variations across provinces because of the differing concentrations of population,” Mkhize told the newspaper.South Africa has confirmed 1.54 million coronavirus infections so far, the most in Africa, and more than 52,000 of those who were diagnosed with the disease have died, Mkhize said in a statement Saturday.The government said Thursday it aims to inoculate 1.5 million health-care workers by the end of April, another 13.4 million vulnerable people and essential workers between May and October, and 22.6 million others between November and February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-plans-covid-19-vaccination-for-200-000-people-daily-from-midmay-101616920685021.html
28-03-2021||World||Myanmar army launches air strikes in Karen state, group says||Myanmar army fighter jets launched air strikes on Saturday on a village near the Thai border in territory controlled by an armed ethnic group, the group said, as fears grow of civil war following last month's military coup.The Karen National Union (KNU), the armed ethnic group that controls the southeastern region, said fighter jets attacked Day Pu No in Papun district, an area held by its Brigade 5 forces, at around 8 pm, forcing villagers to flee."They bombed the area... The villagers from that area said two dead and two injured," a spokesperson for civil society group Karen Peace Support Network said, adding that communication was difficult in the remote region and there could be more casualties.A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls seeking comment.The reported air assault is the most significant attack for years in the region. The KNU had signed a ceasefire agreement in 2015 but tensions surged after the military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government on Feb.1.Earlier on Saturday, the KNU said Brigade 5 forces overran an army base, killing 10 soldiers including a lieutenant-colonel, as the junta celebrated its annual Armed Forces Day with a parade in the capital, Naypyitaw.The KNU says it has been sheltering hundreds of people who have fled central Myanmar amid mounting violence in recent weeks. The junta's troops killed dozens of people on Saturday, including children, in one of the bloodiest days of protests since the coup, news reports and witnesses said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-army-launches-air-strikes-in-karen-state-group-says-101616929799709.html

I hope our (living) conditions will get better, especially since there are a growing number of people going hungry," Stephane Silva said after attending mass.Religious gatherings will be banned from Monday until Easter to comply with stricter quarantine restrictions the Philippine government reimposed in the capital and nearby provinces to slow the sharp rise in COVID-19 infections.About 80% of people in the Philippines are Catholic.At the St. Peter Parish in Quezon City, candles were attached to empty pews to represent parishioners taking part in Palm Sunday celebrations outside the church or online.The Philippines is battling a renewed surge in infections, including those of the new and more transmissible variants, prompting the government to tighten existing curbs in the capital and nearby provinces.Coronavirus cases and deaths in the Philippines totalled 721,892 and 13,170, the second highest in Southeast Asia, with infections reported in the past nine days accounting for a tenth of the total.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-catholics-brave-covid-19-threat-to-celebrate-palm-sunday-101616920720963.html
28-03-2021||World||Suez update: Canal workers dredge to 18 Meters, 350 ships wait, Joe Biden offers to help Egypt||A new attempt could be made Sunday to re-float the 400-meter-long container ship blocking the Suez Canal.Tugs managed to shift the Ever Given about 29 meters on Saturday, and dredgers freed its propellers from the canal’s mud. The Suez Canal Authority’s chief declined to set a timetable for re-floating the ship and said the task remains “difficult.”The pile-up of ships is creating another problem for global supply chains already strained by the coronavirus pandemic. Companies including A.P. Moller-Maersk and Mediterranean Shipping Co. have redirected vessels around southern Africa. About 12% of global trade transits the canal that’s so strategic world powers have fought over it.Highlights:Canal authority dredges to 18 meters The Suez Canal Authority said in a statement it’s so far shifted 27,000 cubic meters of sand around the ship to reach a depth of 18 meters.More than 350 vessels waiting A further 23 vessels will arrive for transit through Suez Canal in the next 24 hours, according to Inchcape Shipping Services, a maritime services provider. There are 352 cargo vessels -- either moving or stationary -- within the waiting areas of Port Said Anchorage, Great Bitter Lake and South Suez Anchorage, the firm said.Syrian oil supplies delayed Syria’s oil ministry said the stranded ship has delayed the arrival of a tanker carrying fuel to the country. The government is rationing supplies as a result. “Waiting for the return of normal movement of navigation via the Suez Canal may take an unknown time,” it said.HMM to divert 3 ships around Africa HMM Co. will divert three container ships around Cape of Good Hope this week because of the Suez Canal blockage, a spokesman at South Korea’s biggest shipping company said Sunday.Two of the vessels, which can each carry 24,000 20-foot containers, are headed to Europe and the third to Asia.Ship Moved Slightly; Refloating Ops Halted Tugs working to refloat the Ever Given managed to shift the stricken container ship 29 meters (32 yards) on Saturday, and dredgers succeeded earlier in freeing the propellers from the sediment that’s glued the vessel to the bank of the Suez Canal since Tuesday.Dredging work will continue until 4 p.m. local time Sunday, at which point the refloating operations will resume, Inchcape Shipping Services said. Another two tugs are set to arrive, adding to the 11 currently on site, according to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, technical manager for the vessel.The Ever Given’s charterer said it could take at least a couple of days of dredging before enough mud and sand is cleared to attempt a refloat on a high tide. Meanwhile, the rescue team said it would start lifting containers off the vessel to lighten its load.Ship’s Propeller Is Free, More Tugs on WayEleven tugs worked throughout Saturday alongside the dredging operations which removed sand and mud from around the port side of the bow, according to a statement from Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the vessel’s technical manager. Another two tugs are set to arrive Sunday.The vessel’s rudder has been released from the sediment.Initial investigations have ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding, according to the statement.CMA CGM Diverts Two Vessels French shipping company CMA CGM Group has diverted two vessels, the Leo and the Attila, around the Cape of Good Hope, according to the firm’s web site.The Leo is en route from Charleston, South Carolina, to Port Klang, Malaysia. The Attila is plying a route from Kingston, Jamaica, to Singapore, according to shipping data.The company has 10 ships stuck in or near the canal, plus another nine partner vessels.Pumping Water Into Sand Could Work The Ever Given could be freed by pumping water into the sand beneath the vessel, the emeritus professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh told The Scotsman newspaper.“I would give it a 50/50 chance of working,” Professor Stephen Salter said.Ever Given Moves Slightly, Egypt Today Reports The ship has moved 30 meters northward, according to a tweet by Egypt Today Magazine, adding that this suggests the reflotation process will work.Line of Ships Grows Longer The number of ships waiting to enter the Suez Canal is lengthening as the waterway remains blocked. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows there are 429 vessels queued up Saturday, compared with around 100 at the start of the blockage.Bulk carriers typically hauling commodities such as grains, coal and iron ore account for the biggest share of the vessels stuck in and around the canal. The data also indicate as many as 14 vessels that could be carrying thousands of livestock.Canal Chief Sounds Optimistic Note The latest efforts to free the vessel have begun to pay off, and new attempts to refloat it could begin Saturday or Sunday, Suez Canal Authority chief Osama Rabie told reporters.Declining to lay out a timeline for when the operation could be completed, Rabie said 10 tug boats are on site. There are currently more than 320 ships waiting to move, and authorities are working to provide them with all necessary services.The canal is taking a revenue hit of as much as $14 million a day from the blockage, Rabie said.Excavation Could Take Days Excavation will take at least two to three days of digging to reach the required depth for the stranded ship to refloat, charterer Evergreen Line said in a statement dated March 26.Maersk Diverts 14 Container Ships South of Africa Logistics company AP Moller-Maersk A/S has diverted 14 vessel around the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, to avoid the Suez canal. The number of rerouted ships is up from 12 yesterday and the company said it expects the number to increase.“For every day the canal remains blocked, the ripple effects on global capacity and equipment continues to increase,” Maersk said in a statement.Dredging Set to ResumeTugs are connecting up to resume reflotation operations, according to Inchcape Shipping Service. Dredgers are currently working and there are some divers around the Ever Given vessel.Egyptian Prime Minister Comments In the first public comment from an Egyptian government official on the incident, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the country was racing against time to restore movement to the facility vital to the entire world and was keen to complete the work as soon as possible.Livestock Vessels Stranded Several vessels laden with livestock and containers en route to Jordan are stranded near the Suez Canal, Captain George Dahdal, Representative of Jordan Navigation Syndicate, said by phone. Seven vessels loaded with 92,000 livestock that were supposed to arrive to Aqaba on March 21 are stranded. Other vessels loaded with containers including food and other commodities are still stuck due to the traffic jam, Dahdal said.Qatar Airways Gets Air Freight Queries Qatar Airways, one of the world’s largest cargo airlines, said shippers stuck in the canal were sending queries as a precautionary measure. The airline expects “to see firmer interest in the coming days if the situation remains the same,” a spokesperson for the company said in response to questions from Bloomberg.Timing Couldn’t be Worse, Moody’s SaysThe canal’s temporary closure might affect 10%-15% of world container throughput, Moody’s Investors Service estimated earlier this week. Under normal circumstances, the temporary delays in global supply chains would not be a “big issue,” it said. However, a global shortage in container capacity and low service reliability has made supply chains highly vulnerable to external shocks despite high consumer demand, its analysts said.“The timing of this event could not have been worse,” analysts including Daniel Harlid wrote in a March 25 report.Insurers May Be on Hook for Millions There were potentially thousands of insurance policies taken out on the steel boxes stacked high on Ever Given. They could result in millions of dollars in payouts.The blockage is set to unleash a flood of claims by everyone affected, from those in the shipping industry to those in the commodities business.

28-03-2021||World||UK eases lockdown but nervously eyes European virus surge||Britain is taking another small step out of lockdown as it looks nervously at a new virus surge inundating its European neighbors.With U.K. coronavirus vaccination rates outstripping those of European Union nations, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is easing the stark “stay at home” message that has curtailed everyday life — and kept the virus in check — for almost three months.From Monday, it will be replaced in England with a message to stay local. People will be allowed to meet in groups of six outdoors and can resume outdoor sports such as basketball, tennis and golf.The other parts of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are taking broadly similar steps. In Wales, thousands of people poured onto beaches and beauty spots on Saturday, after the authorities lifted travel restrictions that have been in place since December.Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service in England, urged people to continue to follow the rules and limit contact with others, saying the easing “does not mean job done.”“We’ve made enormous progress that we need to build on and not squander the gains we’ve made,” he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.The stringent restrictions in business and social life imposed during three lockdowns in the past year have had broad public support, though they have alarmed some lawmakers in Johnson’s Conservative Party, who argue that the economic, democratic and human costs outweigh the benefits.Most nonessential businesses remain closed, along with pubs, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theaters, museums and sports stadiums. Millions of workers have been furloughed, with the government paying the bulk of their wages.The U.K. has recorded more than 126,000 Covid-19 deaths, the highest toll in Europe.While many European nations are seeing a new surge in the pandemic, Britain is counting on a rapid mass-vaccination program to help it end lockdown. Nearly 30 million people, accounting for 56% of all adults, have received a first dose of vaccine so far.Under the government’s “road map” to lifting lockdown, shops, hairdressers and outdoor dining in England are to reopen on April 12, followed by indoor venues on May 17. Remaining restrictions are to end June 21, if the country isn't facing a new virus surge.Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, said it was vital that people who had received a vaccine shot remained cautious.“It’s really important that people who are vaccinated can remember that they aren’t completely protected,” he told the BBC.“They’re protected against severe disease, hospitalization and death, but they might not be protected against infection after one dose, it takes three or four weeks for the vaccine effects to kick in, and they could potentially still transmit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eases-lockdown-but-nervously-eyes-european-virus-surge-101616929586124.html

The annual tradition of turning off lights for one hour between 8.30pm to 9.30 pm was followed once again to spread awareness about sustainability and climate change. The tradition was started by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in 2007 when the international non-governmental organisation encouraged 2.2 million people to turn off their lights for an hour. This year the organisation invited people from across the world to share the must-watch videos on social media in order to raise awareness. "This year, we invite you to spread the same message and re-create the same unmissable sight online by taking part in our first-ever Earth Hour Virtual Spotlight," WWF said in a statement.Earth Hour has become a worldwide event and global landmarks have also switched off electric lights for an hour.

28-03-2021||World||Bangladesh violence spreads after PM Modi visit, attacks on Hindu temples, train||Hundreds of members of a hardline Islamist group attacked Hindu temples and a train in eastern Bangladesh on Sunday, police and a local journalist said, as violence spread across the country in the wake of a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.At least 10 protesters were killed in clashes with police during demonstrations organised by Islamist groups against the Indian leader's visit, and violence raged on after his departure as anger swelled over the deaths.Modi arrived in Dhaka on Friday to mark the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's nationhood, and he left on Saturday after gifting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina some 1.2 million Covid-19 vaccine shots.The Islamist groups accuse Modi of discriminating against minority Muslims in Hindu-majority India and violence escalated rapidly during his visit.On Friday, dozens of people were injured in the densely-populated capital Dhaka as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. Thousands of Islamist activists marched down the streets of Chittagong and Dhaka on Saturday in protest.On Sunday, activists with the Hefazat-e-Islam group attacked a train in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria, resulting in ten people being injured."They attacked the train and damaged its engine room and almost all the coaches," one police official told Reuters, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.“Brahmanbaria is burning. Various government offices were set on fire indiscriminately. Even the press club was attacked and many injured, including the press club president. We are in extreme fear and feeling really helpless,” Javed Rahim, a journalist in the Brahmanbaria town, told Reuters by phone.Several Hindu temples in the town were also attacked, he said.Islamist activists allegedly also set alight two buses in the western district of Rajshahi on Sunday, while hundreds of protesters clashed with police in Narayanganj, pelting them with stones, police said.Protesters used timber and sand bags to block roads, as police retaliated with rubber bullets and tear gas, leaving dozens injured in Narayanganj, just outside the capital, Dhaka.The protests sparked by Modi's visit have since flared into wider demonstrations against police killings, and the Hefazat-e-Islam enforced a nationwide strike on Sunday."Police opened fire on our peaceful supporters," Hefazat-e-Islam’s organising secretary Azizul Haque told a rally in Chittagong on Saturday. "We will not let the blood of our brothers go in vain."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-spreads-after-pm-modi-visit-attacks-on-hindu-temples-train-101616924882038.html

The two suspects were the only fatalities."I strongly condemn this act of terrorism and I have ordered the police chief to thoroughly investigate the perpetrators' networks and tear down the networks to their roots," President Joko Widodo said in an online broadcast following the attack.Authorities were looking into which radical networks the bombers came from and whether the attack was linked to recent arrests of suspected militants, national police spokesman Argo Yuwono said.In January, a counter-terrorism unit raided a militant hideout in Makassar and killed two men suspected by police of involvement in twin bombings at a Philippine church in 2019 that killed more than 20 people.Jokowi, as the president is widely known, urged people to remain calm and said everybody could worship "without fear".Father Wilhemus Tulak, a priest at the church, told Indonesian media that a suspected bomber tried to enter the church grounds on a motorbike, but had been stopped by a security guard.Security camera footage showed a blast that blew flame, smoke and debris into the middle of the road.Ansyaad Mbai, former chief of the National Counterterrorism Agency, said the perpetrators were likely part of the same group responsible for a bombing in Jolo, the Philippines, in 2020."They want to show that they still exist and use this to propagate their group and recruit new members," he said.Police blamed the Islamic State-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah group for suicide attacks in 2018 on churches and a police post in the city of Surabaya that killed over 30 people.Makassar, Sulawesi's biggest city, reflects the religious makeup of Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country with a substantial Christian minority and followers of other religions."Whatever the motive is, this act isn't justified by any religion because it harms not just one person but others, too," Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, Indonesia's religious affairs minister, said in a statement.Gomar Gultom, head of the Indonesian Council of Churches, described the attack as a "cruel incident" as Christians were celebrating Palm Sunday, and urged people to remain calm and trust the authorities.Indonesia's deadliest Islamist militant attack took place on the tourist island of Bali in 2002, when bombers killed 202 people, most of them foreign tourists.In subsequent years, security forces in Indonesia scored some major successes in tackling militancy, but more recently there has been a resurgence of militant violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-president-condemns-church-attack-as-terrorism-101616922520142.html
28-03-2021||World||Chinese digital art mocks Western criticism of labour conditions in Xinjiang||A digital illustration by a prominent Chinese propaganda artist mocking Western governments, media and businesses critical of labour conditions in Xinjiang has gone viral on China's social media.The digital art by the artist who goes by the name Wuheqilin, referring to a one-horned Chinese mythical beast, shows two figures with white pointed hoods interviewing a scarecrow in a field of cotton and Black slaves.One of the journalists holds up a microphone with a logo that looks similar to "BBC News".At the bottom of the illustration reads: "Can you tell us what unfair treatment you have suffered, Miss Scarecrow?""I've been sexually assaulted and abused," a placard next to the scarecrow says.Steadying the cross on which the scarecrow is held is a hooded figure wearing a Minneapolis police uniform, an apparent reference to the police officer who pressed his knee on the neck of a dying George Floyd last year.Western governments and rights groups have accused authorities in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, drawing fierce denials from Beijing, who says the camps are vocational training centres that help combat religious extremism.Earlier this year, BBC reported that women in the camps had been subject to rape, sexual abuse and torture.The Chinese foreign ministry said at the time that the BBC report was "without factual basis" and the people interviewed by the BBC have been "proved multiple times" to be "actors disseminating false information".Last week, Swedish clothing retailer H&M faced a public backlash in China when social media users circulated a statement the company made last year announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.Chinese celebrity endorsers have since dropped several foreign retail labels including Nike.The assault on Western brands followed coordinated sanctions by the United States, the European Union, Canada and Britain on Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which Washington has said have amounted to genocide.In Wuheqilin's illustration, which has garnered 1 million "likes", the blood-red letters "HM" can be seen carved onto the trunk of a tree, while in the background is a black antique cotton scale that looks similar to Nike's swoosh logo.Entitled "Blood Cotton Initiative", the illustration also refers to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), an international group that promotes sustainable cotton production which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, citing human rights concerns.Nike, H&M and a number of Western brands are BCI members.Wuheqilin, who has 2 million followers on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo, in December published a digitally manipulated image of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child, drawing the fury of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.Wuheqilin declined to comment when reached by Reuters.Nike, H&M and BCI did not immediately comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-digital-art-mocks-western-criticism-of-labour-conditions-in-xinjiang-101616923141152.html
28-03-2021||World||'We've made friends with it already': Villagers on ship blocking Suez Canal||Villagers on the banks of the Suez Canal are getting used to their unusual new neighbor. It’s 400 meters long, carries about $1 billion and nobody knows when it’ll leave.Towering above the low-rise red-brick homes, grazing buffalo and green farmland dotted with palm trees, the Ever Given stands like a monument to globalization marooned amid a typically Egyptian rural scene. And since the ship’s grounding last week brought one of the world’s busiest trade routes to a halt, residents have had rare front-row seats to an event whose outcome is key to the global economy.“We’ve never had a ship stuck around here for a very long time,” said a local woman who asked to be called Fatma and has spent her life within earshot of the shipping horns. She gestured to the hulking Ever Given, in whose spotlights the local children have been playing hide-and-seek at night. “We’ve made friends with it already!”As dredgers, tug boats and teams of engineers race to dislodge the ship, the inhabitants of the agricultural hinterlands north of Suez city are basking in the novelty. While some take selfies with the behemoth in the background or wave to the crew, others like Fatma daydream about what it was transporting to world markets.“I need to get a bedroom and a saloon for my new house; I want it French-style!” she chuckled, casting a wistful look at the vessel laden with potentially thousands of red, blue and green containers.The ships plying the waterway may come from all corners of the Earth, but for locals the 120-mile channel linking the Red Sea and Mediterranean that opened in 1869 is a source of Egyptian pride. As far back as the early second millennium BC, Pharaoh Senusret III is said to have established a predecessor connecting the seas using branches of the Nile River.President Gamal Abdel-Nasser nationalized the canal in 1956, wresting it back from eight decades of British control and sparking an invasion by Israeli, British and France forces that failed, cementing his status as an inspirational Arab leader. Current head of state Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi oversaw an $8 billion expansion that opened in 2015 and sought to boost traffic and revenue.With that initiative came stepped-up security. A fence erected in 2014 has blocked villagers from the canal’s edge, otherwise they say they might have befriended their temporary neighbors. Years ago when ships ran aground, villagers remember crew-members tossing sodas ashore to children.For people like Mohammed Awad, 39, who was born in Ismailia, another of the canal’s three cities along with Port Said, the conduit has been a way of life for generations. He grew up fishing in the canal with his father, and his grandfather worked on a dredger that removed the wreckage of ships sunk during the 1973 Yom Kippur conflict with Israel.The canal had been shut from 1967, when Arab countries and Israel fought the Six Day War, and was only re-opened in 1975. That was the last major closure, until now.Like all those living by the canal interviewed for this story, Awad recalls the strong winds and sandstorm that turned the sky yellow and cut visibility on the day the Ever Given ran aground.It’s an accident the state-run Suez Canal Authority says is losing it as much as $14 million a day. The canal generated $5.6 billion for the government last year, around 10% of its total revenue. Until a lengthy press briefing Saturday, authorities had released limited information about the event and access to the site remains heavily restricted.“I panicked when I first heard about the ship,” Awad said. “I know how important the canal is to all of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weve-made-friends-with-it-already-villagers-on-ship-blocking-suez-canal-101616922368823.html
28-03-2021||World||Myanmar protests continue a day after more than 100 killed||Protesters in Myanmar returned to the streets Sunday to press their demands for a return to democracy, just a day after security forces killed more than 100 people in the bloodiest day since last month's military coup.Protests were held in Yangon and Mandalay, the country’s two biggest cities, as well as elsewhere. Some of the demonstrations were again met with police force.At least 114 people were killed Saturday as security forces cracked down on protests against the Feb. 1 coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, according to the online news service Myanmar Now. The reported fatalities included several children under 16 years old.Similar tallies of the death toll were issued by other Myanmar media and researchers, far exceeding the previous highest death toll on March 14. The number of killings since the coup is now more than 420, according to multiple counts.The coup reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule and has again made Myanmar the focus of international scrutiny.The Saturday killings by police and soldiers took place throughout the country as Myanmar’s military celebrated the annual Armed Forces Day holiday with a parade in the country’s capital, Naypyitaw.The bloodshed quickly drew international condemnation, both from diplomatic missions within Myanmar and from abroad.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was shocked by the killings of civilians, including children.“The continuing military crackdown is unacceptable and demands a firm, unified & resolute international response,” he wrote on Twitter.In the United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet that his country was “horrified by the bloodshed perpetrated by Burmese security forces, showing that the junta will sacrifice the lives of the people to serve the few.”The military chiefs of 12 nations issued a joint statement condemning the use of force against unarmed people.“A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting — not harming — the people it serves,” it said. “We urge the Myanmar Armed Forces to cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions."The statement was issued by the defense chiefs of Australia, Canada, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.The human rights group Amnesty International revived criticism that the international community was not doing enough to end the state violence in Myanmar.“U.N. Security Council member states’ continued refusal to meaningfully act against this never-ending horror is contemptible,” said Ming Yu Hah, the organization’s deputy regional director for campaigns.The Security Council has condemned the violence but not advocated concerted action against the junta, such as a ban on selling it arms. China and Russia are both major arms suppliers to Myanmar’s military as well as politically sympathetic, and as members of the council would almost certainly veto any such move.In recent days the junta has portrayed the demonstrators as the ones perpetrating violence for their sporadic use of Molotov cocktails. On Saturday, some protesters in Yangon were seen carrying bows and arrows. It has said its use of force has been justified to stop what it has called rioting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-continue-a-day-after-more-than-100-killed-101616922461160.html
28-03-2021||World||NATO chief raises serious concern about China's military investment||North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) chief Jens Stoltenberg has raised serious concern about China's heavy investment in military equipment, claiming it will have a direct consequence on our security.According to The Standard (Hong Kong), Jens Stoltenberg at a media conference after the commencement of NATO said, "the military alliance does not regard China as an adversary, but of course, the rise of China has direct consequences for our security.""China is investing heavily in military equipment, including nuclear-capable missiles," Stoltenberg added."More importantly, China is a country that doesn't share our values. We see that in the way they deal with democratic protests in Hong Kong, how they suppress minorities in their own country, the Uyghurs, and also how they actually try to undermine the international rules-based order," Stoltenberg further added.Earlier this month, Stoltenberg called for the United States and European Union to quickly repair their alliance if they are to deal with the bullying of countries all 'over the world by China.He described China's behaviour as undermining the rule of law and he welcomed President Joe Biden's clear commitment to "rebuilding alliances and strengthening NATO".NATO, a military alliance between 30 European and North American countries, enduring a tough four years when former President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the group, claiming that European members were not paying their way.The NATO chief said that Europe is not big enough, the United States is not big enough. But together Brussels and Washington represent 50 per cent of the world's GDP and 50 per cent of the world's military market."So if you're concerned about the rise of China, the military and economic strength of China, that makes it even more important that we stand together, Europe and North America in NATO," Stoltenberg said.In December, in its report 'NATO 2030 - United for a New Era report', it said that the organisation must devote more time, political resources, and action to counter the security challenges posed by China. It also recommended a special unit within the Joint Intelligence and Security Division (JISD) to monitor Russia-China cooperation impacting Euro-Atlantic security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-raises-serious-concern-about-china-s-military-investment-101616921719625.html

When will the booster be given? The answer should be based on the results of future phase III clinical studies," Zhang said.Antibodies triggered by two Covid-19 vaccine products from Sinopharm both have "pretty good" neutralising effect on variants found in Britain and South Africa, Zhang told a news conference, citing results from lab tests using blood samples taken from clinical trial participants.Lab testing was ongoing for variants found in Brazil and Zimbabwe, Zhang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinopharm-needs-trial-results-to-decide-if-covid-19-vaccine-needs-booster-shot-101616920410093.html

28-03-2021||World||2 tugboats speed to Egypt's Suez Canal as shippers avoid it||Two additional tugboats sped Sunday to Egypt's Suez Canal to aid efforts to free a skyscraper-sized container ship wedged for days across the crucial waterway, even as major shippers increasingly divert their boats out of fear the vessel may take even longer to free.The massive Ever Given, a Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal. In the time since, authorities have been unable to remove the vessel and traffic through the canal — valued at over $9 billion a day — has been halted, further disrupting a global shipping network already strained by the coronavirus pandemic.The Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magno, called in to help tugboats already there, reached the Red Sea near the city of Suez early Sunday, satellite data from MarineTraffic.com showed. The tugboats will nudge the 400-meter-long (quarter-mile-long) Ever Given as dredgers continue to vacuum up sand from underneath the vessel and mud caked to its port side, said Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which manages the Ever Given.Workers planned to make two attempts Sunday to free the vessel coinciding with high tides, a top pilot with the canal authority said.“Sunday is very critical," the pilot said. “It will determine the next step, which highly likely involves at least the partial offloading of the vessel.”Taking containers off the ship likely would add even more days to the canal's closure, something authorities have been desperately trying to avoid. It also would require a crane and other equipment that have yet to arrive.The pilot spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.On Saturday, the head of the Suez Canal Authority told journalists that strong winds were “not the only cause” for the Ever Given running aground, appearing to push back against conflicting assessments offered by others. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei said an investigation was ongoing but did not rule out human or technical error.Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement maintains that their “initial investigations rule out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.” However, at least one initial report suggested a “blackout” struck the hulking vessel carrying some 20,000 containers at the time of the incident.Rabei said he remained hopeful that dredging could free the ship without having to resort to removing its cargo, but added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.”Asked about when they expected to free the vessel and reopen the canal, he said: “I can’t say because I do not know.”Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the company that owns the vessel, said it was considering removing containers if other refloating efforts failed.The Ever Given is wedged about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the canal's Red Sea entrance near the city of Suez.A prolonged closure of the crucial waterway would cause delays in the global shipment chain. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal. The closure could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Already, Syria has begun rationing the distribution of fuel in the war-torn country amid concerns of delays of shipments arriving amid the blockage.As of early Sunday, over 320 ships waited to travel through the Suez, either to the Mediterranean or the Red Sea, according to canal services firm Leth Agencies. Dozens of others still listed their destination as the canal, though shippers increasingly appear to be avoiding the passage.The world’s biggest shipping company, Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk, warned its customers that it would take anywhere from three to six days to clear the backlog of vessels at the canal. Already, the firm and its partners have 22 ships waiting there.“The current number (of) redirected Maersk and partner vessels is 14 and expected to rise as we assess the salvage efforts along with network capacity and fuel on our vessels currently en route to Suez,” the shipper said.Mediterranean Shipping Co., the world's second-largest, said it already had rerouted at least 11 ships around Africa's Cape of Good Hope to avoid the canal. It turned back two other ships and said it expected “some missed sailings as a result of this incident.”“MSC expects this incident to have a very significant impact on the movement of containerized goods, disrupting supply chains beyond the existing challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-tugboats-speed-to-egypt-s-suez-canal-as-shippers-avoid-it-101616917135468.html

28-03-2021||World||Expelled from Ubured States at night, migrants from Mexico weigh next steps||In one of Mexico's most notorious cities for organized crime, migrants are expelled from the United States throughout the night, exhausted from the journey, disillusioned about not getting a chance to seek asylum and at a crossroads about where to go next.Marisela Ramirez, who was returned to Reynosa about 4 a.m. Thursday, brought her 14-year-old son and left five other children — one only 8 months old — in Guatemala because she couldn't afford to pay smugglers more money. Now, facing another agonizing choice, she leaned toward sending her son across the border alone to settle with a sister in Missouri, aware that the United States is allowing unaccompanied children to pursue asylum.“We're in God's hands,” Ramirez, 30, said in a barren park with dying grass and a large gazebo in the center that serves as shelter for migrants.Lesdny Suyapa Castillo, 35, said through tears that she would return to Honduras with her 8-year-old daughter, who lay under the gazebo breathing heavily with her eyes partly open and flies circling her face. After not getting paid for three months' work as a nurse in Honduras during the pandemic, she wants steady work in the US to send an older daughter to medical school. A friend in New York encouraged her to try again.“I would love to go, but a mother doesn't want to see her child in this condition,” she said after being dropped in Reynosa at 10 p.m.The decisions unfold amid what Border Patrol officials say is an extraordinarily high 30-day average of 5,000 daily encounters with migrants. Children traveling alone are allowed to remain in the US to pursue asylum while nearly all single adults are expelled to Mexico under pandemic-era rules that deny them a chance to seek humanitarian protection.Families with children younger than 7 are being allowed to remain in the US to pursue asylum, according to a Border Patrol official speaking to reporters Friday on condition of anonymity. Others in families — only 300 out of 2,200 on Thursday — are expelled.Reynosa, a city of 700,000 people, is where many migrants are returned after being expelled from Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The Border Patrol has said the vast majority of migrants are expelled to Mexico after less than two hours in the United States to limit the spread of Covid-19, which means many arrive when it's dark.In normal times, migrants are returned to Mexico under bilateral agreements that limit deportations to daytime hours and the largest crossings. But under pandemic authority, Mexicans and citizens of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras can be expelled to Mexico throughout the night and in smaller towns.Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott acknowledged in an interview last year that agreements limiting hours and locations for deportations are suspended “on paper” but said US authorities try to accommodate wishes of Mexican officials. The US also coordinates with nongovernmental organizations.“I would never sit here and look at you and say Tijuana is not dangerous, Juarez is not dangerous, Tamaulipas (state) is not dangerous,” Scott said. “However, a lot of it is like any other US city. There are certain US cities that there are pockets of it that are very dangerous and there are pockets of it that aren’t.”Tamaulipas, which includes Reynosa, is among five Mexican states that the US State Department says American citizens shouldn't visit. A US travel advisory says heavily armed criminal groups patrol Reynosa in marked and unmarked vehicles.More than 100 fathers, mothers and children who were expelled overnight waited in a plaza outside the Mexican border crossing at sunrise Saturday, many bitter about the experience and scared to venture into the city. Several said they left Central American in the past two months because they could finally afford it, but information about President Joe Biden's more immigrant-friendly policies contributed to their decisions. Some reported paying smugglers as much as $10,000 a person to reach US soil.Michel Maeco, who sold his land in Guatemala to pay smugglers $35,000 to bring his family of five, including children aged 15, 11 and 7, said he was going home after a 25-day journey. He left Guatemala after hearing “on the news” that Biden would allow families to enter the United States.Maeco's family was expelled to the streets of Reynosa at 3 a.m. Saturday.“Supposedly (Biden) was going to help migrants, but I see nothing,” said Maeco, 36.A Honduran woman who declined to give her name said she left two months ago because her home was destroyed in Tropical Storm Eta and she heard Biden would “open the border” for 100 days — unaware that the president's 100-day moratorium on deportations, suspended by courts, doesn't cover new arrivals. She planned to send her 9-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son across alone to live with their aunt in Alabama while she returns to Honduras.Underscoring the dangers, the Border Patrol said Friday that a 9-year-old Mexican girl died crossing the Rio Grande near the city of Eagle Pass.Mexico's migrant protection agency, Grupos Beta, persuaded many overnight arrivals to be bused to a distant shelter. Crowds at the nearby park had thinned from a few hundred migrants days earlier.Felicia Rangel, founder of the Sidewalk School, which gives educational opportunities to asylum-seeking children in Mexican border cities, sees the makings of a squalid migrant camp like in nearby Matamoros, which recently closed.“If they get a foothold in this gazebo, this is going to turn into an encampment,” she said as a church distributed chicken soup, bread and water to migrants for breakfast. “They do not want another encampment in their country.”Martin Vasquez is among the migrants staying for now. The 19-year-old was expelled after being separated from his 12-year-old brother, who was considered an unaccompanied child and will almost certainly be released to a grandfather in Florida. He said he was inclined to return to Guatemala, where he worked for a moving company, but wanted to wait a while “to see what the news says.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expelled-from-ubured-states-at-night-migrants-from-mexico-weigh-next-steps-101616913372508.html
28-03-2021||World||Protesters opposing farm laws disrupt Holi celebration in Canadian city||Tension flared up in the city of Edmonton on Saturday as a celebration of the Holi festival by the Indo-Canadian community was disrupted by protesters opposing the three farm laws passed by India’s Parliament.Nearly 400 people gathered at the Heritage Valley Park in Edmonton, a city in the province of Alberta, to celebrate Holi, to be followed by a Peace and Harmony Indo-Canadian Tiranga Yatra organised by the Bharatiya Multicultural and Heritage Society of Alberta. The participants included families with children.However, they were confronted by a group of about 100 protesters shouting slogans against the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The protesters blocked the route that the car rally was to take, delaying the event for nearly three hours.Organisers of the celebration said some of the protesters also carried Khalistan flags, while the pro-Khalistan group Shirmani Akali Dal Amritsar (Canada) sent out a message saying the “rally was to demonise the farmers’ protest in India”.However, organisers of the Tiranga Yatra, who asked not be named, said their event had no political motive or agenda. “This was an expression of solidarity in the community as we haven’t been able to gather together to celebrate our festivals for over a year due to Covid-19,” an organiser said. She added that permission to hold the event and the car rally was taken weeks earlier from the city and police.Another organiser said while the rally was originally scheduled to commence at 1pm, it only began three hours later as the route the cars were to take was blocked by the protesters.Police cordoned off the protesters from the event participants but it took that much time to clear the area for the rally to proceed. The rally featured nearly 250 vehicles, flying both the Indian and Canadian flags, and lasted for about an hour.“We have been separated for a year and we were looking forward to being together but these nearly 100 protesters spoilt the day for some of us,” an organiser said.Recent car rallies by the Indo-Canadian community have been similarly disrupted, in some cases resulting in instances of violence. Incidents of assault and harassment were captured on video during a Tiranga-Maple Rally in the Greater Toronto Area on February 28, which resulted in the arrest of two persons, including Jodhveer Dhaliwal, brother-in-law of New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh.A Tiranga Yatra in Metro Vancouver on February 7, to celebrate Republic Day, resulted in protests outside the office of two of the organisers and also threats and intimidating phone calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-opposing-farm-laws-disrupt-holi-celebration-in-canadian-city-101616913402008.html
28-03-2021||World||Explained: Why US, Brazil witnessing surge in infection among youth||In the United States, several states including Florida and Michigan are reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases. However, this time the surge is not in people from the vulnerable section but in people under the age of 30 years old, an age group which was said to be at lesser risk of severe Covid-19, news agency Bloomberg reported citing data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Brazil, the second country after the US to have the highest death toll, is also witnessing a rise in the deaths among young people due to the Covid-19. It is also seeing an increase in the hospitalisation of younger patients, according to the data by the country's health ministry.In March, about 2,030 Brazilians aged 30 to 39 died from Covid-19. Among those in their 40s, there have been 4,150 fatalities in March, up from 1,823 in January, and for those 20-29, deaths jumped to 505 from 242, the government data showed. While patients above 60 and older continue to dominate hospital admissions, the share of those under 50 has risen to 15 per cent from 10 per cent last year.The situation is not limited to the US and Brazil only. In Canada as well, doctors are seeing an increase in hospitalisation of young Canadians with more severe complications from Covid-19, according to local media reports. A similar situation is being witnessed by Israel as well, where infections were recently plateauing despite the country’s world-leading immunisation program. It turned out that cases among young people were surging, even as infections dropped in the 50-and-older crowd.Why is it happening?So far, no research has emerged which could paint the exact picture of why the countries are witnessing this trend. However, experts have attributed the surge to the negligence in following the Covid-19 protocol. Throughout 2020, local and regional restrictions hampered social activities. This changed when authorities started loosening the lockdowns and holiday seasons. People gathered in groups and flocked back to the restaurants and bars; crowded the country’s beaches and attended live concerts, football matches.The second reason is said to be a delay in informing medics in case the person is infected with the Covid-19. For example, in Brazil, authorities have noticed that younger patients wait longer to seek health care and are sicker when they arrive, Bloomberg reported.The third reason speculated to be the young people at the last of the vaccination priority list. In many countries where the vaccination drive is underway, authorities are inoculating people most-at risk of severe Covid-19. This has also led to an increase in numbers.Covid-19 situation in IndiaThere is an onset of the second wave in India with the number of daily cases now hovering around 60,000. It had dropped to less than 10,000 in the first week of February after which the cases started to rise again. According to the figures provided by the Union health ministry, the country has a total of 11.97 million cases as of Sunday morning. While the death toll stands at 161,552.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-us-brazil-witnessing-surge-in-infection-among-youngs-101616911428301.html
28-03-2021||World||6 days on, Suez Canal still blocked: What we know so far||The Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest waterways, continued to remain blocked as a giant container ship is stuck sideways in it hindering global shipping and trade for the sixth day on Sunday.The 400 metre (430 yard) long Ever Given, which is wedged diagonally across a southern section of the canal, moved slightly as efforts underway to dislodge it allowed its stern and rudder to move, the head of the canal authority told news agency Reuters."We expect that at any time the ship could slide and move from the spot it is in," Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chairman Osama Rabie was quoted as saying by Reuters. He added that water had started running underneath the ship.About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the canal and hundreds of vessels are waiting to pass once the blockage is cleared, the agency reported.Here’s what we know so far about the Suez Canal blockage:*The MV Ever Given, which is longer than four football fields, has been wedged diagonally across the canal since Tuesday, blocking it in both directions.*Rabie on Saturday pointed to the possibility of "technical or human errors" behind the grounding of a huge container ship, which has led to a backlog of over 300 vessels, according to news agency AFP. "Strong winds and weather factors" were not solely responsible, he said adding, there "may have been technical or human errors".*On being asked by when the vessel may be removed, the Suez canal chief told AFP on Saturday, “We could finish today or tomorrow (Sunday), depending on the ship's responsiveness" to tides.*Dredgers removed some 20,000 tonnes of sand from around the ship’s bow by Friday, Reuters said and quoted a Dutch firm that is carrying out efforts to move the vessel that it could be freed by the start of next week if heavier tugboats, dredging and a high tide succeed in dislodging it.*Following the logjam, over 320 ships carrying billions of dollars-worth of cargo are now stalled at either end of the vital shipping lane linking Asia to Europe, according to AFP. Rabie told the agency that Egypt is suffering a loss of some $12-14 million in revenue from the canal for each day it is closed.*An expert cited by AFP said, "If they don't manage to dislodge it during that high tide, the next high tide is not there for another couple of weeks, and that becomes problematic." Plamen Natzkoff, an expert at VesselsValue added that the stakes are too high for it to take months.*Shipping rates for oil product tankers have nearly doubled after the stranding of the vessel and disrupted global supply chains threaten costly delays for companies already dealing with Covid-19 restrictions, Reuters said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-days-on-suez-canal-still-blocked-what-we-know-so-far-101616903531092.html

28-03-2021||World||Covid-19 keeps spreading death where vaccines haven’t reached||If you’re living in Israel, the US or the UK, where vaccination programs are rolling out with remarkable speed, glimpses of a post-pandemic future are starting to appear: Schools have mostly reopened, family gatherings are being planned and summer vacations may be just over the horizon.But move away from this handful of rich countries, and a darker reality emerges: The virus is still rampaging around most of the planet, and uneven vaccine distribution poses a major public risk as variants emerge.Since mid-March, Covid-19 deaths have started trending upward again worldwide even as the numbers improved in the U.S. and U.K., according to Johns Hopkins University data. Last week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the unequal supply of vaccines “is not just a moral outrage, it is also economically and epidemiologically self defeating.”Worldwide, half a billion vaccine doses have been administered, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. While shots have been given in some 140 countries, the vast majority have gone to developed nations that secured early doses by the hundreds of millions. That disparity risks prolonging the pandemic, even for places currently leading the vaccination race.“We need to try to bridge the gap between the vaccine haves and vaccine have-nots to really meet the goals that we’re seeking to achieve in ending this pandemic and getting our economies running again,” Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview.Covax, a facility that aims to distribute doses equitably around the globe, has started delivering shots to lower-income countries like Ivory Coast and Ghana, but the WHO has said more needs to be done.Here’s a look at how vaccine disparities and a resurgent virus are playing out in half-a-dozen countries.IsraelIsrael’s economy has mostly reopened now that half the country is fully vaccinated and new cases are plunging.People are flocking back to the restaurants and bars that survived the pandemic, crowding the country’s beaches and enjoying live concerts and football matches in the early days of spring.Israel is still closed to foreign tourists out of concern the spread of variants could undermine its vaccination program. Still, some hotels say they’re fully booked for the Passover holiday, which will be celebrated without new restrictions on movement. That’s a switch from last year, when lockdowns were imposed over the period to avoid a spike in cases.UKThe U.K. remains in a lockdown, but the government’s roadmap to reopening the economy has offered a pathway to normality for a population that’s being vaccinated faster than any of its European neighbors.The country recently passed the milestone of giving a first dose to more than half its adults. It set a daily record on March 20, inoculating almost 1.3% of the population on a single day. Hospitalizations also fell by more than a fifth from the week before, bringing some relief to the National Health Service.Schools have reopened and some employees are starting to return to offices in London’s financial districts, but residents won’t be able to eat at restaurants or buy non-essential goods in stores for another two weeks. Still, the government hopes to remove all lockdown restrictions, including allowing nightclubs to reopen, by June 21.USThe daily death toll has fallen steadily since mid-February as states pushed to speed vaccinations and balanced medical concerns with protests by anti-lockdown groups.Yet disparities remain. While New Mexico has given at least one dose to over a third of its population, Georgia has just managed a fifth. The inequities are also present among racial groups: in 16 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., less than 10% of the Hispanic population has been vaccinated as of Wednesday -- a milestone most states reached with White populations weeks ago. Still, more than a quarter of Americans have received their first vaccine dose.Restaurants in New York City -- once the pandemic’s American epicenter -- can now operate at 50% capacity indoors, with many diners taking advantage of covered sidewalk seating in Manhattan. The city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has announced plans for a vaccination center on Broadway to inoculate theater-industry workers in preparation for a planned re-opening in September.BrazilAbout a year after the virus first arrived and two months after vaccinations began, Brazil is going through its worst stretch of the pandemic yet.The vast Latin American nation reported 3,650 deaths on Friday, its highest daily toll. On Wednesday, it became just the second country after the U.S. to record 300,000 fatalities. Since starting inoculations in mid-January, just 6% of the population has received a dose. The crisis has prompted neighbors to close borders, impose travel bans and require forced quarantines.President Jair Bolsonaro, who long downplayed the coronavirus, has now promised to speed up vaccination efforts. The pathogen’s resurgence follows months of relatively lax rules, which included New Year’s celebrations and clandestine parties around the Carnival season in Rio de Janeiro. The upswing also coincided with the growing dominance of a more contagious strain discovered in the northern city of Manaus.IndiaIndia, a vaccine-making colossus key to supplying much of the world with low-cost shots, has struggled to immunize itself. Now the country of almost 1.4 billion is slowing exports to keep more doses at home after new infections climbed six-fold since February to more than 60,000 a day.This week, the government expanded the rollout to everyone over the age of 45 and has allowed its huge network of private hospitals to charge a subsidized rate for the vaccines. Those moves have boosted immunization rates and may help Prime Minister Narendra Modi reach a target of inoculating 300 million Indians by August.While India has been reluctant to reimpose lockdowns after a costly shutdown last year did little to halt the spread of the virus, there are increasing concerns that tighter restrictions may be needed.ItalyA year after it became Europe’s first virus hotspot, Italy has again been forced to impose a costly lockdown.In the nation with the highest death toll in the European Union, daily fatalities have been climbing since the start of the month as a highly contagious strain spreads across the country. Prime Minister Mario Draghi has been pressing the EU to lean on pharmaceutical companies to respect vaccine delivery commitments while warning that Italy will block exports by firms that breach contracts.A general has been appointed as a new virus czar to speed up the vaccine rollout and make sure that all Italian regions keep up the pace. Draghi hopes to gradually ease Italy’s lockdown after the Easter holidays and to vaccinate 80% of citizens by the end of September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-keeps-spreading-death-where-vaccines-haven-t-reached-101616895770906.html
28-03-2021||World||Top military officers from US, allies to condemn violence by Myanmar security forces||The top military officer from the United States and nearly a dozen of his counterparts are set to condemn on Saturday the deadly use of force by Myanmar's security forces and say the country's military has lost credibility with its people.The joint statement, obtained by Reuters ahead of its planned release this weekend, is a rare declaration by the most senior military commanders from countries around the world, including in Asia and Europe.It came after news reports and witnesses said Myanmar security forces killed 114 people on Saturday, including some children, on Armed Forces Day - the bloodiest day of its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters since last month's military coup."As Chiefs of Defense, we condemn the use of lethal force against unarmed people by the Myanmar Armed Forces and associated security services," read the draft statement.It was signed by 12 chiefs of defense from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, United Kingdom and the United States.Diplomats from these countries have already condemned the bloodshed by Myanmar's military, making the statement largely symbolic. Myanmar's military has so far ignored criticism of its violent crackdown on dissent.While the draft statement did not explicitly condemn the Feb. 1 coup, which ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, it said that a professional military must follow international standards for conduct "and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves."It said the country's military must "cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions."Myanmar's military has said it took power because November elections won by Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the country's election commission. Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her National League for Democracy party are also in custody.The deaths on Saturday, Myanmar's annual Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945, would take the number of civilians reported killed since the coup to more than 440.New U.S. and European sanctions this week increased external pressure on the junta. But Myanmar's generals have enjoyed some support from Russia and China, both veto-holding members of the U.N. Security Council that could block any potential U.N. action.Russia's deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin attended a parade in Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw on Saturday, having met senior junta leaders a day earlier.Diplomats said eight countries - Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand - sent representatives to the Armed Forces Day parade, but Russia was the only one to send a minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-military-officers-from-us-allies-to-condemn-violence-by-myanmar-security-forces-101616895536119.html
28-03-2021||World||5,000 gather in Barcelona after Covid-19 screen for non-distanced rock concert||If one overlooked the white face masks dotting the tightly packed crowd of music lovers, it was almost like pre-pandemic times in Barcelona's Palau Sant Jordi concert hall Saturday night.Five thousand rock fans enjoyed a real-as-can-be concert after passing a same-day coronavirus screening, to test its effectiveness in preventing outbreaks of the virus at large cultural events.The only rule inside the show was the strict use of the high-quality face masks provided by the concert organizers.“We were able to evade reality for a while," said 40-year-old Jose Parejo. "We were inside our small concert bubble. And we were even able to remember back in time when things like this one were normal. Things that nowadays aren’t that normal, sadly.”The show by Spanish rock group Love of Lesbian had the special permission of Spanish health authorities. While the rest of the country was limited to gatherings of no more than four people in closed spaces, the concertgoers were able to mix freely.The musicians were also swept up in the moment.“It’s been a year and half since we last set foot on a scenario as a band," singer Santi Balmes told the crowd. "This is so. ... some of the musicians are crying over here."Ticket buyers chose between three venues in Barcelona where they could take a quick antigen test on Saturday morning. Those with negative results got a code on their cellphones validating their tickets for the 7 p.m. show.People with heart disease, cancer, or those who have been in contact with someone infected by Covid-19 in recent weeks were asked not to sign up.Organizers said it was the first commercial event with an audience that big held in Europe during the pandemic.The show was sold out. The tickets, ranging from 23-28 euros ($27-33), included the cost of the test and the face mask that was obligatory except when eating or drinking in designated areas.The concert was backed by local authorities and by experts of Barcelona’s The Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, which also organized a case study around a smaller concert of 500 people in December. They said that the results of that preliminary case study showed that pre-screening with antigen tests and the use of face masks succeeded in preventing infections inside the concert despite there being no social distancing rules.“This is another small step toward being able to hold concerts and cultural events” during the pandemic, said Dr. Boris Revollo, the virologist involved in the design of the health protocols.In addition to being 10 times larger than the concert in December, this time there was no control group maintained outside the concert hall.Instead, concertgoers agreed public health authorities can inform Revollo’s team if they come down with the coronavirus in the weeks after the concert. With that information, Revollo’s team will do an analysis of infection rates among the 5,000 concertgoers compared with that of the general population to see if there are any discrepancies that could point to contagion at the concert.For 37-year-old Gerard Munne, it was a release.“A sensation of freedom, being able to feel the warmth of the people," he said. "(It was) yesterday’s normality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5000-gather-in-barcelona-after-covid-19-screen-for-non-distanced-rock-concert-101616895608192.html
28-03-2021||World||Germany must suppress Covid-19 now or risk losing control, says Merkel aide||Germany must bring down coronavirus infections in the next few weeks or risk new virus mutations that are resistant to vaccines, and should impose night-time curfews in regions with high caseloads, said a top aide to Chancellor Angela Merkel."We are in the most dangerous phase of the pandemic," Merkel's chief of staff Helge Braun told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. "The next few weeks will determine whether we can foreseeably get the pandemic under control."If the number of infections rises rapidly again there is a growing danger that the next virus mutation will become resistant to the vaccine, Braun said."Then we would need new vaccines, then we would have to start vaccinating all over again," he added.After a popular backlash and legal hurdles, Merkel was forced to ditch plans for an extended Easter holiday intended to try to break a third wave of Covid-19, but Braun said it remained imperative to reduce the number of infections.In regions where the number of cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days is more than 100, he spoke out in favour of additional curbs. "That's where regional curfews in the evening and at night can help, because we have the highest infection rates at meetings in people's homes," he saidCoronavirus infections have risen sharply in Germany in recent weeks, driven by a more transmissible variant of the virus and moves to ease some restrictions.On Saturday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 20,472, while the reported death toll rose by 157, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.Braun said he expected the infection situation to ease in May, helped by the impact of vaccinations and the onset of warmer weather. "By Whitsun (May 23) we will see the first positive effects - provided the situation doesn't get out of hand by then."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-must-suppress-covid-19-now-or-risk-losing-control-says-merkel-aide-101616895288092.html
28-03-2021||World||Ship blocking Suez Canal moves slightly, unclear when it will refloat||Efforts to dislodge a giant container ship blocking the Suez Canal have allowed its stern and rudder to move, but it remains unclear when the vessel will be refloated, the head of the canal authority said on Saturday.The 400 metre (430 yard) long Ever Given became wedged diagonally across a southern section of the canal amid high winds early on Tuesday, blocking one of the world's busiest waterways.A combination of dredging material from around the ship and pulling and pushing the vessel with tugboats made minor progress in dislodging the ship on Saturday, two SCA sources said. One source said there had been some movement at the bow of the ship.Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Chairman Osama Rabie told local TV that water had started running underneath the ship. "We expect that at any time the ship could slide and move from the spot it is in," he told a press conference earlier.About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the canal and hundreds of vessels are waiting to pass once the blockage has been cleared.Rabie said he hoped it would not be necessary to remove some of the 18,300 containers on board to lighten the ship's load, but strong tides and winds were complicating efforts to free it."The ship's stern began (on Friday) to move towards Suez, and that was a positive sign until 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) at night, but the tide fell significantly and we stopped," Rabie told journalists in Suez.Dredgers removed some 20,000 tonnes of sand from around its bow by Friday. A Dutch firm working to free the vessel said it could be freed by the start of next week if heavier tugboats, dredging and a high tide succeed in dislodging it.Tugging attempts restarted on Saturday afternoon and further efforts were planned for Sunday, SCA sources said, though they added more sand may need to be removed from around the ship to free it.A shipping agent in Port Said said the SCA had notified agencies to prepare for the possible entry of new ships into the canal, while a shipping source said the SCA had outlined a plan for the rapid transit of 133 vessels once the Ever Given was freed.HEAVY TUGBOATSThe head of Boskalis, parent company of Dutch firm Smit Salvage which has been brought in to help the SCA, said heavy tugboats with a combined capacity of 400 tonnes would arrive sometime this weekend."We aim to get it done after the weekend, but everything will have to work out exactly right for that," Boskalis Chief Executive Peter Berdowski told Dutch TV programme Nieuwsuur late on Friday.Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on Saturday thanked foreign partners for offers to help refloat the ship.Shipping rates for oil product tankers nearly doubled after the ship became stranded, and the blockage has disrupted global supply chains, threatening costly delays for companies already dealing with COVID-19 restrictions.If the blockage drags on, shippers may decide to reroute their cargoes around the Cape of Good Hope, adding about two weeks to journeys and extra fuel costs. Rabie said the ships that are waiting were free to reroute, but none had yet done so.He said 321 vessels were waiting to enter or continue their transit through the canal. Those included dozens of container ships, bulk carriers and liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vessels, according to a shipping source.Fourteen tugs have so far been involved in efforts to refloat the Ever Given, although Boskalis and Smit Salvage have warned that using too much force to tug the ship could damage it.Berdowski said a land crane could lighten the Ever Given's load by removing containers, though experts have warned that such a process could be complex and lengthy."If we don't succeed in getting it loose next week, we will have to remove some 600 containers from the bow to reduce the weight," he said. "That will set us back days at least, because where to leave all those containers will be quite a puzzle."Rabie said empty container ships with cranes could offload cargo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ship-blocking-suez-canal-moves-slightly-unclear-when-it-will-refloat-101616894743569.html

No details were provided.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said "multiple victims" were stabbed inside and outside the North Vancouver Library and that one suspect was in custody.It "appears this was a lone suspect," the RCMP said on Twitter, adding that it was still looking for "potential additional victims."Amy Robertson of B.C. Emergency Health Services said six people were taken to the hospital and that she was unable to release details on their condition, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported earlier."We were driving up ... and there was a woman right beside her car with a 7-year-old boy, multiple stab wounds and bleeding profusely ... She said it was a random stabber who was running down the street," a witness who gave his name as Steve told Canada's Global News.North Vancouver is a mostly quiet and wealthy suburb with about 85,000 people on the north side of Burrard Inlet, Vancouver's primary port. In 2019, North Vancouver was ranked 10th on Maclean's magazine list of the richest Canadian communities with an average household net worth of nearly C$2 million.Two bridges and a foot ferry connect North Vancouver to the city of Vancouver.

28-03-2021||World||2 dead, 3 arrested in Virginia Beach shootings, say police||Overnight shootings near the Atlantic oceanfront in Virginia Beach left two people dead and eight wounded in a scene described by authorities on Saturday as “very chaotic.”A woman who died was likely an innocent bystander, authorities said, while the other person was killed by a police officer whose body camera was not activated at the time.Three men ranging in age from 18 to 22 have been arrested and face charges that include felonious assault and reckless handling of a firearm, Virginia Beach police said in a statement on Saturday.The first shooting occurred shortly after 11 pm Friday along an outdoor strip of hotels, clubs and restaurants that were densely packed with people on one of the first warm days of the year.Witness Akereia Drayton said Saturday that she was coming out of a club on Friday night after the shooting ended and saw “mass chaos” and many people running.“People were literally falling over themselves,” Drayton said.Investigators believe the first shooting stemmed from a fight involving a group of people, police said.“Several individuals produced firearms and began shooting at each other, resulting in numerous people being wounded,” the police department statement said.Officers patrolling the area quickly responded, police said. But more gunfire followed several minutes later.Police said they found a female bystander about a block away who died of her injuries from a second shooting incident. Investigators believe the woman's death was not related to the initial shooting.At around the same time, police said that a uniformed officer in that area “encountered an armed citizen” and fatally shot him.A firearm was found “in the vicinity” of the shooting, Virginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate said during a news conference Saturday night. The man was later identified as Donovon W. Lynch, 25, of Virginia Beach.Neudigate said the officer who killed Lynch was wearing a body camera but, “for unknown reasons,” it was not activated.“We would like to provide the community answers. At this point we do not have them,” the police chief said.A Virginia Beach police officer was also struck by a vehicle, authorities said. He was treated for his injuries and released from the hospital.“We have a very chaotic incident, a very chaotic night,” Neudigate said.A total of 10 people were wounded by gunfire, including the two who died, according to police.Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital said four people wounded in the gunfire remained in the hospital on Saturday. All four of them were in good condition, a hospital spokeswoman said in an email.Three men were charged in the initial shooting incident, police said. They were identified as Ahmon Jahree Adams, 22, of neighboring Chesapeake, Virginia; Nyquez Tyyon Baker, 18, of Virginia Beach; and Devon Maurice Dorsey Jr., 20, of Virginia Beach.Police said they are being held in a jail in Virginia Beach. It's unclear if they've hired attorneys, who could be contacted for comment on their behalf.The bystander who died in the second shooting incident was Deshayla E. Harris, 28, of the nearby city of Norfolk, police said. No arrests have been made in connection with her death.The officer who killed has been placed on administrative leave, police said. He has been with the department for five years and is assigned to its special operations division.Lynch's father told WAVY-TV that his son was “a father’s dream.”Adrian Montgomery, a security guard who works at one of the oceanfront hotels, said the initial shooting occurred in an outdoor area where a lot of young people hang out and “try to talk to girls.”Montgomery said a woman told a man that she didn't want his phone number, which led to an altercation between that man and another man.An exchange of gunfire between the two men followed, Montgomery said, before more shots were fired between people who were friends with each of the respective shooters.“At that point, it just became a shooting gallery,” Montgomery said. “Whoever had a gun and felt threatened fired ... (They) were pulling out guns like they're cellphones.”Montgomery, 31, said the people he saw get shot appeared to be innocent bystanders. One of them was his 17-year-old nephew who had to have surgery.Montgomery added that the Virginia Beach oceanfront, which includes a boardwalk, was packed with people who were shoulder-to-shoulder on a warm, but tension-filled spring night.“There was no wiggle room,” Montgomery said. “When you have no wiggle room, somebody is going to step on somebody. And somebody is going to try to be Mr. Tough Guy.”Police on Saturday were still processing the crime scene, which included two full blocks that mostly make up a city-owned parking lot.Bill Feis, who lives a few houses away from the parking lot, said he was in bed and could hear people talking loudly before the shooting, which he said “sounded like someone threw a package of firecrackers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-dead-3-arrested-in-virginia-beach-shootings-say-police-101616894030937.html

28-03-2021||World||No timeline given for extracting wedged ship from Suez Canal||A giant container ship remained stuck sideways in Egypt’s Suez Canal for a fifth day Saturday, as authorities made new attempts to free the vessel and reopen a crucial waterway whose blockage is disrupting global shipping and trade.Meanwhile, the head of the Suez Canal Authority said strong winds were “not the only cause” for the Ever Given running aground on Tuesday, appearing to push back against conflicting assessments offered by others. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei told a news conference Saturday that an investigation was ongoing but did not rule out human or technical error.The massive Ever Given, a Panama-flagged ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about six kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez.Rabei said he could not predict when the ship might be dislodged. A Dutch salvage firm is attempting to refloat the vessel with tugboats and dredgers, taking advantage of high tides.Rabei said he remained hopeful that dredging could free the ship without having to resort to removing its cargo, but added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.”Asked about when they expected to free the vessel and reopen the canal, he said: "I can’t say because I do not know.”Shoei Kisen, the company that owns the vessel, said it was considering removing containers if other refloating efforts failed.Two attempts to free the vessel failed Saturday, according to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the ship's management company, and a canal services provider, Leth agencies, despite hopes that a high tide might give the vesslela boost.Bernhard Schulte had said earlier that “significant progress” was made late Friday at the ship’s stern where its rudder was released from sediment.It said around a dozen tugboats were working Saturday alongside dredging operations that were removing sand and mud from around the left side of the vessel’s bow.Some 9,000 tons of ballast water had been already removed from the vessel, the canal chairman said.Since the blockage began, a maritime traffic jam had grown to more than 320 vessels waiting on both ends of the Suez Canal and in the Great Bitter Lake in the middle of the waterway.Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired to extract the Ever Given said Friday said the company hoped to pull the container ship free within days using a combination of heavy tugboats, dredging and high tides.He told the Dutch current affairs show Nieuwsuur on Friday night that the front of the ship is stuck in sandy clay, but the rear “has not been completely pushed into the clay and that is positive because you can use the rear end to pull it free.”“The combination of the (tug) boats we will have there, more ground dredged away and the high tide, we hope that will be enough to get the ship free somewhere early next week,” he said.If that doesn’t work, the company will remove hundreds of containers from the front of the ship to lighten it, effectively lifting the ship to make it easier to pull free, Berdowski said.A crane was already on its way that can lift the containers off the ship, he said. Bernhard Schulte also confirmed that a Dutch and an Italian tugboat were scheduled to arrive in Egypt on Sunday.Egypt Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly called the ship's predicament "a very extraordinary incident,” in his first public comments on the blockage.The Suez Canal Authority organized the first media trip Saturday to the site where the vessel was stuck. From a distance, a flotilla of tugboats and other salvage equipment appeared minuscule compared to the vessel, a reminder of the scale of effort needed to reopen the canal.Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said Friday that its initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure. However, Rabei seemed to be pushing back against that assessment Saturday, saying that all possibilities, including human and technical errors, were being investigated.A prolonged closure of the crucial waterway would cause delays in the global shipment chain. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal. The closure could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East.Some vessels began changing course and dozens of ships were still en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv.It remained unclear how long the blockage would last. Even after reopening the canal that links factories in Asia to consumers in Europe, the waiting containers are likely to arrive at busy ports, forcing them to face additional delays before offloading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-timeline-given-for-extracting-wedged-ship-from-suez-canal-101616892862172.html
28-03-2021||World||Taiwan, US coastguard agreement aims to counter China's expansion: Analyst||A new pact signed by Taiwan and the United States on coast guard cooperation aims at countering China's expansion, said a Taiwanese analyst.According to Taiwan News, Su Tzu-yun, a senior analyst at Taiwan's Institute of National Defense and Security Research, said that the new pact between Washington and Taipei symbolises the clarification of America's strategy in the Indo-Pacific.Taiwan and the United States signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a Coast Guard Working Group (CGWG) in Washington DC on Thursday.The pact seems to be in response to the Chinese coast guard law, which allows the country's coast guard to fire at any foreign vessels in the waters "under China's jurisdiction".Su said that with the passing of its Coast Guard Law in late January, Beijing is attempting to strengthen its control over surrounding waters and the disputed islands in the South China Sea.Chinese coastguard ships have played a leading role in asserting China's maritime claims, including in fishing disputes off Indonesia's Natuna Islands and the stand-off with Vietnam over Vanguard Bank.In terms of organization, the Chinese Coast Guard is under command of the People's Armed Police, charged with integrating internal stability, border defence, and coastal defence. It is actually a "party police force," CNA cited Su as saying.China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, something which is contested heavily by several countries in the region.As per the report, some parts of the waters that fall within Manila's exclusive economic zone were renamed West Philippine Sea by the Philippine government.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region.Beijing's rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-us-coastguard-agreement-aims-to-counter-china-s-expansion-analyst-101616892497961.html
28-03-2021||World||Over 100 killed in deadliest day since Myanmar coup||As Myanmar's military celebrated the annual Armed Forces Day holiday with a parade Saturday in the country's capital, soldiers and police elsewhere reportedly killed dozens of people as they suppressed protests in the deadliest bloodletting since last month's coup.The online news site Myanmar Now reported late Saturday that the death toll had reached 114. A count issued by an independent researcher in Yangon who has been compiling near-real time death tolls put the total at 107, spread over more than two dozen cities and towns.Both numbers are higher than all estimates for the previous high on March 14, which ranged in counts from 74 to 90.Figures collected by the researcher, who asked not to be named for his security, have generally tallied with the counts issued at the end of each day by the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, which documents deaths and arrests and is widely seen as a definitive source. The Associated Press is unable to independently confirm the death tolls.The killings quickly drew international condemnation, with multiple diplomatic missions to Myanmar releasing statements that mentioned the killing of civilians Saturday, including children.“This 76th Myanmar armed forces day will stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour,” the European Union's delegation to Myanmar said on Twitter. “The killing of unarmed civilians, including children, are indefensible acts."In the United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the violence.“We are horrified by the bloodshed perpetrated by Burmese security forces, showing that the junta will sacrifice the lives of the people to serve the few,” he said in a tweet. “I send my deepest condolences to the victims' families. The courageous people of Burma reject the military's reign of terror.”The death toll in Myanmar has been steadily rising as authorities grow more forceful with their suppression of opposition to the February 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule.Up through Friday, the Association of Political Prisoners had verified 328 people killed in the post-coup crackdown.Junta chief Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing did not directly refer to the protest movement when he gave his nationally televised Armed Forces Day speech before thousands of soldiers in Naypyitaw. He referred only to “terrorism which can be harmful to state tranquility and social security,” and called it unacceptable.This year's event was seen as a flashpoint for violence, with demonstrators threatening to double down on their public opposition to the coup with more and bigger demonstrations. The protesters refer to the holiday by its original name, Resistance Day, which marks the beginning of a revolt against Japanese occupation in World War 2.State television MRTV on Friday night showed an announcement urging young people — who have been at the forefront of the protests and prominent among the casualties — to learn a lesson from those killed during demonstrations about the danger of being shot in the head or back.The warning was widely taken as a threat because a great number of the fatalities among protesters have come from being shot in the head, suggesting they have been targeted for death. The announcement suggested that some young people were taking part in protesting as if it was a game, and urged their parents and friends to talk them out of participating.In recent days the junta has portrayed the demonstrators as the ones perpetrating violence for their sporadic use of Molotov cocktails. On Saturday, some protesters in Yangon were seen carrying bows and arrows. In contrast, security forces have used live ammunition for weeks against what have still been overwhelmingly unarmed and peaceful crowds.The US Embassy said shots were fired Saturday at its cultural center in Yangon, though no one was injured.The military government does not issue regular casualty counts, and when it has released figures, the totals have been a fraction of what independent parties such as the UN have reported. It has said its use of force has been justified to stop what it has called rioting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-killed-in-deadliest-day-since-myanmar-coup-101616891267895.html
28-03-2021||World||Ship could be afloat by Sunday night: Official||Egypt’s Suez Canal chief said on Saturday that “technical or human errors” could be behind the grounding of a huge container ship blocking the vital waterway, causing a backlog of over 300 vessels.Osama Rabie, head of the Suez Canal Authority, told reporters in Suez that the ship could possibly be afloat again by Sunday night. The crisis has crippled global supply chains, forcing companies to consider the expensive option of re-routing vessels around the southern tip of Africa.Officials had previously blamed 40-knot gusts and a sandstorm that impeded visibility, but Rabie said on Saturday that “strong winds and weather factors were not the main reasons for the ship’s grounding -- there may have been technical or human errors”.But he sounded an optimistic note when asked when the vessel might be freed.“We could finish today or tomorrow (Saturday or Sunday), depending on the ship’s responsiveness” to tides, he said.The canal chief’s timeline echoed comments on Friday by the ship’s owners, but the parent company of the salvage firm was less optimistic.Yukito Higaki, president of Japanese firm Shoei Kisen which owns the vessel, told local media on Friday that the ship could be freed from the canal bed by late Saturday.But the executive director of Royal Boskalis, parent company of Smit Salvage which is in charge of the salvage operation, suggested the ship could be afloat again “at the start of next week”.“We are already in the process of installing a crane on land,” Peter Berdowski told a public television chat-show late on Friday.“That will allow us to eventually remove all the containers from the foredeck, which could involve hundreds of containers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ship-could-be-afloat-by-sunday-night-official-101616890331628.html
28-03-2021||World||Myanmar forces kill 114 people on deadliest day||Myanmar security forces killed 114 people, including some children, in a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on Saturday, the bloodiest day of violence since last month’s military coup, news reports and witnesses said.The killings, which took place on Armed Forces Day, drew strong renewed criticism from Western countries. British foreign minister Dominic Raab said the killing of unarmed civilians and children marked a new low, while the EU delegation to Myanmar said Saturday would “forever stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour”.Military jets also launched air strikes on a village in territory controlled by an armed group from the Karen ethnic minority and at least two people were killed, a civil society group said.Also read | US embassy in Myanmar blasts junta for 'murdering unarmed civilians'Earlier, the Karen National Union said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people - including a lieutenant-colonel - and losing one of its own fighters as tensions with the military surged after years of relative peace.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta leader, said during a parade to mark Armed Forces Day that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Demonstrators turned out on Saturday in Yangon, Mandalay and other towns, as they have done almost daily since the Februar 1 coup that ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Myanmar Now news portal said 114 people were killed across the country in crackdowns on the protests.At least 40 people, including a 13-year-old girl, were killed in Mandalay, and at least 27 people were killed in Yangon, Myanmar Now said. A boy as young as five was earlier reported among the dead in Mandalay but there were conflicting reports later that he may have survived. Another 13-year-old was among the dead in the central Sagaing region.“Today is a day of shame for the armed forces,” Dr Sasa, a spokesman for CRPH, an anti-junta group set up by deposed lawmakers, told an online forum. A military spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment on the killings by security forces, the air strikes or the insurgent attack on its post.“They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes,” said Thu Ya Zaw in the central town of Myingyan, where at least two protesters were killed.“We will keep protesting regardless... We must fight until the junta falls.”The deaths on Saturday would take the number of civilians reported killed since the coup to over 440.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-forces-kill-114-people-on-deadliest-day-101616889704261.html

28-03-2021||World||Suez canal blockage: When a desert wind blew USD 10 billion of global trade off course||The forecast for Tuesday, March 23, showed wind gusts of more than 40 miles per hour and sand storms sweeping through northern Egypt. Indeed, such weather is common in the Sinai desert at this time of year.The Suez Canal—one of the most critical, yet precarious waterways on the planet—remained open. Ships were starting to form the daily convoy as the gusts picked up. One of the world’s biggest container vessels, the Ever Given, joined it. The decision would reverberate globally within hours.By 7:40 a.m. local time, the megaship—loaded with containers that would stretch more than 120 kilometers (75 miles) end to end and carrying everything from frozen fish to furniture—was stuck. Its grounding would not only lay bare the intricacies of navigating a man-made trench of water in a vessel the size of the Eiffel Tower, but also the fragility of a global network of markets and economies that takes for granted the flow of goods through it.Based on tracking data and dozens of interviews with people in the industry, what’s known is that the Ever Given started heading through the 300 meter-wide canal while at least one other ship decided to hold off due to the high winds. The Ever Given also didn’t employ tug boats, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, while the two slightly smaller container ships immediately ahead did.Then there was the issue of how fast it was going. When the ship began to move toward the sand, it appeared to speed up, perhaps to correct itself, though it was too late and it almost collided with the bank. That served to then wedge the steel hull more deeply into the side of the canal. The gusts also would have compounded what’s considered by captains as one of the toughest water crossings in the world.“You’re in for some white-knuckle rides,” said Andrew Kinsey, a former captain who has navigated a 300-meter cargo ship through the Suez and is now a senior marine risk consultant at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. “It’s such a small canal, the winds are very rough and you have a really small margin for error and big consequences if errors happen.”It wasn’t a situation where you couldn’t sail, even though wind was strong enough to close nearby ports. Some vessels used tugs or other assistance, others just passed through without incident.At least one ship decided to delay the trip through the canal, though. The day before the Ever Given grounded, the Rasheeda was among the ships approaching the canal from the southern end. Mindful of the dangers of the coming sandstorm and laden with liquefied natural gas from Qatar, the captain decided not to enter the canal after discussion with other officials at Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which manages the ship, according to two people familiar with the situation.The Suez Canal Authority said a lack of visibility in adverse weather led to the ship losing control and drifting. It hasn’t commented further. Taiwan-based Evergreen Line, the time charterer of the vessel, said by email the Ever Given “was grounded accidentally after deviating from its course due to suspected sudden strong wind.”The manager of the ship, Benhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said initial investigations suggest the accident was due to the wind. An extensive investigation involving multi-agencies and parties is ongoing. It will include interviews with pilots onboard and all bridge personnel and other crew, said a company spokesman.Meanwhile, the canal remains blocked and the latest reports from people familiar with rescue efforts suggest that will take until at least Wednesday.A conduit for 12% of the world’s trade, an average of 50 ships pass through Suez every day in convoys that start in the early morning. The Ever Given started its journey soon after daybreak and picked up two local pilots from the Suez Canal Authority. They come onboard to supervise ships making the journey through the waterway that can take up to 12 hours. But the authority’s rules of navigation clearly spell out that the captain, shipowners and charterers remain responsible for accidents.The Ever Given captain overseeing the bridge had made the journey through the Suez many times before and handled it through gusty wind, according to a former crew member. Shipping companies say that they use their top captains for Suez because of the delicate nature of the trip.But what happened next left $10 billion worth of goods with nowhere to go with more than 300 ships carrying products across multiple industries now stuck in the gridlock.The Ever Given lost its bearing and began turning to its starboard side around 5 miles into the mouth of canal. The 200,000-ton ship then careened to its port side, and soon moved sideways and ran aground, its bulbous red bow that juts out to cut efficiently through water firmly embedded in the sandy embankment.“Here we have just a single vessel that’s out of place and yet it has impact on the entire maritime and global economy,” said Ian Ralby, chief executive officer of I.R. Consilium, a maritime law and security consulting firm that works with governments. “This ship—carrying exactly the kinds of things we rely on day to day—shows that the supply chains we rely on are so integrated and the margin for error is so thin.”Those piecing together what caused the accident will undoubtedly look at speed. The ship’s last known speed was 13.5 knots at 7:28 a.m., 12 minutes before the grounding, according to Bloomberg data.That would have surpassed the speed limit of about 7.6 knots (8.7 miles an hour) to 8.6 knots that is listed as the maximum speed vessels are “allowed to transit” through the canal, according to the Suez authority’s rules of navigation handbook posted on its website. Captains interviewed for this story said it can pay to increase the speed in the face of a strong wind to maneuver the ship better.“Speeding up to a certain point is effective,” said Chris Gillard, who was captain of a 300-meter container ship that crossed the Suez monthly for nearly a decade until 2019. “More than that and it becomes counter effective because the bow will get sucked down deep into the water. Then, adding too much power does nothing but exacerbate the problem.”Bloomberg data also show that the 300-meter Maersk Denver traveling behind the Ever Given also posted a top speed of 10.6 knots at 7:28 a.m. A spokesperson for Maersk in Denmark declined to comment. Ship captains and local pilots said it’s not unusual to travel through the canal around that speed despite the lower limit.The Cosco Galaxy, a container ship marginally smaller than the Ever Given, was immediately ahead and appears to have travelled at a similar speed, though with a tugboat. The one ahead of the Cosco, the Al Nasriyah, also had an escort. The escorts are not mandatory, according to the Suez authority’s rules of navigation, though the authority can require it for ships if they deem it necessary.“The biggest vessels often travel with a tugboat in close proximity, an escort boat, to facilitate the transit,” said Captain Theologos Gampierakis at commodity trading house Trafigura Group in Athens.A cargo ship with containers stacked high like the Ever Given can be particularly hard to navigate since the ship’s hull and wall of containers can act as a huge sail, said Kinsey, the former captain, who made his last trip through Suez in 2006 .“You might find yourself positioning the ship in one direction, and you’re actually moving in another direction,” said Kinsey. “There’s a very fine line between having enough speed to maneuver and not having too much speed that the air and hydrodynamics become unstable. Any deviation can get real bad real quick because it’s so tight.”About 20 minutes after the incident, the first of two tugboats accompanying the vessels ahead of the Ever Given came back to push its port side in an effort to dislodge it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Later, eight tugboats were deployed to push both sides of the container vessel, but to no avail.On the ground, officials and investigators were sent to the embankment. Excavators tried to make a dent in helping to release it from the sandy embankment.In a village 100 meters away from the stuck ship, the vessel looms on the skyline like a giant monument. Every day that it sits still makes it harder to extricate it, due to the sediment that’s being carried by the currents that will pack around the ship under the water, said Kinsey.The accident will be a missed opportunity if the industry doesn’t adapt, he said. “There will be vessels larger than this one that will be going through the Suez,” he said. “The next incident will be worse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-blockage-when-a-desert-wind-blew-usd-10-billion-of-global-trade-off-course-101616876390225.html
28-03-2021||World||UK to end green home grants, add funds for energy upgrades||The UK government will end a key program to improve home energy efficiency, while boosting funding for efforts to help households cut greenhouse emissions and save on power bills.The government will end its Green Home Grant voucher program, which faced a tepid uptake partly because of the coronavirus pandemic. The program, which provided vouchers for homeowners to help pay for insulating their properties and switch to low carbon heating, will be terminated on March 31, the government said in an emailed statement.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is working on a major overhaul of the voucher program, one of the government’s most important climate change policies, after it failed to deliver, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. Johnson is now in talks with finance minister Rishi Sunak over what comes next. The Treasury is seeking to redirect funds elsewhere, while the premier wants to design a successor program, the people said.The voucher program was launched in September with a budget of 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) and was designed to be a temporary stimulus measure as part of its broader climate change effort. Officials had originally hoped the grants would help upgrade 600,000 homes and support more than 100,000 jobs, fueling the economic recovery from the pandemic. The government didn’t provide figures on how many people applied for vouchers.The government also announced today an additional 300 million pounds in funding that will be channeled through local authorities in England to help low-income households upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes. The additional financing will take total government funding for energy efficiency and low-carbon heating in 2021-2021 to 1.3 billion pounds, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-end-green-home-grants-add-funds-for-energy-upgrades-101616871362150.html
