A judge could also sentence her up to 30 days in jail on each count, although that would be unusual.Advocates for journalism and human rights in the U.S. and abroad have pressed Iowa authorities to drop the charges, arguing that Sahouri was simply doing her job by documenting the event. But prosecutors in the office of Polk County Attorney John Sarcone have pressed forward with the case against Sahouri and her former boyfriend, Spenser Robnett, who faces the same charges.The pair are standing trial in a courtroom at Drake University in Des Moines as part of a program for law students. The university is broadcasting the proceedings, which are expected to last two days. Lawyers began selecting a six-member jury from a larger pool on Monday morning.The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has not recorded any other trials of working journalists in the country since 2018. Sahouri was among more than 125 reporters detained or arrested during the civil unrest that unfolded across the U.S. in 2020. Thirteen, including Sahouri, still face prosecution although the majority of those arrested were not charged or their charges were dismissed, the group says.Employees in the Gannett newspaper chain, which owns USA Today, the Register and hundreds of other newspapers, have flooded social media with support for Sahouri in recent days. Columbia Journalism School, where Sahouri graduated in 2019 before joining the Register, expressed solidarity Monday by promoting the hashtags #StandWithAndrea and #JournalismIsNotACrime.Amnesty International launched a campaign to publicize her case and demand the charges be dismissed.Sahouri was assigned to cover a May 31 protest at Merle Hay mall, where activists were demanding better treatment for people of color after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white officer put his knee on his neck for about nine minutes.Some protesters threw water bottles and rocks at police, broke store windows and vandalized a Target store. Police responded by spraying tear gas to disperse a large crowd from an intersection. Sahouri reported the details live on Twitter.Sahouri was running from the gas when Robnett was hit in the leg with a projectile — likely a tear gas canister or rubber bullet launched by police. She briefly stopped to check on him before continuing around the corner of a Verizon store. Officer Luke Wilson then arrested her, burning her eyes with a blast of pepper spray and cuffing her hands in zip ties, Sahouri says.Wilson has said he didn't know Sahouri was a journalist until Robnett intervened during the arrest. Robnett told the officer that Sahouri was a Register journalist and tried to pull Sahouri away from him, Wilson says. Prosecutors say the officer did not activate his body camera during the arrest or use a camera function to retrieve the video after the fact before it was erased.Sahouri was not wearing press credentials at the time but repeatedly identified herself as press. A Register colleague who wasn't arrested also immediately vouched for her employment to police. Nonetheless, Sahouri was loaded into a police van and jailed for a couple of hours.Prosecutors have tried to defend the arrest by arguing that journalists do not have special rights to ignore police dispersal orders, including one that had been given roughly 90 minutes earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-journalist-arrested-while-covering-protest-goes-on-trial-101615224646634.html

Shops and some pubs can re-open on April 12.Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said the effect of the vaccine roll-out is causing deaths to decline more rapidly than other indicators like cases and hospitalizations, yet warned about the risk of another wave.Harries said that the testing of children for the virus will take time to settle down, and that she is “optimistic”’ schools won’t have to close again.“There may be a very short period at the start of this program where everybody gets used to it, and a larger number of children come out of school,” she said. “It’s really important that when observing this, people think through the next three to four weeks, not the first one to two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-deaths-continue-to-fall-as-country-vaccinates-more-than-one-third-of-population-101615224084685.html
08-03-2021||World||Italy's Covid-19 death toll tops 100,000||Italy on Monday surpassed the grim milestone of 100,000 official coronavirus deaths, amid warnings the spread of new variants is fuelling a fresh wave of infections.Just over a year since it became the first European country to be overwhelmed by Covid-19, Italy's health ministry recorded another 318 virus-related deaths, taking the total to 100,103.The figure is almost certainly an underestimate of the true toll, but is nevertheless shocking.When the pandemic started, "we could have never imagined that after a year ... the official death toll would have neared the terrible threshold of 100,000," said Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who took over last month.In a video message that represented his first public statement in three weeks, he added: "The pandemic has not yet been defeated, but with the acceleration of the vaccination plan, we can see a way out."As in many other European countries, Italy's vaccine programme has had a slow start, dogged in large part by a lack of jabs.It expects to have 50 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by the end of June, allowing for the vaccination of "at least half of our population" -- some 30 million people -- within the next four months, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said Sunday.Italy will start using the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine on people over the age of 65, while it also has high hopes for the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which could win EU approval on March 11.So far, Italy has fully vaccinated only 1.65 million people.However, Speranza warned Monday that Italy faced difficult weeks as it needs "to flatten this [infection] curve at a time when variants make the virus even harder to handle".New national lockdown? Weekly infection numbers rose by a third to more than 123,000 cases between February 24 and March 2, according to the GIMBE health think tank, the highest since early December.As hospital intensive care units are again coming under pressure, the government is considering new restrictions -- including extending the current 10:00 pm to 05:00am curfew and a national lockdown, according to media reports."With these numbers we need stricter measures," Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio wrote on Facebook, adding: "There is no alternative to stricter measures."Tough new nationwide restrictions would be another blow for the economy, which was plunged into a historic recession by last year's lockdown.But a poll published on the weekend by the Corriere della Sera newspaper suggested that 44 per cent of Italians would back it, up from 30 per cent two weeks earlier.Tighter restrictions took effect Monday as southern Campania, which includes Naples, joined Basilicata and Molise in the list of "red" regions under lockdown.Lockdowns have also been enforced at more local level in dozens of provinces and cities -- leading to the closure of bars, restaurants, museums and of all schools including nurseries.Face-to-face learning is now off for almost six million students, around two thirds of the total, according to specialised website Tuttoscuola.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italys-covid-19-death-toll-tops-100000-101615223518569.html

The goal, one of the officials said, is to ensure students have an education “free of sexual violence.”The Trump administration also scrapped key Obama-era policies and put forward their rules which, among other items, said transgender students couldn’t use the bathroom consistent with their own gender identities. Biden’s executive order instructs the agency to make sure all policies related to Title IX are consistent with the ethos of the Biden-Harris administration, the official added.“President Biden knows we need a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of all women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, restoring America as a champion for gender equity,” said one of the officials.The Obama administration had a White House Council on Women and Girls. The new gender council reflects the idea, one official said, that gender discrimination can happen to people of all genders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-women-s-day-joe-biden-creates-gender-policy-council-within-white-house-101615222789833.html

Such gatherings are “low risk,” the CDC said.Those vaccinated also can meet with people who aren’t vaccinated from a single household who are at low risk, without wearing masks or distancing -- such as vaccinated grandparents meeting their unvaccinated adult child and that child’s children, providing they’re healthy and not at high risk.However, the agency estimated that just 10% of the population has been fully vaccinated so far, and recommends that those who are continue to take steps to curb the spread of the virus, particularly as more contagious variants emerge.“We believe these new recommendations are an important first step in our efforts to resume everyday activities in our communities,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing Monday.In PublicFully vaccinated people should wear masks and socially distance in public, if they’re visiting with unvaccinated people from more than one household, or when around unvaccinated people who are high risk, such as older people, the CDC said. Most fully vaccinated people don’t need to quarantine and test for Covid-19 if exposed to a case and are asymptomatic, the CDC said. There are some exceptions, such as residents of congregate settings like group homes.Everyone, regardless of vaccinations, should avoid medium or large gatherings, the CDC said. If they choose to attend anyhow, vaccinated people should wear a mask because they can still relay the virus to those who haven’t been immunized, the CDC said.The CDC recommendations didn’t include any changes to travel guidance. The CDC continues to urge that people delay travel.“Every time that there is a surge in travel we have a surge of cases in this country,” Walensky said. “We know that many of our variants have emerged from international places and we know that the travel corridor is a place where people are mixing a lot.”Travel GuidanceThe CDC is hopeful that by the next update it will have more scientific guidelines as to what vaccinated people can do, “perhaps travel being among them,” Walensky said.Covid-19 cases and deaths are declining across the country, and more than 9 million people have been fully vaccinated. In the past week, an average of 2.16 million doses per day were administered to Americans. The White House said that all American adults will be able to get a Covid-19 vaccination by the end of May.Last week Walensky warned of a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections without continued vigilance. President Joe Biden echoed her statement by urging all Americans to keep washing their hands, practice social distancing and wear masks.“Now is not the time to let our guard down,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-people-can-visit-each-other-mask-free-says-cdc-101615223356389.html

The traditional “fist-and-palm salute” is often used as a greeting at weddings and special occasions, such as the Chinese New Year.“The oldest and most commonly used greeting in history is the fist and palm salute. And it’s a better way to greet people in the post-pandemic era,” Han told China.org, “This greeting etiquette greatly helps keep social distancing and reduce the spread of the virus.”“We need to vigorously promote the etiquette across the whole of China, as it demonstrates a profound social significance, not only for its role in pandemic prevention, but also for the inheritance of a part of ancient Chinese civilisation,” he said.A similar request from Yang Chaoming, head of the Confucius Research Institute in eastern China’s Shandong province, is already pending from last year.A short video of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro greeting a Chinese medical team with the “fist and palm” salute at his presidential palace in April 2020 was widely viewed and shared in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adviser-urges-china-govt-to-use-fist-and-palm-salute-in-times-of-pandemic-101615221738527.html

The announcement was made on International Women’s Day.Frances Donald, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, Hydro-Quebec Chief Executive Officer Sophie Brochu, former British Columbia Finance Minister Carole James and Atkinson Foundation fellow Armine Yalnizyanare among the group’s 18 members. The task force will hold its first meetings in early March, in the lead-up to the budget, according the new release.“Their diverse perspectives will help our government make smart, targeted investments through Budget 2021 and beyond to advance gender equity and address the systemic barriers and inequities faced by women, including Black, Indigenous, and people of color -- so that Canada’s economic recovery leaves no one behind,” Fortier said in the news release.The task force’s creation suggests the Trudeau government is taking steps to address the uneven impacts the pandemic has had on the labor market. Women have been hit particularly hard because they disproportionately work in service-sector jobs where physical distancing is difficult.Mothers have also had a hard time navigating school and daycare closures, sometimes having to sacrifice work to stay home with the kids. In the past 12 months, more than 80,000 women aged 15 and older have left the labor force versus 25,000 men, according to the release.“The government recognizes that a robust and inclusive recovery is necessarily also a feminist recovery,” it said in the release.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-names-task-force-on-women-in-the-economy-ahead-of-budget-101615218417663.html
08-03-2021||World||UK mulls postponing Brexit border checks on food||The UK government is considering postponing the introduction of border checks on imports from the European Union to reduce the risk of disruption to supply chains this summer.David Frost, the minister who negotiated the Brexit trade deal with the EU and is now leading the UK’s relations with the bloc, has asked officials to review the timetable of the new border paperwork requirements, which are due to start from April 1, according to two people familiar with the matter.Britain has so far taken a light-touch approach to imports from the EU since Brexit, waiving customs requirements and allowing goods to enter freely. In contrast, the EU imposed full border controls on trade going the other way on January 1, causing delays to shipments and a decline in freight volumes.Yet the UK’s lax stance is due to expire within weeks: From April, food products will require extra forms to enter the UK from the EU. And then, from July 1, stricter border inspections plus further documents for all EU imports are scheduled to begin.The extra trade burden is due to coincide with the re-opening of Britain’s hospitality sector as lockdown restrictions ease, when demand for food and drink is expected to surge. About 80% of imported food in Britain’s supermarkets comes from the EU, according to the British Retail Consortium.Food has been one of the industries worst-hit by the post-Brexit trade deal, with exports ranging from fish to meat held up and spoiling because they lack the correct paperwork.“We will continue to work with business groups and the haulage industry to help them adapt to the new checks and new arrangements that are going to be put in place,” said Jamie Davies, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, on a call with reporters on Monday.Another problem for Johnson’s government is that much of the physical infrastructure to conduct the post-Brexit import checks is not ready. Many ports won’t have built their facilities in time for handling inspections of food products for the July 1 deadline, said Richard Ballantyne, chief executive officer of the British Ports Association, in a phone interview.Separately, the UK is facing legal action from the EU after unilaterally changing trade rules affecting Northern Ireland, going beyond what was agreed in their post-Brexit accord. The British government has extended a grace period for the introduction of export documents on food crossing from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland which was due to lapse on April 1. The requirements will now start from October 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mulls-postponing-brexit-border-checks-on-food-101615216381213.html

They shouted “Enough with patriarchal justice!" and held banners against fascism and calling for an end to violence and repression against women.Some activists have called for purple scarves to flood the balconies and windows of Madrid.The largest gathering is expected later in the day in Barcelona, although organizers have asked people to stand still instead of marching.Spain is home to a thriving feminist movement that has in recent years claimed a few victories, including the adoption of gender violence laws and forcing a judicial reform on sexual abuse of women. Activists say that the social and economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic has widened the salary gap between men and women and affected even more the work-life balance, especially among those in the trenches of the health emergency and care workers, many of whom are migrants.“Spain can’t continue to be built with women in the margins, with a few that break glass ceilings while the most vulnerable continue on sticky floors,” said Equality Minister Irene Montero, who was joined by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez at an official event to mark March 8.A draft of a new Transgender Law has deepened divisions in the movement and within the left-wing ruling coalition, with the leading Socialist party opposing self-determination of gender without a previous mental health diagnosis.Far-right activists, meanwhile, have campaigned against gender violence laws they say discriminate against men, and lambasted the center-left government’s push to make consent in sexual relations legally mandatory.Twin street murals celebrating accomplished women in politics, arts and science were vandalized over the weekend in Madrid and a nearby city. The portraits of Rigoberta Menchú, Frida Kahlo, Nina Simone, Rosa Parks and seven more women were covered in paint, amid signs that read “terrorist” and “communist.”Sánchez, who said that only feminism will make societies advance and reach new levels of wellbeing, called extremist conservative voices who oppose feminism “a force for regression.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-pandemic-feminists-in-spain-decry-far-right-attacks-101615206581802.html

That was the highest figure since 1965.While Covid-19 lockdowns forced many companies to cut jobs, that could have contributed to the jump in investing as retrenched workers looked to save compensation payouts, according to Sunette Mulder, senior policy adviser at Asisa. Even so, “last year’s record-breaking net inflows came as a surprise given the volatility and uncertainty,” she said.South Africa was already in recession and battling high unemployment before the pandemic hit, and initially tough restrictions to contain the spread only worsened the situation. While the economy has since returned to growth, the jobless rate hit a record 32.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020.A less surprising outcome of Asisa’s research is that life insurers paid 522.7 billion rand to beneficiaries last year, an increase of more than 6%, while death claims jumped to more than 434,000 from 317,442 a year earlier.South Africa has been the worst-hit country by the pandemic on the continent, with more than 50,000 reported Covid-19 fatalities. To protect against the crisis, the life industry ended the year with more than double its legally required capital buffer in place, Asisa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africans-invested-most-in-55-years-as-covid-19-crisis-raged-101615214417201.html

The commission sees output of 90 million to 100 million doses a month by the end of March.“If you look at the rest of the world, we are very good where vaccination is concerned and the vaccination rates are rising,” von der Leyen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-it-s-tired-of-being-a-scapegoat-for-slow-vaccines-101615215557008.html

It is no secret that scores of top Afghan Taliban leaders are hidden in Pakistan.In December, a series of videos surfaced showing senior Taliban leaders meeting their followers and Taliban fighters in Pakistan.In the videos, Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the head of the Taliban political office, was seen holding a briefing with the Taliban cadre on the Afghanistan peace negotiations and acknowledging the presence of the Taliban's top leadership in Pakistan.Reacting to the videos, Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "The presence of Taliban leaders in Pakistan clearly violates Afghanistan's national sovereignty".Afghanistan had also urged Islamabad "not to allow its territory to be used by insurgents and elements who insist on continuing the war and bloodshed"."Meaningful peace and security will not come to Afghanistan until the issue of Pakistan's relentless disposition to meddle in Afghanistan's affairs is properly addressed, and it is wishful thinking to believe otherwise," Professor asserted that Pakistan needs to mend its ways.The UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team to the 1988 Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions on the Taliban, in its 2019 report had acknowledged that nearly 5,000 terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which is based in Pakistan, were active in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan alone.In December, former Pakistan senator Afrasiab Khattak said Pakistan is using the Taliban as a "tool" for its dominance in Afghanistan under the pretext of strategic depth."They [Pakistan] want dominance in Afghanistan under the pretext of strategic depth and they have pursued this policy. They see the Taliban as a tool for themselves," Khattak said in an interview with TOLOnews."We can say that their (the Taliban's) approach has changed if they stop violence and say that they will feel the people's pain," Khattak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/treating-pak-as-normal-neighbour-won-t-benefit-afghan-peace-process-vp-saleh-101615212548267.html

With more than 1 million jabs, Hungary has administered 13.2 doses per 100 people, compared with the trading bloc’s average of 9.1.The gains were propelled by hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Russian shots, which drew criticism from some member states for undermining EU unity.And at home, Hungarians are facing the yearlong pandemic’s highest daily infections over the weekend, with reports of hospitals struggling to keep up with the influx of coronavirus patients. The surge was seemingly a surprise for the government, which recently had been discussing easing previous curbs.Hungary has the third-highest Covid-19 fatality rate in the world after Mexico and Peru and is in fourth place in deaths per capita after the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Italy, according to Johns Hopkins University data.While Hungary doesn’t break down data for intensive-care units, the government reported that a record 806 people are on ventilators, double the number from two weeks ago. It plans to triple the number of available ICU beds, Chief Medical Officer Cecilia Muller said at a briefing on Monday.The worsening outbreak is creating an opening for the opposition, which plans to unify for next year’s election for the first time since Orban swept to power in 2010. Ater three landslide victories for the ruling party, the majority of polls this year show it consistently behind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungarys-covid-19-mortality-rises-despite-having-high-vaccination-rate-101615210093621.html
08-03-2021||World||Tesla enters Texas energy market, plugs gigantic battery to faulty grid||Elon Musk is getting into the Texas power market, with previously unrevealed construction of a gigantic battery connected to an ailing electric grid that nearly collapsed last month. The move marks Tesla Inc.’s first major foray into the epicenter of the US energy economy.A Tesla subsidiary registered as Gambit Energy Storage LLC is quietly building a more than 100 megawatt energy storage project in Angleton, Texas, a town roughly 40 miles south of Houston. A battery that size could power about 20,000 homes on a hot summer day. Workers at the site kept equipment under cover and discouraged onlookers, but a Tesla logo could be seen on a worker’s hard hat and public documents helped confirm the company’s role.Property records on file with Brazoria County show Gambit shares the same address as a Tesla facility near the company’s auto plant in Fremont, California. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission lists Gambit as a Tesla subsidiary. Executives from Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.As winter storms pummeled Texas in February and left millions without power for days, Musk took to Twitter to mock the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, the nonprofit group that manages the flow of electric power to more than 26 million customers. “Not earning that R,” he wrote. Musk, 49, recently moved to Texas and his various companies are expanding operations in the state.The battery-storage system being built by Tesla’s Gambit subsidiary is registered with Ercot. Warren Lasher, senior director of system planning at Ercot, said the project has a proposed commercial operation date of June 1. The site is adjacent to a Texas-New Mexico Power substation.While Tesla is known for its sleek, battery-powered electric vehicles, it’s always been more than a car company: its official mission is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” Utility-scale batteries are needed to store the electricity produced by wind and solar, but they can also become lucrative opportunities. By storing excess electricity when prices and demand are low, battery owners can sell it back to the grid when prices are high.Tesla has spent years expanding into residential energy technology. Back in March 2015, Musk unveiled a home battery product, dubbed the Powerwall, with a splashy event at its design studio near Los Angeles. Scores of utility and energy executives attended. A year later Tesla acquired SolarCity, the solar-panel installer founded by Musk and his cousins. Musk then hawked a “solar roof” that has gone through several iterations without becoming a strong contender in the market.But the company’s product lineup already reaches beyond the home and into the electrical grid. The Tesla Powerpack and even larger Megapack were designed with utility customers in mind. Tesla’s battery project in South Australia, launched in 2017, is adjacent to a wind farm and can store surplus electricity generated on gusty nights for daytime demand. At 100 megawatts, it was the largest battery project in the world at its launch.While Tesla’s focus on energy often takes a back seat to the increasingly competitive business of manufacturing and selling electric cars, Musk and his executive team continue to highlight energy as a key part of their growth. “I think long-term Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive,” Musk said during an earnings call in July 2020. “The energy business is collectively bigger than the automotive business.”Tesla’s battery packs are connected to Southern California Edison’s Mira Loma substation, located east of Los Angeles. The 20 megawatt system, which has been online since December 2016, supports grid operation during peak hours and helps the utility make the most of its renewable resources. In the San Francisco Bay Area, PG&E Corp. and Tesla are constructing a 182.5 megawatt system at an electric substation in Moss Landing that should be operational by August.Tesla Energy could represent up to 30% of the company’s total revenue by the 2030s, up from roughly 6% today, according to analyst Alexander Potter of Piper Sandler. His research has highlighted the potential for Autobidder, a software platform Tesla designed for utilities. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn has described Autobidder as an “autonomous energy market participation system that does high-frequency trading.” Potter has a $1,200 price target on Tesla stock, the highest on Wall Street.“Tesla’s energy storage business on a percentage basis is growing faster than their car business, and it’s only going to accelerate,” said Daniel Finn-Foley, head of energy storage at Wood MacKenzie Power and Renewables. “They are absolutely respected as a player, and they are competing aggressively on price.”Musk’s empire has numerous branches in Texas, and with the billionaire’s recent relocation from California, the Lone Star state now appears set to become the center of his universe. Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, is building and testing Starship, a new rocket and spacecraft designed to take humans to Mars, at a facility in Boca Chica on the southern tip of the Gulf Coast. Another rocket-testing facility is located in McGregor, near Waco.SpaceX has posted engineering positions in Austin for a “new, state of the art manufacturing facility” for Starlink, a space-based high speed Internet service. Tesla is also building a new factory in East Austin for its forthcoming Cybertruck, an electric pickup. Gigafactory Texas, as the facility is known, will create 5,000 mid-level manufacturing jobs and is supposed to produce the first vehicles by the end of this year.Musk’s focus on Texas comes as the dominant US energy hub—with its abundant natural gas, oil, solar and wind resources—is being transformed by the surging growth of renewables. For more than a century the Texas grid has transported power from large plants to customers over miles of transmission lines. The recent storms have highlighted just how fragile that legacy system is in the era of climate change. With the build out of giant batteries like those made by Tesla’s Gambit project and others, the state’s power grid could be remade around distributed generation that may prove more resilient.About 2,100 megawatts of battery storage and 37,000 megawatts of solar and wind are in advanced stages of connecting to Ercot’s grid. “It’s not only stunning but the financing is already in place,” Jigar Shah said on March 2, a day before the clean-energy pioneer was named as director of the US Energy Department’s loan finance office.The Gambit project was originally developed by San Francisco-based Plus Power, a privately held renewables company that has battery operations in several states. Scott Albert, the former city manager of Angleton, said it was obvious that Plus Power was working with Tesla. A project summary available on the city’s website features images of Tesla’s utility-scale battery products, and some of Plus Power’s principal staffers previously worked at Tesla. (Plus Power confirmed its sale of the project to an undisclosed party and declined further comment.)The Gambit project is not hard to find in Angleton, a small town of roughly 3,000 people in the middle of the Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge. But people on the construction site appear to have instructions to avoid drawing attention or answering questions from passersby. A photographer who attempted to observe from the front gate was told by a worker that it was a “secretive project.” White sheets obscured what appeared to be Tesla’s modular Megapacks.In Texas, Albert said, it’s common for developers in real estate or energy to begin projects with several potential partners or purchasers waiting in the wings. It made sense to him that the project ended up with the state’s biggest billionaire. “Elon Musk has a lot of activity in Texas right now,” said Albert. “It wouldn’t surprise me if Musk is thinking about starting his own power company.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-enters-texas-energy-market-plugs-gigantic-battery-to-faulty-grid-101615211827383.html
08-03-2021||World||Close to 90% of Americans feel a woman could become US president by 2030||More than 90% of Americans think the United States could have its first woman president within a decade, a poll showed on Monday, as Vice-President Kamala Harris is increasingly tipped as favourite for the Democratic Party nomination in 2024.A Gallup poll conducted in 74 countries showed Americans were the most likely to say they thought a woman could lead their nation by 2030.The majority of respondents in only three countries - Mauritania, Belarus and Sri Lanka - said they did not expect to see a woman leader in the years ahead, found the poll conducted from 2019 to 2020 and released for International Women's Day.Women serve as heads of state or government in only 22 countries and 119 nations have never had a woman leader, UN Women data showed in January, while on average women hold just over a quarter of seats in parliaments worldwide.But Harris's election as the first female US vice president last year was a significant boost for efforts to boost women's political representation and help young women see themselves in top jobs, according to campaigners."We all believe (Harris) is going to run for president again very, very soon," said Sara Guillermo, executive director of California-based young women's political leadership organisation IGNITE, describing Harris's election as a "huge cultural shift"."That is really huge, not just for the little girls of the world but for the little boys, to be able to fully understand that both genders can serve in the highest leadership role," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video call.Harris, 56, who also made history by becoming the first Black American and first Asian American to win the second highest US office, is seen as an obvious contender for her party's 2024 candidacy should Biden, 78, decide not to run.Monday's poll findings follow a warning last week that despite recent high-profile appointments of women globally, wider progress towards equality in political representation and other key areas is faltering.A report by the Equal Measures 2030 partnership found half of the 129 countries it examined were lagging behind a target to reach gender equality by 2030 in five key areas including ministerial roles and workplace equity laws.Progress is "limping along" globally but "rapid change on gender equality is possible", said Alison Holder, director of the organisation, which assesses progress on an ambitious set of global goals against inequality set by world leaders in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/close-to-90-of-americans-feel-a-woman-could-become-us-president-by-2030-101615210490795.html
08-03-2021||World||EU executive criticises Belgium for Covid-19 travel ban||The European Union's executive criticised Belgium on Monday for extending its blanket ban on non-essential travel to and from the country despite the European Commission asking it to ease restrictions on movement.Highlighting how the bloc's 27 countries struggle to stick to a unified line in battling the Covid-19 pandemic, Germany has equally ignored a call from the Commission in late February to roll back its latest curbs on travel and borders.In laying out plans for gradually restarting more social and public activities from May, Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said last Friday that Belgium's ban on foreign travel would be extended by more than two weeks to Apr. 18."We were rather surprised by the Belgian authorities' announcement," said a spokesman for the Commission, which - as most EU institutions - sits in the Belgian capital Brussels."We have asked Belgium to replace that with more targeted measures," they said, referring to strict testing and quarantine requirements to discourage - but not ban - foreign trips.The Commission has said excessive limitations imposed recently to contain the spread of new variants of the coronavirus hurt the flow of goods, services and people in the bloc's cherished single market, already going through a record recession triggered by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-executive-criticises-belgium-for-covid-19-travel-ban-101615210185610.html
08-03-2021||World||As crime rises, New York prosecutor candidates vow to rein in office||Despite a recent rise in crime, many of the candidates in the crowded field vying to become the next Manhattan district attorney are talking about which crimes they won't prosecute, rather than those they will.This year’s race to succeed Cyrus Vance, who is unlikely to seek re-election, has become one of the most progressive campaigns in the country. Several candidates have vowed to stop prosecuting low-level crimes like prostitution, fare-beating and marijuana possession while two have pledged to ending gang conspiracy cases. At a recent online candidate forum, five of the people said they supported defunding the police.Whoever wins the June 22 Democratic primary is likely to shake up the office, to which only three White men have been elected in the past 79 years. The person will also take over the investigation that could turn into the office’s most historic prosecution -- that of Donald Trump.The most high-profile district attorney’s office in the nation — and the inspiration for the long-running TV series “Law & Order”— is responsible for prosecuting most crimes in Manhattan, from purse-snatching to corporate fraud to murder. Over its storied history, the office has won the convictions of Harvey Weinstein for sex crimes; David Berkowitz for the “Son of Sam” shootings; and former Tyco International Ltd. chief executive officer Dennis Kozlowski for looting his company. Vance has come under criticism for some missteps, including an initial decision not to prosecute Weinstein, but he has silenced some critics with his Trump probe.That case hasn’t come up much during the race though. Instead, the campaign has focused heavily on the racial- and social-justice issues that came to the fore following the deaths of several unarmed Black men and women at the hands of the police. In that respect, Manhattan could be set to join a progressive tide that in recent years has seen Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Brooklyn elect new district attorneys on pledges of sweeping reform.But the recent spike in violent crime in New York could test the appeal of such arguments. The five boroughs saw 468 homicides in 2020, the most in a decade, and shootings doubled from the year before, according to the New York Police Department. The first two months of 2021 have seen murders in New York fall slightly, to 47 from 49 during the same period last year, but shootings have increased 75%.Manhattan, where Trump barely received 10% of the 2020 vote, is certainly progressive territory. And relatively few Democratic primary voters will essentially decide the race long before Election Day — no Republicans are currently running and none has won the office since Thomas Dewey in 1938.‘Pendulum Swing’Manhattan district attorneys face a “constant balancing act,” said George Arzt, a longtime New York political consultant. “There is a pendulum swing in criminal justice where there is a call for law and order when people are sick of crime and shootings and then the pendulum swings back in the wake of cases like Eric Garner and George Floyd toward moderation and reforms.”The candidates largely reject any connection between rising crime and progressive reforms. They say the prosecutions they are foreswearing have unfairly targeted individuals and communities of color, and violent crimes would be better addressed by focusing on issues like gun control and mental health. Increased prosecutions and incarcerations only contribute to a cycle of recidivism, some candidates contend. Despite the recent increase, crime remains far lower than it was two decades ago — there were nearly 2,000 murders in New York in 1993.Competitive district attorney races in Manhattan have been rare events, with Vance’s predecessor, Robert Morgenthau, and Dewey’s successor, Frank Hogan, each staying in office for more than three decades. The diversity of the current field, which includes six women and a Black man, also mark a departure from the mold set by Morgenthau and Vance, both sons of cabinet secretaries.Historic First“It’s a large and interesting field who are really unknowns,” said Arzt. “There is a possibility there could be the first woman D.A. in history for Manhattan or the first African American man.”Where the race stands at the moment is difficult to judge, given the lack of polling. Two candidates have considerably outpaced the others in terms of campaign contributions, with Alvin Bragg raising $1.3 million and Tali Farhadian Weinstein raising $2.3 million.District attorney primaries are typically low-turnout affairs. Though there are 860,000 registered Democrats in Manhattan, Vance needed fewer than 50,000 of them to win his 2009 primary against two opponents. Running in a field of eight, the next district attorney might be elected by fewer than 30,000, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former Brooklyn federal prosecutor and top deputy to Vance who’s concerned that progressive reforms could lead to an increase in crime.“My biggest worry is that somebody is going to look in the mirror and say, ‘I am a Manhattan progressive, I was against everything Donald Trump stood for, so I need to vote for the most progressive candidate,’ without stopping to consider what that really means and the potential negative effect that that will have on public safety,” said Alonso.Rebecca Roiphe, a veteran of the district attorney’s office who’s now a professor at New York Law School, shares Alonso’s views. “The debate has been so focused on the ways in which these candidates are going to reform the office in a progressive manner that there is very little attention being paid to traditional law enforcement function like crime fighting,” she said.Defund the D.A.The three candidates staking out the most progressive positions — Eliza Orlins, a public defender, Tahanie Aboushi, a civil rights lawyer, and Dan Quart, a state assemblyman — have never worked as prosecutors before. Orlins wants to defund the district attorney’s office along with the police, vowing to cut its $120 million budget in half while replacing many of its staff with former public defenders or defense lawyers. Aboushi has said she’ll replace the unit that reviews initial arrests with one focused on diverting offenders out of the criminal justice system.Three former Manhattan assistant district attorneys — Lucy Lang, Liz Crotty and Diana Florence — are in the race, while Bragg and Farhadian Weinstein have both worked as federal prosecutors. The former prosecutors are also promoting progressive reforms, though. Lang has pledged to devise policies that divert incoming cases into programs that provide alternatives to prosecution. Bragg has vowed to create a unit of outside lawyers, social workers and community leaders to hold police officers accountable. Farhadian Weinstein has touted her work with Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez’s office reviewing past wrongful convictions.Crotty has argued for stepping up white-collar prosecutions to “institute a culture of fairness” that targets wealthy offenders as much as poorer ones. Florence has cited her history of taking on real estate and construction fraud to demonstrate that she wouldn’t be afraid to pursue the rich and influential over what she calls “crimes of power.”When it comes to one particular case involving a rich and influential person, the candidates are mostly mum though. They have all said it would be inappropriate for them to speculate about possibly prosecuting Trump. With the investigation gaining momentum though, chances are growing that the former president could be at the heart of the next district attorney’s biggest decision to prosecute or not.The CandidatesTahanie Aboushi: The civil rights lawyer says she will shrink the district attorney’s office, implement a policy platform that “addresses the root causes of crime” and won't prosecute at least two dozen crimes. Promises to get tough on crime usually lead to policies criminalizing “people of color while catering to the powerful and privileged,” Aboushi said. “The easy or soft thing to do is turn to more police and prosecution and continue to conflate accountability with incarceration.”Alvin Bragg: A Harlem native, the former assistant Manhattan U.S. attorney and onetime chief deputy state attorney general says he won't prosecute low-level crimes like turnstile jumping and gang conspiracy cases against juvenile offenders. He promises to prosecute crimes like domestic violence and create a civil rights unit to investigate police misconduct. “I will work to reshape and repurpose the D.A.’s office to end racial disparities,” said Bragg, adding that he would “refuse to criminalize poverty.”Liz Crotty: The prosecutor-turned-defense lawyer is positioning herself as a moderate who has seen both sides of what the office does. She’s vowed to prioritize white-collar prosecutions for fraud, money laundering, enterprise corruption and other economic malfeasance. Though Crotty also says she won't bring charges for minor crimes like turnstile jumping and shoplifting, she’s been critical of the race’s focus on foreswearing prosecutions. “The job of the D.A. is to enforce the law of the state of New York and to run on a platform describing the kinds of crimes you won't enforce is disingenuous,” she said.Diana Florence: The 25-year veteran of the D.A.’s office won landmark convictions over wage theft, deadly work conditions and non-profit fraud. Florence, who has won significant union backing, says the criminal justice system needs to take on developers and landlords. “The discussion isn't about not prosecuting but it's about prosecuting the right types of crime that destroy our communities like domestic violence, violent crime and sexual assault,” Florence said. “It also means prosecuting in a fair way, making sure we don't give powerful people a pass and instead over-prosecute people who are low income and people of color.”Lucy Lang: A homicide and domestic violence prosecutor under Vance and Morgenthau, she now touts her support for alternative justice programs that provides for supervised release or restorative justice. “I’ve spent my career working with those most impacted by the system,” she said. “We don’t have to choose between ending mass incarceration and keeping our communities safe, because with the right leadership, we will achieve both.”Eliza Orlins: The Manhattan public defender vows to never prosecute misdemeanor cases, sex work and some drug possession cases. Calling the criminal justice system “rigged,” Orlins wants to curtail the office’s prosecutorial function and push for alternatives to incarceration. “We’ve been sold a false choice between public safety and incarceration,” she said. “The reality is that a punitive criminal legal system does not keep us safe and it never will.” Orlins is one of the more familiar faces in the race due to her past as a contestant on reality TV shows “Survivor” and “The Amazing Race.”Dan Quart: The state assemblyman for the Upper East Side lists at least 18 crimes he won't prosecute and says decarceration is his top priority. “For far too long, our criminal justice system has criminalized poverty and mental health instead of prioritizing public safety,” Quart said. “Instead of prosecuting low-level crimes that punish poverty, like fare-evasion and drug possession, I’ll prosecute violent and economic crime that harms Manhattanites and I’ll hold the police accountable for excessive force.”Tali Farhadian Weinstein: The former assistant Brooklyn U.S. attorney and onetime Supreme Court clerk calls herself as a “progressive prosecutor” who will pursue bail and sentencing reforms. She says she would create a unit focusing on domestic and gender-based violence. “The best prosecutors use their resources to fight the crimes that harm the most vulnerable and do the most damage to public safety,” she said. Farhadian Weinstein, the wife of Saba Capital co-founder Boaz Weinstein, has attracted significant financial support from hedge fund heavyweights like David Einhorn and Bill Ackman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-crime-rises-new-york-prosecutor-candidates-vow-to-rein-in-office-101615209711101.html

Authorities want to quickly detect and isolate asymptomatic cases in order to avoid sending entire schools home.“We are being cautious in our approach so that we do not undo the progress we have made so far,” Johnson said as he urged people to get vaccinated.High schools and colleges could reopen in phases to allow for testing. The UK government has distributed nearly 57 million rapid “lateral flow” test kits to schools across the country, but there are concerns about the accuracy of the tests, which may result in pupils being forced to self-isolate unnecessarily.But Susan Hopkins, a director at Public Health England, told the BBC that evidence from testing over the past eight weeks suggested less than 1 in 1,000 tests resulted in a false positive.Britain has had Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with nearly 125,000 Covid-19 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-uk-students-back-to-school-after-2-months-of-closure-101615209031092.html

It said that Assad, 55, and his wife Asma, will return to work after spending between two to three weeks in isolation in their home.Both were in “good health and in stable condition,” it added.Syria, which marks 10 years of war next week, has recorded nearly 16,000 virus cases in government-held parts of the country as well as 1,063 deaths, but the numbers are believed to be much higher with limited amounts of PCR tests being done.Syria began a vaccination campaign last week, but no details have been given about the process. The health minister said the government procured the vaccines from a friendly country, which he declined to name.The announcement comes days after international and Israeli media reports revealed that Israel paid Russia $1.2 million to provide the Syrian government with coronavirus vaccines, as part of a deal that secured the release of an Israeli woman held in Damascus. The terms of the clandestine trade-off negotiated by Moscow remained murky; Damascus denied it happened and Russia had no comment.It was not immediately clear if Assad and his family members have been vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrias-president-bashar-al-assad-and-his-wife-test-positive-for-covid19-101615207816263.html

Tabloids react||The British media on Monday reacted sharply to Prince Harry and his wife Meghan’s highly-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired in the United States on Sunday night. During the two-hour conversation, Meghan opened up about her life as a member of the British royal family, concerns raised by its members with respect to the colour of their baby’s skin and the intense media scrutiny they faced.The Daily Mail ran wall-to-wall coverage of the interview on their website with the interview summarised into a single headline. “Meghan claims she was suicidal when she was 5 months pregnant, Kate made HER cry and Royals refused to make Archie a prince because they were worried how 'dark' he would be, as Harry reveals their new baby will be a GIRL,” it said.Watch: Meghan Markle & Prince Harry’s biggest revelations in tell-all interviewThe website was dominated with its coverage and had more than 20 articles about the interview. The tabloid's website also included a prominent banner that read: "I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF," and featured a clip playing on loop from the interview, which showed Meghan saying, with subtitles: "I just didn't want to be alive anymore."The print edition of the Daily Mail on Monday highlighted the allegations about concerns of Archie's skin colour: "MEGHAN ACCUSES PALACE OF RACISM," the front page of the Daily Mail read. The tabloid also quoted royal expert Robert Jobson as saying that the couple were "self-obsessed".The Sun newspaper also followed suit. “Meghan Markle may never return to Britain after angering Royal Family with bombshell Oprah interview," its headline read. The front page of the Daily Express newspaper read, "Queen: Duty and family unite us." "That's public service for you, Harry and Meghan ... NOT a self-serving TV chat with Oprah," the paper wrote before the interview. The Daily Telegraph wrote that Queen Elizabeth II was the only member of the royal family to "emerge unscathed" from the interview.In the interview, Meghan said that it had become clear that there were double standards in how the media covered her and Catherine, the duchess of Cambridge and wife to Prince William. "I can see now what layers were at play there. And again, they really seemed to want a narrative of a hero and a villain," said Meghan.Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, had also faced similar media scrutiny which made him compare Meghan’s plight with that of his late mother’s. Harry said that his biggest concern was history repeating itself. “You know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side because I can't begin to imagine what it must've been like for [my mother] going through this process by herself all those years ago,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-harry-call-out-british-media-in-oprah-interview-tabloids-react-101615203655022.html

However, its around 600 factories are significant employers, providing jobs for around 450,000 workers in 2020, according to the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association(Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; additional reporting by John Geddie; editing by Niklas Pollard)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fashion-giant-h-m-pauses-placing-orders-in-myanmar-says-extremely-concerned-101615206603647.html
08-03-2021||World||Taiwan President Tsai visits naval base amid Chinese threats||Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen visited a naval base on Monday to thank sailors and marines for their dedication to protecting the island amid renewed threats from China, vowing not to allow the loss of “any single inch" of territory.In remarks during her visit to the 131st Flotilla in the northern port of Keelung, Tsai said the bravery of servicemembers “demonstrated the determination of Taiwan’s national armed forces to defend the sovereignty of our country.”“We can’t yield any single inch of our land,” Tsai said.Tsai's tough talk comes amid stepped-up Chinese military exercises and near-daily incursions by Chinese military aircraft into airspace close to Taiwan. China claims the island, which broke away amid civil war in 1949, as its own territory and threatens to use its massive military to bring it under Beijing's control.China accuses Tsai and other members of her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party administration of undermining security in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing cut off contacts over her refusal to recognize the island as a part of China and has sought to pressure her through diplomatic isolation and economic measures.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday also demanded the Biden administration in the United States reverse former President Donald Trump’s “dangerous practice” of showing support for Taiwan, saying China’s claim to the self-governing island democracy is an “insurmountable red line.”Following Wang's remarks, the U.S. State Department expressed concern about Chinese attempts to intimidate Taiwan, stating “Our support for Taiwan is rock-solid.”Separately, Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China's Defense Ministry, reiterated that China would not “renounce the use of force and reserve the right to take whatever measures are necessary.”Tsai has made boosting Taiwan’s indigenous defense capacity a central pillar of her defense policy, while also buying billions of dollars in weapons from the U.S., including F-16 fighter jets, armed drones, rocket systems and missiles capable of hitting both ships and land targets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-president-tsai-visits-naval-base-amid-chinese-threats-101615206715173.html
08-03-2021||World||Migrant workers brought under the ambit of vaccination drive in Singapore||Singapore will start vaccinating migrant workers against Covid-19 as part of its national immunisation strategy, starting with 10,000 people living in the country's five largest dormitories.This batch of 10,000 workers have never been infected by Covid-19, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday, announcing the vaccination programme for the migrant workers.The migrant workers, which include a huge number of Indians, make up about 90 per cent of Singapore's Covid-19 tally, which stands at 60,046. The death toll is 29.The packed dormitories housing the foreign labourers were the biggest infection clusters during the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak in the island last year.Infections among the foreign workers have fallen in the past few months, with no new cases reported on most days, according to a report by Channel News Asia.Workers who have received both doses of the vaccine would be subjected to a lower frequency of testing, ie., every 28 days, instead of the current 14-day cycle, the Channel reported.Vaccinations will progressively be made available to all other migrant workers, the MOH said.The ministry said the migrant worker dormitories are where large Covid-19 clusters could "rapidly develop and grow, with a high risk of transmission to the local community"."Vaccination of migrant workers living in dormitories is thus part of our national Covid-19 vaccination strategy to protect all Singaporeans and long-term residents," it added.The ministry also announced that later this month it will offer vaccinations to selected cargo drivers and accompanying personnel who enter Singapore from Malaysia via a causeway and a bridge on a regular basis."Vaccination will provide an additional layer of protection against Covid-19, ensuring that personnel can continue to deliver essential goods to Singapore safely," said the ministry.Singapore began its Covid-19 vaccination exercise on December 30, 2020, with healthcare workers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases the first to get the jabs.About 379,000 people have since received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine as of Sunday, said the MOH.Of these, more than 217,000 have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination programme.On Monday, Singapore reported 13 new imported cases of Covid-19.The infected persons have been placed on 'stay-home notice' or isolated upon arrival in Singapore, said the MOH.No new locally transmitted infections were reported in the community or among the migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-workers-brought-under-the-ambit-of-vaccination-drive-in-singapore-101615203740398.html
08-03-2021||World||Myanmar protestors begin national strike, vows to defeat military||Myanmar protesters marched Monday in some of the country’s biggest cities, part of another nationwide strike to pressure the military to relinquish power after a February 1 coup.Thousands of demonstrators hit the streets in Yangon and Mandalay, Myanmar’s biggest cities, as well as other cities to keep up momentum for the pro-democracy movement. In the southeastern city of Dawei, the Karen National Union -- Myanmar’s longest standing ethnic armed group -- stood guard protecting protesters.At least three deaths were reported by witnesses and local media outlets across the Southeast Asian nation Monday taking the death toll in the harsh crackdown on protesters to at least 64 since the coup. Two protesters died of bullet wounds in Myitkyina city in Kachin State and a 30-years old man was shot dead in Pyapon of Ayeyarwady Region, news reports said. Police also cracked down on protests in Yangon and Mandalay.Eighteen labor organizations working in Myanmar jointly called for a nationwide work stoppage Monday in a bid to restore democracy after the military failed to recognize the November election win by detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s party. They called for all citizens to join the civil disobedience movement.“We are not content simply to create martyrs in the struggle for Myanmar democracy,” they said in a joint statement. “We must win this struggle, and the extended nationwide work stoppage is the path to the people’s victory.”Myanmar’s generals have come under more international pressure, with the United Nations envoy urging more action to halt the violent crackdown on protesters. While the US and UK have put sanctions on the generals, most other countries have resisted taking concrete measures even as they’ve pushed for a peaceful solution.The Myanmar Police Force released a statement late Sunday saying those who have instigated anti-state activities will be prosecuted in accordance with the law. Security forces will search and detain protesters for national security reasons, the statement said.The junta also warned on state-broadcaster MRTV that those who cause physical harm to security forces and persuade people to join the civil disobedience movement could be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison in accordance with the existing laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protestors-begin-national-strike-vows-to-defeat-military-101615205686591.html
08-03-2021||World||Thailand charges more activists with sedition, royal insults||Prosecutors in Thailand charged 18 pro-democracy activists with sedition on Monday, while lodging additional charges of insulting the monarchy against three of them.The sedition charges, which carry a maximum penalty of up to seven years in prison, stem from an antigovernment rally in September, though details on the alleged offenses were not immediately clear.The three charged with violating the lese majeste law, which outlaws criticism of senior members of the royal family, are Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, Jatupat Boonpattararaksa and Panupong Jadnok.Thai authorities have stepped up their legal offensive against those involved in a student-led protest movement that is pushing for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his government to step down, the constitution to be amended to make it more democratic and the monarchy to be reformed to make it more accountable.The latter demand is the most radical and controversial because the monarchy has rarely faced any public scrutiny and is considered by many to be an untouchable pillar of Thai identity. Those found guilty of violating the law against criticizing or insulting key royals face up to 15 years in prison per offense.The protest movement has struck a chord with many Thais but alienated others, especially royalists shocked at its criticisms of the monarchy. The movement began to lose steam late last year amid differences among its factions, and because of a resurgence of the coronavirus in Thailand.Prosecutors last month charged four protest leaders with lese majeste and they were denied bail.Jatupat, who was imprisoned for violating the lese majeste law in 2017, said that if he and the other activists charged Monday are unable to post bail they will keep fighting from jail.“The movement outside will surely continue no matter what happens,” he said.Jatupat on Sunday completed a nearly 250-kilometer (155-mile) walk from Thailand's northeast to Bangkok's Democracy Monument. Along the way, he campaigned and talked to people about ousting Prayuth, amending the constitution and abolishing the lese majeste law.According to the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, at least 382 people, including 13 minors, have been charged in connection with the protests, which picked up momentum last summer. At least 60 of those people have been charged with lese majeste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-charges-more-activists-with-sedition-royal-insults-101615190703786.html

Others are just starting out on a journey they didn't ask for,” Biden says in remarks prepared for the ceremony, which were obtained by The Associated Press.“Some were called to service, and some couldn't escape it,” Biden says. “They are fighting for their own lives and for their children. They?want to right the wrongs of our past, to?build a brighter future for everyone. They?aren't?immune to fear. No one is.”Biden says that in the course of ordinary?lives, each of the women made “an extraordinary?choice.”“You see, courage isn't really found,” Biden says. "It doesn't conjure away our doubts. It's an intentional decision made.”The ceremony is being held virtually and not at the State Department because of the coronavirus pandemic.The 14 living awardees are from Belarus, Cameroon, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Iran, Myanmar, Nepal, Somalia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Venezuela.“These women?made an extraordinary choice, to persist, to demand justice, to believe that, despite the obstacles and fear they faced, there is a future worth fighting for," Biden says.Monday is International Women's Day.Touching on the past year, the first lady says the pandemic shows “how the things that connect us — our love for family and friends, our hope that we will be together soon — transcend language and distance.” She says that diplomacy, “at its best, is a recognition of this connection” and that the United States, under President Joe Biden's leadership, will support women around the world.“We will make the choice to lead, to be bold and to lift up the women and girls everywhere who light our way,” Biden says in her prepared remarks. “For 15 years, we have honored women around the world who have made the extraordinary choice to fight for something bigger than themselves.”“Today, we recommit to being worthy of that courage, to understanding that our lives are tied together in immeasurable and powerful ways and to choosing, every day, to honor that connection,” she says. “We will stand with you as we build a brighter future for us all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-helps-honor-women-from-15-countries-for-courage-101615203661523.html
08-03-2021||World||Russia slams Facebook over blocking media content||Russia accused Facebook on Monday of violating citizens' rights by blocking some media outlets' content in the latest standoff between a government and Big Tech.Communications watchdog Roskomnadzor at the weekend threatened Facebook with a minimum 1 million rouble ($13,433) fine and demanded it restore access to content posted by TASS news agency, RBC business daily and Vzglyad newspaper.It said Facebook blocked posts pertaining to Russia's detention of alleged supporters of a Ukrainian far-right group."I think this is unacceptable. It violates our national legislation," said Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament and a member of President Vladimir Putin's United Russia ruling party.In a statement, Volodin said Facebook had violated basic rights to disseminate and receive information, and legislation would be proposed to preserve Russia's "digital sovereignty."Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Like other nations, including Australia in a high-profile dispute with Facebook and India in a spat with Twitter, Russia has in recent months taken steps to regulate and curb the power of big social media companies.Bills passed in December allow Russia to impose large fines on platforms that do not delete banned content and to restrict access to US social media companies if they are deemed to discriminate against Russian media."They operate in our environment but at the same time they often don't obey any Russian laws," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told RIA news agency on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slams-facebook-over-blocking-media-content-101615202708073.html
08-03-2021||World||EU's financial regulator hit by Microsoft email hack, takes down email system as 'precautionary measure'||The European Banking Authority, a key EU financial regulator, says it has fallen victim to a hack of its Microsoft email system which the US company blames on a Chinese group.Microsoft said last week that a state-sponsored group operating out of China was exploiting previously unknown security flaws in its Exchange email services to steal data from business and government users, believed to number in the tens of thousands so far.The "Hafnium" group was a "highly skilled and sophisticated actor," it said.Hafnium has previously targeted US-based companies including infectious disease researchers, law firms, universities, defence contractors, think-tanks and NGOs, it added.In a statement issued late Sunday, the EBA confirmed the attack on its email systems which it had decided to take offline "as a precautionary measure.""The Agency has swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with its ICT provider, a team of forensic experts and other relevant entities," it said.The EBA warned that as a result of the attack, personal data could have been accessed and it would provide advice on possible mitigation measures if necessary.Microsoft executive Tom Burt said last Tuesday that the company provided updates to fix the security flaws and urged customers to apply them."We know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems," he added.Beijing typically rejects US hacking charges out of hand and last year berated Washington following allegations that Chinese hackers were attempting to steal coronavirus research.In January, the US said Russia was probably behind the massive SolarWinds hack that hit large swathes of the government and private sectors, and which experts say may constitute an ongoing threat.Microsoft said Tuesday the Hafnium attacks "were in no way connected to the separate SolarWinds-related attacks."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eus-financial-regulator-hit-by-microsoft-email-hack-takes-down-email-system-as-precautionary-measure-101615201601994.html
08-03-2021||World||Mike Pence to give speech in South Carolina, his first since leaving office||In his first public address since the end of the Trump administration, former Vice President Mike Pence is traveling to South Carolina, set to speak to a conservative Christian nonprofit in the state that plays a crucial role in the presidential nominating process.Next month, Pence will keynote a dinner hosted by the Palmetto Family Council, a Pence aide told The Associated Press on Sunday. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity due to a lack of permission to discuss the plans publicly.The Palmetto Family lobbies for what it considers to be “biblical values,” such as heterosexual marriage, and most recently helped push through a ban on most abortions in South Carolina. That law is now being challenged in court.Pence, who since leaving the administration has been doing work with the Heritage Foundation and Young America's Foundation, has not indicated if he plans a future run for office, but his choice of making his post-administration debut in South Carolina helps set down a marker for a potential 2024 presidential bid. The state holds the first presidential primaries in the South, and candidates of both major parties typically spend more than a year in the state ahead of those votes, introducing themselves and trying to secure support.As vice president, Pence made numerous trips to South Carolina, meeting several times with Gov. Henry McMaster for coronavirus-related forums. He also recently campaigned in the state for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace.Throughout his political career, beginning as an Indiana congressman-turned-governor, Pence has long advocated for restrictions on abortion and has voiced support for the overturn of Roe v. Wade. The speech to Palmetto Family is advantageous for Pence in a state that Republican candidates use as a proving ground to test their “pro-life” mettle.The Pence aide described the former vice president's speech as one that will focus on traditional conservative talking points but will also tout what Pence sees as the accomplishments of the Trump administration.According to Dave Wilson, president of Palmetto Family, Pence will speak to between 450 and 600 guests at a ticketed, sponsored dinner at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center on April 29.Wilson told AP that he considered Pence a “prime person” to address the organization due to the “level of faith” the former vice president embodied while in office.“Vice President Mike Pence ... is very reflective of the ideas, policies and direction that we at Palmetto Family want to see in South Carolina: bringing faith to the forefront and growing the next generation of conservative leaders for our state,” Wilson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-to-give-speech-in-south-carolina-his-first-since-leaving-office-101615200360888.html

In a historic first, two warships INS Kulish and INS Sumedha, with Cmde MV Raju, NM, Naval Officer-in-Charge Andhra Pradesh onboard, arrived at Mongla today and were accorded a ceremonial welcome by Bangladesh Navy," India in Bangladesh wrote in a tweet.According to the Indian Navy, the year 2021 is being celebrated as 'Swarnim Vijay Varsh' being the 50th anniversary of the 1971 Indo-Pak war. However, 2021 is also the 50th Year of Independence of Bangladesh."This is the first time that any Indian Naval Ship is visiting the port of Mongla in Bangladesh and the visit is aimed at paying homage to the Bangladeshi and Indian combatants and citizens who laid down their lives during the Liberation War of 1971, and reiterate India's firm resolve and commitment to maintain peace, stability and good order in the region, in line with SAGAR - Security and Growth for all in the Region, as articulated by the Prime Minister of India," an official release stated.India and Bangladesh are celebrating 50 years of the liberation war in which the Pakistan Army was thrown out of Bangladesh and 90,000 of their troops were made to surrender. Meanwhile, a number of events are being organised by both countries to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the decisive war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ins-kulish-sumedha-arrive-in-bangladesh-to-mark-50th-anniversary-of-1971-war-101615199928949.html
08-03-2021||World||Myanmar security forces kill 2 anti-coup protesters||Security forces shot dead two people in northern Myanmar on Monday, local media reported, as the military government continued its attempt to stamp out opposition to its Feb. 1 coup.The Irrawaddy newspaper said the victims were shot in the head during anti-coup protests in Myitkyina in Kachin State. Graphic video on social media showed protesters in the street backing away from tear gas, responding with rocks, then fleeing after a fusillade of what seemed to be automatic gunfire.Demonstrators hurriedly carried away a number of casualties, including one apparent fatality, a person who had clearly sustained a severe head wound. A second body was seen a little later, on a stretcher, his head covered with a cloth.Security forces also clamped down on anti-coup protesters elsewhere Monday, firing tear gas to break up a crowd of around 1,000 people who were demonstrating in the capital, Naypyitaw. The protesters deployed fire extinguishers to create a smoke screen as they fled from authorities.Meanwhile, thousands of protesters marching in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, dispersed on their own amid fears that soldiers and police were planning to use force to break up their demonstration.Large-scale protests have occurred daily across many cities and towns in Myanmar since the country’s military seized power, and security forces have responded with ever greater use of lethal force and mass arrests.The coup and its violent aftermath have led foreign governments and international organizations to impose measures against Myanmar's military leaders.In the latest example, Australia suspended its defense cooperation with Myanmar and is redirecting humanitarian aid in the country because of last month's military takeover of the government and the ongoing detention of an Australian citizen.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Monday that diplomats and relatives had only been able to contact economic policy adviser Sean Turnell twice by phone since he was detained in early February. She described the access as “very limited consular support.”Australia announced late Sunday that it had suspended a defense training program with Myanmar worth about 1.5 million Australian dollars ($1.2 million) over five years. The program had been restricted to noncombat areas such as English-language training.Australian humanitarian aid will be directed away from Myanmar government and government-related entities. Instead it will focus on the immediate humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable and poor in Myanmar, including the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities, Payne said.On Sunday, police occupied hospitals and universities and reportedly arrested hundreds of people involved in protesting the military takeover.In Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, gunshots from heavy weapons rang out for a second straight night in several neighborhoods after the start of an 8 p.m. curfew. The sounds of what apparently were stun grenades could also be heard on videos posted on social media.The purpose for security forces using such weapons when protesters had left the streets appeared to be part of a strategy to strike fear in anyone who might think about defying the authorities. In a similar vein, many filmed incidents of police and soldiers in plain view showed them savagely beating protesters they had taken into custody.Some of the shooting was heard near hospitals, where reports said neighborhood residents sought to block the entry of police and soldiers.Security forces have often targeted medical personnel and facilities, attacking ambulances and their crews. Members of the medical profession launched the Civil Disobedience Movement, which is the nominal coordinator of the protests, frequently hailed on demonstrators’ signs by its CDM initials. Taking over hospitals would allow the authorities to easily arrest wounded people presumed to be protesters.Meanwhile, a Canadian-Israeli lobbyist hired by Myanmar’s junta has said the ruling generals want to get out of politics and shift the nation away from China after they grabbed power in the widely-condemned coup against the nation’s civilian government.Ari Ben-Menashe, who previously represented Sudan’s military leader and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, spoke to The Associated Press on Sunday from the U.S. after returning from his second trip in the past month to Myanmar.He said he was confident he can persuade the Biden administration to lift sanctions imposed on Burmese military leaders who directed the coup last month that deposed and detained Myanmar's elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.He said the U.S. and others in the West have reduced Myanmar’s political conflict to a black and white tale of military repression against pro-democracy activists that ignores the fraudulent exclusion of millions of minorities from voting in last year's election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-kill-2-anti-coup-protesters-101615199197087.html
08-03-2021||World||Biden administration to review campus sexual misconduct rules changed by Trump||US President Joe Biden on Monday will order a review of changes the previous administration made to on rules on how colleges should handle sexual assault allegations and formally establish a White House Gender Policy Council, officials said.A Biden executive order he will sign later on Monday will direct the US Education Department to review all its existing regulations, orders, guidance, and "policies for consistency with the administration’s policy to guarantee education free from sexual violence," according to a White House fact sheet provided Sunday night.In 2017, the Trump administration reversed Obama-era guidelines that had spelled out measures schools should follow to try to prevent sexual assaults on campuses. Trump's Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, argued the Obama guidelines resulted in too many students being falsely charged and the accused being treated unfairly.In May 2020, DeVos unveiled final regulations on how colleges should deal with sexual misconduct allegations on campuses. She said the rules would require "schools to act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process."Biden's order directs a review of the 2020 regulation "to determine whether the regulation and agency action are consistent with the policies of the Biden-Harris Administration," the fact sheet said.A second executive order will formally establish a White House council gender equality council, officials said.The council is part of "a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls in the United States and around the world," according to a White House fact sheet.Jennifer Klein, chief strategy and policy officer at anti-sexual harassment activist group Time's Up, is cochairing the council with Julissa Reynoso, a lawyer who previously served as a diplomat and deputy assistant secretary of state during the Obama administration.As a candidate, Biden pledged to narrow the wage gap between men and women, invest in women-owned businesses and fight against work-place discrimination. His vice president, Kamala Harris, is the first woman to occupy the position.The council will work with other parts of the administration to address "barriers to women’s participation in the labor force, decreasing wage and wealth gaps, and addressing the caregiving needs of American families and supporting care workers," the fact sheet said.As of January, women accounted for slightly more than half of the 10 million jobs lost during the coronavirus crisis, even though they typically make up a little less than half the work force.More than 2.5 million women left the labor force between February 2020 and January of this year, compared to 1.8 million men.Biden will direct the council to submit a "government-wide strategy to address gender in policies, programs and budgets" and an annual report on progress, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-review-campus-sexual-misconduct-rules-changed-by-trump-101615198227457.html
08-03-2021||World||Revealing Meghan and Harry interview with Oprah shakes UK royal family||Britain's royal family was absorbing the tremors Monday from a sensational television interview by Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, in which the couple said they encountered racist attitudes and a lack of support that drove Meghan to thoughts of suicide.The couple gave a deeply unflattering depiction of life inside the royal household, depicting a cold, uncaring institution that they had to flee to save their lives.Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that at one point “I just didn’t want to be alive anymore” and had uncontrollable suicidal thoughts. She said she sought help through the palace’s human resources department, but was told there was nothing they could do.While most in Britain have yet to see the interview, which airs on Monday evening, anti-monarchy group Republic said the Winfrey interview gives a clearer picture of what the royal family is like — and it’s not pretty.“Whether for the sake of Britain or for the sake of the younger royals this rotten institution needs to go,’’ Graham Smith of the campaign group said.“Some people will say ‘well you would say that,’ but this interview has only served to highlight what a lot of people have known for years: The monarchy is rotten to the core and does not reflect British values.″In the soul-baring interview, Meghan, 39, admitted that she was naive at the start of her relationship with Harry and unprepared for the strictures of royal life.Meghan, who identifies as biracial, described that when she was pregnant with son Archie, there were “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born.”Harry confirmed the conversation, saying: “I was a bit shocked.” He said he would not reveal who made the comment.Harry, born a royal prince, described how his wife’s experience had helped him realize how he and he rest of the family were stuck in an oppressive institution.“I was trapped, but I didn’t know I was trapped,” Harry said. “My father and my brother, they are trapped.”Meghan, he said, “saved me.”The younger royals — including Harry, Meghan, Prince William and William’s wife Catherine — have made campaigning for support and awareness around mental health one of their priorities. But Harry described a royal family completely unable to offer that support to its own members.“For the family, they very much have this mentality of ‘This is just how it is, this is how it’s meant to be, you can’t change it, we’ve all been through it,’” Harry said.Sympathy for the couple poured in from the United States, where the two-hour interview was broadcast Sunday night. It will be shown later Monday in Britain, where some see Meghan and Harry as a couple who put personal happiness ahead of public duty.Tennis star Serena Williams, a friend who attended Harry and Meghan’s wedding, said on Twitter that the duchess’ words "illustrate the pain and cruelty she’s experienced.“The mental health consequences of systemic oppression and victimisation are devastating, isolating and all too often lethal,” Williams added.American actress Meghan Markle, a star of the American TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born the following year.In early 2020, Meghan and Harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. They have settled in Santa Barbara, California, and spoke to Winfrey from their home in the upmarket Montecito area.Harry said he had lived in fear of a repeat of the fate of his mother, Princess Diana, who was covered constantly by the press and died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi.“What I was seeing was history repeating itself, but definitely far more dangerous — because then you add race in, and you add social media in,” Harry said.Both Meghan and Harry praised the support they had received from Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's grandmother.“The queen has always been wonderful to me,” Meghan said.But Harry revealed he currently has a poor relationship with his brother William, and said things got so bad with his father that at one point Prince Charles stopped taking his calls.“There is a lot to work through there,” Harry said about his relationship with his father. “I feel really let down. He’s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like. And Archie is his grandson. I will always love him, but there is a lot of hurt that has happened.”In a rare positive moment in the interview, Harry and Meghan revealed their second child, due in the summer, would be a girl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/revealing-meghan-and-harry-interview-with-oprah-shakes-uk-royal-family-101615198689196.html

BEA investigators were travelling to the site on Monday.Forbes magazine listed Olivier Dassault as one of the world's top 500 richest people in 2020. He held executive positions at the family-owned Dassault Group as well as serving in the lower house of parliament as a lawmaker from the conservative Republicans party since 2002.President Emmanuel Macron paid homage in a tweet to a “captain of industry, parliament member, local elected leader, air force reserve officer" and said "his brutal death is a great loss.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-aviation-industrialist-olivier-dassault-killed-in-helicopter-crash-101615195661901.html
08-03-2021||World||Germany plans aggressive Covid-19 vaccine rollout after slow start||Germany will drastically speed up its vaccination campaign in the next few weeks with as many as 10 million weekly inoculations from the end of March, according to Finance Minister Olaf Scholz.In April, May and June, vaccination centers and doctors will have to handle millions of doses every week, Scholz said in an interview with ZDF television on Sunday night. “And I have seen to it that this will be well prepared for.”Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has come under fire for the country’s slow coronavirus vaccination campaign. Germany has so far given 8.8 shots per 100 people, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. That compares with more than 27 doses in the US and almost 35 in the UK.A rate of 10 million per week would be a rapid acceleration in Germany’s vaccination campaign. The country used a total of 7.33 million doses since inoculations started ten weeks ago, according to the tracker.In a move that will likely aid the rollout effort, Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine is expected to be accepted at the European level this week, European Union internal markets chief Thierry Breton said on France 2 television. He said that the EU would double its monthly vaccine production and would see output of 90 million to 100 million doses a month by the end of March.“This month we will have even fewer vaccines, which means we have to supplement priorities and add flexibility,” Bavaria’s Prime Minister Markus Soeder told ARD television on Monday. “There is a feeling of ‘We could have more freedom if we were able to tackle the organizational hurdles’ like the fact that there aren’t enough vaccines available and that the bureaucracy surrounding immunization is so rigid,” he added.Germany’s sluggish vaccination pace has contributed to the need for a longer lockdown, with Merkel last week extending most curbs to March 28. Her government also unveiled a plan to gradually relax virus restrictions, but a further easing is dependent on a slowdown in Covid-19 infection rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-plans-aggressive-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-after-slow-start-101615194887614.html
08-03-2021||World||China's carbon market to grow 30-fold by 2030, says Citigroup||The size of China’s carbon market will expand more than 30-fold over the next decade as it covers more industries and polluting becomes more expensive, according to Citigroup Inc.The market’s physical turnover will rise from about $800 million this year, its first in operation, to around $25 billion by the end of the decade, analysts including Tracy Liao said in a March 8 note. The expected growth underscores both the massive potential of the emissions trading scheme, and the modest impact it’s expected to have at the outset as the government seeks to ease companies into compliance.China’s launch means that one-fifth of global emissions will now fall under a tax or trading scheme, according to Citi. At the same time, the pressure to cut emissions is likely to be inflationary and could leave Chinese factories more expensive relative to countries without controls, the bank said.“The Chinese national ETS as currently rolled out should play a limited role in reducing emissions at first,” Liao said. “We expect a series of developments to transform China’s ETS into the world’s largest effective carbon trading scheme and a key building block of the country’s 2030 peak emissions commitment.”China made the rules for its ETS official in February and wants online trading to begin by the end of June. The market will begin with the power sector, and will add other energy-intensive industries such as steel, petrochemicals and cement through 2025.Citi expects an initial carbon price of $4 a ton and emissions allowances representing about 200 million tons to be in circulation this year. Those are expected to rise to $25 a ton and 1 billion tons in circulation by 2030, the bank said, based on a survey.At $25 a ton, the carbon cost for a coal-powered aluminum smelter could rise to $375 a ton, equivalent to current profit margins, according to Citi.“If policies are stringent enough, this could precipitate the shifting of supply chains of emission-intensive industries from China to other countries that do not face the same regulatory costs,” Liao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-carbon-market-to-grow-30-fold-by-2030-says-citigroup-101615194099066.html

The government has said it is still assessing the causality between the incidents and the vaccine and would report findings as soon as possible.Around 93,000 people have been vaccinated since the public rollout started on Feb 26."These serious adverse events are of much concern to us," Sophia Chan, the city's health secretary, told a news briefing on Monday. "We are still uncertain whether it was related to the vaccine. Once we have any information or conclusions, we would report the details to the public."Bookings for vaccinations have dropped in recent days according to government figures that show around 4,900 people booked their Sinovac vaccine on March 5, compared with 12,300 people on March 3.Chan said people who were unsure about their own medical situation should consult a doctor before booking the vaccine.Hong Kong is due to start administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine this week. Until now Sinovac has been the only option available.Patrick Nip, the city's secretary for the civil service, who was speaking at the same news conference, said seven additional preferential groups would be allowed to apply for vaccines including, those working in catering, in supermarkets and convenient stores and public transport workers such as bus drivers.To try to assuage fears, Matthew Cheung, the city's secretary for administration, wrote on his blog on Sunday that the government would do a "good job of vaccination monitoring and respond to social concerns to protect public health and give citizens peace of mind".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-vaccinate-teachers-cab-drivers-despite-reports-of-adverse-events-101615193570122.html
08-03-2021||World||Hong Kong's chief executive ''fully welcomes'' proposed electoral changes||Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam said Monday the city's government “fully welcomes” changes to the city's electoral system that will substantially increase central government control over Hong Kong politics and exclude Beijing's critics.Chinese authorities have said the draft decision before China's National People's Congress would mean the largely pro-Beijing committee that elects Hong Kong's leader would also choose a large part of the legislature to ensure that the city is run by “patriots.” The Election Committee would also have the right to vet candidates for the Legislative Council, weeding out any suspected of being insufficiently loyal to China and the ruling Communist Party.Currently, half of Hong Kong's legislature is directly elected by voters, although the mass resignation of opposition legislators to protest the expulsion of four of their colleagues for being “unpatriotic" means the the body is now entirely controlled by Beijing loyalists.“There are loopholes in the electoral systems, there are also flaws in the systems in Hong Kong,” Lam said at a news conference after she returned from the meeting in Beijing. “I fully understand that this is not a matter that can be addressed entirely by the government.”“I'm glad that the central authorities have, again, exercised its constitutional powers to help address this problem for Hong Kong,” she said.She declined to elaborate on the views she had shared to the central authorities regarding the electoral reforms, and said many pieces of legislation in Hong Kong would have to be amended. The NPC, China's ceremonial legislature, will all but certainly endorse the draft decision, though it may not take immediate legal effect.Unconfirmed reports say the legislation will also expand the size of the Legislative Council from 70 to 90 and the Election Committee from 1,200 to 1,500. Seats on the Election Committee now reserved for directly elected district counselors will also be eliminated, further cementing Beijing's control over the body.Lam also said she could not confirm whether legislative elections — already postponed for one year last September ostensibly because of the coronavirus pandemic — would be further deferred due to the electoral reforms.She also said the central government authorities are “very sincere and very committed in trying to move towards the objective of universal suffrage,” which was promised to Hong Kong under the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution that was drawn up when the British handed Hong Kong to China in 1997.Universal suffrage would give Hong Kong voters the right to vote for the city's leader, although only candidates approved by Beijing would be allowed to run.Hong Kong has in recent months cracked down on dissent, and most of the city's opposition figures — including pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers — are in jail or in exile.About 100 people, most of whom are pro-democracy activists and supporters, have been charged under the city's sweeping national security law since it was implemented in June. The NPC imposed the law on Hong Kong, bypassing the Legislative Council, saying it was necessary to restore order after increasingly violent anti-government protests in 2019.The legislation criminalizes secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city's affairs and terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-chief-executive-fully-welcomes-proposed-electoral-changes-101615193939189.html
08-03-2021||World||Google to provide $25 million to social enterprises working on women empowerment||Google.org, the philanthropic arm of the tech giant, on Monday said it will provide $25 million in grants to non-profits and social enterprises globally, including in India, that are working on empowering girls and women.The company, which has committed support one million rural women entrepreneurs in India, also stated that its Internet Saathi digital literacy training programme has benefitted over 30 million women across the country."In India, in the past few years, we have invested more than $40 million alongside the entrepreneurs, the innovators, the non-profits who are doing amazing work. We announced another million dollar initiative building on that work in particularly to help getting digital skills to those who are most vulnerable, including women," Jacquelline Fuller, Vice President at Google and President of Google.org, said in a virtual briefing.She added that one of the first initiatives under that effort is led by the NASSCOM Foundation, wherein the organisation is getting a $500,000 grant from Google.org to support one lakh women agri workers."They (Nasscom Foundation) are going to reach one lakh women farmers and provide digital skills and financial literacy. Learning these skills has been shown to increase their incomes by about 30%," she said.Talking about the new $25 million grant, Fuller said this is a global impact challenge aimed at non-profit organisations that are working towards helping women and girls."We are providing $25 million, it's an open call. So any non-profit or social enterprise anywhere around the world can apply. And the winners will get funding up to $2 million per organisation. We're also going to provide Googlers, so there'll be expertise, whether that's in software engineering or user experience, or even marketing to come alongside and help bring these projects to fruition," she said.Fuller noted that while more girls are now going to school and more women are represented in the workplace, the Covid-19 pandemic has had gender-regressive effects."The Covid crisis is one of the greatest threats we have ever seen to this progress. We know that globally, women are about twice as likely to have lost their jobs during the Covid crisis. And we see women who are doing double duty around the world while they are working, also teaching children at home in many places, providing caregiving," she said.She pointed out that around a billion children globally have seen their education being disrupted, girls are much less likely to return to school after the pandemic."At the same time, there's just not enough funding going to women and girls. If you look at all of the philanthropic funding, only about 1%-2% of all funding is targeted to women and girls. So that's why it's so important that we're we're doing this and we're doing this alongside of our partners," she said.Sapna Chadha, Senior Country Marketing Director at Google India and Southeast Asia, said based on learnings from the Internet Saathi program, the company has launched the Women Will web platform that will be complemented by community support, mentorship and accelerator programmes for rural women entrepreneurs.Available in English and Hindi, the Women Will platform is designed especially for women aspiring to explore entrepreneurship. Through a 'how to' curriculum on turning an interest into a business, managing an enterprise, and promoting it for growth, the platform will provide guidance and support to women who want to convert an existing hobby or talent such as tailoring, beauty services, home tuition, food processing, etc into income.To begin with, Google will work with 2,000 Internet Saathis to help other women gain from this resource and start on their entrepreneurial journey.Google, in partnership with Tata Trusts, had launched the Internet Saathi programme in 2015 to empower women across rural India with digital literacy skills and bridge the digital gender divide. The joint effort, upon completion, has reached across 3 lakh villages. Over six years, this pan-India effort has benefitted over 30 million women across India through training provided by over 80,000 Internet Saathis."Two in 10 women included in the Internet Saathi programme started small businesses of their own, and 73% of them stated an interest to learn new skills. And almost three-fourths of them felt they were able to start their own business in the future...The next leap with this insight is taking digital Literacy to digital livelihoods, to help women generate income, create livelihoods," she said.In a statement, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said when women have equal access to opportunity, everyone can benefit from their perspectives, creativity and their expertise."Yet, when it comes to accessing opportunity, deep inequalities persist. Building on the Internet Saathi program success, we're making a new commitment to help one million women in rural villages in India to become entrepreneurs through business tutorials, tools, and mentorship,” he added.Ratan Tata, Chairman of Tata Trusts, said the organisations had embarked on training women trainers to familiarise other women on how to utilise the internet, all in the rural environment, that would otherwise never take place."In bringing today's technology, and perhaps tomorrow's technology, to bear for the benefit of rural women is a great move forward. Over time, these efforts will ensure that the true value of the internet can come into the fore. I would like to congratulate the two teams that have worked together to help make this happen," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-provide-25-million-to-social-enterprises-working-on-women-empowerment-101615193176010.html

The revelations aren't over: Winfrey teased additional bits of the interview would be shown Monday morning on CBS.Meghan on racism around son Archie and him not receiving the prince title:"They didn't want him to be a prince or princess, not knowing what the gender would be, which would be different from protocol, and (said) that he wasn't going to receive security."In those months when I was pregnant ... we have in tandem the conversation of, you won't be given security, not gonna be given a title and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born."Meghan declined to name who expressed those concerns: "I think that would be very damaging to them. That was relayed to me from Harry; those were the conversations that family had with him."Meghan on considering suicide:"I just didn't want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. And I remember how he (Harry) just cradled me."She said she went to senior people in the institution to ask for help."I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help ... And I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution."I remember this conversation like it was yesterday, because they said, my heart goes out to you because I see how bad it is, but there's nothing we can do to protect you because you're not a paid employee of the institution."This wasn't a choice. This was emails and begging for help, saying very specifically I am concerned for my mental welfare."Asked if she thinking of harming herself, or having suicidal thoughts, while pregnant with her first child she said:"Yes. This was very, very clear ... and very scary."Harry on "blindsiding" the queen:Harry, asked whether he told his family about his plans to step away from his royal roles and about a newspaper story that they had "blindsided" the queen with their decision:"I've never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her."Meghan, too, was complimentary toward the queen, despite saying at one point she realised some in the palace were willing to lie to “protect other members of the family.”“The queen has always been wonderful to me,” Meghan said.Harry confirms Prince Charles stopped taking his calls:"I had three conversations with my grandmother, and two conversations with my father before he stopped taking my calls. And then he said, can you put this all in writing?"Asked why Prince Charles had stopped taking his calls:"By that point, I took matters into my own hands, it was like, I needed to do this for my family. This is not a surprise to anybody. It's really sad that it's got to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well."Meghan on Kate making her cry before her wedding:Meghan, on a newspaper story that she made Prince William's wife Kate cry over flower girls' dresses before Meghan and Harry's wedding:"The narrative with Kate, which didn't happen, was really, really difficult and something that I think that's when everything changed really."Asked if she made Kate cry: "The reverse happened. A few days before the wedding she was upset about something, pertaining to ... the flower girl dresses, and it made me cry. And it really hurt my feelings.""There wasn't a confrontation and ... I don't think it's fair to her to get into the details of that because she apologised, and I have forgiven her. What was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didn't do, but that happened to me.""I'm not sharing that piece about Kate in any way to be disparaging to her."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-racism-and-queen-key-highlights-from-meghan-harry-s-interview-to-oprah-101615187716728.html

08-03-2021||World||Meghan, Harry say UK royals were worried ‘how dark’ their son Archie would be||Meghan Markle and her husband Prince Harry alleged in a tell-all interview on Sunday that the British royals were worried “how dark” their son Archie would be.The son would also not be accorded the usual royal titles, the couple told Oprah Winfrey, the legendary talk show host who conducted a much-anticipated interview for CBS.In another revelation that underlines the couple’s estranged relationship with Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan said they have been financially cut off by the UK royal family.Harry said his father Prince Charles had stopped taking his calls. The king-in-waiting of a monarchy struggling to stay relevant had barely just emerged from the setbacks he had suffered over his troubled marriage with Princess Diana.The deadliest blow in the interview came in the form of allegations of a potentially racist response from the royal family - from at least one unidentified royal - to the child that the couple were expecting.“All around this same time, we have in tandem the conversation of he won’t be given security, he’s not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations as how dark his skin might be when he’s born,” Meghan said, speaking of Archie, their first born. Archie was born on May 6, 2019.Meghan clarified that she hadn’t heard this particular conversation herself. “That was relayed to me from Harry from conversations that the family had with him,” she told Winfrey.Harry refused to elaborate when asked about it, saying, “That conversation, I am never going to share.”Meghan said she was told the son would not be granted a royal title or security even before he was born.“The allegation that there were discussions in the (Buckingham) palace about how dark Meghan’s first baby might be is a devastating one,” Jonny Dymond, the BBC’s royal correspondent, noted. “This is heading into ‘worst-case scenario’ territory for the palace.”Harry and Meghan stepped down from their official roles in the family as “senior royals” in March 2020 and relocated from London to California.The two former royals drew a picture of a cold and uncaring British royal family. Meghan said no one prepared her for her role as a royal, in a reminder, royal watchers said, of the reception accorded to Diana. Meghan added that she didn’t get any help when she reached out, eventually feeling suicidal.“I was ashamed to say it at the time and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry. But I knew that if I didn’t say it - then I would do it,” she said. “I just didn’t want to be alive anymore.”“That was clear and real and frightening and a constant thought,” said Meghan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-harry-say-uk-royals-were-worried-how-dark-their-son-archie-would-be-101615188976895.html
08-03-2021||World||Joe Biden’s giant stimulus to easily pass House, say Democrats||President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion package will sail through the House when it takes up the bill on Tuesday, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides, even after proposals progressives championed were scaled back.The Senate’s changes to the House-passed bill, made to appease moderates and comply with parliamentary rules, are unlikely to prove enough to make progressive Democrats vote against it.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can only afford to have four Democrats oppose a bill for it to pass, if all members are voting and Republicans are lined up in opposition, given her party’s thin majority. Two Democrats joined a united GOP in voting against the initial version of the stimulus.Pelosi on Sunday predicted the bill will pass.“In two days, the House will have a resounding, hopefully bipartisan, vote for justice,” Pelosi said in a letter to her caucus on Sunday. “We can then send it to the president and move quickly to distribute its life-saving resources.”Other senior lawmakers agreed.“I don’t think there is any trouble. What Democrat is going to vote against a bill that cuts poverty by a third, expands child tax credits and SNAP, gives $1,400 to 80% of their constituents?” said Budget Chairman John Yarmuth, a chief architect of the American Rescue Plan bill. SNAP refers to a federal food-assistance program.With Biden now cruising to his first legislative victory less than two months after proposing his relief bill, economists have baked its effects into their forecasts for a stronger recovery in 2021.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists see the unemployment rate tumbling to 4.3% by year-end, from 6.2% in February, with employment climbing by almost 7.4 million for 2021, making up most of the 9.4 million plunge in payrolls last year.“Growth will be rip-roaring during the coming year,” Moodys Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi wrote Sunday, due to additional fiscal stimulus, the end of the pandemic and consumers emerging from lockdown.The outsize stimulus has propelled a surge in bond yields, with 10-year rates punching through to the highest levels in more than a year last week.Deadline NearsDemocratic aides said the looming March 14 expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits makes for a strong disincentive for any rank-and-file members to try to force a renegotiation with the Senate. That could risk missing the deadline, with assistance lapsing.Progressives who had expressed concern about any changes in the Senate so far are holding their fire, with the Congressional Progressive Caucus issuing a statement calling the upper chamber’s changes “minor.”Outside groups, like the Justice Democrats and Sunrise movement, were also quiet on the bill over the weekend.The Senate reduced weekly supplemental unemployment benefit to $300 per week through Sept. 6, compared with $400 through August in the House bill. The new version also now lets individuals earning up to $150,000 to collect $10,200 in benefits tax free.Senate’s TweaksWhile the ceiling for zeroing out stimulus checks was lowered to $80,000 from $100,000 by the Senate, the bill now made student-loan relief tax-free. A progressive attempt to add a phased-in $15 minimum wage to the package failed when eight senators in the Democratic caucus voted Friday against waiving budget rules to allow it in the bill.Marathon negotiations Friday night showcased the delicate balance of power in the Senate, and the sway of moderates. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer contended with a move by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin to back a GOP proposal to phase out the enhanced jobless benefits by mid-July.With Schumer arguing that such a change could cause trouble in the House, Manchin ultimately compromised, and backed the deal to keep aid going until September.Progressive House Democrats are already turning their attention to getting their proposals in a second budget reconciliation bill -- which allows for Senate approval by a simple majority, rather than the usual 60 votes to cut off debate.

The NPC, China’s ceremonial legislature, will all but certainly endorse the draft decision, though it may not take immediate legal effect.Unconfirmed reports say the legislation will also expand the size of the Legislative Council from 70 to 90 and the Election Committee from 1,200 to 1,500. Seats on the Election Committee now reserved for directly elected district counselors will also be eliminated, further cementing Beijing's control over the body.Lam also said she could not confirm whether legislative elections — already postponed for one year last September ostensibly because of the coronavirus pandemic — would be further deferred due to the electoral reforms.She also said the central government authorities are “very sincere and very committed in trying to move towards the objective of universal suffrage,” which was promised to Hong Kong under the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution that was drawn up when the British handed Hong Kong to China in 1997.Universal suffrage would give Hong Kong voters the right to vote for the city’s leader, although only candidates approved by Beijing would be allowed to run.Hong Kong has in recent months cracked down on dissent, and most of the city's opposition figures — including pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers — are in jail or in exile.About 100 people, most of whom are pro-democracy activists and supporters, have been charged under the city's sweeping national security law since it was implemented in June. The NPC imposed the law on Hong Kong, bypassing the Legislative Council, saying it was necessary to restore order after increasingly violent anti-government protests in 2019.The legislation criminalizes secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city's affairs and terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-fully-welcomes-proposed-electoral-changes-101615186732613.html

Huyen has been caring for Covid-19 patients at a tropical disease hospital in Hanoi the past year. Health protocols limited her time with family, among other challenges. “I hope the vaccine will be available for everyone so we can contain the virus and get back to normal life," she said.The first batch of over 100,000 doses in a 30 million-dose order of the vaccine developed by Oxford University and U.K.-based drugmaker AstraZeneca arrived two weeks ago. Separately, Vietnam expects to secure another 30 million doses of the same vaccine through COVAX, a U.N.-backed initiative created to ensure vaccine access to low- and middle-income countries.It is also negotiating with Pfizer for another 30 million doses, according to the health ministry.After Covid-19 first responders, the next group to be vaccinated will be diplomats, workers providing essential services, teachers, senior citizens and people with chronic illnesses.Vietnam has recorded 2,512 cases of Covid-19, a low number compared to other countries. Despite a fresh outbreak detected in two northern provinces in January, it has managed to contain the virus's spread and resume business activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-vaccinates-covid-19-front-liners-with-its-1st-doses-101615186761614.html

Few wore facemasks, especially during Francis' stops in northern Iraq on Sunday. That day ended with an open-air mass in a stadium that drew nearly 10,000 people. Security was tight and most events were strictly controlled.Public health experts had expressed concerns ahead of the trip that large gatherings could serve as superspreader events for the coronavirus in a country suffering from a worsening outbreak where few have been vaccinated. The pope and members of his delegation have been vaccinated but most Iraqis have not.Iraq is in the midst of another wave of the coronavirus, spurred by a new, more infectious strain that first appeared in the UK. Authorities in Iraq recorded 4,068 new infections on March 6, according to Health Ministry figures, up significantly from infection rates at the start of the year. In total 13,500 people have died among a total 720,000 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-leaves-iraq-for-rome-after-historic-whirlwind-visit-101615187272906.html

08-03-2021||World||As US mulls Afghan exit, activist sees long fight for women||Prominent activist Sima Samar has been fighting for women’s rights in Afghanistan for the past 40 years. She believes her struggle is far from over — especially at a time when violence is on the rise, peace talks between rival Afghan groups are stuck and the US mulls a May departure from her country.Samar, 64, worries about the future, noting that insecurity and instability in Afghanistan have reached frightening levels."No one knows what will happen tomorrow,” she said in an interview at her home in the Afghan capital, Kabul, protected by blast walls, guards and a German shepherd, who races to his vantage point overlooking the street when a car even slows as it passes.Yet much is at stake and “a lot of sacrifices have been made in these 20 years," she said, reflecting the anxiety among civil society leaders as the US searches for the best exit from its longest war.Under a 2020 deal between the Taliban and the Trump administration, all US troops are to leave Afghanistan by May 1. The Biden administration says it's reviewing the deal, suggesting it may not meet the deadline.Last week, Samar and other civil society representatives participated in a Zoom call with US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. He assured them that Washington stands with Afghanistan’s civil society to protect the gains made in the past 20 years.The call seemed last-minute to Samar — held just before Khalilzad was leaving Kabul for Qatar to meet with Taliban negotiators, following two days of face-to-face meetings with political leaders and warlords-turned-politicians.“I feel a little like history is repeating itself," said Samar, questioning the prominence given again to warlords and a political leadership that struggles to win over the trust of Afghans.When the Taliban regime was ousted in 2001 by the US-led coalition she had pressed for justice — that those who had committed crimes in previous regimes should be punished, that accountability, equality and justice should be given priority.At that time she warned in vain against having warlords — who had participated in the 1990s civil war and destroyed much of Kabul — in prominent roles in a post-Taliban administration. She received death threats and was targeted in a slander campaign as “Sima Samar, the Salman Rushdie of Afghanistan.”“I am not saying everyone has to go to jail but a crime is a crime,” she said. “They should be at least brave enough to say ‘I am sorry.’ That's a start."Samar said Afghanistan needs involvement by international community going forward, to make sure that promises made are kept and that cease-fires are monitored independently. Culprits should be punished, she said.The immediate question on the minds of many is who is systematically targeting and killing members of civil society. The Islamic State group has claimed several attacks. The Taliban have denied involvement in most incidents. The government and the Taliban often blame each other.The number of targeted killings tripled last year, according to Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission, which Samar launched and headed from 2002 to 2019.Commission spokesman Zabihullah Farhang said 65 women were killed and 95 wounded in targeted attacks in 2020. Attackers hit a maternity hospital. Twice they struck educational institutions, killing 50 people, most of them students. Several of the victims were journalists, rights activists, young judges, lawyers.“It is like taking the rarest pearls from our midst,” said Torek Farhadi, an analyst and former Afghan government adviser.In recognition of International Woman’s Day on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is awarding six Afghan women, who were among those killed last year, with the International Women of Courage award.“These tragic murders underscore the alarming trend of increased targeting of women in Afghanistan and the United States condemns these acts of violence,” Blinken said ahead of the ceremonies.Blinken also proposed steps to help jumpstart the stalled peace process between the government and the Taliban, according to his letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani published Sunday by Afghanistan’s TOLONews.The letter calls for bringing the two sides together for a U.N.-facilitated conference with foreign ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the US “to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan.”Samar said much has been gained in the 20 years since the Taliban were ousted. Schools for girls are open. Women entered the workforce, politics, became judges — they are even at the negotiating table where the Taliban and the Afghan government are struggling to find a way to end war.But the gains are fragile and human rights activists have many enemies in Afghanistan — from militants and warlords to those who want to stifle criticism or challenges to their power.Afghanistan is second only to Yemen as the worst place in the world to be a woman, according to the 2019 Women, Peace and Security Index, compiled by the Georgetown Institute for Women Peace and Security and the Peace Research Institute in Oslo. The illiteracy rate among Afghan women is 82% and most of the women in Afghan prisons are jailed for so-called “moral” crimes like seeking a divorce.The road to justice and equality remains long, said Samar, who became an activist as a 23-year-old medical student with an infant son. At the time, the then-communist government arrested her activist husband, and she never saw him again.Samar, who says discrimination based on ethnicity and gender is still widespread, is a member of Afghanistan's minority Hazaras, who have faced discrimination for centuries. They are mostly Shiite Muslims in a majority Sunni Muslim Afghanistan and most often the target of Islamic State militants in recent years.Despite the persistent challenges, Afghanistan of 2021 is different, said Samar, a recipient of numerous awards who during a recent visit wore a T-shirt proclaiming “this is what a FEMINIST looks like.”Human rights, women’s rights and the rights of minorities are now at least being discussed. “At least we speak about violence against women now. Before it was not an issue in this country, except for some crazy ones like me," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-us-mulls-afghan-exit-activist-sees-long-fight-for-women-101615186964129.html
08-03-2021||World||China tells Biden to reverse 'dangerous practice' on Taiwan||China’s foreign minister warned the Biden administration on Sunday to roll back former President Donald Trump’s “dangerous practice” of showing support for Taiwan, the island democracy claimed by Beijing as its own territory.The claim to Taiwan, which split with the mainland in 1949, is an “insurmountable red line,” Wang Yi said at a news conference during the annual meeting of China’s ceremonial legislature.The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but extensive informal ties. Trump irked Beijing by sending Cabinet officials to visit Taiwan in a show of support.“The Chinese government has no room for compromise,” Wang said.“We urge the new US administration to fully understand the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue” and “completely change the previous administration’s dangerous practices of ‘crossing the line’ and ‘playing with fire,’” he said.President Joe Biden says he wants a more civil relationship with Beijing but has shown no sign of softening Trump’s confrontational measures on trade, technology and human rights. Surveys show American public attitudes turning more negative toward China, which is seen as an economic and strategic competitor.Wang gave no indication how Beijing might react if Biden doesn't change course, but the ruling Communist Party has threatened to invade if Taiwan declares formal independence or delays talks on uniting with the mainland.The State Department later reiterated that the Biden administration's support for Taiwan was rock-solid and that the US stood with its regional friends and allies, including “deepening our unofficial ties with democratic Taiwan.”“We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected representatives," said the statement issued late Sunday in Washington.Wang’s comments in a wide-ranging, two-hour news conference reflected Beijing’s increasing assertiveness abroad and rejection of criticism over Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and other sensitive topics.Wang defended proposed changes in Hong Kong that will tighten Beijing's control by reducing the role of its public in government. He dismissed complaints that erodes the autonomy promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997.The changes announced Friday follow the arrest of 47 pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong under a national security law imposed last year following months of anti-government protests.Beijing needs to protect Hong Kong’s “transition from chaos to governance,” Wang said.The proposal would give a pro-Beijing committee a bigger role in picking Hong Kong legislators. That would be a marked reduction of democracy and Western-style civil liberties in Hong Kong. Mainland officials say they want to make sure the territory is controlled by people deemed patriots.“No one cares more about the development of democracy in Hong Kong than the central government,” Wang said. He said the changes will protect the “rights of Hong Kong residents and the legitimate interests of foreign investors.”Also Sunday, Wang rejected complaints Beijing’s treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang amounts to genocide.Human rights researchers say more than 1 million people, many of them members of the Uyghur minority, have been sent to detention camps. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent extremism.“The so-called existence of genocide in Xinjiang is absurd. It is a complete lie fabricated with ulterior motives,” Wang said. He blamed “anti-China forces” that he said want to “undermine the security and stability of Xinjiang and hinder China’s development and growth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tells-biden-to-reverse-dangerous-practice-on-taiwan-101615186465473.html

The government represses political freedom, and controls the freedom of expression, Kashmiri said.He further said that anyone who wants to take part in public life in the country has to sign a pledge of loyalty to Pakistan while anyone who publicly supports or worries about Kashmir faces persecution.Those who favour independence risk being beaten and jailed. Numerous political leaders of Kashmir have been forced to live in exile and face the threat of being eliminated or languish in jail.Talking about a prominent political leader from Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), Sardar Arif Shahid, who was brutally killed in Rawalpindi seven-years ago, Kashmiri said that the issue was raised several times at different forums including United Nations to put pressure on Pakistan for a judicial inquiry but no action has been taken yet.In Pak occupied Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, nationalist leaders and political workers and human rights activists are being booked for sedition, he added.Speaking about the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), he said, the project runs through disputed territories of Gilgit Baltistan and is a cause of environmental damage - air quality, water resources, and soil erosion.Kashmiri also said that UKPNP demands that the Pakistan government must take immediate actions against security forces and agencies those who kidnap citizens of Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir and make arrangement for the immediate release of all those who have disappeared.UKPNP recommends that the Jammu and Kashmir issue must be resolved through a process of dialogue and peaceful means, he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukpnp-chairman-says-part-of-j-k-illegally-held-by-pakistan-since-1947-101615185278675.html

But now we've got our family. We've got the four of us and our two dogs."Harry, wearing a gray suit as he sat next to his wife at a distance from Winfrey, joined the interview after Meghan talked to Winfrey alone.He denied blindsiding the queen with the news that he and Meghan were stepping down from their royal duties, saying it was preceded by several conversations."I've never blindsided my grandmother," Harry said. "I have too much respect for her."He did however say that his father, Prince Charles, has stopped taking his calls.Meghan Markle told Oprah Winfrey that she had suicidal thoughts after marrying Prince Harry, and the palace prevented her from getting help.Meghan told Winfrey in the interview airing Sunday night that she “just didn't see a solution” to the mental suffering she had experienced since joining the royal family and that she told Harry she “didn't want to be alive anymore.”She said she went to a senior royal staffer and said she needed to get help for her mental health, but was told it would be bad for the family if she did.She described the moment as a breaking point leading to her and Harry stepping aside from their royal duties.Meghan said she “wasn't planning to say anything shocking" during the interview, “I'm just telling you what happened."Meghan Markle told Oprah Winfrey that she realized soon after marrying Prince Harry that the institution of the royal family would not protect her.In their pre-taped interview on Sunday night, Meghan told Winfrey that “not only was I not being protected, but they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family, but they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband.” She did not give specific examples.She said when she was first pregnant with son Archie, there were “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born.” The statement led Winfrey to ask “What,” incredulously and sit in silence for a moment.Meghan declined to say who had this conversation with Harry that he relayed to her, saying revealing their name would be “very damaging.”Meghan also said she was stunned when she was told he would not be a prince and would not receive security from the palace.Meghan said she did not worry about being a divorced, mixed-race American actress entering the British royal family, but later she “thought about it because they made me think about it.”Meghan said it was not so much the royal family members themselves who treated her this way, but the people behind the institution.She emphasised that the queen herself “has always been wonderful to me."Meghan Markle told Oprah Winfrey that she didn't “fully understand what the job was” when she married Prince Harry.Winfrey's hotly anticipated two-hour pre-recorded interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex began its airing on CBS in the U.S. on Sunday night, with Meghan sitting alone with Winfrey.The two talked about the early days before the royal marriage, with Meghan saying “there was no way to understand what the day-to-day was going to be like."That's what was really tricky over those past few years, is when the perception and the reality are two very different things," Meghan said. “And you're being judged on the perception, but you're living the reality of it.”Meghan also revealed that she and Harry were technically married a few days before the ceremony watched by the world.After a brief intro with Winfrey narrating a recounting of the couple's wedding and subsequent announcement that they were stepping down from their royal duties, Meghan walked into the backyard garden setting of the interview."You really are having a baby!” Winfrey shouted when she saw Meghan's baby bump under her black empire-style dress.Meghan said she would reveal the sex of the baby later in the interview when Harry joined them.Winfrey and Meghan said they were at the home of a friend of Winfrey's because they liked the setting.They clarified that no questions would be off limits and that Meghan and Harry would not be paid for the interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-a-girl-meghan-markle-and-harry-tell-oprah-101615174216751.html

She cited a report late last year that found extreme poverty was expected to rise for the first time in more than two decades with a disproportionately high share of women among the world’s new poor.The pandemic has contributed to an increase in violence against women and is reinforcing gender inequality in many countries, with women on average having roughly three-quarters of the legal rights of men, according to the World Bank.While laws have improved in some countries, women in many nations still face legal limits on economic opportunities, including restrictions on travel without a male guardian, the lender said.Pazarbasioglu of the IMF said it’s very important to have “a women’s lens in policies.”“That’s what we are pushing in our surveillance, in our lending, in our analytical work and in our capacity development,” she said.Pazarbasioglu and Reinhart wrote an opinion piece published by Bloomberg on Monday arguing for greater transparency in finance to help address growing inequality within countries and across borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/women-can-be-fired-for-pregnancy-in-28-nations-says-world-bank-s-reinhart-101615173550431.html
08-03-2021||World||Meghan Markle says British royals worried about her son's dark skin||Meghan, the wife of Prince Harry, said there were concerns about how dark her son Archie's skin would be before his birth and that such worries explained why he was not given the title of prince.Meghan, whose mother is Black and father is white, said she was naive before she married into the royal family in 2018, but that she ended up having suicidal thoughts and considering self harm after asking for help but getting none."They didn't want him to be a prince or princess, not knowing what the gender would be, which would be different from protocol, and that he wasn't going to receive security," Meghan said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey aired on CBS late on Sunday."In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time, so we have in tandem the conversation of, 'you won't be given security, not gonna be given a title' and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born."She declined to say who had aired such concerns. Asked if she was silent or had been silenced, she replied: "The latter."The highly anticipated interview is set to intensify an already acrimonious row between Meghan and Harry on one side and the British monarchy on the other.The couple have stepped down from their royal duties and are starting a new life in the United States.Harry said he left because of a lack of understanding and because he was worried about history repeating itself - a reference to the 1997 death of his mother Diana.He said he had not blindsided his grandmother, the queen, as he had too much respect for her, although his father, Prince Charles, had stopped taking his calls."I had three conversations with my grandmother, and two conversations with my father before he stopped taking my calls. And then he said, can you put this all in writing?" Harry said.Their detractors say the couple want the glamour of their positions without the dedication it requires or scrutiny it brings.To their supporters, their treatment shows how an outdated British institution has lashed out against a modern, biracial woman, with undertones of racism.'QUEEN HAS BEEN WONDERFUL'There have also been allegations of bullying against Meghan which first appeared in The Times newspaper in the buildup to the couple's appearance.Buckingham Palace, which has made no comment so far on the interview, said it would investigate the claims, adding it was "very concerned."In response to the report, a spokeswoman for Meghan said she was "saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself."Meghan told Winfrey that people within the royal institution not only failed to protect her against malicious claims but lied to protect others."It was only once we were married and everything started to really worsen that I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family," Meghan said."There's the family, and then there's the people that are running the institution, those are two separate things and it's important to be able to compartmentalise that because the queen, for example, has always been wonderful to me."Meghan denied a newspaper story that she had made Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, cry before the wedding and said it was a turning point in her relations with the media."That was a turning point," Meghan said. Asked if she made Kate cry, Meghan replied: "The reverse happened.""A few days before the wedding she (Kate) was upset about something, pertaining to yes the issue was correct about the flower girl dresses, and it made me cry. And it really hurt my feelings."Meghan said she had been naive before her wedding and did not realise what she was marrying into when she joined the British royal family."I will say I went into it naively, because I didn't grow up knowing much about the royal family," Meghan said.Meghan explained that she was not being paid for the interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-says-british-royals-worried-about-her-son-s-dark-skin-101615173157661.html
08-03-2021||World||Meghan Markle says 'just didn't want to be alive anymore', alleges royal racism||Prince Harry's wife Meghan Markle on Sunday said she contemplated taking her own life after joining the royal family, and raised allegations of racism in the monarchy during an explosive television interview.Explaining the couple's dramatic exit from royal life, Meghan said she was denied help during her mental health crisis, was targeted by lies, and that there was official concern about the skin color of her unborn son.Meghan, whose father is white and mother is Black, spoke out in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that immediately became one of the most extraordinary chapters in recent royal history and was set to rock the British institution."I... just didn't want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought," she told Winfrey.Asked if she was having suicidal thoughts, Meghan replied "Yes. This was very, very clear."Recalling how she felt at the time, she said that "I'm scared, because this is very real. This isn't some abstract idea. This is methodical, and this is not who I am."Meghan, 39, also told of royal "concerns" about "how dark" her son's skin would be, saying Harry revealed to her official concerns over Archie's appearance, as well as the security he would be entitled to, ahead of his birth on May 6, 2019.- 'How dark his skin might be' -"In those months when I was pregnant... we have in tandem the conversation of 'he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title' and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born," Meghan told Winfrey.After the couple's surprise decision to move to North America, the former television actress has been portrayed in some British newspapers as headstrong, calculating and spoiled, and the couple reckless and selfish for quitting royal life.The two-hour interview with the queen of US television was the biggest royal tell-all since Harry's mother princess Diana detailed her crumbling marriage to his father Prince Charles in 1995.Winfrey reportedly sold it to US broadcaster CBS for $7-9 million, and retained the international rights to the interview, which will feed an appetite of interest about Britain's centuries-old monarchy -- and their troubles -- across the globe.Royal fans were offered a treat with the revelation by the couple of the gender of their second child -- the first senior royal due to be born outside Britain in 100 years."It's a girl!" Harry and Meghan chimed in tandem.But it was a rare light-hearted moment in the drawn-out interview -- and viewers who tuned in to see if the pair had scores to settle with Buckingham Palace since leaving the royal frontline were likely to be shocked at how far they went.- Knives out -Taking aim squarely at the royals, Markle flatly denied reports that she made Kate Middleton cry before her wedding to Harry -- saying the reverse was true."Everyone in the institution knew it wasn't true," Meghan told Winfrey of the reported incident -- pored over at great length by the gossip press."The reverse happened," Meghan added, saying that Kate "was upset about something, but she owned it, and she apologized.""A few days before the wedding, she was upset about something pertaining -- yes, the issue was correct -- about flower girl dresses, and it made me cry, and it really hurt my feelings."Meghan called the incident "the beginning of a real character assassination" and "a turning point" in her relations with the royal family."I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family," she said.Ahead of the broadcast, revelations emerged Meghan was facing an internal palace investigation into claims that she bullied royal household staff after she and Harry married in a fairytale wedding in 2018.Further reports the couple are facing a probe into their charitable foundation have been seen as a counter-offensive by the embattled royals in a bitter battle for public support and sympathy.Last month, when Buckingham Palace confirmed the couple would not return to their senior roles, it said they would not "continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service."The Sunday Times said Queen Elizabeth II, 94, would not watch the interview.The weekly quoted unnamed courtiers as calling the situation a "circus," and the palace would "come out swinging" if individuals are attacked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-says-just-didn-t-want-to-be-alive-anymore-alleges-royal-racism-101615172490690.html

Now a joint call from the Trades Union Congress, ground-handlers Swissport International Ltd. and Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd. asks for:“Aviation has been an engine for creating high-quality skilled jobs and will serve as an important catalyst for economic prosperity post-Covid,” Heathrow Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye said in an emailed statement.“The budget set out the next phase of support available for businesses –- including the extension of government-backed loans and furlough payments, which build on around 7 billion pounds ($9.7 billion) of support already pledged for the aviation sector since the start of the pandemic,” a government spokesman said in an emailed response.“It’s almost a year since ministers promised a sector-specific support package for the aviation industry, but it’s yet to materialize,” the opposition Labour Party’s transport spokesman Jim McMahon said in an email. “It’s clear that government failure is costing jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-aviation-industry-calls-on-boris-johnson-for-more-financial-aid-101615167337175.html

A Kremlin spokesman denied the U.S. claim Russia was spreading false information about vaccines to the WSJ.Russia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russia approved its Sputnik V vaccine in August, before a large-scale trial had begun, saying it was the first country to do so for a Covid-19 shot. Peer-reviewed trials months later proved it was almost 92% effective in fighting the virus.Pfizer, headquartered in New York, and Germany's BioNTech, produced the first vaccine that was authorized in the United States, which regulators approved in December. The second, made by Moderna, headquartered in Massachusetts, was authorized later that month.The State Department's Global Engagement Center, set up to counter propaganda and disinformation campaigns, identified the three outlets, the spokeswoman said.News Front is controlled by Russia's federal security service, the center found. New Eastern Outlook and Oriental Review are directed and controlled by the Russian foreign intelligence service.A fourth outlet, Rebel Inside, controlled by the Russian army, was also named by the center but is largely dormant, the spokeswoman said."The Department will continue to expose Russia’s nefarious activities online," she added. "We will also continue to work closely with our allies and partners to provide a global response to countering disinformation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-disinformation-spread-by-russia-backed-outlets-says-us-101615164978030.html
08-03-2021||World||Hire more police officers, improve intelligence capability: Capitol riot review||US House members on Monday will receive closed-door briefings with details of a top-level review that calls for security improvements to prevent another breach of the Capitol.Briefings from the task force led by retired Army Lieutenant General Russel Honore will be given to members of both parties, a person familiar with the matter said.Recommendations in the draft report include hiring more Capitol Police officers, streamlining the force’s command structure, improving its intelligence capability, and upgrading fences and security surveillance. It even suggests restoring horse-mounted patrols to the Capitol complex that were disbanded in 2005.The report acknowledges “institutional challenges unique to securing the Capitol,” including “the inherent tension between public access and physical security.” The complex is currently ringed by miles of temporary fencing topped by razor wire.Word of the briefings came after House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy issued a statement critical of Honore, including a suggestion that he’d been chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to reach a desired result: “turning the Capitol into a fortress.”Pelosi said last week that she’d received Honore’s draft of an initial security review of the Capitol complex security in the wake of the Jan 6. assault by supporters of former President Donald Trump. “It’s going to take more money to protect the Capitol,” she said.The report says the breach showed “the need to immediately improve the security” of the Capitol complex and of members of Congress. Those proposals include:While the draft doesn’t name a price tag, Pelosi has said a supplemental appropriations bill will be needed to boost spending on Capitol security and that work on drafting the legislation has started.Pelosi commissioned Honore to lead the task force on Jan. 15, with a brief to look at security infrastructure, inter-agency processes, and command and control. She called him “a respected leader with experience dealing with crises.”Honore, 73, is credited with turning around the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He has experience dealing with the interaction between military and civilian authorities and with security in the Washington area.Pelosi’s call for an independent commission has some bipartisan support, yet the effort risks getting tangled in the bitter aftermath of Trump’s impeachment by Democrats over the deadly assault.‘Political Bias’McCarthy, in his statement, questioned Honore’s “political bias because of statements he made before his review,” including an “inflammatory accusation that Capitol Police officers themselves were complicit in the attack.”“While there may be some worthy recommendations forthcoming, General Honore’s notorious partisan bias calls into question the rationality of appointing him to lead this important security review,” McCarthy said.Pelosi has called for an independent commission to investigate the Capitol insurrection, similar to one set up in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. But an initial draft of a bill to create such a panel is entangled in partisan fights, including over how many seats each party would get on the commission.Fencing OptionsAside from a “robust Quick Reaction Force,” the Capitol also needs “a fully integrated system of obstacles, cameras, sensors, and alarms, around the complex,” according to the report. “The current, temporary security fence surrounds such a tremendous area that it requires significant personnel resources to monitor its entire length.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hire-more-police-officers-improve-intelligence-capability-capitol-riot-review-101615164458989.html
08-03-2021||World||Game of drones: Chinese giant DJI hit by US tensions, staff defections||Chinese drone giant DJI Technology Co Ltd built up such a successful US business over the past decade that it almost drove all competitors out of the market.Yet its North American operations have been hit by internal ructions in recent weeks and months, with a raft of staff cuts and departures, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees.The loss of key managers, some of who have joined rivals, has compounded problems caused by US government restrictions on Chinese companies, and raised the once-remote prospect of DJI's dominance being eroded, said four of the people, including two senior executives who were at the company until late 2020.About a third of DJI's 200-strong team in the region was laid off or resigned last year, from offices in Palo Alto, Burbank and New York, according to three former and one current employee.In February this year, DJI's head of US R&D left and the company laid off the remaining R&D staff, numbering roughly 10 people, at its flagship U.S. research centre in California's Palo Alto, four people said.DJI, founded and run by billionaire Frank Wang, said it made the difficult decision to reduce staffing in Palo Alto to reflect the company's "evolving needs"."We thank the affected employees for their contributions and remain committed to our customers and partners," it said, adding that its North American sales were growing strongly."Despite misleading claims from competitors, our enterprise customers understand how DJI products provide robust data security. Despite gossip from anonymous sources, DJI is committed to serving the North American market."It did not comment on the other U.S. staff departures that current and ex-employees spoke of, although it told Reuters last year its global structure was becoming "unwieldy to manage".DJI, which has become a symbol of Chinese innovation since it was founded in 2006, is one of dozens of companies caught in the crossfire of trade and diplomatic hostilities between Washington and Beijing, like Huawei and Bytedance.Staff sources and competitors say the company's brand reach, technical know-how, manufacturing might and sales force mean it won't lose its crown anytime soon in the multi-billion-dollar US and global markets for non-military drones.But a December order adding the company to the U.S. Commerce Department's "Entity List" along with the closure of its R&D operation in California could affect its ability to serve the needs of U.S. customers, according to three former senior executives and two competitors.       The Commerce Department listing, enacted over allegations including DJI enabled "high-technology surveillance", prohibits the company from buying or using U.S. technology or components. The same month, Romeo Durscher, DJI's US-based head of public safety, who had played a central role in building the company's business in providing drone technology to non-military US government departments and agencies, left his job.Durscher, a former NASA project manager and an influential figure in the drone industry, now works at Swiss company Auterion, a competitor to DJI.He said he left DJI because he was disheartened by the staff cuts and what he described as internal power struggles between the US team and its China headquarters. He added that the US reorganisation complicated the task in dealing with the fallout from US-China tensions and winning government business."It's not an easy decision to leave the market leader that's really far ahead of everyone else," said Durscher, who joined DJI in 2014. "But those internal battles were distracting from the real purpose and in 2020 it got worse ... we lost tremendous talent at DJI and that's very unfortunate."US SECURITY CONCERNSPrivately held DJI doesn't publish sales figures. The US Department of Defense estimated the American non-military market was worth $4.2 billion last year. Consultancy DroneAnalyst said DJI controlled almost 90% of the consumer market in North America and over 70% of the industrial market.The December listing by the Commerce Department, and the prohibition on buying US parts, may impact the firm's mobile apps, web servers and some battery and imaging products, said David Benowitz, head of research at DroneAnalyst and a senior figure with DJI's enterprise team, which works with industrial customers, in Shenzhen before he left last summer.DJI said in December that the ban would not affect U.S. customers' ability to buy and use its products.The listing followed other official blows. In October, the U.S. Department of the Interior said it would only buy drones from companies okayed by the Department of Defense, which last August published a list of five approved drone suppliers to the federal government - four American and one French.DJI said there was no "broad-based U.S. government ban on purchasing DJI drones"."Congress considered that approach last year and rejected it, because ... such a ban would be challenging for many companies and government bodies that rely on drones," it added.'WE'RE STILL PRIMITIVE'Benowitz said persisting US-China tensions and the push by Washington to support DJI's rivals could see the company's North American market share decline. He added that, while the federal government comprised a relatively small part of DJI's business, its restrictions could have a "chilling effect", with other buyers worried about tougher measures in the future."We're at a point where there are too many market opportunities for one player to dominate," he said.Yet he added alternatives to DJI were relative minnows, though both policy support and security concerns over Chinese drones had brought them growth in the last year. Competitors to DJI include France's Parrot and California-based Skydio.Chris Roberts, CEO of Parrot Inc, Americas, said 2020 had been a significant year for the company in the United States, having been named an approved supplier by the Defense Department and won business from emergency services and security agencies.Skydio announced $170 million in D-round funding last week and said it had a valuation of over $1 billion.    "DJI makes good hardware but we are still very early in the market, and very primitive compared to what ultimately should exist," Skydio CEO Adam Bry told Reuters.PHANTOM DRONE FLEETSWhen Durscher joined DJI back in 2014, the company's Phantom series was transforming drones from a niche hobby to a mainstream gadget. He said he was particularly drawn by the chance to bring drones into the kit of fire and rescue departments.He said the technological advances of smaller rivals in the last year were tempting for some public-safety agencies, who might say "let's go with this drone now so we don't have to deal with the data security".He added that change could come as government departments and companies looked to replace drone fleets that are nearing the end of their life cycles.A fleet is typically expected to last three to four years, according to Benowitz.Durscher and several other staff compared DJI's internal rivalry over projects to "Game of Thrones", the TV series where rival factions vie for power. He said this resulted in a rotating door of Shenzhen bosses, and that he reported to 12 different managers in his six years at the company.Durscher's departure from DJI followed those of other key executives in North America last year, including director of business development Cynthia Huang.Huang, who now works with Durscher at Auterion, said job cuts over the past year were the main reason she decided to leave. The losses in Palo Alto, Burbank and New York had followed cuts made to DJI's global sales and marketing teams, which Reuters reported in August."Some of the people that we lost in those layoffs, it didn't make sense," said Huang, who was hired in 2018 to take the lead in building DJI's enterprise business in North America. "The continued exodus of talent was discouraging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/game-of-drones-chinese-giant-dji-hit-by-us-tensions-staff-defections-101615164112053.html
08-03-2021||World||Covid-19's impact could mean millions more child marriages: Unicef||The outsized impact Covid-19 has had on women in some countries could result in an additional 10 million child marriages in this decade, according to a new analysis released Monday by Unicef."School closures, economic stress, service disruptions, pregnancy and parental deaths due to the pandemic are putting the most vulnerable girls at increased risk of child marriage," said a study titled "Covid-19: A threat to progress against child marriage."That trend, if confirmed, would represent a serious retreat from recent years of progress against child marriage.In the last 10 years, according to the study, the proportion of young women globally who were married as children had declined by 15 percent, from nearly one in four to one in five.That progress "is now under threat," said the study, released on International Women's Day."Covid-19 has made an already difficult situation for millions of girls even worse," said Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore."Shuttered schools, isolation from friends and support networks, and rising poverty have added fuel to a fire the world was already struggling to put out."Girls who marry in childhood, the study said, are more likely to experience domestic violence and less likely to remain in school. They face an increased risk of early and unplanned pregnancy, and maternal complications and mortality.Isolation from family and friends can take "a heavy toll on their mental health."Meantime, pandemic-related travel restrictions and physical distancing have made it harder for girls "to access the health care, social services and community support that protect them from child marriage, unwanted pregnancy and gender-based violence," while making it more likely that they drop out of school.In addition, families facing economic hardship may seek to marry off their daughters to ease financial burdens.The report estimates that 650 million girls and women alive today were married in childhood, about half of them in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India or Nigeria.Fore called for countries to reopen schools, implement legal reforms, ensure access to health and social services while providing measures to protect families.By doing so, she said, "we can significantly reduce a girl's risk of having her childhood stolen through child marriage."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19s-impact-could-mean-millions-more-child-marriages-unicef-101615163679328.html
08-03-2021||World||'Totally constitutional', says China on altering Hong Kong's electoral reforms amid criticism||Despite worldwide condemnation of China for altering Hong Kong's electoral reforms, Beijing has justified its moves as "totally constitutional, lawful and justified".Addressing a press conference on Sunday on the sidelines of the fourth session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that the move to "improve" Hong Kong's electoral system and ensuring "patriots administering Hong Kong" is justified."The reform is needed to implement 'patriots governing Hong Kong', and for advancing 'one country, two systems'...it is entirely constitutional, lawful and justified for the National People's Congress (NPC) to improve Hong Kong's electoral system and ensure "patriots administering Hong Kong," he said.He further said, "If a person does not love the country, how can he or she love Hong Kong? Loving Hong Kong and loving the country are entirely consistent...Hong Kong's transformation from chaos to peace is in the interest of all sides, and will offer stronger safeguards to protect Hong Kong residents' various rights and foreign investor's legal interests."On March 4, the National People's Congress in China announced that it would deliberate on amending the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, according to a statement from the bloc dated Friday. A decision can be expected by March 11.Less than a year after imposing the draconian National Security Law, China has launched a legislative process for drastic electoral system reform in Hong Kong, which could benefit the pro-establishment camp and further smother the political opposition in the city.China has planned a fundamental overhaul of the city's normally contentious politics, the New York Times reported.Zhang Yesui, a senior Communist Party official, announced on Thursday that China's national legislature planned to rewrite election rules in Hong Kong to ensure that the territory was run by patriots, which Beijing defines as people loyal to the national government and the Communist Party.Zhang did not release the details of the proposal. But Lau Siu-kai, a senior adviser to the Chinese leadership on Hong Kong policy, has said the new approach is likely to call for the creation of a government agency to vet every candidate running not only for chief executive but for the legislature and other levels of office, including neighbourhood representatives.NYT also reported that the strategy will further concentrate power in the hands of the Communist Party in Hong Kong and decimate the political hopes of the territory's already beleaguered opposition for years to come.The new reforms come months after China passed the national security law to quash the resistance to its rule in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/totally-constitutional-says-china-on-altering-hong-kong-s-electoral-reforms-amid-criticism-101615162732700.html
08-03-2021||World||China’s bullet train could become strategic concern for New Delhi||Tibet’s first high-speed train service between provincial capital Lhasa and Nyingchi near the border with Arunachal Pradesh will be operational by the end of June, a top official from China railways said on Saturday.The construction of the 435km-long high-speed train corridor, also the first electrified railroad in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) linking the two cities, began in 2014, Lu Dongfu, chairperson of China State Railway Group Company and a deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC), said on the sidelines of the ongoing annual session of China’s rubber-stamp parliament.The new high-speed rail connection is part of China’s ambitious plan of expanding connectivity across TAR, especially along border areas with India. Nyingchi is located less than 50km from the border with Arunachal Pradesh.China claims the entire Indian state as part of south Tibet and has been rapidly developing infrastructure in the remote area of Nyingchi, which, like the rest of TAR, is not accessible to foreign journalists and diplomats.For example, China is building the Sichuan-Tibet railway’s Ya’an-Nyingchi section, which will be 1,011km in length and include 26 stations when completed — this will take Chinese railways right up to the disputed boundary with India.Last November, Chinese President Xi Jinping identified the Ya’an-Nyingchi railway project as a major measure in facilitating the Communist Party of China’s general plan for governing Tibet in the new era, and stressed the project’s important role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.“The project would significantly contribute to the economic and social development of the western region, especially in Sichuan province and TAR,” Xi said in November.The Sichuan-Tibet railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.On Saturday, talking about the first high-speed network, Chinese railway official Lu Dongfu said the track-laying work was completed by the end of 2020.“The railway has a designed speed of 160km per hour, according to its constructor Tibet Railway Construction Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China State Railway Group,” official news agency Xinhua said in a report.“China aims to extend the total length in operation (of high speed trains) to around 50,000km by 2025, up from 37,900km by the end of 2020,” Lu said.The high-speed railway network will cover 98% of cities with over 500,000 residents, he added.China’s self-developed Fuxing trains now operate at a speed range of 160kmph to 350kmph.By the end of last year, 1,036 Fuxing or “electrical multiple units” (EMU) had run a total of 836 million km and carried 827 million passengers since 2007, when the first bullet train became operational.Under a national blueprint, quoted by state media, China will extend the total length of its rail system to 200,000km and its high-speed rail system to 70,000km by 2035.China is also planning to build a “passageway” connecting Tibet to south Asia, according to the draft outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP) unveiled on Friday.A brief report published by the official news agency Xinhua said the central government will support TAR to build the passageway. The 14th FYP is part of China’s long-range objectives it envisages until 2035.China’s Tibet Autonomous Region will be supported to build an important passageway opening to South Asia, according to the draft outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and the long-range objectives through the year 2035, which was unveiled Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-bullet-train-could-become-strategic-concern-for-new-delhi-101615152702066.html
08-03-2021||World||Switzerland referendum: People vote to ban full face coverings in public places||Switzerland on Sunday (local time) narrowly voted in favour of banning full facial coverings including the niqab and burqa in almost all public places. As many as 51.21 per cent of voters voted in support of the controversial proposal in the referendum.According to CNN, the approval by voters means that facial covering will be banned in all publicly accessible places, including on the streets, in public offices, on public transport, in restaurants, shops and in the countryside.The places where the full facial coverings will be allowed include places of worship and other sacred sites. Besides, it will be allowed for health and safety reasons and also in situations where it is "local custom" such as carnivals.There will be no additional exceptions, for example for tourists, according to the proposal by the Swiss federal government.According to CNN, the proposal, put forward by several groups including the right-wing Swiss People's Party, does not mention Islam specifically but has been widely referred to as the "burqa ban" in Swiss media.The proposal has been widely criticised, especially by the Swiss religious organizations, human rights and civic groups and the federal government.According to the Swiss Council of Religions, which represents all major religious communities in Switzerland, has stated the human right to religious freedom also protects religious practices such as dress codes.The Swiss Federal Council, which serves as the country's federal government, and the Swiss Parliament also rejected the initiative as going too far and advised people to vote against it, CNN reported.France was the first country in Europe to ban burqas and niqabs in public places in 2011 and the European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban in 2014.In Switzerland, the referendum has come after years of debates. Twelve years ago another referendum had come that outlawed the construction of minarets in Switzerland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-agree-to-outlaw-facial-coverings-in-burqa-ban-vote-101615139201663.html
