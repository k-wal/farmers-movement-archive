05-03-2021||World||Huge number of young migrants arriving at US border poses challenge for Biden||Thousands of minors without papers are arriving at the US border with Mexico, presenting President Joe Biden with a potentially major crisis in one of America's most politically sensitive regions.Biden took office promising an immigration policy more humane than that of Donald Trump, but some migrant advocacy groups say the new Democratic president's decisions are luring undocumented travelers in what amounts to a beacon effect.In line with a pandemic-rooted policy adopted by Trump, who cracked down on immigration both legal and illegal as part of his "America first" doctrine, the Biden administration is deporting most of the undocumented people who arrive at the southern border. The majority of them come from Central America fleeing violence and poverty.But unlike Trump, Biden has opted against expelling minors who show up unaccompanied and are filling shelters set up to hold them, with limited capacity because of the coronavirus crisis.'Old patterns'Activists say a crisis is in the making.Accepting kids without their parents, they say, can incite families to separate and result in widespread detention of children and young people."A lot of our border policies put parents in the position where their only choice is to send their child up alone through immigration, because it's the way that the child can be the safest," said Allegra Love, an attorney with the Santa Fe Dreamers Project, which provides free legal services to migrants.Most of the minors who arrive unaccompanied, some as young as six, must spend 10 days in quarantine and after two negative Covid-19 tests are sent to holding facilities spread around the country while authorities try to find some relative of theirs in the United States.Critics of this policy say what ends up happening is the minors' stay in such facilities, where serious abuses have been reported in the past, can drag on for months."There's a lot of pressure for these families to self separate," said Joshua Rubin, an activist with Witness at the Border.He said US immigration authorities are "falling into old patterns because you know they feel pressured."The way they're handling it, they are causing somewhat of a crisis," said Rubin.These minors can end up suffering and being traumatized, he said.For the Biden administration, "it's an unenviable position to be in. They're getting criticism from all different political perspectives," said Jennifer Podkul, a lawyer with Kids in Need of Defense, which has worked at the US-Mexico border."It's very hard and they have to start from scratch. Trump totally decimated the US protection system," said Podkul.'Horrible experiences'Minors traveling alone from Central America are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and forced labor because of abusive people they meet along the way, said Belinda Bradford, assistant director of Good Neighbor Settlement House, a shelter that helps families in Brownsville, Texas, across the border from Matamoros, Mexico.The Biden administration recently reopened a temporary shelter in Carrizo Springs, Texas, that can hold some 700 adolescent migrants. And there have been reports it is planning to reopen an even bigger one in Homestead, Florida -- prompting protests at the site."Our hope and expectation is that won't stay open very long, that we will be able to provide for every kid that comes across the border to safely be housed in a facility that is licensed," Biden told the Spanish language broadcaster Univision last week of the Texas facility.The number of undocumented migrants arriving at the border started falling in mid-2019, when Trump approved measures to prevent them from entering the United States to request asylum.But the number has been on the rise again since April. US officials say this is due in part to hopes stirred among migrants by some of Biden's campaign promises, including a plan to create a path to citizenship for the 11 million people living in the US without papers.Activists explain that Trump's tough deportation policies led to a build-up of migrants massed at the US border -- which also partly explains the current surge.In January more than 5,800 unaccompanied minors were stopped by US border agents.The figure does not yet surpass the numbers recorded under Barack Obama or Trump. In May 2019, a record 11,000 entered the US. But this could change."I don't think that (the arrival of migrants) will ever end for the United States, you know. For centuries, the United States has been a land of opportunity, a land for new beginnings," said Bradford, of the Texas shelter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-number-of-young-migrants-arriving-at-us-border-poses-challenge-for-biden-101614965319748.html

Nigeria is also expecting at least 40 million doses from the African Union as well as 100,000 donated doses of India's Covishield vaccine.'The vaccine is safe'Applause greeted the first vaccinations in Kenya on Friday after it received its first million doses this week via Covax."I am feeling great," said Patrick Amoth, director general at the ministry of health, after getting his shot. "The vaccine is safe."Kenya, which is keen to revive its tourism-dependent economy, East Africa's largest, plans to vaccinate 1.25 million people by June and another 9.6 million in the next phase, with more vaccines expected within weeks."This may mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic," said Susan Mochache, a senior official at the health ministry.Neighbouring Uganda took delivery on Friday of its first batch of 864,000 AstraZeneca doses via COVAX and aims to begin inoculations on March 10.As of Thursday, Africa as a whole had reported nearly 4 million infections and 104,000 deaths - still a relatively small toll compared to other continents, with higher national death counts in the United States, India, Brazil, Russia and Britain.South Africa has recorded by far the most Covid-19 infections and deaths on the African continent, with 1.5 million cases and more than 50,000 fatalities to date.On Friday, a senior health official said South Africa was negotiating with an African Union (AU) platform to buy vaccines for at least 10 million of its people.The country was provisionally allocated 12 million doses developed by AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson in an AU vaccine plan, but it was unclear how many vaccines it would seek to buy after it halted plans to use the AstraZeneca shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covax-vaccinations-bring-relief-to-africans-suffering-from-covid19-101614964732450.html

She said Twitter would be testing and iterating possible paid-for features over time.Twitter is working on “Undo Send” timer for tweets pic.twitter.com/nS0kuijPK0Twitter has said it is working on paid subscription models, which would reduce its dependence on ad revenue, including a "super follow" feature to let users charge their followers for access to exclusive content which will launch this year.CEO Jack Dorsey has previously said the site would likely never have an "edit button," a feature users have long sought.But Twitter has been introducing more prompts as users send tweets such as asking them if they want to read an article before sharing it, and experimenting with allowing people to revise a tweet reply before it is published if it uses harmful language.The company reportedly included a possible "undo send" feature in a user survey last year asking which features people would like to have available through a subscription model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-explores-undo-send-feature-for-paying-users-101614964566147.html
05-03-2021||World||Turkey: Sudden weather change likely cause of chopper crash||A sudden, mid-flight change of weather conditions is thought to be the cause a helicopter crash which killed 11 military personnel in eastern Turkey, the Defense Ministry said Friday, citing a preliminary inspection of the crash site.The Cougar army helicopter went down on a snow-covered area close to the village of Cekmece, in the predominantly Kurdish-populated Bitlis province on Thursday. The victims included Lt. Gen. Osman Erbas, an army corps commander.Two military personnel survived the crash with injuries.The Defense Ministry statement said an initial inspection of the wreckage showed no evidence of an explosion or fire. There was also no meteorological warning prior to the flight, it added.“In the light of the initial information, it is considered that the accident occurred due to adverse weather conditions that occurred as a result of a sudden change in weather conditions in the region,” the statement read.The ministry added that a more detailed technical inspection would determine the definitive cause.The location of the crash is in an area where Turkish troops have been combating militants of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which is considered to be a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people since 1984.In 1997, PKK militants attacked a Turkish Cougar helicopter in northern Iraq, killing 11 Turkish soldiers.More recently, 13 military personnel were killed in 2017, when a Cougar helicopter crashed into power lines shortly after take-off from a base near Turkey’s border with Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-sudden-weather-change-likely-cause-of-chopper-crash-101614964199252.html
05-03-2021||World||UN report shows close to 931 million tonnes of food were wasted globally in 2019||An estimated 931 million tonnes of food were wasted globally in 2019, enough to circle the Earth seven times, according to a UN report which said that household food waste in India is about 68.7 million tonnes a year.The Food Waste Index Report 2021, from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and partner organisation WRAP, said that around 931 million tonnes of food waste was generated in 2019, sixty-one per cent of which came from households, 26 per cent from food service and 13 per cent from retail.“This suggests that 17 per cent of total global food production may be wasted,” it said.“The weight roughly equals that of 23 million fully loaded 40-tonne trucks — bumper-to-bumper, enough to circle the Earth seven times,” the UN agency said.In India, the household food waste estimate is 50 kg per capita per year, or 68,760,163 tonnes a year.The household food waste estimate in the US is 59 kg per capita per year, or 19,359,951 tonnes a year, while for China these estimates are 64 kg per capita per year or 91,646,213 tonnes a year.The report looks at food waste that occurs in retail outlets, restaurants and homes – counting both food and inedible parts like bones and shells and presents the most comprehensive food waste data collection, analysis and modelling to date.It finds that in nearly every country that has measured food waste, it was substantial, regardless of income level.It shows that most of this waste comes from households, which discard 11 per cent of the total food available at the consumption stage of the supply chain.Food services and retail outlets waste 5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.On a global per capita-level, 121 kgs of consumer level food is wasted each year, with 74 kgs of this happening in households, the UNEP said in a statement.“If we want to get serious about tackling climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, businesses, governments and citizens around the world have to do their part to reduce food waste,” Executive Director of the UNEP Inger Andersen said.The report said that food waste has substantial environmental, social and economic impacts. At a time when climate action is still lagging, 8-10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food that is not consumed, when losses before consumer level are taken into account.“Reducing food waste would cut greenhouse gas emissions, slow the destruction of nature through land conversion and pollution, enhance the availability of food and thus reduce hunger and save money at a time of global recession,” Andersen said.The report noted that with 690 million people affected by hunger in 2019, an estimate that is expected to rise sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and three billion people unable to afford a healthy diet, consumers need help to reduce food waste at home.It said countries can raise climate ambition by including food waste in Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, while strengthening food security and cutting costs to households.This makes food waste prevention also a primary area for inclusion in COVID-19 recovery strategies.“For a long time, it was assumed that food waste in the home was a significant problem only in developed countries,” said Marcus Gover, CEO of WRAP.“With the publication of the Food Waste Index report, we see that things are not so clear cut. With only nine years to go, we will not achieve SDG 12 Target 3 if we do not significantly increase investment in tackling food waste in the home globally. This must be a priority for governments, international organisations, businesses and philanthropic foundations,” Gover said.Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3 aims at halving per-capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reducing food losses along production and supply chains. One of the two indicators for the target is the Food Waste Index.Andersen said that there is growing evidence of success in reducing food waste – though not at the scale needed to achieve the target.“Much more can be done. We need, for example, to address the role of consumer behaviour, in all cultural contexts, in achieving the target. Let us all shop carefully, cook creatively and make wasting food anywhere socially unacceptable while we strive to provide healthy, sustainable diets to all,” Andersen added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-report-shows-close-to-931-million-tonnes-of-food-were-wasted-globally-in-2019-101614963348818.html

Health authorities are trying to stop the spread of the variant, known as P1, because of concerns that it may respond less well to current vaccines.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that the emergence of a vaccine-resistant variant could derail the planned timings for reopening parts of the economy that have been under lockdown for over two months. Non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality are due to open again in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-uk-person-with-covid-variant-found-after-5-day-hunt-101614964043761.html

05-03-2021||World||After senate poll defeat, ISI, Pak army chiefs meet Imran Khan||The chiefs of Pakistan Army and powerful spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) met Prime Minister Imran Khan to review national issues, a day after his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party suffered a humiliating defeat in a closely-contested Senate election, according to a media report.Army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa on Thursday met Prime Minister Khan as part of the interactions between the civilian and military leadership on national issues. ISI Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed was also present during the meeting, the Dawn newspaper reported.An official source said the meeting was held to review the “internal and external situation”. However, no statement was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which usually issues press releases on such meetings, the report noted.According to the report, people were quick to link the meeting to the latest political developments in the country following the Senate elections.Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) candidate and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani defeated ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on Wednesday, in a major blow to Khan, who had personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.The defeat of the finance minister in the elections to the upper house prompted calls for resignation of Khan by the Opposition leaders.Khan hit back by announcing to seek a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on Saturday. Shaikh was defeated by a margin of 5 votes.Criticising the meeting between Khan, the Army chief and the ISI chief, Maryam Nawaz, Vice President of the main Oppostion party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz said the military leadership "should not have been seen" with Prime Minister Khan after the developments in the Senate polls.She said that the Prime Minister had called and met the heads of institutions in the lawns of PM House "on the day he suffered a humiliating defeat (and) his members expressed a lack of confidence in him and voted against him"."Is he not dragging the institutions into politics?" she was quoted as saying in the report.She said that the meeting at this juncture does not send out good visuals.“Institutions” should end backing of Prime Minister Khan, if they have not done so far and should restrict themselves to the constitutional and lawful role, she said.Addressing the military leadership, she said, "you should not have been seen sitting with Imran Khan at any cost a day after he suffered a battering (and) faced the people's and public representatives' wrath, when he (Imran) was busy in machinations and rigging."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-senate-poll-defeat-isi-pak-army-chiefs-meet-imran-khan-101614963620616.html
05-03-2021||World||PDM to boycott Pak PM Imran Khan's vote of confidence on Saturday||In a relief for Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the eve of a vote of confidence on his government, the Opposition alliance on Friday announced that they will boycott the floor test, claiming that their candidate's victory in the Senate election was itself a "no-confidence motion" against the premier.Pakistan Democratic Movement chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said no Opposition member will attend the National Assembly session scheduled for Saturday, in which Prime Minister Khan will seek a vote of confidence.The announcement from the chief of the PDM, a 10-party Opposition alliance, comes after Khan delivered an address to the nation, explaining why he was seeking a vote of confidence in the wake of the Senate elections in which the opposition managed to stage an upset.PDM candidate and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani defeated ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on Wednesday, in a major blow to Khan, who had personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.Rehman said Gilani's "victory was itself a no-confidence motion against Khan".He claimed that President Arif Alvi in his notification to summon Saturday's session had essentially stated that Prime Minister Khan had "lost the trust of the majority" and he, therefore, needed to seek a vote of confidence."So when the president talks about losing trust to call the session of the National Assembly, then this further strengthens the stance of the Opposition," he was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.Prime Minister Khan has convened a meeting of his allies on Friday to firm up his strategy, a day ahead of seeking a vote of confidence from the National Assembly following a key defeat in this week's closely-contested Senate elections.Khan needs the support of 171 lawmakers in the National Assembly, currently having 341 members out of total 342, as one seat is vacant.Khan's PTI has 157 lawmakers. The Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has 83 member and the Pakistan Peoples Party has 55 lawmakers. PTI leaders have said they are confident that Khan will overcome the floor test.Minister for Science Fawad Chaudhry said that Khan will easily win the confidence vote as PTI's woman candidate for Senate, Fouzia Arshad, got 174 votes on Wednesday and won in the house where Shaikh got 164 votes and was defeated."The requisite support is available and Khan will easily win,” he said.Meanwhile, Pakistan's election commission on Friday expressed shock and disappointment over Prime Minister Khan's allegations against it, asserting that the Senate elections were held as per the Constitution and it has "never come under any sort of pressure and God willing, will not in future as well."The strong comments were made by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in a statement following a crucial meeting of its members to review Prime Minister Khan's statements against it on Thursday in an address to the nation.The meeting was summoned by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja.Prime Minister Khan lashed out at the election commission which he said failed to stop corruption in Wednesday's closely-contested Senate elections."You (ECP) discredited democracy…you damaged the morality of the nation by doing nothing to stop vote-buying," he alleged. In its response, the ECP said, "this is the beauty of democracy and independent elections and the secret ballot which the entire nation witnessed, which was according to the Constitution."Rejecting Khan's allegations, the commission said it has "never come under any sort of pressure and God willing, will not in future as well"."We cannot ignore the law and the Constitution to please anyone," said the ECP in its statement.Urging its critics to bring forward evidence of the ECP's wrongdoing, it asked them to not indulge in mud slinging on national institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pdm-to-boycott-pak-pm-imran-khan-s-vote-of-confidence-on-saturday-101614961996917.html
05-03-2021||World||As UK awaits Harry, Meghan's take on royal split, author says ‘no winners in it’||The timing couldn’t be worse for Harry and Meghan.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will finally get the chance to tell the story behind their departure from royal duties directly to the public on Sunday, when their two-hour interview with Oprah Winfrey is broadcast.But back home in Britain, events have conspired to overshadow the tale of a prince and his American bride. On top of the pandemic and record economic slump, Prince Philip, Harry’s 99-year-old grandfather, has been hospitalized for almost three weeks and is now recovering from a heart procedure.“Harry and Meghan are hugely popular,’’ Pauline Maclaran, a professor of marketing and author of “Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture,” told The Associated Press. “But I think that some people who might otherwise have supported them will find this just a little bit distasteful, that they’re drawing all this attention to themselves … just at this time when Prince Philip appears to be quite seriously ill.”Though it is the choice of CBS when to air its pre-recorded interview, critics are already lining up to deride it as a brand-building exercise by the pair, who left Britain saying they wanted to live a normal life but have been accused of continuing to use their royal status to open doors and make money.The sit-down with America’s queen of celebrity interviews is a chance for the couple to explain what led them to quit royal life, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. A book about their departure, “Finding Freedom,” also alleges that senior royals had little respect for Meghan, a biracial former actor, and that courtiers treated her badly.Pre-released clips have already shown Harry talking about his fears that history would repeat itself after his mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash while pursued by paparazzi. In another clip from the interview, Winfrey asks Meghan how she feels about the palace “hearing you speak your truth today?”“I don’t know how they could expect that, after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there was an active role that the firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us,” the duchess replies.“The firm” is a nickname for the royal family, sometimes used with affection and sometimes with a note of criticism.Ahead of the broadcast, relations with the palace are increasingly strained. First there was Queen Elizabeth II’s decision to strip Harry and Meghan of the handful of royal patronages they had retained in the one-year trial period following their departure last year. The couple responded with a terse statement promising to live a life of service — a move many in the U.K. saw as disrespectful to the queen, as she usually has the final word. Then on Wednesday, the palace said it was launching a human resources investigation after a newspaper reported that a former aide had accused Meghan of bullying staff in 2018.One of the authors of “Finding Freedom,’’ Omid Scobie, compared the recent commentary about Harry and Meghan in the British media to the Salem Witch Trials, while noting Americans have had more sympathy for them. His tweet linked to a discussion on the U.S. television program “The View,’’ including comments from Meghan McCain, a conservative columnist and daughter of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain.“I think we can’t ignore the elephant of the room that there’s probably a racial angle to this,’’ McCain said. “There’s a lot of racism directed at this woman, in a lot of different ways she threatens a lot of people in the patriarchy. ... It just looks like they are bullying her in the press.’’It was all supposed to be so different.At the time Harry started dating Meghan, the British public seemed smitten with the beautiful young woman who starred for seven seasons on the U.S. television drama “Suits.” When they married in 2018, newspapers were filled with optimistic stories about how the energetic couple would help make the monarchy relevant for a new, multicultural Britain.But less than two years later they decamped to North America. After a brief stay in Canada, the couple settled in Meghan’s home state of California, buying a house in the exclusive Santa Barbara County enclave of Montecito that reportedly cost more than $14 million. Among their neighbors: Oprah Winfrey.Then came deals with Netflix and Spotifiy, reportedly worth millions. The commercial deals and headline-grabbing amounts are uncomfortable for the royal family, which has devoted itself to public service as a justification for its wealth and privilege. The queen, among the richest people in Britain, has spent her life supporting charities, cutting ribbons at hospitals and traveling the world to represent her country.“The main thing that the royal family is so good at is serving the nation, serving the nation and the Commonwealth, basically serving us rather than serving themselves,’’ royal historian Hugo Vickers told ITV News. “And I’m sorry, if you’re sitting in an $11 million mansion in California and making fantastic deals, that is trading in on your royal heritage. And it’s all wrong, frankly.”Others are concerned that the interview will include damaging revelations about the royal family.The royals rarely grant interviews, and when they do the questions are usually narrowly focused on specific issues. For instance, Harry and his brother, William, have tried to remove the stigma from mental health problems by talking about their own struggles after the death of their mother.More free-ranging interviews have often gone badly. Interviews with Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry and William’s parents, around the time of their divorce led to embarrassing revelations about infidelity.More damaging for the palace was the interview Prince Andrew, Harry’s uncle, did with the BBC in 2019. Andrew tried to address rumors about his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but he was forced to give up royal duties after failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims.“I think it’s a bigger danger than the Prince Andrew car-crash interview,’’ Maclaran said of the Oprah interview, “because I think that Meghan is going to get a lot of sympathy, particularly from American audiences, about her position being untenable.”Regardless of what’s actually said, the interview is a threat to the stature of the monarchy because it further blurs the line between celebrity and royalty — tarnishing the royal mystique, Maclaran said.Late night chat show host James Corden underscored the threat to the royal brand during a tongue-in-cheek segment with Harry broadcast last week in which Corden suggested the prince and his wife might move into the mansion that provided the backdrop for the 1990s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”“If it was good enough for the Fresh Prince, it’s good enough for a real prince,” Corden said.The line put Harry, whose father and brother will be king one day, on the same footing as a TV character who fled west Philadelphia for a posh life in Southern California.Royal watchers wonder what could possibly be next.“It’s just such a mess,” said Penny Junor, who has written several books about the royals, including a biography of Harry. “I don’t think there are going to be any winners in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-uk-awaits-harry-meghan-s-take-on-royal-split-author-says-no-winners-in-it-101614962393480.html

It did not elaborate on what those comments were.Konkord said in December that Prigozhin had filed lawsuits against Navalny and his allies worth a total of 77 million roubles, the Interfax news agency reported.The Kremlin's critics have cast those lawsuits as well as the jailing of Navalny and prosecution of some of his allies as part of a coordinated campaign to cripple their activities. Russian authorities deny those charges.Navalny surfaced in a jail in Russia's Vladimir region to the east of Moscow, his allies said this week.Prigozhin has been accused by the United States of election meddling and has been sanctioned by the US and European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-orders-navalny-to-pay-damages-in-lawsuit-filed-by-kremlin-ally-101614961774372.html
05-03-2021||World||Donald Trump State Department aide charged with assault at US Capitol||A former State Department aide in President Donald Trump's administration has been charged with participating in the deadly siege at the Capitol and assaulting officers who were trying to guard the building, court papers show.It’s the first known case to be brought against a Trump appointee in the Jan. 6 insurrection, which led to Trump's historic second impeachment.Federico Klein, who also worked for Trump's 2016 campaign, was seen wearing a “Make America Great Again" hat amid the throng of people in a tunnel trying to force their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6, the papers say. Klein pushed his way toward the doors, where, authorities say, “he physically and verbally engaged" with officers trying to keep the mob back.Klein was seen on camera violently shoving a riot shield into an officer and inciting the crowd as it tried to storm past the police line, shouting, “We need fresh people, we need fresh people,” according to the charging documents.As the mob struggled with police in the tunnel, Klein pushed the riot shield, which had been stolen from an officer, in between the Capitol doors, preventing police from closing them, authorities say. Eventually, an officer used chemical spray, forcing Klein to move somewhere else, officials say.Klein was arrested Thursday in Virginia and faces charges including obstructing Congress and assaulting officers using a dangerous weapon.He was in custody on Friday and couldn’t be reached for comment. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney who could comment on his behalf. A Trump spokesman said he had no comment.At least five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died as a result of the violence, and two other officers killed themselves after. More than 300 people have been charged with federal crimes.Klein became a staff assistant in the State Department shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, according to a financial disclosure report. He held a top secret security clearance that was renewed in 2019, according to the court papers. He resigned from his position on Jan. 19, the day before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, authorities said.One of Klein's State Department coworkers helped authorities identify him, officials said.A Department of State diplomatic security special agent interviewed by an FBI agent said that Klein worked in the Office of Brazilian and Southern Cone Affairs, according to the court papers. The Department of State official identified Klein in photos and video shown by the FBI, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-state-department-aide-charged-with-assault-at-us-capitol-101614961480260.html
05-03-2021||World||Judge tells UK paper to print front-page notice on Meghan Markle legal win||The Mail On Sunday, part of a UK newspaper group that lost a high-profile privacy case brought by Meghan Markle, must print a front-page statement acknowledging her legal victory, a judge ruled on Friday.High Court judge Mark Warby also ordered Associated Newspapers, which owns the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline website, to publish a notice on page three of the paper stating that it had "infringed her copyright".Warby in February upheld Meghan's claim that Associated Newspapers had breached her privacy and copyright by publishing parts of a 2018 letter she sent to her father Thomas Markle.The letter to her estranged father was written a few months after she married Queen Elizabeth II's grandson, Prince Harry, and asked him to stop talking to tabloids and making false claims about her in interviews.Warby has already ordered Associated Newspapers to make an "interim payment" of £450,000 ($627,000) to cover legal costs for the Duchess of Sussex, as Meghan is formally known.On Friday he also formally refused its appeal bid, saying the newspaper group had "no real prospect" of success.In his written ruling, the judge said the front- and third-page statements about Meghan's successful copyright claim would have "genuine utility".He noted the Associated Newspapers titles involved had "devoted a very considerable amount of space to the infringing articles, which it continued to publish for over two years"."The wording sought is modest by comparison, and factual in nature," Warby added of the notices he was ordering.Meghan, 39, and 36-year-old Harry, who now live in the United States after stepping down from frontline royal duties last year, have taken legal action against a number of publications, alleging invasion of privacy.The couple have been in the headlines all week after becoming embroiled in a transatlantic war of words with Buckingham Palace ahead of their blockbuster interview with Oprah Winfrey, set to air Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-tells-uk-paper-to-print-front-page-notice-on-meghan-markle-legal-win-101614960880330.html
05-03-2021||World||Gender inequality has cost world USD 70 trillion since 1990, finds report||With many reports confirming women and other socially-disadvantaged sections have suffered the most during the pandemic, economists at BofA Securities have tabulated the cost of lack of gender diversity and inclusion, saying it will take 257 years to close the gap at the current rate, and not doing this has cost the world a whopping USD 70 trillion since 1990.The report also notes that full gender equality globally can increase the world GDP by up to USD 28 trillion by 2025 and the loss of human capital wealth due to gender inequality alone is estimated at USD 160.2 trillion.“Not closing the gender inequality gap and a lack of diversity and inclusion has an economic price tag. Not doing the right thing on this count has cost us USD 70 trillion since 1990…It will take us 257 years to close the gender economic gap at today's rate,” says the report, adding the pandemic alone, when women suffered the most, has cost women USD 1 trillion in income.Noting that gender and racial biases lead to persistent labour market disparities and limit the economy, it says closing the gender and race gaps in education and employment would have generated USD 2.6 trillion more in economic output in 2019 and the cumulative gains from 1990 would have been USD 70 trillion at the 2019 dollar rate.Closing racial earnings gap resulting from disparities in health, education, incarceration and employment opportunities would boost trend growth by 0.5 per cent per year through 2050, says the report.Reeling out numbers, the report says in 2020, there were no Black senior executives in any of the FTSE 100 companies. For the first time in six years in 2020 there were no black chairs, chief executives or finance chiefs in the FTSE 100 companies and just one company in the S&P 500 is run by a Black female CEO today, and only eight companies have at least 50 per cent female management teams.As much as 75 per cent of Nasdaq companies do not have at least one woman and one under-represented minority or LGBT member on the board, it says, adding continued racial inequality could cost the US economy USD1-1.5 trillion in lost consumption and investment over the next decade. The LGBTQ community is equivalent to the fourth largest economy in the world at USD 3.9 trillion.All in all, S&P 500 companies with above-median gender diversity on their boards see 15 per cent higher return on equity, and for companies with ethnic and racially diversified workforce this is 8 per cent higher. And the pandemic has only deepened the gender inequality crisis.As much as 96 million people will slide into extreme poverty in 2021, of which 47 million are women. Women's jobs were 19 per cent more at risk and women took up an even greater share of childcare and unpaid labour during the pandemic.Even before the pandemic, the gender gap was worsening and at the current rate of inclusion, it will take 257 years to reach economic equality, warns the report.As much as 90 per cent of children with disabilities in emerging markets countries do not attend school, says the report.Stating that gender diversity and inclusion are leading the way to tackling the social issues of our times, the report says from the MeToo movement to BlackLivesMatter, the awareness of injustices faced by under-represented and marginalised groups is at an all-time high, and especially during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gender-inequality-has-cost-world-usd-70-trillion-since-1990-finds-report-101614959591976.html
05-03-2021||World||Scientists add new coronavirus variant to UK watchlist after 16 cases. What do we know so far||Scientists have identified 16 cases of another new coronavirus variant in the UK as mutations of Sars-CoV-2 continue to pose a greater threat to containment measures for the infection. Public Health England (PHE) has designated the new strain of lineage B.1.1.318 as a variant under investigation (VUI).The health agency of the UK government on Thursday announced that cases of this new variant were first identified on February 15 through “genomic horizon scanning”. It further stated that all individuals who tested positive and their contacts have been traced and advised to isolate.Coronavirus variants are raised for formal investigation if they are considered to have concerning epidemiological, immunological or pathogenic properties. The new variant, which is understood to have originated in the UK, has been designated as VUI with a year, month, and number.The variant VUI-202102/04 contains the E484K mutation, which has also been found in two existing VUIs detected in the country. However, this new variant does not feature the N501Y mutation which is present in all variants of concern (VOCs). It may be designated as VOC after a risk assessment with the relevant expert committee. Currently, Britain is tracking a total of 4 VUIs and 4 VOCs.The coronavirus variant B.1.1.7 is currently the dominant variant in the UK and was suspected behind the renewed surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the country. According to PHE, at least 108,337 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant has been detected in the country so far. Some experts have predicted that B.1.1.7 is likely to drive a new wave of transmission in spring.The scientists have also identified six cases of a new P.1 variant, first detected in Brazil, in the UK. A new modelling study has suggested that the VOC may be up to 2.2 times more transmissible and cause re-infection in people already recovered from Covid-19.Researchers at the University of São Paulo, in collaboration with Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, used statistical analysis of genome sequencing data to arrive at a conclusion that a second wave of infection in Brazil’s Manaus, a city thought to have a high level of existing immunity from the first wave, was associated with the emergence of the new P.1 variant. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and is available as a preprint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-add-another-new-coronavirus-variant-to-uk-watchlist-after-16-cases-101614958848355.html
05-03-2021||World||ByteDance developing Clubhouse-like app for China amid copycat rush: Report||TikTok owner ByteDance is working on a Clubhouse-like app for China, sources familiar with the matter said, as the global success of the US-based audio chat service inspires a rush of copycats in the country.At least a dozen similar apps have been launched in the past month, with momentum picking up after Clubhouse was blocked in China in early February. Clubhouse had seen a surge in users who participated in discussions on sensitive topics such as Xinjiang detention camps and Hong Kong independence.New offerings include Xiaomi Corp's reworking of its Mi Talk app into an invitation-only audio service targeted at professionals last week. More are currently under development, industry executives say.ByteDance's plans are still in the early stages, said two sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.Discussions about TikTok and ByteDance on Clubhouse had prompted interest in the genre from ByteDance executives including CEO Zhang Yiming, said one of the sources.ByteDance declined to comment.The success of Clubhouse, which can host up to 8,000 people per chat room and has seen a discussion between Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev boost user numbers, has rammed home the potential of audio chat services.But similar apps in China are expected to take on Chinese characteristics that will accommodate censorship and government oversight.One such example is Nasdaq-listed Lizhi Inc's Zhiya app which was launched in 2018 and whose users usually talk about video games or sing songs.The app requires real name registration, a trait Lizhi CEO Marco Lai says is key in China. Audio livestreaming companies in China employ staff to listen to conversations in every room and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to weed out "inappropriate" content, such as pornography or politically sensitive issues, he said.A Lizhi spokeswoman said Zhiya uses humans as well as AI tools to regulate public conversations on the platform.The app was briefly taken down by Chinese regulators in 2019, but reinstated after Lizhi made rectifications.Lizhi's Lai said that outside of politics there was plenty of room for audio chat apps in China."Adults in China do not like to express their views in public, we have been taught to keep a low profile since we were young," he said. "A good approach in China, though, is entertainment, you invite everybody to have fun."Some new entrants to the market have had hiccups.Inke Ltd, best known for its livestreaming platform, launched a similar app, Duihuaba, this month that recruited venture capitalists, fashion critics and other celebrities to host conversations.However, it abruptly pulled the app two weeks after its debut, saying that it needed further improvements without elaborating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bytedance-developing-clubhouse-like-app-for-china-amid-copycat-rush-report-101614959946098.html
05-03-2021||World||China to build important 'passageway' to South Asia through Tibet: Report||China has included building of an important “passageway” connecting Tibet with South Asia in the 14th Five Year plan which is due to commence from this year, the official media reported on Friday.China will support Tibet in building the passageway to South Asia, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the 14th Plan document which was submitted to the National People’s Congress, (NPC), China’s Parliament.The annual session of the NPC began here on Friday.“China's Tibet Autonomous Region will be supported to build an important passageway opening to South Asia,” state-run Xinhua news agency reported briefly.The draft outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and the long-range objectives through the year 2035, which were cleared by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) have been submitted to the NPC for formal approval.Though the Xinhua report has not mentioned, China has been planning for a long time to build the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network through Tibet and Nepal.It was regarded as a part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation between China and Nepal.Nepal under the present government of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has moved closer to China, firming up especially the trans-Himalayan connectivity network.In 2019, China and Nepal signed a protocol to operationalise their 2016 Transit Transport Treaty which provided access for the landlocked Himalayan country to use Chinese ports for its foreign trade, reducing the dependence on Indian ports.Besides the road network, the two countries are considering the extension of the rail network from Tibet to Nepal.Last year, state-run China Daily here reported that preparatory work is underway for a cross-border railway connecting Tibet and Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.Meanwhile, work will start on the China-Nepal Friendship Industrial Park in Jhapa, eastern Nepal, early next year. The park is the first of its kind launched with Chinese investment.These two projects form part of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-build-important-passageway-to-south-asia-through-tibet-report-101614957484929.html
05-03-2021||World||Donald Trump sued by House impeachment manager over incitement of Capitol riot||A Congressman who helped lead the second impeachment of Donald Trump filed a lawsuit alleging the former president incited a mob that took over the US Capitol and disrupted the certification of the 2020 election.Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, filed the suit in federal court Friday. It’s the latest sign of legal peril for Trump over his role in the January 6 riot, even after he won acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial last month. Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, filed a similar suit Feb. 16 claiming the riot was the culmination of a months-long campaign by the former president to discredit the election results.Swalwell, who was one of the House impeachment managers, alleges Trump conspired with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama to incite the riot and violate the civil rights of the members of Congress who gathered to certify the election results. Giuliani and Brooks, both Republicans, appeared alongside Trump at the rally that preceded the Capitol assault.“Trump lied to his followers, telling them that the certification of Joe Biden’s election was a ‘coup’ and that their country was being stolen from them,” Swalwell said in the lawsuit. “Many participants in the attack have since revealed that they were acting on what they believed to be former President Trump’s orders in service of their country.”The suit seeks unspecified damages and raises the prospect of a lengthy discovery process that could uncover new evidence of Trump’s role in the riot, including private communications between him and Giuliani.Legal experts expect a wave of private lawsuits in the coming weeks targeting Trump and others over the violence that erupted at the Capitol. But any suit against Trump will have to overcome a legal hurdle: The president is likely to claim that his speech on January 6 fell within his presidential duties, shielding him from litigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-sued-by-house-impeachment-manager-over-incitement-of-capitol-riot-101614957385666.html
05-03-2021||World||Japan extends Covid-19 emergency in Tokyo, PM Suga apologises||Japan extended a state of emergency in the Tokyo area by two weeks on Friday to try to combat Covid-19, prompting a "heartfelt apology" by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The state of emergency had been set to end on March 7. But 4-1/2 months before Tokyo is due to host the Olympic Games, Suga said there was a need for caution because of the threat from new coronavirus variants and the possibility of cases rising again."I am deeply sorry at not being able to lift the state of emergency by the previously-promised March 7. I offer my heartfelt apology," Suga told a news conference.Under the state of emergency in Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures, the government has requested restaurants and bars close by 8 p.m. and stop serving alcohol an hour earlier.People are also asked to stay home after 8 p.m. unless they have essential reasons to go out.Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama prefectures, which make up 30% of Japan's population, sought the extension because the number of new coronavirus cases had not fallen enough.Suga said conditions had improved but there were still problems such as pressure on the medical system in the Tokyo area and cases could still rebound. Variant strains of the virus have been found in 19 of Japan's 47 prefectures, he said."In order to protect your lives and livelihood, and to take back a secure and lively life, I ask for your cooperation from the bottom of my heart," Suga said.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told a videoconference of governors of the affected area that the extension was essential."We can't have things rebound now, this is a really important time, and I think we all understand this," she said. "We'll keep in close contact with each other and beat the virus."BUSINESSES WORRIEDSuga said he would offer as much support for businesses as possible, but restaurants and related businesses fear continued suffering.Akira Koganezawa, vice president of the association for 55 restaurants that serve monjayaki, a pan-fried batter dish popular in the Tokyo area, said it was "a matter of life or death for us.""Without enough subsidies, some restaurants would go out of business," he said.Foreign athletes have been barred from entering Japan to train before the Olympics during the state of emergency. It was not immediately clear if the ban will remain in place during the extension for the Tokyo region while the order has already been lifted for the rest of the country.The curbs are narrower in scope than those imposed under an emergency last year, when schools and non-essential businesses were mostly shuttered.New case numbers are still a fraction of their peak in early January, when the state of emergency took effect. Tokyo reported 301 cases on Friday, compared with a record high 2,520 on Jan. 7Nationwide, Japan has recorded about 438,000 cases and 8,185 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-extends-covid-19-emergency-in-tokyo-pm-suga-apologises-101614955959849.html
05-03-2021||World||Crocodile hunt: Search on for unknown number of escaped reptiles in South Africa||Police and conservation officers were searching Friday for an unknown number of young crocodiles that escaped earlier in the week from a large breeding farm in South Africa.The crocodiles are suspected to have entered the nearby Breede River after escaping Wednesday morning near the town of Bonnievale in Western Cape province, about 180 kilometers (111 miles) east of Cape Town.So far, 27 of the reptiles have been recaptured and another seven had to be euthanized, Cape Nature conservation spokeswoman Petro van Rhyn said. Another six were spotted but evaded capture.The commercial breeding farm contains about 5,000 crocodiles, van Rhyn said, and a big part of the problem is that recovery teams aren’t certain how many escaped. They are waiting for the owner of the farm to give them an accurate count.“Is it 100, or is it 1,000?” van Rhyn said. “We don't know.”The crocodiles are thought to be between 1.2 and 1.5 meters long, according to Cape Nature.Conservation officers have been using cages with food bait inside to try and capture the crocodiles, but that hasn't proved to be very successful because the river is full of fish, van Rhyn said.Police and Cape Nature officers are concentrating on an area as far as five kilometers (three miles) upstream and five kilometers downstream of the escape point but don't believe the crocodiles will have moved very far.Van Rhyn said residents of the area should be watchful but shouldn't panic. Crocodiles are nocturnal and generally shy, she said, it's highly unlikely to see one on the streets of Bonnievale.She said it was not a good idea to go swimming in the river there, though.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crocodile-hunt-search-on-for-unknown-number-of-escaped-reptiles-in-south-africa-101614953952591.html
05-03-2021||World||World's worst Covid crisis is unfolding in Brazil, where no fix seems to work||More than a year after a spiked virus launched a murderous campaign across the globe, most countries have put the worst behind them, aided by aggressive government policies and vaccines.Not Brazil.The continent-sized nation of 212 million is facing more Covid deaths and cases than ever, its hospitals overflowing, its policy in disarray, its vaccine supply severely limited. In addition to a president who scoffs at the disease, rejects masks and leaves each state on its own, the country plays host to a variant that’s more contagious and possibly deadlier.Nothing better illustrates the bizarrely fractured nature of Brazil’s Covid policies — and how they’ve sowed confusion and anger and suffering — than three cities along a 140-mile roadway in the state of Sao Paulo, where three distinct approaches to the pandemic coexist. In one, practically anything goes; in another, it’s full lockdown; and in a third, mass vaccination is underway. Each is a mess, overrun by rampant illness and mired in a deep economic funk that shows no signs of ending anytime soon.“What we’re living through now is much worse than what we had before,” said Denise Garrett, an infectious disease expert and vice president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington. “I see a huge storm forming in Brazil.”Sao Paulo, the country’s financial hub and center of wealth, is where the virus first made landfall one year ago in Brazil, transported unwittingly by returning skiers and holiday-makers from Spain, Italy and the US From them, it spread to household help and employees.Araraquara sits almost in the middle of the state, a four-hour drive from the capital, and has long basked in its access to wealth. Its 240,000 residents make three times the nation’s minimum wage.These days, work is scarce. In fact, everything is scarce. Araraquara has been hermetically sealed — even supermarkets and gas stations are shut — for the past week or two to push back against a viral attack like no other.In the first two months of 2021, more people have died of the virus in the city than in all of 2020. Most Covid tests are coming back not only positive but positive for the highly contagious Brazil variant that emerged in the Amazonian city of Manaus. The strain, which preliminary studies suggest is at least twice as transmissible, showed up in more than 80% of samples collected at a clinic in the city from mid-January to mid-February.So Mayor Edinho Silva has imposed a lockdown of unprecedented severity.“I opted for a lockdown like what they had in China,” he said. While effects will take time to show up in the numbers, it was the only way to keep the situation from getting even worse. “If we don’t close, we’ll have people dying without having the right to fight for their lives.”Eighty miles away, the city of Bauru, with 380,000 residents, is facing a similarly devastating rate of infection. Its ICU beds are, like those of its neighbors, 100% occupied. The patients, once elderly, are now in their 20s and 30s and arriving even sicker than previously.And yet, Bauru is not shutting down. Not by a long shot. Mayor Suellen Rosim has been following the lead of President Jair Bolsonaro, even joining street protests against the state’s governor for ordering lockdowns.“People are taking risks, but not because they’re irresponsible,” said the city’s health secretary, Orlando Dias. “They just can’t take it anymore.” He denies the pandemic is at its worst moment, and says a municipality that has 70% of its gross domestic product tied to commerce can’t just halt activities because the governor ordered it to.So Fernando Christian’s small clothing shop in the city is not only open, clients are trying on clothes. City Hall knows about it, he says. What he and other vendors fear is state inspection. When state representatives come, stores rush to close.Eighty miles in the other direction from Araraquara, Serrana has risen to virus fame in a very different way. The small town of 46,000, where the virus has been twice as deadly as in its neighbors, was chosen for a study researchers say is the first of its kind in the world: mass vaccination.Henrique and Viviane Ferreira were happily standing in line to become part of the very small group of 30- and 40-year-olds in Brazil to get the vaccine. Elsewhere in the country, shots are available only to health-care professionals and those 75 or older, plus priority groups including the indigenous population. The plan in Serrana is to vaccinate 30,000 people, essentially everyone in the city over 18.The plan, which was kept secret for months, caused a stir when it was announced in February. More than 90% of the residents signed up. Outsiders tried to buy or rent properties, but a census avoided what mayor Léo Capitelli called “an opportunistic mass migration.”The results of the experiment, which are expected in May, could give a glimpse into what life for Brazilians may be like once vaccinations gain scale. Health experts like Isabella Ballalai, the vice president of the Brazilian society of immunization, had hoped that would come sooner. Brazil’s centralized vaccination program, she says, used to set the country apart even from rich nations, ensuring fast and equal access.“We could be vaccinating so much more,” she said. “It’s really sad to see the situation where we’ve arrived at.”The three cities exemplify the wildly diverse experience that has been Covid in Brazil. Restrictions have varied from city to city and are often eased, only to be reimposed weeks later — a mishmash of policies that have little to no enforcement, lowering their efficacy and prolonging the situation. Politicians setting the rules have been caught evading their own orders and often publicly bicker over who’s to blame for the crisis.The glimmer of hope offered by vaccination remains elusive. The country has only a few doses at hand, not enough to cover even the priority groups. Jonas Donizette, a former mayor who heads a grouping of 400 municipal chiefs, blames the federal government for not acquiring vaccines. Cities, he says, are going off on their own to try and buy them, something that has never happened before.And then there’s the economy. The government’s cash handouts, which helped tie over 66 million Brazilians last year and even reduced poverty levels, ran out in December. While lawmakers debated a new round of aid, which was approved just this week, data from retail sales have tumbled, showing the effect of phasing out the so-called coronavouchers.Christian, the clothing shop owner in Bauru, is among the millions who lost jobs during the pandemic’s first wave. After being fired from a sports apparel shop, he opened a food truck with his father-in-law, only to have to sell off the van, along with everything else, as the crisis worsened.Today he earns about half of what he did before the virus hit. Even with his wife bringing in money from baking cakes and selling used clothes, it’s not unusual for their refrigerator to be empty, especially now that government aid has run out. It’s a day-to-day worry: “If there’s a lockdown, I’ll earn nothing,” he says.The Ferreiras, in Serrana, have seen business slow down, too — especially in their part-time work as wedding photographers. The mass vaccination has yet to materialize into a rebound, though the knowledge that they and their families are safer eases part of the blow.The sense of policy drift and rising deaths — Brazil has lost more than 260,000 to the virus, second only to the US — is producing political anxiety.This week, state governors criticized the federal government for spreading false information and “prioritizing conflict, creating images of good-versus-evil and undermining cooperation.” States from Sao Paulo to Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul have tightened restrictions in the past few days to try to halt contagion.State health secretaries issued a statement calling on the government to recognize the seriousness of the pandemic, which is causing the collapse of several public and private health-care systems. It lamented the lack of a national, coherent policy and asked for more stringent rules for non-essential businesses, including forbidding sports and religious activities and all in-person classes and closing bars and beaches. It also called for authorities to consider shutting airports and suspending interstate travel, as well as imposing a national curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. during the week and all day on weekends.While some at the health ministry are open to discussing nationwide measures with governors, the concern is that Bolsonaro himself will bar any such initiative, a person familiar with the matter said.'We're going to continue to see a high number of infections and deaths for at least three months, because there's nothing to stop it from happening,' said Antonio Carlos Bandeira, a director at Brazil's infectious disease society. 'It's not lockdowns being done in one place or the other that will avoid it. You would have had to have coordinated this long ago.'This week, as Brazil reported back-to-back record deaths from the virus, Bolsonaro welcomed allies for a lunch in Brasilia. The largely maskless group feasted on typical dishes, including beans with sausage and collard greens, plus a whole roast pig. The following day, the president raged against governors for creating panic in the population.'You didn't stay home, you didn't cower,' Bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters on Thursday. 'We have to face our fears. No more fussiness, no more whining. Are people going to cry forever?'||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-worst-covid-crisis-is-unfolding-in-brazil-where-no-fix-seems-to-work-101614952708138.html
05-03-2021||World||Swiss mull 'burqa ban' in vote centering on security, rights||At a time when seemingly everyone in Europe is wearing masks to battle Covid-19, the Swiss go to the polls Sunday to vote on a long-laid proposal to ban face-coverings, both the niqabs and burqas worn by a few Muslim women in the country and the ski masks and bandannas used by protesters.The issue strikes at the intersection of religious freedom, security, the economy and women’s rights.Critics say the proposal “Yes to a ban on covering the face” is an ironic throwback to a time not long ago when violent extremism was a greater concern than global pandemic, and say it would unfairly stigmatize Muslims who wear full face-covering burqas or niqabs, which have open slits for the eyes, in Switzerland.Proponents, including populist, right-wing movements behind the idea, say it’s needed to combat what they consider a sign of the oppression of women and to uphold a basic principle that faces should be shown in a free society like that of the rich Alpine democracy.The issue is one of three measures on national ballots in the vote culminating Sunday — most voters in Switzerland cast ballots by mail – as part of the latest installment of regular Swiss referendums that give voters a direct say in policymaking.Other proposals would create an “e-ID” to improve security of online transactions — an idea that has run afoul of privacy advocates — and a free-trade deal with Indonesia, which is opposed by environmentalists who have concerns about palm oil plantations on the archipelago in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.The face-covering measure has come to be known colloquially as the “burqa ban." It would put Switzerland in line with countries like Belgium and France that have already enacted similar measures. Two Swiss regions also already have such bans.One campaign poster presented by the Swiss People’s Party — a populist, right-wing party that is the leading faction in parliament and has strongly backed the measure — features a caricatured image of the scowling eyes of a woman in a burqa above the words: “Stop Islamic Radicalism.”A coalition of left-leaning parties have put up signs that read: “Absurd. Useless. Islamophobic.”Support appears to have been eroding, but the vote is expected to be tight. An initial poll for public broadcaster SSR by the gfs.bern agency in January found more than half of voters backed the proposal, but a second poll published on Feb. 24 showed the figures had dipped to under half. Some remain undecided.The Swiss government opposes the measure, arguing that it could crimp economic development: Most Muslim women who wear such veils in Switzerland are visitors from well-heeled Persian Gulf states, who are often drawn to bucolic Swiss lakeside cities. The justice minister insists existing laws work just fine.The measure would make it punishable by fines to cover the face in public in places like restaurants, sports stadiums, public transport or simply walking in the street — though exceptions are made for religious, security and health reasons, as well as for the Swiss traditional Carnival celebrations.A counter-proposal would require people to show their faces if requested to do so by authorities.It’s another indication how Switzerland is grappling with security issues and cultures and people from abroad. In the past, Swiss voters have approved a ban on the construction of minarets in the Alpine country whose flag carries the cross.Andreas Tunger-Zanetti, a researcher who heads the Center for Religious Studies at the University of Lucerne, estimates at most a few dozen Muslim women wear full-face coverings in the country of 8.5 million people, and says the issue is really about Switzerland's take on religion and ability to “cope with diversity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-mull-burqa-ban-in-vote-centering-on-security-rights-101614952072704.html
05-03-2021||World||Italy is first to block Covid-19 vaccine export. All you need to know about AstraZeneca supply row||Italy has decided to block thousands of doses of the vaccine developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Australia. The country is not only the first country in Europe to do so but also the first in the world that has refused the export of Covid-19 vaccines to another nation. The refusal was possible because of the vaccine export control measure taken by the European Union earlier this year.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Worried about the Covid vaccine supply, the 27-nation bloc had taken vaccine export control measures that drove criticism from the World Health Organization (WHO). The global health body has been programming the COVAX initiative for the equitable access of vaccines to all. Italy has reported more than 2.9 million coronavirus cases and 99,000 deaths, as per Johns Hopkins University's tracker.Here is what has happened:1. Italy has decided to block the 250,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses to Australia. This is the first refusal to vaccine export after the EU introduced the vaccination supply measures overseas on January 29. France has also come forward in support of the decision.2. Due to the delivery shortfall the EU has brought in export control measures that authorises its members to deny vaccine exports.3. The refusal to Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine export comes after the Anglo-Swedish company said it will only be able to supply 40 million doses of the vaccine in contrast to the 90-100 million doses marked in the contract. The vaccine delays from the company have prompted such measures.4. In August 2020, the EU had signed a deal with Oxford-AstraZeneca for the supply of 400 million Covid-19 vaccines but earlier this year, the company reported production delays in its plant in Netherlands and Belgium. Pfizer vaccine supplies have also declined due to production issues.5. EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides had even demanded the company to meet the promised vaccine supply through the UK factories.Also Read | As China eyes Taiwan and beyond, Quad's Indo-Pacific agenda takes priority6. Australia on the other hand while asking the European Commission to review the refusal of vaccine export has said that it understands Italy's approach. "In Italy, people are dying at the rate of 300 a day. And so I can certainly understand the high level of anxiety that would exist in Italy and in many countries across Europe," Reuters quoted Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as saying.6. AstraZeneca’s chief executive officer Pascal Soriot said that the contract mentions 'our best efforts' on the allegations made by the EU that it is backtracking from its deal. He had also indicated that Europe might have signed the vaccine supply deal a little late in comparison to the UK. "Europe at the time wanted to be supplied more or less at the same time as the UK, even though the contract was signed three months later," Bloomberg quoted Soriot as saying.7. The EU vaccine row comes as the bloc is under pressure to do better in inoculating since the European nations were hit hard by the coronavirus disease. While the vaccination drive in Europe had begun in December last year, the pace of the inoculation is very slow in comparison to its old member Britain and other developed countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-is-first-to-block-covid-19-vaccine-export-all-you-need-to-know-about-astrazeneca-supply-row-101614946940759.html

The appointment, effective March 15, was approved by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.Most recently, Hassan, whose parents are immigrants from Kerala, was the chief digital officer of wealth management at Morgan Stanley and a member of the wealth management operating committee at the investment bank. Previously, she was the executive vice president of investor services, segments and platforms at Charles Schwab Corporation. She holds a Masters of Business Administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.“I am confident that Naureen will be an inspiring and innovative leader, and look forward to working with her to move our organization forward in line with our values,” Williams added.The growing role of Indian Americans in the various sectors was well reflected in US President Joe Biden’s remark during a congratulatory call with Nasa’s aerospace engineer Swati Mohan on Thursday. The Mars 2020 guidance, navigation and control operations lead was responsible for the descent and landing phase of the Perseverance rover through the thin Martian atmosphere, described by Nasa scientists as “seven minutes of terror”.Referring to the achievement of Mohan, US vice president Kamala Harris, and the director of the White House speechwriting team, Vinay Reddy, Biden said that Indian Americans are “taking over the country.” “This is an incredible honour. And it’s amazing. Indian(s) - of descent - Americans are taking over the country. You, my vice president, my speechwriter, Vinay. I tell you what,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-naureen-hassan-named-first-vp-coo-of-new-york-fed-101614949269620.html
05-03-2021||World||Debate to begin in US Senate on Prez Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill||A sharply divided US Senate will begin a contentious debate on Friday on a $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill that is President Joe Biden's first major legislative initiative, with Democrats pressing ahead without any Republican support.The Senate voted on Thursday to take up the bill in a party-line 51-50 vote, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. But Republicans delayed the start of the debate by forcing the hours-long reading of the full text of the 628-page measure.The Senate is expected to debate the bill three hours on Friday before considering a multitude of amendments, which could require a marathon voting session, before taking a vote on final passage in a process that could extend into the weekend. Republicans are expected to use procedural maneuvers to slow the process.If the Senate approves the bill, it will have to be sent back to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives for final passage. Democrats hope Biden can sign the bill into law before March 14, when some of the current benefits run out.With no votes to spare, Senate Democrats have tweaked the measure to ensure all 50 of their members would support it. Those changes would steer more aid to smaller U.S. states and add money for infrastructure projects, among other adjustments.But efforts by some senators to alter temporary federal unemployment benefits failed. The Senate bill keeps the House plan for $400 per-week payments through Aug. 29. It was unclear whether any senators would try to change that figure, possibly to $300, during the amendment process in coming days."The time is now to move forward with big, bold, strong relief for the American people," said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has promised to keep the Senate at work until the bill is passed.Republicans, who broadly backed Covid-19 relief spending early in the pandemic, have criticized the bill's price tag.The relief legislation includes funding for vaccines and medical supplies, extends jobless assistance and provides a new round of emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments. Opinion polls indicate broad public support.Senate Democrats on Wednesday tightened criteria for stimulus checks so fewer high-income households would qualify.The compromise means that 9 million fewer households would receive a stimulus payment than in the last tranche of payouts in 2020. It also lowers the cost of the legislation by $12 billion, according to Senate Democrats. On Thursday, they said they had increased minimum payments to states with smaller rural populations to match the $1.25 billion minimum contained in last year's CARES Act. The bill passed by the House set the floor at $500 million.The pandemic has killed nearly 520,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work, although infection rates have eased in recent weeks as more people are vaccinated.'BIG, BLOATED, WASTEFUL'The Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Thune, said larger states like California, New York and Illinois still got the lion's share in the "big, bloated, wasteful bill.""You've got taxpayers in places like South Dakota and North Carolina and Georgia and other places around the country that essentially are writing checks to states which really aren't needed," Thune told PBS.Democrats also included $10 billion for infrastructure, $8.5 billion for health providers and expanded healthcare subsidies for those who lose their jobs.In the Senate, bills usually require the support of 60 senators. But the coronavirus relief bill is being advanced under a legislative maneuver known as reconciliation that allows passage with a simple majority vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/debate-to-begin-in-us-senate-on-prez-biden-s-1-9-trillion-covid-19-relief-bill-101614943486681.html

"I want everybody to be vaccinated."Two other male doctors and one female nurse were also inoculated in white tents draped in green, the colours of the national flag, while cameras rolled and officials clapped and cheered.Nigeria, with 157,671 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,951 deaths, has not been as hard hit by the pandemic as initially feared, but is aiming to vaccinate 40% of its people this year, and a further 30% in 2022.It took delivery of 3.92 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on Tuesday through the COVAX scheme. Nigeria expects to receive 84 million doses of the vaccine from COVAX this year.The scheme for poor and middle-income countries is co-led by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, and the World Health Organization, with UNICEF as an implementing partner.'Light at the end of the tunnel'Nigeria also expects at least 40 million doses from the African Union and 100,000 donated doses of India's Covishield vaccine.President Muhammadu Buhari and other "strategic leaders" will be vaccinated on Saturday in an effort to increase public confidence in the shots.Nigeria's 36 states, including Lagos, the commercial capital and epicentre of the pandemic in the country, will receive shots in coming weeks. Seroprevalence studies suggest 23% of Lagos state inhabitants may have had Covid-19 in October.Frontline healthcare workers and employees in key sectors, including oil and gas, will be among those getting the first shots, followed by adults with pre-existing conditions. All those over 18, excluding pregnant women, can then be vaccinated."Vaccines provide light at the end of the tunnel but we must get to the end of the tunnel," said Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director General of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, adding that surveillance, testing and treatment would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctor-gets-nigeria-s-first-covid-19-vaccine-amid-cheers-and-hope-101614948772158.html

Multiple news reports also talked about the bizarre-looking image shared by David Morris. Morris, while speaking to the broadcaster, said that he was “stunned” to see the image of a ship floating in the air.A BBC meteorologist, David Braine, explained the phenomenon and said that “a super mirage” has caused the ship to appear as floating in the air, because of “special atmospheric conditions that bend light.” “Superior mirages occur because of the weather condition known as a temperature inversion, where cold air lies close to the sea with warmer air above it. Since cold air is denser than warm air, it bends light towards the eyes of someone standing on the ground or on the coast, changing how a distant object appears,” Braine was quoted as saying by the BBC.Also read | As China eyes Taiwan and beyond, Quad's Indo-Pacific agenda takes priority“Superior mirages can produce a few different types of images - here a distant ship appears to float high above its actual position, but sometimes an object below the horizon can become visible,” he added. Braine also noted that such illusions appear “very rarely” in the United Kingdom during winter, but are common in the Arctic.A similar image was shared by a Facebook user named Colin McCallum, who also photographed what appeared to be a floating ship, near Banff, Aberdeenshire in Scotland. However, it turned out to be an optical illusion too.“When I first saw the boat, I had to do a double-take because I genuinely thought it was floating. Upon further inspection, however, I noticed that it was in fact just a remarkable optical illusion,” McCallum said while speaking to the British news outlet Daily Mail in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floating-ship-clicked-off-english-coast-expert-calls-it-rare-phenomenon-101614947329933.html
05-03-2021||World||Four Hong Kong activists released on bail after prosecutors withdraw appeal||Four Hong Kong democracy activists were released from custody on Friday after prosecutors withdrew an appeal against a court decision to grant them bail in a controversial national security case following marathon hearings this week.The four are part of a group of 47 activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in a case that has triggered global concern that Beijing is using the security law to crush dissent and wipe out meaningful opposition in the former British colony.The case is the most sweeping use yet of the law, which imposes punishments of up to life in prison for serious charges, including subversion.The 47 activists, aged 23 to 64, are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll last July that authorities said was part of a "vicious plot" to "overthrow" the government.The vote was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a Legislative Council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.Beijing is planning a major overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system and Legislative Council elections will likely be deferred again, to September 2022.Late on Thursday, following four consecutive days of hearings that went on late into the night and saw some of the defendants falling ill and taken to hospital, judge Victor So denied bail to 32 of the defendants.The other 15 were granted bail under strict conditions, but still kept in custody after government prosecutors appealed against the decision.On Friday, appeals for Clarisse Yeung, Lawrence Lau, Hendrick Lui and Mike Lam were withdrawn.They were then granted bail ranging from HK$80,000 ($10,300) to HK$1 million, provided that they surrender all travel documents, abide by a curfew, do not use speech and action that could possibly endanger national security, or organise or take part in elections or contact foreign officials.The other 11 will appear in three batches in court on Saturday for the prosecutors' appeal to be heard.For the others - including prominent activists Owen Chow, Lester Shum, Wu Chi-wai, Eddie Chu, Alvin Yeung, Claudia Mo, Gwyneth Ho and Prince Wong - the case was adjourned until May 31. Some are appealing against the decision.In contrast with the global financial hub's common law traditions, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies interference.While critics say the security law has been used to curb freedoms, Beijing and Hong Kong officials say it was vital to end the 2019 violence - political action they say was partly manipulated by foreign governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-hong-kong-activists-released-on-bail-after-prosecutors-withdraw-appeal-101614945782585.html
05-03-2021||World||Germany compensates utilities $2.9 Billion for nuclear exit||Germany agreed to compensate Vatenfall, RWE, EnBw and E.ON 2.4 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for losses suffered following the country’s decision to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima Dai-Ichi meltdowns.The deal ends the decade-long battle between the government and Germany’s biggest energy companies. It comes in an election year when the green credentials of Europe’s largest economy will be a key topic among voters. Abandoning nuclear power will eliminate one of Germany’s top sources of emissions-free electricity that is available around the clock.Friday’s settlement underscores the long-lasting economic impacts of the Fukushima accident even outside of Japan. Just months before the 2011 disaster, Germany’s government had agreed to extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear plants. But the government abruptly reversed course after the accident and decided to end nuclear power generation by the end of 2022 at the latest.“This led to years of legal disputes, including before the Federal Constitutional Court and an international court of arbitration, which can now be settled,” read a government statement on Friday.Vattenfall will receive 1.43 billion euros, while RWE will get 880 million euros to compensate for residual electricity that the utilities won’t be able to generate. EnBW will receive 80 million euros and E.ON 42.5 million euros to compensate for investments.As part of the overall agreement, the companies withdrew all pending legal proceedings and waived any legal claims contesting the deal.“We welcome the agreement we are seeking, which will now put an end to many years of costly and time-consuming disputes over the German nuclear phase-out,” read a Vattenfall statement.The Swedish company won a top court ruling in November, arguing Germany failed to implement a 2016 decision that gave utilities the right to seek compensation following the country’s decision to close nuclear power plants.“It is an important step toward creating legal certainty for all parties involved,” read an RWE statement, adding that the deal strengthens confidence in Germany so that it can attract “the considerable investments that must now be made in the restructuring of the energy system.”Japan will commemorate the Fukushima Dai-Ichi disaster next week. More than 160,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding the nuclear plant after a magnitude 9 earthquake, the biggest ever recorded to hit Japan, caused a massive tsunami that overwhelmed the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-compensates-utilities-2-9-billion-for-nuclear-exit-101614945975193.html

The suspect, who was not identified under Swedish rules and who faces seven counts of attempted murder, denied any wrongdoing.“I have done nothing. I was at home," the suspected shouted at the beginning of the custody hearing and banged his fist on the table, Swedish media reported.The man, who has Afghan citizenship, was described by Swedish media as an asylum-seeker whose residence permit had expired last year. Local news reports also have said the man had a history of mental health issues. He is known to police for petty crimes.On Friday, he entered the court room limping after having being shot in the leg by police Wednesday, some 20 minutes after the first calls of an ongoing incident in the small town of Vetlanda, 190 kilometers (118 miles) southeast of Goteborg, Sweden’s second-largest city. Officers who arrested him found a knife in his possession.Police say there are five crime scenes in the town of 13,000. It appeared that the seven male victims were picked at random. All are stable, according to hospital officials.At first, police floated the idea that the preliminary investigation could be considered terror-related, but later changed it to attempted murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-suspected-of-stabbing-7-held-in-custody-in-sweden-101614941199961.html
05-03-2021||World||France backs Italy’s call to stop exports of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines||France came out in support of Italy’s decision to halt a shipment of AstraZeneca Plc’s coronavirus shots to Australia as tensions escalate over global supplies of the vaccines.“Of course I understand Italy,” French Health Minister Olivier Veran said during an interview with RMC radio. “We could do the same thing.”The backing from a major European Union country comes after Australia called on the European Commission to take a look at Italy’s actions. The EU has struggled to distribute shots to its population, and sparred with the Anglo-Swedish drug company over production delays.“Australia has raised the issue with the European Commission through multiple channels,” Greg Hunt, Australia’s health minister, told reporters. “We have asked the European Commission to review this decision.”Italy informed the commission that it would withhold the vaccine shipment, using a new rule that obliges member states to inform the EU executive when it decides to stop doses being exported outside of the bloc. The commission didn’t oppose Italy’s decision, an EU official said. The company declined to comment.The EU’s top trade official, Valdis Dombrovskis, spoke with his Australian counterpart on Friday, according to EU officials familiar with the discussion. They asked not to be identified because the talks were private.Tougher ApproachThe Italian foreign ministry said the decision involving 250,700 doses was a consequence of continued vaccine scarcity in Europe and Italy, and took into account AstraZeneca supply delays. It also said Australia was considered a “non-vulnerable” country.During an EU summit last week, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called for a tougher approach against companies that don’t respect their delivery commitments.The impact is likely to be largely symbolic given that the number of the vaccines blocked is relatively small compared to the company’s expected deliveries in the EU and elsewhere. But the move highlights Draghi’s intention to be tougher on pharmaceutical companies that don’t respect their commitments to the EU, and could encourage retaliatory protectionist measures by other governments.In January, the commission introduced legislation that allows curbs on exports of coronavirus vaccines if drugmakers fail to meet delivery targets within the bloc. The rules came into force after AstraZeneca had informed the EU that it was unable to meet its commitments under an advance purchase agreement.Damaging ProtectionismItaly is the first country so far to block the export of vaccines outside the EU, while over 170 requests have so far been authorized, according to a separate EU diplomat.The decision could reignite concerns echoed by many including the World Health Organization that the EU is engaging in damaging protectionism, at a time when countries around the world race to immunize their populations amid growing concerns over fast-spreading coronavirus variants.Asked by a reporter in Sydney on Friday whether he blamed Italian authorities for the block, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: “They’re certainly responsible for exercising the veto right they had through the EU process about those supplies coming to Australia.”“It’s important contracts are honored,” Morrison said.The export controls may also prove to be a growing headache for drugmakers with so many manufacturing sites in the EU. Most companies at the forefront of the vaccine effort have production capacity in the bloc that is used to serve countries beyond it, or must be sent outside for completion before returning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-backs-italy-s-call-to-stop-exports-of-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccines-101614942221906.html
05-03-2021||World||Pak election commission meets to discuss Imran Khan's allegations||Pakistan's election commission has convened a crucial meeting on Friday after Prime Minister Imran Khan accused it of discrediting democracy and damaging the morality of the nation, according to media reports.Prime Minister Khan, in a televised address to the country on Thursday, lashed out at the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) which he said failed to stop corruption in Wednesday's closely-contested Senate elections."You (ECP) discredited democracy…you damaged the morality of the nation by doing nothing to stop vote-buying," he alleged."You allowed corruption to occur at the top, and this happened right before you, and you knew it would happen. I kept saying that markets have opened and there is an auction going on. And when the Supreme Court gave you a chance, what reason was there to not bar code a mere 1,500 ballots?" Khan said.Khan's criticism of the ECP came after Opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) candidate and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani defeated ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on Wednesday, in a major blow to the Prime Minister who personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.According to a report in the Geo TV, ECP convened the meeting to review the statements of Prime Minister Khan, who had levelled serious allegations on its role during the Senate polls. All members of the ECP will attend the meeting.Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja summoned the meeting after the ECP members asked him for the same to discuss the highly objectionable comments made by Prime Minister Khan, the Dawn newspaper reported.“The government should amend the Constitution, if it wants open voting for Senate elections, but should not expect from the Comm­ission to do the job of legislature,” a senior official of the ECP was quoted as saying in the report.Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the Senate elections would be held through a secret ballot, amid a raging controversy among the government and Opposition parties about allowing an open vote to avoid corruption.According to the official, the ECP is bound to follow the law which provides for a secret ballot and any hasty attempt to make the votes traceable would have been a violation of the Constitution, the report said.The official said that the prime minister instead of taking note of the uncalled for remarks made by members of his Cabinet chose to join the blame game, it said.Under mounting pressure from the Opposition to resign, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that he will seek a vote of confidence on Saturday, in a bid to restore the legitimacy of his government after an embarrassing defeat of the finance minister in the hotly-contested Senate elections.He also accused the grand Opposition alliance for "making a mockery of democracy" and said that he will never let the corrupt politicians off the hook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-election-commission-meets-to-discuss-imran-khan-s-allegations-101614942633543.html
05-03-2021||World||China to cut carbon emissions per economic unit of output by 18% in five years||China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, announced generally moderate new energy and climate targets on Friday that give little sign that it will step up its pace in combatting climate change.On a smoggy day in Beijing, Premier Li Keqiang said the country will reduce carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 18% over the next five years. He was speaking at the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, China's ceremonial legislature, that began Friday.The meeting is China's highest-profile political event of the year, where the ruling Communist Party unveils new policies and legislation.The 18% target is the same as in the previous five-year economic plan. The country uses carbon emissions per unit of economic output, or carbon intensity, instead of absolute emission reduction targets.“We were very keen to see what the 14th five-year plan would say about how to actually get there, or maybe even more ambitious targets,” said Dimitri de Boer, chief representative of ClientEarth, an environmental law charity. “What we’ve seen of the actual plan is that there is a target on reducing carbon intensity by 2025 but we can’t tell what exactly that means in total emissions.”In September, President Xi Jinping announced that China would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, and a peak in emissions by 2030. The carbon neutrality announcement led many to expect there would be sharper targets.Government planners offered a few more specifics in a summary of the new five-year plan. It sets a target for non-fossil energy to account for 20% of total energy consumption by 2025, which will require further investment in solar and wind energy. It did not mention any ban on new coal projects, which experts say would be a significant step.China obtains 60% of its power from coal and is the world’s biggest source of climate-changing industrial pollution. As a result, its carbon intensity is higher than any other country.Climate change experts say the new plan does not include indicators previously given by the government, such as a 5-year GDP target, which would set more concrete limits since carbon intensity is calculated using GDP.Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki, said the lack of such concrete numbers could be good because it could offer the government more flexibility in pursuing green policies.Many are waiting to see whether the government will unveil more detailed regulations on carbon-intense industries such as steel and cement manufacturing later this year.Although the new target continues the same pace as the previous five-year plan, experts say achieving it will be harder given earlier gains.The country achieved a 18.6% reduction in the last five-year period.“It should be more challenging than in the last five years because you are doing better … the marginal cost will be higher," said Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China, a charity dedicated to sustainable economic development.Whether China will pick up its pace remains to be seen.“This is very gradual progress at best,” said Myllyvirta. “It’s much more of continuing business as usual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-cut-carbon-emissions-per-economic-unit-of-output-by-18-in-five-years-101614943310859.html
05-03-2021||World||Africa welcomes Covax doses but warns against 'selfishness'||Urgent calls for Covid-19 vaccine fairness rang through African countries on Friday as more welcomed or rolled out doses from the global COVAX initiative, with officials acutely aware their continent needs much more.“Rich countries should not be so selfish,” Pontiano Kaleebu, head of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, said as his country prepared to receive its first doses. “It’s a concern, and everyone is talking about it.”The East African nation of 45 million people was seeing the arrival of under 1 million vaccine doses — 864,000. It’s the first batch of a total of 18 million COVAX doses for Uganda, but when all will arrive is not known.That number is “not going to do much,” said Monica Musenero, an epidemiologist and presidential adviser, though she added that “we can advocate for more vaccines, but we should also appreciate what we’ve got.”She urged Africa’s 54 countries to devote more resources, however limited, to secure more doses: “As a bloc we should organize ourselves ... instead of sitting there to cry.”The foundation of Nobel Peace Prize winner and former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu and his wife, Leah, on Friday issued a statement saying that “more must be done, immediately, to ensure lower-income countries have faster access to Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostic tools and treatments.” It noted that a small number of rich countries hold the majority of vaccine doses.“This is not a time for selfishness,” the statement said, and it noted growing calls for a waiver of intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines to allow for faster, wider production — a proposal opposed by the European Union and countries including the United States, Britain and Canada.While the COVAX initiative was created to ensure that low- and middle-income countries receive Covid-19 vaccines, it has faced delays and limited supply.Even as the World Health Organization’s Africa chief, Matshidiso Moeti, on Thursday noted that almost 10 million COVAX doses had been delivered to 11 African countries, she could not resist adding, “finally.”She added, “we expect about half of African countries will receive COVAX deliveries in the coming week and that most countries will have vaccination programs under way by end of March.”The goal is that countries will be able to vaccinate 20% of their population with the COVAX doses by the end of this year — far from the goal of 60% or more to achieve so-called “herd immunity” when enough people are protected through infection or vaccination to make it difficult for a virus to continue to spread.“You expect that at this point we should be getting the initial 9 million doses from COVAX” instead of less than 1 million, said Misaki Wayengera, head of a technical committee advising Uganda’s response. He worries that delays in vaccine procurement mean several months could pass before some people receive the second required shot.Uganda aims to vaccinate 20% of its population with doses from COVAX, with 40% vaccinated via government and private-sector funding.The COVAX delays have pushed other African countries to seek more doses elsewhere, including via bilateral deals that can be unfavorable.Uganda has announced plans to buy 18 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India, but the country faces cash shortages.And it is not clear how much the doses will cost. Some critics have been appalled by lower-income countries paying more per Covid-19 vaccine dose than rich ones.One WHO official in Africa, Richard Mihigo, on Thursday discouraged African countries from bilateral deals because of the risk of paying a high price. The African Union instead is pursuing bulk deals for the continent, but that also has faced delays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-welcomes-covax-doses-but-warns-against-selfishness-101614943010223.html

All you need to know||YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki said former US president Donald Trump’s channel on the online video-sharing platform will be restored only when the risk of violence decreases. Trump was banned from multiple online platforms, including YouTube, in the aftermath of the Capitol riots on January 6 as he continued amplifying the claims of widespread electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election.Speaking to Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, Wojcicki said that several videos uploaded on YouTube by Donald Trump’s channel were in violation of the company’s incitement-to-violence policy. “As a result, we removed those videos very quickly. And when we see a violation of our policy, we suspend the channel for seven days. So that is standard procedure about how our strike system works. And again, it works that way for everyone,” she told Frederick Kempe, president and CEO of Atlantic Council.The top executive of Alphabet Inc’s unit further stated that YouTube will restore Trump’s channel after the company sees reduced law enforcement in all state capitols in the US. Notably, security around the US Capitol has been tightened after intelligence found a possible plot of an attack on the complex by a militia group. Citing the company’s policy, Wojcicki said that Trump’s YouTube channel will remain subject to a “three-strikes” system.Read | Threats to lawmakers spur request for more National Guard helpWhat is the ‘three-strikes’ system?If the content of someone’s channel violates the Community Guidelines, YouTube removes the content and issues a strike to the channel. The channel’s owner gets a notification on their mobile phone, computer and channel settings, along with the reason for the removal and what could be done next. After getting the first strike, the user cannot upload videos, live streams, or stories on the channel for at least a week. In case the user gets a second strike within the same 90-day period as the first strike, the individual cannot upload content for another two weeks.“If there are no further issues, full privileges will be restored automatically after the 2-week period, but each strike will not expire until 90 days from the time it was issued,” reads the Community Guidelines on strike system.A third strike in the same 90-day period will lead to the permanent removal of that channel from YouTube. According to the company, each strike doesn’t expire until 90 days from the time it was issued and mere deletion of the content doesn’t mean the removal of a strike. Wojcicki stressed that the three-strikes system applies to everyone and no one has the privilege of exception.“We have had that system since the very beginning of YouTube. And those three strikes, they apply to everybody. So there are no exceptions. Politicians aren’t excepted. Famous people aren’t excepted. CEOs aren’t excepted. Everybody follows the same rules,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-youtube-three-strikes-system-trump-channel-will-remain-subject-to-101614940700074.html
05-03-2021||World||Pope Francis lands in Iraq on first-ever papal visit to rally Christians||Pope Francis arrived in Iraq on Friday to urge the country’s dwindling number of Christians to stay put and help rebuild the country after years of war and persecution, brushing aside the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns to make his first-ever papal visit.Iraqis were keen to welcome him and the global attention his visit will bring, with banners and posters hanging high in central Baghdad, and billboards depicting Francis with the slogan “We are all Brothers” decorating the main thoroughfare. In central Tahrir square, a mock tree was erected emblazoned with the Vatican emblem, while Iraqi and Vatican flags lined empty streets.Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said Iraqis were eager to welcome Francis’ “message of peace and tolerance” and described the visit as a historic meeting between the “minaret and the bells.” Among the highlights of the three-day visit is Francis' private meeting Saturday with the country's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a revered figure in Iraq and beyond.Francis' plane touched down at Baghdad's airport just before 2 p.m. local time (1100 GMT).The government is eager to show off the relative security it has achieved after years of wars and militant attacks that nevertheless continue even today. Francis and the Vatican delegation are relying on Iraqi security forces to protect them, including with the expected first use of an armored car for the popemobile-loving pontiff.Tahsin al-Khafaji, spokesman for Iraq's joint operations, said security forces had been increased.“This visit is really important to us and provides a good perspective of Iraq because the whole world will be watching,” he said. The high stakes will give Iraqi forces “motivation to achieve this visit with safety and peace.”Francis is breaking his year-long Covid-19 lockdown to refocus the world’s attention on a largely neglected people whose northern Christian communities, which date from the time of Christ, were largely emptied during the violent Islamic State reign from 2014-2017.For the pope, who has often traveled to places where Christians are a persecuted minority, Iraq's beleaguered Christians are the epitome of the “martyred church" that he has admired ever since he was a young Jesuit seeking to be a missionary in Asia.In Iraq, Francis is seeking to not only honor its martyrs but deliver a message of reconciliation and fraternity. The few Christians who remain in Iraq harbor a lingering mistrust of their Muslim neighbors and face structural discrimination long predating both IS and the 2003 US-led invasion that plunged the country into chaos.“The Pope’s visit is to support the Christians in Iraq to stay, and to say that they are not forgotten,” the Chaldean patriarch, Cardinal Luis Sako, told reporters in Baghdad this week. The aim of Francis’ visit, he said, is to encourage them to “hold onto hope.”The visit comes as Iraq is seeing a new spike in coronavirus infections, with most new cases traced to the highly contagious variant first identified in Britain. The 84-year-old pope, the Vatican delegation and travelling media have been vaccinated; most Iraqis have not.Ahead of the pope’s arrival Friday, dozens of men, women and children gathered in a Baghdad church, many not wearing masks or observing social distancing, before boarding buses to the airport to welcome the pontiff.The Vatican and Iraqi authorities have downplayed the threat of the virus and insisted that social distancing, crowd control and other health care measures will be enforced. The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, said this week the important thing is for Iraqis to know that the pope came to Iraq as an “act of love.”“I come among you as a pilgrim of peace, to repeat ‘you are all brothers,’” Francis said in a video-message to the Iraqi people on the eve of his visit. “I come as a pilgrim of peace in search of fraternity, animated by the desire to pray together and walk together, also with brothers and sisters of other religious traditions.”Christians once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq but their numbers began dwindling after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. They fell further when IS militants in 2014 swept through traditionally Christian towns across the Nineveh plains. Their extremist brand of Islam forced residents to flee to the neighboring Kurdish region or further afield.Few have returned, and those who have found their homes and churches destroyed.Returnees have had to contend with more struggles. Many cannot find work and blame discriminatory practices in the public sector, Iraq's largest employer. Since 2003, public jobs have been mostly controlled by majority Shiite political elites, leaving Christians feeling marginalized.While hard numbers are hard to come by, there were an estimated 1.4 million Christians in Iraq in 2003. Today the number is believed to be around 250,000.During his visit, Francis will pray in the Baghdad church that was the site of one of the worst massacres of Christians, the 2010 attack by Islamic militants that left 58 people dead. He will honor the dead in a Mosul square surrounded by shells of destroyed churches and meet with the small Christian community that returned to Qaraqosh. He will bless their church, which was used as a firing range by IS.The Vatican and the pope have frequently insisted on the need to preserve Iraq’s ancient Christian communities and create the security, economic and social conditions for those who have left to return. But that hasn’t necessarily translated into reality.“I am the only priest in Mosul. Every Sunday I hold mass at 9 a.m., and only around 70 people attend," said the Rev. Raed Adil Kelo, parish priest of the Church of the Annunciation in the onetime de-facto IS capital.Before 2003, the Christian population was 50,000, he said. It had dwindled to 2,000 before IS overran northern Iraq.He doesn't expect more to return, but he said Francis' visit would have immeasurable importance for those who stayed.“This visit will bring peace to Iraq” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-lands-in-iraq-on-first-ever-papal-visit-to-rally-christians-101614942295967.html
05-03-2021||World||China plans expansion in Arctic region with push for building 'Polar Silk Road'||As the ice-covered parts of the Arctic Ocean melt due to climate change, China has flagged its interest to take part in building "Polar Silk Road", raising prospects for the emergence of a new sea route.China will participate in the pragmatic cooperation on the Arctic and the building of a "Polar Silk Road," the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the draft outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and the long-range objectives to the year 2035.Both the plans were submitted to China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s Parliament which began its annual session here on Friday.Connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) will cut across the centre of the Arctic Ocean, passing close to the North Pole.While it could significantly reduce distances for global trade, it remains frozen over for most of the year, making it much harder to traverse than the two Arctic shipping routes currently available – the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted a research paper earlier."To the best of our knowledge, China is the only country to have led official expeditions of all three Arctic shipping passages, including the TSR,” the research team, led by Dr Mia Bennett from the University of Hong Kong, wrote in the paper.China has made clear its intention to expand in the Arctic region and published a white paper on this in early 2018 calling for its transformation into a “Polar Silk Road” and highlighting its plans to integrate with its multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).China unveiled the BRI in 2013 with an aim to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes.India has been severely critical of the BRI, the pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping, as the USD 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of the BRI, passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plans-expansion-in-arctic-region-with-push-for-building-polar-silk-road-101614940526593.html
05-03-2021||World||US, UK weigh Russia sanctions over use of chemical weapons, possibly target debt||The US and UK are weighing additional penalties against Russia over the use of chemical weapons, with options ranging from sanctions against oligarchs to the extreme step of targeting the nation’s sovereign debt, according to people familiar with the matter.British officials plan to push for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to continue to pressure Russia to provide answers over its use of banned substances, and will raise potential measures with key European allies, including France and Germany, in the coming weeks, according to one of the people.The Biden administration announced its first sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, punishing the Kremlin for the poisoning and jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The penalties mirrored those imposed by the European Union and the U.K., mainly targeting senior Russian law enforcement officials and others allied with President Vladimir Putin.Russian bonds snapped a four-day rally, lifting the yield 11 basis points to 6.68% as of 12:21 p.m. in Moscow. Buoyed by climbing oil prices, the ruble was 0.3% stronger at 74.46 per dollar after slipping 1% on Thursday.The U.S. is expected to closely adhere to a 1991 chemical weapons law and follow-up with a second, more extensive round of sanctions unless Russia meets certain conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. Those include assurances it will refrain from the use of such weapons and allow inspections of suspected chemical weapons sites.The penalties were the latest sign of deepening tensions between Washington and Moscow, and the relationship could deteriorate further if Russia retaliates or the U.S. escalates its sanctions.All of the people spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of the matter. Communications aides at the White House National Security Council and the U.K. Foreign Office had no immediate comment Thursday.British officials are in discussions with U.S. counterparts about new measures. One trigger for additional steps would be if Russia continues to stonewall an investigation into Navalny’s poisoning, one person said.U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday urged Russia to adhere to its obligations under international law.“These attacks are unacceptable. We urge Russia to investigate, adhere to its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention,” Raab tweeted.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a similar message Thursday.The U.S. could increase pressure on Russia with sanctions on oligarchs with powers under the Magnitsky Act, which authorizes the president to sanction individuals for human rights violations or corruption, the people said.But if Russia is again found to commit a major transgression of the international ban on chemical weapons, President Joe Biden would consider imposing sanctions on the nation’s sovereign debt if it could be done in cooperation with Europe, two of the people said.The Treasury Department under former Secretary Steven Mnuchin in 2018 warned of global financial market turmoil if Russia’s sovereign debt market were sanctioned, saying it could destabilize markets because of how deeply tied the Russian market is to global indexes.But others say that Russia has moved away from buying U.S.-denominated debt toward the euro, meaning that negative spillovers could be smaller than previously anticipated. That view is shared by Daleep Singh, a former Obama-era Treasury official, who is now a deputy on Biden’s National Security Council.In 2019, as a witness during a congressional hearing on Russia, Singh supported restricting purchases of Russian sovereign debt to protect U.S. national security interests. At the time, he said that damage to global markets resulting from prohibiting purchases of Russian debt would not be as significant because global investors have reduced their overall exposure to the nation since the Obama administration started sanctioning Russia in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-weigh-russia-sanctions-over-use-of-chemical-weapons-possibly-target-debt-101614938906418.html
05-03-2021||World||World no closer to answer on Covid-19 origins despite WHO probe: Expert||Despite a high-profile visit to China by a team of international experts in January, the world is no closer to knowing the origins of Covid-19, according to one of the authors of an open letter calling for a new investigation into the pandemic."At this point we are no further advanced than we were a year ago," said Nikolai Petrovsky, an expert in vaccines at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and one of 26 global experts who signed the open letter, published on Thursday.In January, a team of scientists picked by the World Health Organization (WHO) visited hospitals and research institutes in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was identified, in search of clues about the origins of Covid-19.But the mission has come under fire, with critics accusing the WHO of relying too much on politically compromised Chinese fieldwork and data.Team members also said China was reluctant to share vital data that could show Covid-19 was circulating months earlier than first recognised.The open letter said the WHO mission "did not have the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation" into all theories about the origins of Covid-19."All possibilities remain on the table and I have yet to see a single piece of independent scientific data that rules out any of them," said Petrovsky.At a press briefing to mark the end of the WHO visit to Wuhan, mission head Peter Ben Embarek appeared to rule out the possibility that the virus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.But Petrovsky said it "doesn't make any sense" to rule any possibility out, and said the aim of the open letter was "to get an acknowledgement globally that no one has yet identified the source of the virus and we need to keep searching.""We need an open mind and if we close down some avenues because they are considered too sensitive, that is not how science operates," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-no-closer-to-answer-on-covid-19-origins-despite-who-probe-expert-101614937107235.html
05-03-2021||World||Pakistan government not planning to buy Covid-19 vaccines; to rely on herd immunity, donated jabs, says official||Pakistan is not planning to buy vaccines anytime soon as it aims to tackle the Covid-19 challenge through herd immunity and donated vaccines from friendly countries like China, authorities have said.So far, four vaccines —Sinophram (China), Oxford-AstraZeneca (UK), Sputnik-V (Russia) and Cansino Bio (China) have been registered in the country.National Health Service (NHS) Secretary Amir Ashraf Khawaja while briefing the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday said that the Pakistan government has no plan to buy vaccines anytime soon and aims to tackle the Covid-19 health challenge through herd immunity and donated vaccines, Dawn newspaper reported.Herd immunity occurs when a large number of people, usually 70 to 90 per cent, become immune to a contagious disease after being infected to it.According to National Institute of Health Executive Director Maj Gen Aamir Aamer Ikram, the cost of a single dose of Chinese vaccine Cansino is USD 13. He said Pakistan was relying on international donors and friendly countries like China.The NHS secretary informed the PAC that Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm had committed to providing one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, saying that 0.5 million doses had been handed over to Pakistan, out of which around 275,000 doses had been administered to health professionals dealing with Covid-19 patients.He said the second phase would cover the health officials working in other hospitals and health facilities, adding that the people aged 65 years and above could also register themselves for vaccination.He said Pakistan has planned to vaccinate 70 million people this year.According to the NHS secretary, Pakistan will also get 16 million free doses of India-made Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine through Gavi that would give cover to 20 per cent of the population of Pakistan.The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) is a public-private global health partnership with the goal of increasing access to immunisation in poor countries.In response to a question by PAC Chairman Rana Tanveer Hussain, the NHS secretary said Pakistan would get the first batch of AstraZeneca vaccine made by Serum Institute of India by the middle of March and the rest was expected to arrive in the country by June.According to him, vaccination to the aged people was due to start by March 5; however, the consignment was delayed.He said that another Chinese company had conducted the phase-three trial of Cansino vaccine in Pakistan, adding that total 18,000 people were inoculated and the vaccine’s efficacy stood at 85 per cent.According to the NHS secretary, the ministry had conducted a survey in June 2020 to ascertain the figures of those who have developed antibodies against coronavirus. He said the survey disclosed that around 15 per cent of the population has developed antibodies and that they did not need to be immunised.The PAC chairman pointed out that some people had some reservations over side effects of the vaccine and suggested that the top leadership of the country should get inoculated first to remove doubts in the general public’s mind.In response to a question by Hina Rabbani Khar, the NHS secretary said that despite the government's offer to the private sector to buy the vaccine, no serious buyers had so far come forward.According to him, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan has so far received applications only from three companies for the import of vaccines, but their applications have been rejected because they did not give any detail and specification of the vaccines they intended to import.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases in the country has gone up by around 30 per cent since the announcement of relaxation in restrictions, the report said.The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), a representative body of health professionals, has urged the government to immediately impose the restrictions to avoid chances of a third wave of the virus.The Nat­ional Command and Ope­ration Centre (NCOC) data showed that there were 1,176 cases on February 27 and 1,163 on March 1, but the number suddenly surged to 1,388 on March 2 and reached 1,519 on Thursday.Pakistan reported 52 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours as the number of positive cases surged to 587,014. The nationwide tally of fatalities jumped to 13,128 on Friday.According to the latest figures by the National Command and Operation Center (NCOC), 1,579 persons tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-government-not-planning-to-buy-covid-19-vaccines-to-rely-on-herd-immunity-donated-jabs-says-official-101614935759751.html

Although the country’s economic growth was below its recent annual target, a focus on heavy industry and property construction drove the increase in emissions. Output from the industry and construction sector increased by 2.8%, steel by 7% and cement and coal mining by 2.5% and 1.4% last year, the report said.While the emissions growth was below the 3.3% average rate in the past decade, it raises concern about the nation’s ability to meet its 2060 carbon neutrality pledge, Rhodium said.“If 2020 is any indication, it will require a significant departure from the status quo for China to shift away from its current fossil-heavy growth path,” the report said. “There will be increasing scrutiny on China’s plans for the coming decade to ensure that emissions peak as soon as possible.”The world’s biggest emitter began its week-long National People’s Congress on Friday, announcing major green targets for its 14th Five Year Plan covering the period 2021 to 2025. In the plan, the first strategic blueprint since last September when Xi Jinping announced the net-zero emission goal, China outlined modest short-term climate goals. The country plans to reduce carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 18% by 2025, the same level it targeted in the previous five-year plan. And a new target to reduce energy use per unit of GDP by 13.5% is lower than the 15% goal in its 13th Five Year Plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-emissions-grew-1-7-in-2020-only-major-economy-to-see-increase-in-pandemic-year-report-101614935312967.html

And a new target to reduce energy use per unit of GDP by 13.5% is lower than the 15% goal in its 13th Five Year Plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-emissions-increased-by-1-7-in-2020-report-101614934764157.html

05-03-2021||World||Pope Francis departs Rome for risky, historic Iraq tour||Pope Francis left Rome on Friday to start a four-day trip to Iraq, his most risky foreign trip since his election in 2012 and the first visit by a pontiff to the country.An Alitalia airplane carrying the 84-year-old pope, his entourage, a security detail, and about 75 journalists, left Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport for the 4-1/2-hour flight to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.Iraq is deploying thousands of additional security personnel to protect Francis during the visit, which comes after a spate of rocket and suicide bomb attacks raised fears for his safety.The flags of Iraq and the Vatican City fluttered outside Baghdad airport in anticipation of his arrival.Francis's whirlwind tour will cover four cities in the north and south of the country, taking him by plane, helicopter and possibly armoured car to areas that most foreign dignitaries are unable to reach, let alone in such a short space of time.He will say Mass at a Baghdad church, meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric in the southern city of Najaf and travel north to Mosul, where the army had to empty the streets for security reasons last year for a visit by Iraq's prime minister.Mosul is a former Islamic State stronghold, and churches and other buildings there still bear the strains of conflict.Since the defeat of the Islamic State militants in 2017, Iraq has seen a greater degree of security, though violence persists, often in the form of rocket attacks by Iran-aligned militias on US targets, and US military action in response.On Wednesday morning, 10 rockets landed on an airbase that hosts U.S., coalition and Iraqi forces. Hours after that attack, the pope reaffirmed he would be going to Iraq.Islamic State also remains a threat. In January, a suicide attack claimed by the Sunni militant group killed 32 people in Baghdad's deadliest such attack for years.VIOLENCE AND HOPEFrancis will meet clergy at a Baghdad church where Islamist gunmen killed more than 50 worshippers in 2010. Violence against minority groups in Iraq, especially when a third of the country was being run by Islamic State, has reduced its ancient Christian community to a fifth of its once 1.5 million people.The pontiff will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham, who is revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews, and meet Iraq's revered top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, 90-year-old Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.The meeting with Sistani, who wields great influence over Iraqi politics and its Shi'ite majority, will be the first by a pope.Some Shi'ite militant groups have opposed the pope's visit, framing it as Western interference in Iraq's affairs. But many Iraqis hope that it can help foster a fresh view of Iraq."It might not change much on the ground, but at least if the pope visits, people will see our country in a different light, not just bombs and war," said Ali Hassan, a 30-year-old Baghdad resident picking up relatives at the airport.The trip is the pope's 33rd outside Italy. He is due to return to Rome on Monday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-departs-rome-for-risky-historic-iraq-tour-101614933948046.html
05-03-2021||World||Situation on ground in Myanmar 'troubling': White House||The White House has said that the situation on the ground in Myanmar is "troubling" and the Biden administration has been working closely with its partners in the region.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Thursday that the Biden administration has taken sanction steps to send a clear message that the coup in Myanmar is unacceptable.“The situation on the ground in Burma is troubling,” she said.The Biden administration has been working closely with its partners in the region, Psaki said.At a separate news conference, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the US is deeply saddened by reports that security forces in Myanmar killed as many as 24 people on March 3.“We strongly condemn the use of violence by Burmese (Myanmarese) security forces against the Burmese people, including peaceful protesters, journalists and civil society. We continue to urge the Burmese military to exercise maximum restraint,” he said.“This latest escalation in violence demonstrates the fact of the junta's complete disregard for their own people, for the people of Burma. It is unacceptable, and the world will continue to respond. The United States will continue to respond; we'll continue to respond in tandem with our partners and allies around the world,” Price said.Tens of thousands of people in Myanmar have courageously taken to the streets peacefully to show the strength of their will and the power of their collective voice, he said.The United States has sought, again with its partners and allies, to amplify the power of their collective voice, Price said.“We call on the military to act peacefully and with respect for human rights, including the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. These are two universal rights that are as applicable in Burma as they are anywhere else,” he said.The United States will continue to work with the international community to take meaningful action against those responsible. There will be additional action on the part of the US, he said.“We support freedom of peaceful assembly, including to protest peacefully in support of the restoration of the democratically elected government,” Price said.Deeply concerned about the increasing attacks on and arrests of journalists, the spokesperson said, calling on the military to immediately release these individuals and to cease their intimidation and harassment of the media and others who are unjustly detained for doing nothing more than their job, for doing nothing more than exercising their universal rights.Responding to a question, Price said that the US has urged China to play a constructive role, to use their influence with the military in Myanmar to bring this coup to an end.The US, he said, has taken a number of actions against the military junta, against the military leaders and military entities responsible for the coup and for related violence, including visa restrictions and asset blocking sanctions.“We will continue and expand our efforts to promote accountability for the military’s actions, including the detention of these journalists and the heinous violence that we've seen in Burma in recent days,” Price added.Myanmar's military last month took control of the country for one year and detained top political figures, including Aung San Suu Kyi.The military accused Suu Kyi's government of not investigating allegations of voter fraud in recent elections. Suu Kyi's party swept that election while the military-backed party performed poorly. The poll officials have rejected the allegations.Many people have been reported killed after security personnel fired at protesters during demonstrations across the country against the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-on-ground-in-myanmar-troubling-white-house-101614933737648.html

Together we can shape a bright future of rejuvenation for our great nation."Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council responded by urging China to begin "benign" interactions with it to gradually resolve disagreements through communication, adding they would continue to defend Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy and freedom."Healthy and orderly exchanges are better than enforced pressure on Taiwan," it said.Most Taiwanese people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, and have also strongly supported anti-government protests in Chinese-run Hong Kong.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected by a landslide last year on a promise of defending the island's democracy and standing up to China.China believes Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for the Chinese government which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Beijing's control.Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-deter-taiwan-independence-seek-peaceful-ties-and-reunification-101614930619694.html
05-03-2021||World||China’s top 20 businessmen-cum-lawmakers are worth a staggering $534 billion||The top 20 richest Chinese businessmen delegates at the ongoing annual meeting of the parliament and its advisory body in Beijing are worth $534 billion, a Chinese wealth tracking group has said.Their personal wealth grew by around 75% last year.As it turns out, the wealthiest in the Communist party-ruled parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), and its advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) – all billionaires -- have grown richer over the last one year despite the economy performing badly due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based wealth tracker, drew up two separate lists of individuals for the NPC and CPPCC, listing 10 each of their richest members. The monitor then combined the two lists to bring out a list of the 10 richest persons.The top 10 wealthiest NPC and CPPCC delegates are worth $391 billion in total, and their wealth grew at an average of 68% in the last one year.They have made their wealth from wide-ranging sources, including internet services, agriculture, green energy, property, consumer electronics, media and automobile, the Hurun report said.Ma Huateng, 50, of Tencent Holdings - owner of WeChat among the company’s massive internet services business - is the richest entrepreneur attending this year’s Two Sessions in Beijing.A member of the NPC, Ma’s personal wealth is $74bn, and year-on-year, it increased by over 94%, the tracker said.Also on the list are Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, NetEase’s Ding Lei, Baidu’s Li Yanhong, and Geely automobile’s Li Shufu.Separately, the top 10 richest NPC delegates are worth $261bn, and they saw their wealth increase at an average of 94% in the last year. The monitor said the top 10 richest CPPCC delegates are worth $273bn, and their wealth grew at an average of 56%.Combining the two figures puts the worth of the 20 richest entrepreneurs attending the Two Sessions, as the twin summits are called, at a staggering $534bn.“From the Hurun Global Rich List 2021 released last week, we can see how China’s entrepreneurs are booming. Today, there are officially 1,058 billionaires living in China, up by 259, significantly ahead of the 696 in the US,” Hurun Report’s chairperson and chief researcher Rupert Hoogewerf said.Beijing is officially the billionaire capital of the world for the sixth year running with 145 billionaires living in the city, while Shanghai overtook New York to second place with 113 billionaires, Hoogewerf said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-top-20-businessmen-cum-lawmakers-are-worth-a-staggering-534-billion-101614930775615.html

It was the third large quake recorded north of New Zealand in a matter of hours. The country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanic and seismic activity that rings the Pacific Ocean.People near the coast in northern areas of the North Island were ordered to move immediately to the nearest high ground or as far inland as possible, as strong currents and unpredictable surges near the shore were expected for several hours.A magnitude 7.1 quake off New Zealand’s east coast was widely felt around the North Island overnight. It was followed by a magnitude 7.4 near the Kermadecs that triggered a tsunami warning. That was later canceled, but the third, larger quake prompted a new warning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-says-tsunami-threat-has-eased-allows-thousands-to-return-home-101614930351306.html

05-03-2021||World||China hikes defence budget to $209 bn, 40% increase in army renumeration to attract more talent||China on Friday hiked its defence budget for the first time to more than USD 200 billion, over three times higher than that of India, maintaining a single-digit growth for the sixth consecutive year with a 6.8 per cent increase in 2021.The hike in defence spending was announced by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on the opening day of the National People’s Congress, China's Parliament, amidst a military standoff with India in eastern Ladakh and growing political and military tensions with the United States.This year's planned defence spending will be about 1.35 trillion yuan (about USD 209 billion), state-run Xinhua news agency reported, adding that the annual defence budget maintains a single-digit growth for a sixth consecutive year.China's defence budget is about one quarter of the US figure, which is USD 740.5 billion for the 2021 fiscal year, it said.Friday’s increase is over three times higher than India’s defence budget of about USD 65.7 billion (including pensions).Last year, China allocated 1.268 trillion yuan (about USD 196.44 billion), according to the state-run Global Times.In his 35-page work report outlining China’s achievements in 2020 and tasks for 2021, premier Li described last year as a “major success” for the armed forces without mentioning China moving over 60,000 well-armed troops who were mobilised for annual exercises, to contentious areas like Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh, prompting India to match the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) mobilisation which led to an over eight-month long standoff.After lengthy rounds of talks, the two sides simultaneously withdrew troops from Pangong Tso area while talks are on for the withdrawal of troops from the rest of the areas.“Last year, major success was attained in the development of national defence and the armed forces. Our people’s forces, with complete competence and fine conduct, safeguarded China’s national security and participated in epidemic control,” Li said in his work report.He also asserted that “absolute leadership” over the two million-strong PLA, the largest in the world, will be vested with the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and its “core leader” and President Xi Jinping who heads the all-powerful Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high command of the PLA.“This year, we will thoroughly implement Xi Jinping’s thinking on strengthening the armed forces and the military strategy for the new era, ensure the Party’s absolute leadership over the people’s armed forces, and strictly implement the system of ultimate responsibility resting with the chairman of the Central Military Commission.“We will, bearing in mind the goals set for the centenary of the People’s Liberation Army, continue to enhance the political loyalty of the armed forces, strengthen them through reform, science and technology and the training of capable personnel, and run them in accordance with the law,” he said.Li said to boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations, and enhance the military’s strategic capacity to protect the sovereignty, security and development interests of the country.“We will improve the layout of defence-related science, technology and industry, and enhance the defence mobilisation system.“We in government at all levels should vigorously support the development of national defence and the armed forces, and conduct extensive activities to promote mutual support between the civilians and the military, so as to forge an ever-closer bond between the people and the military in the new era,” the premier said.The increase of the defence budget, amid massive expansion of the military hardware, including building of more aircraft carriers in addition to the two newly-built ones, also comes amidst the increasing tensions between China and the US over Taiwan and the South China Sea (SCS) besides growing discord between the two over Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.Last year, a key conclave of the CPC had finalised plans to build a fully modern military on par with the United States by 2027, which is also the centenary year of the PLA.The PLA this year has also announced a 40 per cent increase in salaries to attract more talent.China is the second biggest spender of defence after the US.Defending the increase in defence budget, Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the NPC, told the media here that China's efforts to strengthen the national defence do not target or threaten any country.Whether a country poses a threat to others depends on what kind of defence policy it pursues, he said, adding that China is committed to the path of peaceful development and adheres to a defence policy that is defensive in nature.As the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, China's planned defence spending per capita in 2021 will be less than 1,000 yuan (USD 154), the Xinhua report said.China applies strict mechanisms of fiscal allocation and budget management on its defence expenditure, which is mainly assigned to personnel, training and sustainment, and equipment, it said.China has voluntarily downsized its armed forces by over four million troops since 1978, according to a white paper released in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hikes-defence-budget-to-209-bn-40-increase-in-army-renumeration-to-attract-more-talent-101614928177400.html

The election commission said the vote was fair, but the military has used media to make its case and justify the takeover.MRTV pages were banned by Facebook in February, while it had previously barred Myawaddy in 2018 when it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now the military ruler - and more than a dozen other senior officers and organisations on the platform.Facebook has now banned all pages linked to Myanmar’s army - and was itself banned by the junta in February.Other social media platforms are also grappling with how to moderate military content and a proliferation of hate speech and misinformation in Myanmar.Reuters reported on Thursday that Myanmar soldiers and police were using TikTok to deliver death threats to protesters.Researchers have said that after the Facebook ban the military was trying to build its presence on other platforms.YouTube had faced criticism from researchers and civil society groups for a comparatively hands-off approach during Myanmar's Nov. 8 vote.A Reuters review found dozens of channels hosted on YouTube that had promoted election misinformation while posing either as news outlets or political programmes.Google said in December it had terminated 34 YouTube channels following investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-removes-five-myanmar-television-channels-amid-unrest-101614927765495.html

The Kermadec islands region which is around 1,000km from New Zealand was hit by an 8.1 magnitude earthquake.Here is what had happened:> As per the US Geological Survey, the 8.1 magnitude earthquake near the Kermadec Islands, New Zealand was the result of reverse faulting in the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone. The location, depth and style of the faulting indicated its occurrence on or near the west-dipping subducting plate interface between the Pacific and Australia plates.> About 107 minutes prior to the 8.1-quake, a 7.4 magnitude quake had hit 50km west. The proximity and the timing of the 7.4 magnitude earthquake have indicated to be the foreshock of the largest earthquake. The US Geological Survey also said that in terms of seismic moment, the 8.1 magnitude earthquake was 11 times larger than the foreshocks.> A 7.3 oblique reverse faulting earthquake had also hit the country 6 hours prior to the 8.1-quake and 900km south to it. However, as per the US Geological Survey, the changes induced by this quake does not signify any relation with the 7.4-foreshocks or 8.1-earthquake.> The Pacific and Australian plates interaction is behind this one of the most seismically active tectonic atmospheres in the world.> As per the US Geological Survey, over 215 earthquakes greater than the magnitude of 6 have taken place within the 250km radius of the 8.1-quake that hit the Pacific region on Friday.Also Read | Indian-Americans ‘taking over’ US, says Biden on call with Nasa’s Swati Mohan> The Friday quake is considered to be the largest of the century as the previous earthquake with a magnitude of 8 had hit the area in January 1976, which occurred more than 10km to the north. The quake caused no casualties and no damage.> The National Emergency Management Agency had alerted the citizens to get out of their homes and reach a higher surface as a Tsunami warning was sounded.> Emergency Management minister Kiri Allan had asked the residents to evacuate and warned them that the danger can prevail throughout the afternoon.> The National Emergency Management Agency of New Zealand on March 5, 3:43pm (local time) cancelled the national advisory that was issued following the earthquake. It said that as per the GNS Science, the beach and marine threats have now passed for all areas based on ocean observation.> However, the agency has also said that strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges will continue for up to another 24 hours and people should remain vigilant.

05-03-2021||World||Xi Jinping goes mask-free at NPC, raising questions over vaccination status||It’s become a standard photo op of the pandemic: leaders rolling up their sleeves for Covid-19 shots to trumpet the advent of vaccines. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first, Joe Biden did it on live television, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s inoculation is being credited with reviving a lackluster rollout.But despite being one of the first countries in the world to authorize vaccines for use, China has said nothing about the vaccination status of its top leaders, who all -- including President Xi Jinping -- appeared without face masks in Beijing Friday, mingling with thousands of delegates from across China at the country’s biggest political gathering of the year.While officials seated in the rows behind them were all masked, Xi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang moved around the Great Hall of the People, where the National People’s Congress is opened every year, mask-free. The exception seemed to apply only to members of the Politburo and a handful of other top Communist Party leaders. Xi also went without a mask at last year’s NPC, seen as a statement on China’s virus success with the Wuhan outbreak largely quelled.Does Xi’s confidence come from China having all but eliminated Covid-19, or has he received one of the four shots now authorized for general use? Most of the delegates in the Great Hall were probably vaccinated, with state media reporting this week that more than 5,000 of those flocking to Beijing for the so-called twin sessions had been inoculated against the coronavirus.The mystery around Xi and other top leaders’ vaccination status comes as China struggles to ramp up its inoculation drive. The country pushed back by two months a plan to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in February, as concerns about supply and hesitancy around the efficacy and safety of locally-produced shots complicated efforts.While its outbreak is under control, China is way behind the US on vaccinating, according to Bloomberg’s global vaccine tracker. At the current pace it will be more than nine years before 75% of its vast population is immunized, versus six months for the US Government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said this week China plans to vaccinate 40% of its 1.4 billion citizens by the end of June, a mammoth undertaking given it’s only now at 3.5%.Even if they had been vaccinated, a political leader appearing in public without a mask in other parts of the world right now would likely trigger a public outcry. At Biden’s inauguration in January, the incoming president and other senior attendees, including the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court and former presidents, all wore masks through hours of festivities. Biden was vaccinated with the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shot on Dec. 21.US Vice President Kamala Harris, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Indonesia’s leader, Joko Widodo -- who received a Chinese vaccine by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. -- all got shots for the cameras as a way of encouraging people to get vaccinated. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam got the Sinovac shot at a public event in late February.In January, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had taken the vaccine, a revelation that had yet to be confirmed by authorities in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-goes-mask-free-at-npc-raising-questions-over-vaccination-status-101614926453419.html

Over 60 million urban jobs were added, and the world’s largest social security system was established,” said Li.On self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims is a breakaway region, Li said Beijing remains committed “to promoting the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait and China’s reunification”.“We will remain highly vigilant against and resolutely deter any separatist activity seeking Taiwan independence,” Li said. “We will promote exchanges, cooperation and integrated development across the Taiwan Strait. Together, we can shape a bright future of rejuvenation for our great nation.”On Hong Kong, he said China will “resolutely guard against and deter” interference by external forces in the special administrative region’s affairs.He also said that China will ensure the implementation of law and enforcement mechanisms for Hong Kong to safeguard national security, while reaffirming China’s commitment to continue to “fully and faithfully” implement the “one country-two systems” mechanism.China will improve the systems and mechanisms related to implementing the constitution and the basic law in its special administrative regions, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-grow-at-more-than-6-in-2021-defence-outlay-200bn-for-the-first-time-101614921654807.html

Here is all you need to know about the wastage:• It is far more than previously suspected and environmentally, socially and economically costly.• If all the wasted food were packed into 40-ton container trucks parked end-to-end, they would circle the Earth seven times.• UN estimates nearly 700 million people go to bed hungry every night.• Up to now, food waste was seen as a rich world problem. • But the UN Environment Programme’s Sustainable Food Systems Programme’s report showed household food waste is a global problem.• Of the 121 kilos of consumer-level food thrown away each year for every person on the planet, more than half -- 74 kilos -- is disposed of by households.• The report covers three-quarters of humanity and 54 countries -- poor, middle-income and rich -- with good enough data to ensure robust findings.• It is also the first to focus exclusively on what happens to food at the consumer level, rather than food lost during production, storage, or distribution.• The resulting Food Waste Index is designed to help countries take the measure of the problem within their borders, which could also help curb global warming.Also Read | Vice President calls for national campaign to promote healthy lifestyle• If food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet.• Even as efforts to avoid food waste are scaled up, there remains the problem of what to do with whatever unused or unusable biowaste is left over.• The one place it should not go is landfills where it emits the powerful greenhouse gas methane and serves no productive purpose.• There are many alternatives to burying biowaste, including donating food that is still edible, processing it for animal feed, composting, and biogas production.• One technology already operating on an industrial scale in South Africa and elsewhere is the use of black soldier fly larvae to produce protein-rich animal feed.• Rich countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark have acted successfully on food waste.• Britain saw a 31% drop in household food waste over 12 years, excluding inedible matter.• Food waste issues will be addressed at the first-ever UN World Food Systems Summit in September or October.• The summit will provide an opportunity to launch new actions to tackle food waste globally.• One of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/17-of-total-food-available-globally-wasted-in-2019-here-s-what-the-un-said-101614920874897.html
05-03-2021||World||EU, Italy stop AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine exports to Australia||A shipment of more than a quarter million AstraZeneca vaccines destined for Australia has been blocked from leaving the European Union, in the first use of an export control system instituted by the bloc to make sure big pharma companies would respect their contracts.The move, affecting only a small number of vaccines, underscores a growing frustration within the 27-nation bloc about the slow rollout of its vaccine drive and the shortfall of promised vaccine deliveries, especially by Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca.The ban came at the behest of Italy, and the EU did not raise objections to the tougher line Rome has adopted in dealing with vaccine shortages in the bloc since a new government led by Mario Draghi came into power Feb 13.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday it had anticipated veto problems could arise in shipments from Europe, adding that Australia's inoculation schedule would continue as planned.“They are in an unbridled crisis situation. That is not the situation in Australia,” Morrison said. “But, nevertheless, we have been able to secure our supplies, and additional supplies for importation, both with Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which means we can continue the rollout of our program.”He said most significantly, Australia was also producing vaccines domestically, giving it sovereignty over its vaccination program.Italy's objections centered both on the general shortage of supplies in the EU and on “the delays in the supply of vaccines by AstraZeneca to the EU and Italy," a Foreign Ministry statement said.It said it also intervened because of the size of the shipment, more than 250,700 doses, that would go to Australia, which it did not consider a vulnerable nation.Italy said it had informed the company on Tuesday. AstraZeneca refused to comment. The Financial Times first reported on the issue late Thursday.Faced with shortages of doses during the early stages of the vaccine campaign that started in late December, the EU issued an export control system for Covid-19 vaccines in late January, forcing companies to respect their contractual obligations to the bloc before commercial exports can be approved.The EU has been specifically angry with AstraZeneca because it is delivering far fewer doses to the bloc than it had promised. Of the initial order for 80 million doses to the EU in the first quarter, the company will be struggling to deliver just half that quantity.There were rumors that the company was siphoning off from EU production plants to other nations, but CEO Pascal Soriot insisted that any shortfall was to be blamed on technical production issues only.The EU has vaccinated only 8% percent of its population compared to over 30%, for example, in the United Kingdom. Australia is still very much at the start of its vaccination drive.With such an action, the EU is caught in a bind. On the one hand, it is under intense pressure to ramp up the production of vaccines in the bloc while on the other hand it wants to remain an attractive hub for pharmaceutical giants and a fair trading partner to third countries.The EU thought it had made perfect preparations for the rollout of vaccinations, heavily funding research and production capacity over the past year. With its 450 million people, the EU has signed deals for six different vaccines. In total, it has ordered up to 400 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and sealed agreements with other companies for more than 2 billion shots.It says that despite the current difficulties it is still convinced it can vaccinate 70% of the adult population by the end of summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-italy-stop-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-exports-to-australia-101614919314615.html

What an honour this is,” Biden said when Mohan thanked him for the call.The US president added, “This is an incredible honour. And it’s amazing. Indian(s) - of descent - Americans are taking over the country. You, my vice-president, my speechwriter, Vinay. I tell you what.”Biden was referring to Nasa’s Mohan, US vice-president Kamala Harris and the director of the White House speechwriting team, Vinay Reddy, who has been with the American president for years now.Biden might have mentioned the names of a few more Indian-descent members of his administration - actually more than two dozen. Some of them are: Vivek Murthy, the nominee for surgeon general, a position popularly called America’s doctor; Neera Tanden, the nominee for budget chief, a cabinet post, before she pulled out; and Kiran Ahuja, the head of the civil service.Biden then invited Mohan to speak, promising to “be quiet” himself.“So, my path actually started way back when I was a child, watching my first episode of Star Trek,” Mohan said. “In addition to those fantastical scenes of space, what really captured my attention was this really close-knit team who was working together, manipulating this technological marvel with the sole purpose of exploring space and understanding new things and seeking new life.“You know, Perseverance is my first mission at JPL where I’ve gotten to work from the very beginning of formulation, all the way through operations, and it made me feel like I was part of that crew. Being able to work with this incredibly diverse, talented team that has become like a family, spending years creating our own technological marvel has been a privilege.“You know, those last days and weeks leading up to landing-day, it was pretty smooth, but we were all still really nervous and, frankly, terrified until we got through those final seven minutes. To be able to call ‘touchdown’ safely, to see those first images come back from Mars, to see the place where we have never been able to go to on Mars before and go there - reach there for the express purpose of seeking out new life just made it feel like I was living in a dream.“Now that the tremendous relief has passed for the team of being able to be there safely, all that’s left is the excitement and the thrill of all the scientific discoveries that are yet to come and what Perseverance can actually find - and hopefully find those signs of past life on Mars.”“Touchdown confirmed,” Mohan had said over the public announcement system on February 18 that was heard on live telecast around the world, as mission control JPL erupted in applause, with the personnel leaping to their feet.She had gone on to say, “Perseverance safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life.”With those words, Mohan became an overnight sensation.Mohan moved to the US with her parents when she was just one, and grew up in the Northern Virginia/ Washington, DC metro area. She graduated from Cornell University in mechanical and aerospace engineering and did her masters and PhD at MIT in aeronautics and astronautics.Biden said on the Nasa call, “What you did, you restored a dose of confidence in the American people. They were beginning to wonder about us. They were beginning to wonder, are we still the country we always believed we were? You guys did it.”Biden turned his attention to Mohan, without mentioning her, underscoring his focus on diversity. “One of the reasons why we’re such an incredible country is we’re such a diverse country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamericans-taking-over-us-says-biden-on-call-with-nasa-s-swati-mohan-101614919434491.html
05-03-2021||World||Threats to lawmakers spur request for more National Guard help||The head of U.S. Capitol Police on Thursday asked the Defense Department to extend the National Guard presence at the U.S. Capitol, according to a statement from the police force.About 5,000 National Guard troops still on deployment in Washington since the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol were set to return home by March 12. The Capitol Police cited a spike in threats against lawmakers during the first two months of this year in the request for continued support from the Guard.The Capitol Police statement said only that acting Chief Yogananda Pittman asked for the extension without giving a specific timeframe.A new emergency declaration would allow Guard personnel to remain at the Capitol for another two months, according to a person familiar with the request, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. The exact strength or footprint of the Guard during that time could change, but some presence will likely stay in place to allow for a quick response if needed, the person said.Tensions were heightened this week amid warnings of another planned attack on the Capitol Thursday by a right-wing militia group, which did not come to fruition. Nevertheless, the House canceled plans for votes and other events late Wednesday as a result of the threat, which was cited in alerts by the FBI, Homeland Security and Capitol Police. The Senate remained in session.Law enforcement officials from various federal agencies say there are continuing security threats to the Capitol building and lawmakers. In addition to the National Guard forces still deployed at the Capitol, a barrier of fencing and razor wire was established around the complex after a mob of former President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the building on Jan. 6.Robert Salesses, an acting assistant defense secretary, told two Senate committees on Wednesday that military officials do not yet know how long National Guard troops will stay at the Capitol. He said a meeting is planned next week on the subject.During a press conference on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said deployment decisions are up to security officials.But Pelosi added that there is now a draft report of an initial security review headed by retired Lieutenant General Russel Honoré of the Capitol Complex security in the wake of the January assault.Senator Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Rules Committee, said he has talked to Honoré about the recommendations for security at the Capitol, which he understands could include leaving National Guard at the Capitol “quite a bit longer” than two months.Blunt said an extended troop presence could relieve the Capitol Police “from some of their duties that have been overtime and all-time for longer than they should have been.”The Missouri Republican said Guard troops were assigned after Sept. 11, 2001 for what he believes was two years, and they functioned as military police who worked alongside Capitol Police.Blunt also said former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller and former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy should appear before the Rules Committee to explain what he described as “disturbing” testimony from other security officials about delays for National Guard reinforcements to be authorized on Jan. 6 as the attack was underway.“I think they owe it to themselves, frankly, to be here to explain what is wrong with that timeline, and if not, what they were thinking that would have possibly justified the slow action that they took,” he said.Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said it’s “outrageous“ to keep National Guard troops at the Capitol for so long.“It’s outrageous because that’s not their function,” he said. “That’s not what they’re supposed to be. That’s not their mission. We have Capitol Police -- that is their mission.”Rules Committee Chair Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said the National Guard support should stay at the Capitol as warranted by security needs, but “probably at a smaller number.““You want to listen to the law enforcement intelligence about what is safe,“ Klobuchar said.National Guard spokeswoman Darla Torres said there hasn’t been any decision on extension requests. She said that approval would come from the secretary of Defense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threats-to-lawmakers-spur-request-for-more-national-guard-help-101614905955299.html
05-03-2021||World||Capitol riot: Trump can return to YouTube after 'risk of violence' falls||Former US president Donald Trump will be allowed back on YouTube but only when the threat of his inciting violence abates, the head of the popular online video sharing platform said Thursday.YouTube in late January suspended Trump's channel, joining other social media platforms in banning his accounts following the deadly January 6 Capitol riot."We will lift the suspension of the Donald Trump channel when we determine that the risk of violence has decreased," YouTube chief Susan Wojcicki said during a streamed Atlantic Council interview."Given just the warnings by the Capitol Police yesterday about a potential attack today, I think it is pretty clear that that elevated violence risk still remains."Wojcicki said that when the Trump channel is reinstated, it will remain subject to the same "three strike" system as everyone else at YouTube.Uploading videos that break YouTube rules such as those against inciting violence or falsely attacking election integrity would earn the channel more strikes and suspensions.Channels that get three strikes within a 90-day period are removed from YouTube, Wojcicki noted."This was the first strike," she said of the Trump channel."We have applied strikes to over world leaders; (Jair) Bolsonaro in Brazil for Covid-19 misinformation, channels taken down now in Myanmar."Factors considered when assessing when it is safe to allow Trump back on YouTube will include online rhetoric along with concerns expressed by police departments and government agencies regarding risks of politically fueled violence, according to Wojcicki.She felt it important to hold world leaders to the same standards as everyone else on YouTube, reasoning that it is "a very dangerous path to say some people have a free pass" when it comes to breaking content rules.The Google-owned firm has faced criticism over its slow response following the violence in Washington, as well as the proliferation of conspiracy theories on the platform.Trump has been banned from other online platforms including Twitter and Facebook. An independent board created by Facebook is reviewing the decision by the leading social network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-riot-trump-can-return-to-youtube-after-risk-of-violence-falls-101614905723436.html
05-03-2021||World||Dallas police officer charged with arranging 2 killings||A Dallas police officer was arrested Thursday on two counts of capital murder, more than a year and a half after a man told investigators that he kidnapped and killed two people at the officer's instruction in 2017, authorities said.Bryan Riser, a 13-year veteran of the force, was arrested Thursday morning and taken to the Dallas County Jail for processing, according to a statement from the police department. Riser was not listed in online jail records Thursday evening and a lawyer for him couldn't immediately be identified.Riser was arrested in the unconnected killings of Liza Saenz, 31, and Albert Douglas, 61, after a man came forward in August 2019 and told police he had kidnapped and killed them at Riser's direction, police Chief Eddie Garcia said during a news conference. He said investigators don't know the motives for the killings, but that they were not related to Riser's police work.Garcia did not explain why Riser was arrested nearly 20 months after the witness came forward, and police declined to answer subsequent questions about the timing. Riser joined the department in 2008, and Garcia acknowledged that he had been patrolling Dallas while under investigation for the killings.The chief stressed that his homicide division and the FBI were still investigating the killings and said the department was reviewing Riser's arrests.Saenz’s body was pulled from the Trinity River in southwest Dallas on March 10, 2017, with several bullet wounds, the chief said. Douglas was reported missing that year and his body hasn’t been found.Three men were charged with capital murder in the slaying of Saenz: Kevin Kidd, Emmanuel Kilpatrick and Jermon Simmons. Kilpatrick is currently serving life in prison in the killings of a father and son. Kidd and Simmons remain in Dallas County jail on capital murder charges in the deaths of Saenz and the father and son. Simmons is also charged in another death as well.One of the men charged with Saenz’s killing told police that he and Riser were involved in burglaries when they were young, according to an affidavit for Riser’s arrest. It does not identify the man by name.More recently, Riser and the man allegedly hatched a plan to rob drug stash houses, but they didn't follow through with it. Instead, according to the affidavit, the man told investigators that Riser offered to pay him a total of $9,500 to kidnap and kill Douglas and later SaenzBoth were shot and their bodies were dumped in the river, the court states.The affidavit states that Riser told the hired killer Saenz was an “informant.” The document does not elaborate, and police declined to answer questions about whether Saenz had some connection to the department.The murder charges are not the officer's first alleged crimes. In May 2017, Riser faced a domestic violence charge for allegedly assaulting and injuring an ex-girlfriend. It wasn't immediately clear how that case was resolved. Police said Riser “received summary discipline for an incident.”Riser has been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation. Garcia said “we’re going to expedite our process” toward his firing.“We will not allow anyone to tarnish this badge," the chief said.A spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney said her office didn’t have information on the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dallas-police-officer-charged-with-arranging-two-killings-101614905344707.html
05-03-2021||World||WHO investigators plan to scrap interim report of Covid-19 origin probe: Report||A World Health Organization team investigating the origins of Covid-19 is planning to scrap an interim report on its recent mission to China amid mounting tensions between Beijing and Washington over the investigation and an appeal from one international group of scientists for a new probe, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.In Geneva, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email reply: "The full report is expected in coming weeks".No further information was immediately available about the reasons for the delay in publishing the findings of the WHO-led mission to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first human cases of Covid-19 were detected in late 2019. China refused to give raw data on early Covid-19 cases to a WHO-led team probing the origins of the pandemic, Dominic Dwyer, one of the team's investigators said last month, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the outbreak began.The probe had been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.The team, which arrived in China in January and spent four weeks looking into the origins of the outbreak, was limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and prevented from contact with community members, due to health restrictions. The first two weeks were spent in hotel quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-investigators-plan-to-scrap-interim-report-of-covid-19-origin-probe-report-101614905216015.html
05-03-2021||World||Florida governor under scrutiny after Covid-19 vaccine favoritism charges grow||Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state health officials came under deeper scrutiny amid revelations that seniors in a wealthy enclave in Key Largo received hundreds of life-saving vaccinations as early as mid -January, giving ammunition to critics who say the Republican governor is favoring wealthy constituents over ordinary Floridians.The revelations were the latest example of wealthy Floridians getting earlier access to coronavirus vaccines, even as the state has lagged in efforts to get poorer residents vaccinated.DeSantis pushed back Thursday, saying a local hospital — not the state — was behind the vaccinations of more than 1,200 residents of the exclusive Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Florida, and that the state “wasn't involved in it in any shape or form.”Despite the governor's denials of quid pro quos, the charges of favoritism were amplified by the wads of money pouring into the governor's campaign coffers from wealthy benefactors with ties to communities awarded vaccination sites — like the one in Key Largo. One resident of Ocean Reef, Republican former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, last week gave the Florida governor's campaign committee $250,000.Revelations about Ocean Reef residents getting vaccinated were first reported by the Miami Herald.The inequitable distribution of the Covid-19 vaccines is becoming a public relations challenge for the governor. Of the 3.2 million people who have received one or two doses of the vaccines, less than 6% have been Black — about a third of their share of the state's population.Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried joined Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist in calling for federal officials to probe the DeSantis administration’s vaccine distribution programs.“If this isn’t public corruption, I don’t know what is,” Fried said Thursday at a press conference in the Florida Capitol, calling on the FBI's public corruption to launch an investigation.“Give campaign contributions big dollars, get special access to vaccines -- ahead of seniors, ahead of our teachers, ahead of our farmworkers and so many of our residents here in our state of Florida who are scared and who are wanting these vaccines.”Citing reporting from the Herald, Fried noted that DeSantis in February had his biggest fundraising haul since 2018, when he was running for governor.Last week, Crist, a former Florida governor, asked the U.S. Department of Justice to look into possible favoritism in the state's distribution of the vaccines, asserting that DeSantis were benefiting "political allies and donors, over the needs of higher-risk communities and existing county waitlists.”Both Crist and Fried are considering campaigns to oppose DeSantis in next year's gubernatorial election.Other Florida Democrats, including the top Democrat in the state Senate, Gary Farmer, joined in the call for a federal investigation."The exchange of hard-to-get vaccines for political contributions is nothing short of criminal," Farmer said in a letter dashed off to acting U.S. Attorney General Monty Wilkinson.During a Thursday news conference, DeSantis expressed no misgivings about the early vaccinations at the exclusive Key Largo community.“If you are 65 and up, I am not worried about your income bracket," he said. “I am worried about your age bracket because it’s the age, not the income, that shows the risk.”The Republican Party of Florida came to the governor’s defense, calling the controversy “another bogus conspiracy theory.”“It doesn’t matter what party you belong to, whether you are rich or poor, if you qualify for the vaccine, you can get a vaccine. All you need is an arm,” said Helen Aguirre Ferre, the state party’s executive director.The Ocean Reef Club, a senior community in Key Largo, had more than 1,200 homeowners vaccinated through their second dose by late January, according to a message to community members by the management obtained by the Miami Herald.Those vaccinations came at a time when “the majority of the state has not received an allocation of first doses,” the management noted.Officials from Monroe County, home to Key Largo, said the affluent club’s medical center received the vaccines through the Baptist Health hospital as part of the governor’s program to vaccinate communities with a populations of people 65 and older. County spokeswoman Kristen Livengood said the allocations were coordinated through Baptist and the state of Florida.In recent weeks, other reports have surfaced of wealthy retirement communities getting exclusive access to vaccine doses through pop-up vaccine sites. Democrats have criticized him for choosing those places, but the governor’s office has noted that more than half of them have been in Democratic stronghold counties of Broward and Palm Beach. Supporters of DeSantis say he has also coordinated clinics with faith-based groups in underserved areas.Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat and the state's director of the Division of Emergency Management, said the administration is working “diligently” to increase vaccine access in underserved communities.“Any other narrative is intentionally misleading and wrong,” he said in a statement Thursday.After Publix was made the sole distributor of vaccines in Palm Beach County in late January, the mayors of predominately Black farming communities in the area urged the governor to reconsider, and the state set up a vaccine station shortly after.While critics point to disparities in vaccine distributions as a call for more outreach into underserved areas of the state, including in communities of color and impoverished neighborhoods, DeSantis noted that "demand was relatively tepid in FEMA sites in Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. The governor said the four sites had the capacity to administer 12,000 doses but only vaccinated 6,500 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-governor-under-scrutiny-after-covid-19-vaccine-favoritism-charges-grow-101614904208014.html
05-03-2021||World||House OKs George Floyd Act as Democrats avoid 'defund' clash||House Democrats passed the most ambitious effort in decades to overhaul policing nationwide, avoiding a potential clash with moderates in their own party who were wary of reigniting the “defund the police” debate they say hurt them during last fall's election.Approved 220-212 late Wednesday, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is named for the man whose killing by police in Minnesota last Memorial Day sparked demonstrations nationwide. It would ban chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement while creating national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability, and was first approved last summer only to stall in the then-Republican controlled Senate. The bill is supported by President Joe Biden.“My city is not an outlier, but rather an example of the inequalities our country has struggled with for centuries,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who represents the Minneapolis area near where Floyd died.Floyd’s family watched the emotional debate from a nearby House office building and said “defunding the police” is not what the legislation is about.“We just want to be treated equal. We just want to deescalate situations,” said Brandon Williams, Floyd’s nephew. “We want to feel safe when we encounter law enforcement. We’re not asking for anything extra. We’re not asking for anything that we don’t feel is right.”Democrats hustled to pass the bill a second time, hoping to combat police brutality and institutional racism after the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans following interactions with law enforcement — images of which were sometimes jarringly captured on video.But the debate over legislation turned into a political liability for Democrats as Republicans seized on calls by some activists and progressives to “defund the police” to argue that supporters were intent on slashing police force budgets.Though this bill doesn't do that, moderate Democrats said the charge helped drive Democratic defeats in swing districts around the country last November.“No one ran on ‘defund the police,’ but all you have to do is make that a political weapon,” said Teas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar.Republicans quickly revived the “defund the police” criticisms before the vote. “Our law enforcement officers need more funding not less,” Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis.Still, even the House’s more centrist lawmakers, some representing more conservative districts, ultimately backed the bill.“Black Americans have endured generations of systemic racism and discrimination for too long, and this has been painfully evident in their treatment by law enforcement,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash, who chairs the moderate New Democrat Coalition.That endorsement came despite the bill’s prohibitions on so-called qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement from certain lawsuits and is one of the main provisions that will likely need to be negotiated in any compromise with the Senate. Another possible point of contention is provisions easing standards for prosecution of law enforcement officers accused of wrongdoing.Police unions and other law enforcement groups have argued that, without legal protections, fear of lawsuits will stop people from becoming police officers — even though the measure permits suits only against law enforcement agencies, rather than all public employees.California Rep. Karen Bass, who authored the bill, understands the challenge some House members face in supporting it.“My colleagues, several of them, I do not make light of the difficulty they had getting reelected because of the lie around defunding the police,” Bass said.She called provisions limiting qualified immunity as well as those changing standards for prosecution “the only measures that hold police accountable — that will actually decrease the number of times we have to see people killed on videotape.”Civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci released a statement on behalf of the Floyd family saying the House was “responding to the mandate issued by thousands of Americans who took to the streets last summer to raise their voices for change.”“This represents a major step forward to reform the relationship between police officers and communities of color and impose accountability on law enforcement officers whose conscious decisions preserve the life or cause the death of Americans, including so many people of color,” Crump and Romanucci said. “Now we urge the Senate to follow suit.”That may be a taller order. Even though Democrats now control both chambers of Congress, it seems unlikely the bill could pass the Senate without substantial changes to win GOP support.Bass acknowledged the challenges Democrats faced last November — and may likely see again — when former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign and other leading Republicans crowded the airwaves with images of cities around the country burning. But she said those attacks, like much of the opposition to the bill, are built on racism, promoting fears about how “the scary Black people are going to attack you if you try to rein in the police.”“That's as old as apple pie in our history,” she said. “So do you not act because of that?”Still, Bass conceded that changes are likely to come if the measure is to win the minimum 60 votes it will need to advance in the Senate, which is now split 50-50. She said she'd been in contact with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, and was confident he would help deliver some GOP support.Scott said this week that the legislation's sticking points were qualified immunity and prosecutorial standards and that in both areas, “We have to protect individual officers.”“That's a red line for me,” Scott said, adding, “Hopefully we'll come up with something that actually works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-oks-george-floyd-act-as-democrats-avoid-defund-clash-101614903378581.html
05-03-2021||World||Ready to sit in Oppn: Pak PM before key vote||Ahead of a vote of confidence in his government, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Thursday that he was prepared to sit in the opposition in the event of a defeat, but wouldn’t abandon his campaign against corruption.The vote of confidence has been necessitated by Pakistan finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh’s shock defeat in the Senate elections on Wednesday. Shaikh was trounced by former premier Yousaf Raza Gilani, the joint opposition candidate, after lawmakers from Khan’s Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf party broke ranks in the secret ballot.In a televised address to the nation ahead of the vote of confidence in the National Assembly or lower house of parliament on Saturday, Khan appeared to indicate there was a possibility he could lose the crucial vote. He said a loss of power wouldn’t make any difference to his efforts to rid the country of corruption.“These people thought they could hang the sword of no-confidence over me, and because the chair is very important to me, I’d... end all corruption cases against them,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. “I’m seeking a confidence motion [on Saturday]. I’ll go to the [National] Assembly and say, you decide. This will be an open vote and I’m asking all members to exercise their democratic right, and you can say you are not with Imran Khan. I will respect that... and if you win, I’ll sit in the opposition.”After creating an upset in the Senate elections, Pakistan’s opposition parties have retained majority in the upper house of parliament and are now looking to bag the posts of chairman and deputy chairman, for which secret balloting will be held on March 12.The opposition currently has 53 seats in the 100-member Senate, while Khan’s ruling alliance has 47 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ready-to-sit-in-oppn-pak-pm-before-key-vote-101614885818762.html

The rights office had verified 30 of the 38 deaths reported by other UN entities on Wednesday, saying the killings by security forces had taken place in Yangon, Mandalay, Sagaing, Magway and Mon. Since the coup, more than 1,700 people have been “arbitrarily arrested and detained in relation to their participation in protests or engagement in political activity,” the statement said.At least 700 people were detained on Wednesday alone, with many of them reportedly swept up as forces conducted door-to-door searches.Also, the European Union has suspended its support for development projects in Myanmar to avoid providing financial assistance to the military after it seized power last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-tells-military-stop-murdering-protesters-101614885230969.html
05-03-2021||World||Joe Biden pledges deeper ties in Indo-Pacific in national security plan||The Biden administration on Wednesday pledged to a “most robust” military presence in the Indo-Pacific as well as in Europe, asserting the “deepest connection” with the two globally significant regions in a guidance report that outlined President Joe Biden’s national security strategy.The paper, titled “Interim National Security Strategic Guidance”, stated the Biden administration’s aim to “deepen” ties with India as a part of the strategy. The report portrayed an “increasingly assertive” China and “destabilising” Russia as main adversaries confronting the US, but it clearly held the former as the more consequential of the two. China is “the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system”, it said.The US pivot to Asia — in response to and as an acknowledgement of China as a growing threat — started under Barack Obama, and then gathered steam on Donald Trump’s watch with the renaming of the US military’s Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command.It has been taken to a different level by the Biden administration, accorded the same significance as Europe, which has dominated US diplomatic and military thinking and spending for more than a century now, starting with World War I.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a speech hours before the report was released, “The interim guidance lays out the global landscape as the Biden administration sees it, explains the priorities of our foreign policy — and specifically how we will renew America’s strength to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of our time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-pledges-deeper-ties-in-indo-pacific-in-national-security-plan-101614884924197.html
05-03-2021||World||EU reviews Russia’s jab amid fresh spike||The European Medicines Agency has started a rolling review of Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, it announced on Thursday. The regulator said the review is based on results from research in adults, which suggests the vaccine may help protect against the coronavirus.Despite scepticism about Russia’s vaccine, according to a study published last month in Lancet, Sputnik V is 91% effective and appears to prevent inoculated individuals from becoming severely ill with Covid-19.The number of new coronavirus cases has risen in Europe after six weeks of decline, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.“Last week, new cases in Europe rose 9% to just above one million. This brought a promising six-week decline in new cases to an end, with more than half of our region seeing increasing numbers of new infections,” WHO Europe’s regional director Hans Kluge told reporters.“We are seeing a resurgence in central and Eastern Europe. New cases are also on the rise in several western European countries where rates were already high,” he said.The European Commission and Italy have blocked a shipment of AstraZeneca’s vaccine destined for Australia after the drug manufacturer failed to meet its EU contract commitments. Sources said AstraZeneca had requested permission from the Italian government to export 250,000 doses from its Anagni plant. The Italian government refused and the European Commission supported its decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-reviews-russia-s-jab-amid-fresh-spike-101614884640674.html
