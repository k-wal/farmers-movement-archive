I would still encourage individuals to wear a mask, to socially distance."Biden has hailed recent success in distributing vaccines but stressed that Americans should continue to wear masks as his administration tries to quell the soaring death toll and the risk posed by new virus variants."The president is 100 percent behind Doctor Walensky and the CDC's recommendations," White House coronavirus advisor Andy Slavitt said, speaking after Walensky at a coronavirus briefing."I don't think you could possibly be any clearer about the importance and the need for masks. As a leader, it's probably one of the topics he talks about most frequently."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-is-not-the-time-top-us-health-official-warns-against-easing-covid-19-curbs-101614792556158.html

03-03-2021||World||South Africa Covid-19 virus strain 'offers immunity against other variants': Experts||A new study has shown that people previously infected by the Covid-19 variant identified in South Africa have better immunity against other coronavirus mutations, experts said Wednesday.The findings, from yet to be peer-reviewed research by the team of South African scientists who discovered the 501Y.V2 variant, raise hopes that vaccines modelled on the strain could protect against future mutations.Identified late last year, the variant became the dominant strain in Africa's worst hit nation by the pandemic, fuelling the second wave of infection and delaying the start of vaccinations in February.Scientists said Wednesday that plasma collected from people infected with the variant had "good neutralising activity", including against "first wave" viruses and potentially other variants of concern.After the antibodies were tested against the original variant and another identified in Brazil, "results are showing a clear sense of direction", virologist Tulio de Oliveira said in a video conference."The 501Y.V2 can produce a high level of antibodies that can neutralise itself," he said, adding that the immune response outperforms previous variants.Health minister Zweli Mkhize told the same meeting that the discovery was "good news for all" as it presented a huge boost to the control of the pandemic.Only four percent of a sample of 55 patients who had 501Y.V2 failed to neutralise infection from the original coronavirus variant, data presented by the scientists showed.Meanwhile the antibodies were fully effective against the strain identified in Brazil, although only seven patients -- a small number -- were examined in one of the analyses.Coronavirus mutations -- some more contagious -- had put a damper on global vaccination programmes after existing shots were found to offer less protection against them.Manufacturers have in recent weeks raced to tweak their formulas in response to the spread of newer variants.US biotechnology company Moderna last week said it will begin in mid-March a clinical trial of a version of its vaccine specific to the South Africa variant.Top government advisor and leading epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim explained that shots developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna uses mRNA technology to elicit antibody production, and that the recent development bodes well for achieving immunity."These findings are basically telling us that we have a good prospect of success if we make a vaccine based on it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-covid-19-virus-strain-offers-immunity-against-other-variants-experts-101614792064334.html
03-03-2021||World||Water crisis continues in Mississippi after over two weeks since storms||Frustrations are mounting in Mississippi’s largest city, more than two weeks since winter storms and freezing weather ravaged the city’s water system — knocking out water for drinking and making it impossible for many to even flush their toilets.For more than two weeks now, residents in the city of 160,000 have been warned to boil any water that does come out of kitchen taps before using it.“I pray it comes back on,” Jackson resident Nita Smith said. “I’m not sure how much more of this we can take.”Smith has not had water at her house for nearly three weeks now, she said.Smith is concerned about her mother who has diabetes, since not having water makes it difficult to take her medicine. Her mother and most of the other elderly people on her street don’t drive anymore, so she’s been helping them get water to clean themselves and flush their toilets, she said.A key focus of city crews this week is filling the system's water tanks to an optimal level, officials said in an update late Tuesday. Workers are also continuing to fix dozens of water main breaks and leaks throughout the capital city.City officials on Wednesday planned to continue distributing water for flushing toilets at several pick-up points.But they have given no specific timeline for when the crisis will be resolved, nor have they said how many residents remain without water. It is difficult to estimate how many customers remained without water Wednesday, said Michelle Atoa, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office.The crisis has taken a toll on businesses. Jeff Good is co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, and two of them remained closed Wednesday. In an update to his customers posted on Facebook, Good said the businesses have insurance, but he’s concerned about his employees.“We will not be financially ruined,” Good wrote. “The spirits of our team members are my biggest concern.“A true malaise and depression is setting in," he added. “I am staying in touch, keeping them informed of the facts, trying to find the path each day.”Bonnie Bishop, 68, and her husband, Mike, 63, have been without water at their Jackson home for 14 days as both struggle with health problems.She's recovering after a three-and-half-month hospital stay with the coronavirus and back at home but still in therapy to learn how to walk again and deals with constant neuropathy in her hands and feet.She has not been able to soak her feet in warm water, something that usually helps with the neuropathy, or help her husband with gathering water to boil for cooking for cleaning.Mike Bishop just had surgery on his elbow. The first week of the couple was without water, he still had staples in his arm and was hauling five-gallon containers from his truck, his wife said. Bonnie Bishop said she told her husband not to strain himself, but he wouldn’t listen. They need water, and feel like they have no choice.“It’s a lot of wear and tear on the elderly,” she said.On Monday, the couple drove 25 miles (40 kilometers) to Mike’s mother’s house to do laundry.“My greatest concerns are sanitation and hygiene,” Bonnie Bishop said. “I am sure that is everyone’s concern.”Jackson's water system has not been able to provide a sustainable flow of water throughout the city since the mid-February storms, city officials have said.Jackson's water system “has basically crashed like a computer and now we’re trying to rebuild it,” Public Works Director Charles Williams said at a recent briefing.The city's water mains are more than a century old, and needs related to its infrastructure have gone unaddressed for decades, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has said.“We more than likely have more than a $2 billion issue with our infrastructure,” he said.Melanie Deaver Hanlin, who was without water for 14 days, was flushing her toilets with pool water and showering at friends' homes. She said serious updates need to be made to Jackson’s water system.“The problem needs to be fixed, not patched,” she said. “That’s the issue now — poor maintenance for far too long, and Jackson residents are paying the price.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/water-crisis-continues-in-mississippi-over-two-weeks-after-storms-101614791156756.html
03-03-2021||World||Pentagon hesitated on sending National Guard to Capitol riot: US General||The Defense Department took more than three hours to dispatch the National Guard to the deadly riot at the US Capitol despite a frantic request for reinforcement from police, according to testimony Wednesday that added to the finger-pointing about the government response.Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, told senators that the then-chief of the Capitol Police requested military support in a 1:49 p.m. call, but the Defense Department's approval for that support was not relayed to him until after 5 p.m., according to prepared testimony. Guard troops who had been waiting on buses were then rushed to the Capitol.That delay stood in contrast to the immediate approval for National Guard support granted in response to the civil unrest that roiled American cities last spring as an outgrowth of racial justice protests, Walker said. As local officials pleaded for help, Army officials raised concerns about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol, he said.“The Army senior leadership” expressed to officials on the call “that it would not be their best military advice to have uniformed Guardsmen on the Capitol,” Walker said.Meanwhile, the Capitol Police disclosed the existence of intelligence of a “possible plot” by a militia group to breach the US Capitol on Thursday. The revelation, coming as the acting police chief was testifying before a House subcommittee, differed from an earlier advisory from the House sergeant-at-arms that said Capitol Police had “no indication that groups will travel to Washington D.C. to protest or commit acts of violence.”The Senate hearing is the second about what went wrong on Jan. 6, with national security officials face questions about missed intelligence and botched efforts to quickly gather National Guard troops that day as a violent mob laid siege to the US Capitol. Even as Walker detailed the National Guard delay, another military official noted that local officials in Washington had said days earlier that no such support was needed.Senators were eager to grill officials from the Pentagon, the National Guard and the Justice and Homeland Security departments about their preparations for that day. Supporters of then-President Donald Trump had talked online, in some cases openly, about gathering in Washington that day and interrupting the electoral count.At a hearing last week, officials who were in charge of security at the Capitol blamed one another, as well as federal law enforcement for their own lack of preparation as hundreds of rioters, descended on the building, easily breached the security perimeter and eventually broke into the Capitol. Five people died as a result of the rioting.So far, lawmakers conducting investigations have focused on failed efforts to gather and share intelligence about the insurrectionists’ planning before Jan. 6 and on the deliberations among officials about whether and when to call National Guard troops to protect Congress.The officials at the hearing last week, including ousted Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, gave conflicting accounts of those negotiations. Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, told senators he was “stunned” over the delayed response and said Sund was pleading with Army officials to deploy National Guard troops as the rioting rapidly escalated.Senate Rules Committee Chair Amy Klobuchar, one of two Democratic senators who will preside over Wednesday's hearing, said in an interview Tuesday that she believes every moment counted as the National Guard decision was delayed and police officers outside the Capitol were beaten and injured by the rioters.“Any minute that we lost, I need to know why,” Klobuchar said.The hearing comes as thousands of National Guard troops are still patrolling the fenced-in Capitol and as multiple committees across Congress are launching investigations into mistakes made on Jan. 6. The probes are largely focused on security missteps and the origins of the extremism that led hundreds of Trump supporters to break through the doors and windows of the Capitol, hunt for lawmakers and temporarily stop the counting of electoral votes.Congress has, for now, abandoned any examination of Trump’s role in the attack after the Senate acquitted him last month of inciting the riot by telling the supporters that morning to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat.As the Senate hears from the federal officials, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman will testify before a House panel that is also looking into how security failed. In a hearing last week before the same subcommittee, she conceded there were multiple levels of failures but denied that law enforcement failed to take seriously warnings of violence before the insurrection.In the Senate, Klobuchar said there is particular interest in hearing from Walker, the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, who was on the phone with Sund and the Department of the Army as the rioters first broke into the building. Contee, the D.C. police chief, was also on the call and told senators that the Army was initially reluctant to send troops.“While I certainly understand the importance of both planning and public perception — the factors cited by the staff on the call — these issues become secondary when you are watching your employees, vastly outnumbered by a mob, being physically assaulted,” Contee said. He said he had quickly deployed his own officers and he was “shocked” that the National Guard “could not — or would not — do the same."Contee said that Army staff said they were not refusing to send troops, but “did not like the optics of boots on the ground” at the Capitol.Also testifying at the joint hearing of the Senate Rules Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees are Robert Salesses of the Defense Department, Melissa Smislova of the Department of Homeland Security and Jill Sanborn of the FBI, all officials who oversee aspects of intelligence and security operations.Lawmakers have grilled law enforcement officials about missed intelligence ahead of the attack, including a report from an FBI field office in Virginia that warned of online posts foreshadowing a “war” in Washington. Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of the report at the time, even though the FBI had forwarded it to the department.Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the report was disseminated though the FBI’s joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies.Though the information was raw and unverified and appeared aspirational in nature, Wray said, it was specific and concerning enough that “the smartest thing to do, the most prudent thing to do, was just push it to the people who needed to get it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-hesitated-on-sending-national-guard-to-capitol-riot-us-general-101614789343335.html
03-03-2021||World||Prince Philip 'slightly improving': Duchess Camilla on father-in-law's health||Prince Philip is “slightly improving” and the royal family is keeping its fingers crossed for the hospitalized duke's recovery, his daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, said Wednesday.Philip, 99, has been hospitalized since being admitted Feb. 16 to King Edward VII’s Hospital in London, where he was treated for an infection. On Monday, he was transferred to a specialized cardiac care hospital, St. Bartholomew’s, to undergo further treatment alongside testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition.Camilla said during a visit to a coronavirus vaccination center in London that Philip is “slightly improving,” but he “hurts at moments.”“We keep our fingers crossed,” said the duchess, who is married to Prince Charles, eldest son of Philip and Queen Elizabeth II. The comments were reported by broadcasters covering the visit.Buckingham Palace said Monday that Philip was “comfortable and is responding to treatment but is expected to remain in hospital until at least the end of the week.’”The two-week stay is already Philip’s longest-ever stint in hospital.Philip, who retired from royal duties in 2017, rarely appears in public. During England’s current coronavirus lockdown, Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, has been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London, with the queen.Philip married the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and is the longest-serving royal consort in British history. He and the queen have four children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-slightly-improving-duchess-camilla-on-father-in-law-s-health-101614791152421.html
03-03-2021||World||Myanmar security forces kill at least 33 protestors: Reports||Myanmar security forces dramatically escalated their crackdown on protests against last month’s coup, killing at least 33 protesters Wednesday in several cities, according to accounts on social media and local news reports compiled by a data analyst.That is highest daily death toll since the February 1 takeover, exceeding the 18 that the UN Human Rights Office said were killed on Sunday, and could galvanize the international community, which has responded fitfully thus far to the violence. Videos from Wednesday also showed security forces firing slingshots at demonstrators, chasing them down and even brutally beating an ambulance crew.The toll could even be higher; the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent television and online news service, tallied 38 deaths.Demonstrators have regularly flooded the streets of cities across the country since the military seized power and ousted the elected government of leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Their numbers have remained high even as security forces have repeatedly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to disperse the crowds, and arrested protesters en masse.The intensifying standoff is unfortunately familiar in the country with a long history of peaceful resistance to military rule — and brutal crackdowns. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.The Wednesday death toll was compiled by a data analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety. He also collected information where he could on the victims’ names, ages, hometowns, and where and how they were killed.The Associated Press was unable to independently confirm most of the reported deaths, but several square with online postings. The data analyst, who is in Yangon, the country’s biggest city, said he collected the information to honor those who were killed for their heroic resistance.According to his list, the highest number of deaths were in Yangon, where the total was 18. In the central city of Monywa, which has turned out huge crowds, eight were reported. Two deaths each were reported in Salin, a town in Magwe region, and in Mandalay, the country’s second-biggest city. Mawlamyine, in the country’s southeast, and Myingyan and Kalay, both in central Myanmar, each had a single death.As part of the crackdown, security forces have also arrested hundreds of people at protests, including journalists. On Saturday, at least eight journalists, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, were detained. A video shows he had moved out of the way as police charged down a street at protesters, but then was seized by police officers, who handcuffed him and held him briefly in a chokehold before marching him away.He has been charged with violating a public safety law that could see him imprisoned for up to three years.The escalation of the crackdown has led to increased diplomatic efforts to resolve Myanmar’s political crisis — but there appear to be few viable options. It's not yet clear if Wednesday's soaring death toll could change the dynamic.The UN Security Council is expected to hold a closed meeting on the situation on Friday, council diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized the give the information before the official announcement. The United Kingdom requested the meeting, they said.Still, any kind of coordinated action at the United Nations will be difficult since two permanent members of the Security Council, China and Russia, would almost certainly veto it. Some countries have imposed or are considering imposing their own sanctions.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, held a teleconference meeting of foreign ministers on Tuesday to discuss the crisis.But there, too, action is unlikely. The regional group of 10 nations has a tradition of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. A statement by the chair after the meeting merely called for an end to violence and for talks on how to reach a peaceful settlement.Ignoring that appeal, Myanmar’s security forces on Wednesday continued to attack peaceful protesters.In addition to the deaths, there have been reports of other violence. In Yangon, a widely circulated video taken from a security camera showed police in the city brutally beating members of an ambulance crew — apparently after they were arrested. Police can be seen kicking the three crew members and thrashing them with rifle butts.Security forces are believed to single out medical workers for arrest and mistreatment because members of the medical profession launched the country’s civil disobedience movement to resist the junta.In Mandalay, riot police, backed by soldiers, broke up a rally and chased around 1,000 teachers and students from a street with tear gas as gun shots could be heard.Video from the AP showed a squad of police firing slingshots in the apparent direction of demonstrators as they dispersed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-kill-at-least-33-protestors-reports-101614790555500.html
03-03-2021||World||US Police uncover ‘possible plot’ by militia to breach Capitol on March 4||The US Capitol Police say they have intelligence showing there is a “possible plot” by a militia group to breach the US Capitol on Thursday.The revelation was detailed in a statement from the Capitol Police. It comes at the same time the acting police chief is testifying before a House subcommittee.“The United States Capitol Police Department is aware of and prepared for any potential threats towards members of Congress or towards the Capitol complex,” the agency said in a statement. “We have obtained intelligence that shows a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4.”The statement differs from an advisory that was sent to members of Congress by the acting House sergeant-at-arms this week, saying that Capitol Police had “no indication that groups will travel to Washington D.C. to protest or commit acts of violence.”The threat comes nearly two months after thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in a violent insurrection as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden’s electoral win. So far, about 300 people have been charged with federal crimes for their roles in the riot. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died.Capitol Police say that they have stepped up security around the Capitol complex since January's insurrection, adding physical security measures such as the fencing topped with razor wire around the Capitol and members of the National Guard who remain at the complex. The statement said the agency was “taking the intelligence seriously” but provided no other specific details on the threat.The threat appears to be connected to a far-right conspiracy theory, mainly promoted by supporters of QAnon, that Trump will rise again to power on March 4, which was the original presidential inauguration day, until 1933, when it was moved to Jan. 20.Thousands of accounts that promoted the Jan. 6 event that led to a violent storming of the US Capitol have since been suspended by major tech companies like Facebook and Twitter, making it far more difficult for QAnon and far-right groups to organize a repeat of the mass gathering on Thursday.Twitter banned more than 70,000 accounts after the riots, while Facebook and Instagram removed posts mentioning “stop the steal,” a pro-Trump rallying cry used to mobilize his supporters in January. And the conservative social media platform Parler, which many of Trump’s supporters joined to promote false election fraud conspiracy theories and encourage friends to “storm” the Capitol on Jan. 6, was booted off the internet following the siege.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-police-uncover-possible-plot-by-militia-to-breach-capitol-101614790168511.html
03-03-2021||World||Biden signs off on tighter eligibility for $1,400 stimulus checks||President Joe Biden has agreed to moderate Democrats’ demands to narrow eligibility for the $1,400 stimulus payments included in the $1.9 trillion pandemic-relief bill, according to a Democratic aide.Individuals earning over $80,000 now won’t qualify for the payments, compared with a $100,000 cap in the previously drafted legislation, the aide said on condition of anonymity. The ceiling for couples will now be $160,000 against $200,000 before.Democratic Senators including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire had advocated tighter targeting of help to the neediest in the giant Covid-19 assistance package. Their votes will be critical in passing the legislation given the Senate’s 50-50 partisan split and united Republican opposition to Biden’s bill.A separate push by moderates to trim the $400-a-week supplemental unemployment benefits in the bill that the House passed last week to $300 won’t be included in what is initially brought to the Senate floor, according to the aide. The Senate’s so-called managers’ amendment to the House bill is expected to keep the House’s figure, which is a $100-a-week increase from the current level through August.The White House declined to comment.Senate TimelineFor the stimulus checks, phasing out of the $1,400 payments starts at $75,000 per individual and $150,000 for couples, the same as set in the House bill, the aide said.“I think we could drop it below the $200,000 and still provide help to households that still need it,” Shaheen said earlier this week in arguing for changes to the stimulus-check eligibility.It wasn’t immediately clear whether all Senate Democrats have accepted the compromise, although discussions had continued about it into last night. The language Biden approved gives both the moderate and progressive wings of the Senate Democratic caucus one item they wanted in the final negotiations.Biden met with nine moderate Democrats at the White House earlier this week as he sought their support in enacting his first signature piece of legislation.The House version of the aid bill must be tweaked, as some of its elements were found to violate congressional rules; among senators’ tasks is removing the minimum-wage hike and slightly trimming the overall cost.Senate Democrats will proceed with debate on the package once the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation affirm that the managers’ amendment to the House bill qualifies for protections against a filibuster, said a Senate Democratic aide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-off-on-tighter-eligibility-for-1-400-stimulus-checks-101614789211322.html
03-03-2021||World||Ex-PM Gilani's party defeats Pak PM Imran Khan's candidate in senate polls||The 11-party opposition alliance - Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) scored a major victory over Prime Minister Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the Senate polls as former PM Yousuf Raza Gilani won the hotly-contested general seat from Islamabad.Gilani defeated PTI's Abdul Hafeez Shaikh.After the result was announced, Shaikh and Gilani shook hands and hugged each other. The news of Shaikh's defeat was told to him by Zain Qureshi -- who was the minister's polling agent, according to Geo News.Official results announcing Gillani's victory will be announced later, sources said.Geo ancherperson Shahzeb Khanzada termed it a "huge upset" for Imran Khan since he had personally campaigned for Shaikh and had managed to win over most of the government's allies.Senior ministers of the government such as Fawad Chaudhry and Sheikh Rashid had earlier claimed that Shaikh would defeat the former prime minister easily.Analyst Irshad Bhatti also said that it was "huge upset" for the government, adding that his earlier prediction that the former prime minister would lose has been proved wrong, Geo News further reported.Moreover, senior analyst Mazhar Abbas claimed this development was a victory for former president Asif Ali Zardari and a loss for Imran Khan."It was Zardari who urged the PDM to delay the long march and contest the Senate elections," he said, adding that a no-confidence movement against the Prime Minister could be successful.Meanwhile, according to Dawn, Abdul Qadir, Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Muhammad Qasim, Palwasha Khan, Khalida Ateeb, Sarfaraz Bugti, Manzoor Ahmed and Prince Ahmed Umer Ahmedzai have won the elections so far, as per unofficial and unverified results.The polling for 37 seats of Pakistan's Senate came to a close at 5 pm and counting of votes is currently underway as a total of 78 candidates contesting from Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Islamabad.The polls were held after a long-drawn open ballot controversy that kept the ruling party and opposition in a war of words and a legal battle before the Supreme Court on Monday announced that the elections for the Upper House of the Parliament will be held through secret ballot, according to Article 226 of the Pakistan Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expm-gilani-s-party-defeats-pak-pm-imran-khan-s-candidate-in-senate-polls-101614788239421.html
03-03-2021||World||Pak should be on FATF ‘black list’ for role in Afghanistan: Canadian think tank||In a scathing report published by an Ottawa-based think tank, a former Canadian cabinet minister has called for designating Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism and for adding it to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “black list” until it ends its alleged proxy war in Afghanistan. The report, titled “Ending Pakistan’s Proxy War in Afghanistan” and published by Macdonald Laurier Institute (MLI), has been authored by Chris Alexander, who was Canada’s citizenship and immigration minister from 2013-2015 in the Conservative government of then PM Stephen Harper. Alexander was also, from 2003-2009, the first resident Canadian ambassador to Afghanistan and deputy special representative of the UN’s secretary general for the country. He pointed out that the peace process in Afghanistan under President Ashraf Ghani is fading out, and what is considered an “endless war” has a “single underlying cause: Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is waging a covert proxy war in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s aim is to break Afghanistan’s post-2001 constitutional order by installing a Taliban-led coalition to replace the current government, which ISI sees as a stalking horse for India”. Underlining the ISI’s role in Afghanistan, Alexander added, “Without ISI support, the Taliban-led proxy war would end quickly.” Hibatullah Akhundzada currently heads the Afghan Taliban group. Late last month, the Paris-based terror funding watchdog FATF retained Pakistan on its grey list till June to address remaining targets. Pakistan has been on the grey list since 2018 and the FATF has said Islamabad has complied with 24 of 27 actions it was required to make. Alexander made 10 strategic recommendations in the report, including not just listing Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism, but also to “ensure that states enact wide-ranging sanctions against Pakistani officials” supporting extremist groups such as Taliban, al-Qaeda, Haqqani Network. The report also calls for debating the “situation in Pakistan” at the UN Security Council to make it clear that “ISI support for the Taliban and other terrorist groups is a threat to international peace and security. In the MLI’s report, the former Canadian minister also recommended that further talks with the Taliban be suspended pending an “unconditional ceasefire” while also suspending further US and Nato forces’ reduction till that happens and Pakistan’s covert proxy war ends. “The ISI’s clandestine ‘Directorate S’ continues to deliver comprehensive support to these groups, marshalling additional backing as required from other branches of Pakistan’s military and civilian institutions,” Alexander noted. Drawing a parallel to the international sanctions slapped on Russia over its role in Crimea, on Iran and increasingly on China, Alexander argued that to “achieve peace and protect the credibility of international law nearly two decades after the fall of the Taliban regime, every serious partner of Afghanistan now has a duty to enact far-reaching sanctions against those individuals and agencies in Pakistan responsible for this covert proxy war in Afghanistan”. The report also describes the ISI as the “chief spoiler now undermining peace and stability in Afghanistan”, placing at risk gains made over the past two decades since the 9/11 terror attacks in the US. “These achievements are now at risk,” Alexander wrote, due to what he called Pakistan’s policy of “strategic depth” to counter “perceived Indian influence”. That proxy war, Alexander claimed, has cost “at least 124,000 lives” over the last two decades, including 2,355 US soldiers and 167 Canadian military personnel and civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-should-be-on-fatf-black-list-for-role-in-afghanistan-canadian-think-tank-101614788853342.html
03-03-2021||World||ICC probes alleged war crimes in Palestinian territories, Israel condemns decision||The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Wednesday she has launched an investigation into alleged crimes in the Palestinian territories, plunging the court into the midst of one of the most fraught conflicts of the past half century.Fatou Bensouda said in a statement the probe will look into “crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court that are alleged to have been committed" since June 13, 2014, and that the investigation will be conducted “independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor.”Israel swiftly condemned the decision.Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi called it “an act of moral and legal bankruptcy” and said Israel “will take every step necessary to protect its citizens and soldiers from legal persecution.Bensouda said in 2019 there was a “reasonable basis” to open a war crimes probe into Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip as well as Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.Following that assessment, she asked judges to rule on the extent of the court’s jurisdiction in the troubled region. They did that last month, saying that the court’s jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.The Palestinian Authority welcomed Wednesday’s move.“This long-awaited step serves Palestine’s vigorous effort to achieve justice and accountability as indispensable bases for peace,” the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said. It called for concluding the investigation quickly because “the crimes committed by the occupation’s leaders against the Palestinian people are lasting, systematic and far-reaching.”The Palestinians joined the court in 2015 and have long pushed for an investigation of Israel, which is not a member of the court. The Palestinians asked the court to probe Israeli actions during its 2014 war against Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel’s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem.In the past, Israeli officials have accused the court of overstepping its bounds, saying the Palestinians are not an independent sovereign state. Officials say that Israel has been unfairly singled out and reject the allegations. They say military actions in Gaza were acts of self-defense and the status of the West Bank is disputed and must be resolved through negotiations.Bensouda, however, said there is a “reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases.” At the same time, she said the investigation will “allow for a continuing assessment of actions being taken at the domestic level in accordance with the principle of complementarity.”Eugene Kontorovich, director of international law at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative Israeli think tank, said the court’s investigation “is entirely unjustified -- and predictable, given its longstanding lawless bias against the Jewish state.”Israel has also argued that its military justice system is independent and capable of investigating itself. The ICC was set up to deal with crimes in countries where authorities are unable or unwilling to launch meaningful prosecutions.The Palestinians and human rights groups say Israel’s military justice system is biased and routinely whitewashes abuses by soldiers.The investigation will likely also look into alleged crimes by Palestinian militants. Bensouda has said her probe would look into the actions of Hamas, which fired rockets indiscriminately into Israel during the 2014 war.Israel blames Hamas and other militant groups for Palestinian war casualties, saying the militants use residential areas as cover to launch rockets and leave the military no choice but to strike back.Hamas welcomed the initiation of the investigation and called on Bensouda to “resist any pressure” that could scuttle the process.“This is a step forward to implement justice, punish the occupation and do justice to the Palestinian people,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the Associated Press.Asked whether the investigation can also cover rocket attacks by his group, he said that Hamas “is totally certain that its resistance of the occupation is legitimate" under international law.Bensouda said that priorities in the investigation will be “determined in due time” based on constraints including the coronavirus pandemic, limited resources and prosecutors' existing heavy workload.“Such challenges, however, as daunting and complex as they are, cannot divert us from ultimately discharging the responsibilities that the Rome Statute places upon the Office,” she said, referring to the court’s founding treaty.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians claim all three areas for a future independent state, a position that has widespread international support.Israel annexed east Jerusalem, home to the city’s most important religious sites, after the 1967 war and considers it part of its capital. It says the West Bank is disputed, not occupied, and withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The Hamas militant group seized control of Gaza two years later from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.Human Rights Watch welcomed the court's move as a step toward justice for Israeli and Palestinian victims.“The court’s crowded docket shouldn’t deter the prosecutor’s office from doggedly pursuing cases against anyone credibly implicated in such crimes,” said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch.“All eyes will also be on the next prosecutor Karim Khan to pick up the baton and expeditiously move forward while demonstrating firm independence in seeking to hold even the most powerful to account,” Jarrah added. "ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court’s work from any political pressure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/icc-probes-alleged-war-crimes-in-palestinian-territories-101614786045551.html
03-03-2021||World||Former top White House physician Ronny Jackson drank on duty, made sexual comments: Report||US House representative Ronny Jackson made “sexual and denigrating” comments about a female staff and drank alcohol while working as a top White House physician under the previous administrations, according to a report obtained by CNN. The office of the Department of Defense (DoD) inspector general has been investigating Jackson since 2018, particularly after the White House doctor withdrew as President Donald Trump's nominee to run the Veterans Affairs Department following allegations of “hostile work environment" and "drunkenness”.The investigation, which included interviews of 78 witnesses and a review of White House documents, led to the conclusion that Jackson failed to treat his subordinates with dignity and respect, according to CNN. The report has further claimed that the majority of witnesses interviewed as a part of the investigation used words like “meltdowns,” “rages,” “tantrums,” and “aggressive” to describe the physician’s behaviour.The Pentagon report also alleges, per CNN, that the physician, who achieved the position of rear admiral in the US Navy, behaved inappropriately as he consumed alcohol and sleeping medication while on duty. During an overseas presidential trip, Jackson allegedly told a medical subordinate that a female colleague of his had “great t**s” and “a nice a**”, according to CNN citing witnesses. The report is expected to be released by the Pentagon watchdog later on Wednesday.The DoD office of inspector general conducts audits, evaluations, administrative investigations, and overseas contingency operations, providing oversight related to the programs and operations of the Pentagon. The administrative investigations, conducted in the case of Jackson, oversees allegations of misconduct by senior DoD officials.Jackson has reportedly rejected the allegations and accused Democrats of using the report to “repeat and rehash untrue attacks on my integrity.” "I flat out reject any allegation that I consumed alcohol while on duty. I also categorically deny any implication that I was in any way sexually inappropriate at work, outside of work, or anywhere with any member of my staff or anyone else. That is not me and what is alleged did not happen,” Jackson was quoted as saying by Axios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-top-white-house-doctor-drank-on-duty-made-sexual-comments-report-101614782353486.html

Lawyers for the couple, who stepped back as frontline royals last year, told the newspaper they are the victims of a calculated smear campaign based on "misleading and harmful misinformation".The development comes as an interview by the couple with American chat show host Oprah Winfrey is due to be aired over the weekend, with clips showing Harry speak about his late mother, Diana – the Princess of Wales, saying he feared history was "repeating itself" before he and Meghan decided to step back as senior royals.Princess Diana had died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-says-allegations-of-bullying-brought-against-her-false-report-101614783709724.html
03-03-2021||World||Far-right misinformation has more engagement on Facebook: Research||Facebook has emerged as a major source of news consumption in recent years. Since it's launch in 2004, the social media platform has evolved from a simply image sharing and status updating website to go-to point for millennials.The website has seen a lot of user engagement and heated debates over issues which are politically relevant and concern with the lives of the people. And in recent times, Facebook has to deal with misinformation problem.As outrage over the issue grew, the company deployed a series of checks and balances to counter the misinformation campaign. Some of these include labelling of the false claims and reduced visibility in users' feed.But when it comes to political ideology, there is an interesting trend which has been highlighted by the researchers at New York University (NYU) in a recent survey.The researchers identified that accounts which have been labelled far-right by rating agencies generate more engagement - likes, shares and other forms - than any other partisan group. The study also said that far-right misinformation had on average 65 per cent more engagement per follower.This was followed by pages for far-Left publications and then then closer to the centre of the political spectrum.The study has been conducted by Laura Edelson and Ian Goldstein, PhD candidates at NYU, and Minh-Kha Nguyen, a PhD student at Grenoble Alpes University.The researchers based their study on Facebook's CrowdTangle tool and obtained list of pages and public posts from independent data providers and fact-checking websites. Among other criteria, the researchers looked pages with more than 100 followers.The timeframe chosen by the researchers was August 10, 2020 to January 11, 2021. At least 8.6 million pages were downloaded by the researchers to arrive at conclusion, the team said.They also said that content from websites rated as "extreme" garnered more engagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farright-pages-generated-more-engagement-on-facebook-research-101614784514312.html
03-03-2021||World||Saudi Arabia to ship gas to South Korea and take carbon dioxide back||Saudi Arabia plans to ship gas to South Korea where it will be used to make hydrogen, and the carbon dioxide produced in the process will be transported straight back to the kingdom.Hyundai OilBank Co. will take liquefied petroleum gas cargoes from Saudi Aramco which it will then convert into hydrogen, the Korean energy company’s parent Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co. said in a statement. The hydrogen will be used at desulfurization facilities and to power vehicles.The deal signed on Wednesday includes an agreement for the CO2 emitted in the hydrogen-making process to be transported back to Saudi Arabia, according to a Hyundai Heavy spokesman. The gas will then be used in Aramco’s oil production facilities.The Saudi oil major uses carbon dioxide to pump more oil out of the ground in a process known as enhanced oil recovery. Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for more information on the arrangement.The plan hinges on the relative ease of shipping carbon dioxide rather than hydrogen. Carbon dioxide can be shipped as a refrigerated liquid under moderate pressure.“It’s an option to get around the problems of shipping blue hydrogen but still using blue hydrogen in a global market,” said Florian Forster, a consultant at Boston Consulting Group. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas and the carbon dioxide emitted in the process is captured.Aramco shipped its first cargo of hydrogen produced in combination with carbon capture as ammonia to Japan in September. The agreement with HHI differs because the hydrogen will be produced in South Korea, rather than where the natural gas was extracted.“It seems the project will bank on the idea that shipping LPG to Korea and carbon dioxide back to Saudi Arabia will be cheaper than shipping hydrogen to Korea,” said Martin Tengler, BloombergNEF’s lead hydrogen analyst.Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering Co., the shipbuilding arm of Hyundai Heavy, will jointly develop the world’s first vessel that will be able to carry LPG and captured carbon dioxide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-ship-gas-to-south-korea-and-take-carbon-dioxide-back-101614783221340.html
03-03-2021||World||UK to receive 10 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses from India's Serum Institute||The UK will receive 10 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the UK government said on Tuesday.SII, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is mass producing the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, for dozens of poor and middle-income countries."The UK has ordered 100 million doses of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, of which 10 million doses will come from the Serum Institute of India," a UK government spokesperson told Reuters.Reuters reported in February that Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was auditing the manufacturing processes at SII to pave the way for the AstraZeneca vaccine to be shipped from there to the UK.The move is likely to stir concerns that wealthy Western countries are procuring vaccine doses at the expense of poor countries.A slew of low-and middle-income countries ranging from Bangladesh to Brazil are dependent on SII's AstraZeneca vaccine, branded Covishield, but demand has been growing from Western countries.It is also providing doses to the Covax programme backed by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance.The UK government said the agreement follows assurances from the SII that providing doses to the UK would not impact its commitment to provide vaccines to poorer countries.Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency remained concerned, however: "The acquisition by the UK is just another example of how the countries with the highest incomes continue to enjoy privileges at the expense of the poorest ones."Alain Alsalhani, Vaccines and Special Projects Pharmacist with NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres, said he was worried about potential delays."This announcement is a concern as we were under the impression that AstraZeneca would manufacture doses for the UK and Europe in Britain and in the European Union," he said."If SII exports doses to Europe, we can genuinely ask ourselves if AZ and SII delivery timelines to the Covax mechanism in the first half are not going to be subject to delays."Britain has been ahead at inoculating people, with nearly 20.5 million residents receiving the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine so far, according to official data.Separately, the European Union's drug regulator is auditing the manufacturing site of SII, Reuters reported on Monday. AstraZeneca has committed to delivering 180 million doses in the second quarter to the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-receive-10-mn-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-doses-from-india-s-serum-institute-101614783241754.html
03-03-2021||World||California crash kills 13 on route for illegal border crossings||Barely a mile from where an SUV packed with 25 people struck a tractor-trailer — killing 13 inside — a cemetery with unmarked bricks is a burial ground for migrants who died crossing the border from Mexico to remote California desert.Authorities are investigating whether human smuggling was involved in Tuesday's early-morning collision that killed the 22-year-old male driver of the SUV and 12 passengers. The Mexican government said 10 of the dead were Mexican citizens and that nationalities of the three others who died was undetermined.Seats of the 1997 Ford Expedition were removed except for the driver and right front passenger's, said Omar Watson, chief of the California Highway Patrol's border division.The cause of the collision was undetermined, authorities said, and it also was unknown why so many people were crammed into a vehicle built to hold eight people safely. But smugglers have been known to pack people in extremely unsafe conditions to maximize profits.The crash occurred during the height of harvest in California's Imperial Valley, which provides much of the lettuce, onions, broccoli and winter vegetables to U.S. supermarkets. Holtville, a no-stoplight town with a gazebo in its large central square, calls itself the world's carrot capital.The area became a major route for illegal border crossings in the late 1990s after heightened enforcement in San Diego pushed migrants to more remote areas. Many crossed the All-American Canal, an aqueduct that runs along the border and unleashes Colorado River water to farms through a vast network of canals.At the back of Terrace Park Cemetery in Holtville, single bricks — rows of them — mark the unidentified remains of people who died, many of them migrants.In 2001, John Hunter founded Water Station, a volunteer group that leaves jugs of water in giant plastic drums for dehydrated migrants.“I was trying to figure out how to stop the deaths,” said Hunter, whose brother Duncan strongly advocated for border wall construction as a congressman.Illegal crossings fell sharply in the mid-2000s but the area has remained a draw for migrants and was a priority for wall construction under former President Donald Trump. His administration's first wall project was in Calexico.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said late Tuesday that agents in its Homeland Security Investigations unit "have initiated a human smuggling investigation (into Tuesday's crash). The investigation is ongoing and no further details are available at this time.”When police arrived about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of San Diego, some passengers were trying to crawl out of the crumpled SUV while others were wandering around the fields. The rig’s front end was pushed into the SUV’s left side and two empty trailers were jackknifed behind it.“It was a pretty chaotic scene,” said Watson.The Border Patrol said its agents were not pursuing the vehicle.People in the vehicle ranged in age from 15 to 53 and were a mix of men and women, officials said. The driver was from Mexicali, Mexico, just across the border, and was among those killed. The 68-year-old driver of the big rig, who is from nearby El Centro, was hospitalized with moderate injuries.Passengers’ injuries ranged from minor to severe and included fractures and head trauma. They were being cared for at several hospitals. One person was treated at a hospital and released.The crash occurred around 6:15 a.m. under clear, sunny skies at an intersection just outside Holtville, about 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the border. Authorities said the tractor-trailer and its two empty containers were northbound on State Highway 115 when the SUV pulled in front of it from a road with a stop sign.A California Highway Patrol report said the SUV entered an intersection directly in front of the big-rig, which hit the left side of the SUV. Both vehicles came to a halt on a dirt shoulder.It’s not clear if the SUV ran a stop sign or had stopped before entering the highway. Speeds were also unknown.The speed limit for tractor-trailers on the highway is 55 mph (88.5 kph), according to CHP Officer Jake Sanchez. The other road is also 55 mph for vehicles.A 1997 Ford Expedition can carry a maximum payload of 2,000 pounds. If it had 25 people inside, that would easily exceed the payload limit, which taxes the brakes and makes it tougher to steer, said Frank Borris, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation.“You’re going to have extended stopping distances, delayed reactions to steering inputs and potential over-reaction to any type of high-speed lane change,” said Borris, who now runs a safety consulting business.SUVs of that age tended to be top-heavy even without carrying a lot of weight, Borris said.“With all of that payload above the vehicle’s center of gravity, it’s going to make it even more unstable,” he said.The crash occurred amid verdant farms that grow a wide variety of vegetables and alfalfa used for cattle feed. Many workers commute daily from Mexico during the winter harvest, taking buses and SUVs to the fields from downtown Calexico just before dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-crash-kills-13-on-route-for-illegal-border-crossings-101614782684476.html

We have shown that their own members are afraid of the government," Bilawal was quoted as saying by Geo News.As the polling for 37 seats of Pakistan's Senate is underway, the PPP chairman stated that even a single vote more would be a bonus for the party to lead in the elections for the Upper House of the Parliament.Bilawal further remarked that Prime Minister Imran Khan will be 'ousted' with the collective effort of the people and the Opposition."We will get him [Imran Khan] out of here together. PDM is with the people," he said.Taking a jibe at the incumbent government, Bilawal said those who should be winning the elections easily are seen worried about the results. "They are losing, their government is leaving," he said.Polling for the 37 seats of Pakistan's Senate is underway via secret ballot as a total of 78 candidates are contesting from the federal capital and three provinces -- Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.The polls are being held after a long-drawn open ballot controversy that kept the ruling party and opposition in a war of words and a legal battle before the Supreme Court on Monday announced that the polls for the Upper House of the Parliament will be held through secret ballot, according to Article 226 of the Pakistan Constitution.The ruling PTI's numerical strength in the Senate is expected to almost double from the existing 14 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bilawal-bhutto-says-pti-partymen-have-lost-faith-in-imran-101614781306016.html
03-03-2021||World||Data show US companies create less jobs than projected||The number of employees at US businesses rose in February by less than expected, underscoring the labor market’s struggle to recover despite a decline in Covid-19 infections in recent weeks.Company payrolls increased by 117,000 during the month, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for an increase of 205,000. The prior month was revised up to a 195,000 rise.The figures suggest that employment gains are being held back by pandemic-related constraints on businesses and economic activity. Even so, many economists expect a continued improvement in the labor market in the coming months as Covid-19 vaccinations pick up and virus concerns ease.“The labor market continues to post a sluggish recovery across the board,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a statement. “We’re seeing large-sized companies increasingly feeling the effects of Co-19, while job growth in the goods producing sector pauses.”Lawmakers are watching the labor market closely as they consider another economic stimulus bill. President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief package -- which includes an extension of federal unemployment benefits -- passed the House of Representatives on Saturday and the Senate is expected to vote on the legislation as soon as this week.The data precede Friday’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which is forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 200,000 in February, following a gain of just 6,000 in the prior month.The gain in employment was led by services, which rose by 131,000, the ADP data showed. Payrolls at goods-producing businesses, meanwhile, decreased by 14,000, led by manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-show-us-companies-create-less-jobs-than-projected-101614779757577.html

Our relationship has become an ‘all-weather strategic cooperative partnership’,” Qureshi wrote in a Chinese state-run paper.India and China in 2019 had announced a list of 70 events to mark 70 years of the establishment of Sino-India ties in 2020.The celebrations never took off, at first because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and then because of the military standoff which broke out in May.In the case of China and Pakistan, however, the celebrations have already begun: On Tuesday a logo was unveiled during the Wang-Qureshi event, which, it was said, epitomises the historic nature of Pakistan-China ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-and-pakistan-to-hold-100-events-to-mark-70-years-of-bilateral-ties-101614781472974.html

An emergency issued for up to 10 other urban prefectures later in January was lifted last week, underscoring the government’s eagerness to allow businesses to return to normal as soon as possible.“Our anti-infection measures are in a very important phase,” Suga told reporters Wednesday. “In order to protect people’s lives and health, I think we need to extend (the state of emergency) for about two weeks.”Tokyo is to host the Olympics, delayed by one year because of the virus, starting July 23.The state of emergency centers around asking restaurants, bars and other businesses to voluntarily close at 8 p.m. Japan has never had a mandatory lockdown, but has managed to keep infections relatively low. Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike and the heads of neighboring prefectures have raised concerns that a lifting of the emergency this weekend could trigger a quick rebound in infections.Daily new cases in Tokyo have decreased significantly after peaking at about 2,000 in early January, but the decline has slowed recently. Tokyo on Wednesday reported 316 new cases, up from 232 the day before, raising its total to 112,345. Nationwide, Japan reported more than 434,000 cases and about 8,000 deaths as of Tuesday.Suga said he will consult with experts and prefectural leaders and make a final decision quickly. He said medical systems in the region are still burdened with Covid-19 patients and more hospital beds have to be freed up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-mulls-extension-of-coronavirus-emergency-in-tokyo-101614778136943.html
03-03-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine deliveries to African nations pick up speed||More African countries received the long-awaited first deliveries of Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday, with Kenya and Rwanda benefiting from the global Covax initiative that aims to ensure doses for the world’s low-and middle-income nations.African and other health officials have been frustrated with the sight of a handful of rich countries rolling out vaccines after snapping up large amounts for themselves.“We will be known as the continent of Covid” if Africa doesn’t quickly reach its target of vaccinating 60% of its population of 1.3 billion people, the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said last week. The continent last month surpassed 100,000 confirmed deaths.So far Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Angola and Congo also have received their first vaccine doses via Covax, with several other countries including Mali, Senegal, Malawi and Uganda set to receive them this week.Rwanda is becoming the first African nation to receive the Pfizer vaccine via Covax. The vaccine needs storage at ultra-cold temperatures, making rollout complex in hot countries and rural areas, for example.Covax has faced delays related to the severely limited global supply of vaccine doses as well as logistical issues.And Covax alone will not supply Africa’s 54 countries with the doses needed to reach the 60% population coverage for achieving so-called herd immunity, when enough people are protected through infection or vaccination to make it difficult for a virus to continue to spread.That's why some countries such as South Africa, the hardest-hit African nation, are also pursuing Covid-19 vaccines via bilateral deals or via the African Union's bulk-purchasing program.Despite the various challenges, some health officials expressed jubilation as the first vaccine doses via Covax arrived.“We have been fighting the pandemic with rubber bullets but what we have acquired today is equivalent, metaphorically speaking, to bazookas and machine guns,” Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said.Kenya received 1.02 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. The minister said the vaccines will be administered to some 400,000 medical workers and the rest will go to other front-line workers such as teachers and police officers.“This first shipment of 1 million vaccines is part of an order of 3.5 million to Kenya,” UNICEF spokesman Andrew Brown told The Associated Press.Kenya, East Africa’s commercial hub, has more than 106,000 confirmed virus cases including more than 1,800 deaths. Many health workers for months have been disgruntled over the inadequate supply of personal protective equipment. They also say they were never paid the allowances that the government promised them for the extra work and risk while combating Covid-19.Rwanda received 240,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with 102,960 Pfizer doses expected later Wednesday. The health ministry said these first doses will target front-line workers, those above 65 and people with underlying health conditions.Health Minister Daniel Ngamije said Rwanda’s goal is to vaccinate 30% of the population by the end of this year, and 60% by the end of 2022.Rwanda has recorded 19,111 cases and 265 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-deliveries-to-african-nations-pick-up-speed-101614777515914.html
03-03-2021||World||SOS call to local paper saves 81 Rohingya at sea, but no country to take them in||Denis Giles, the editor of a small Indian newspaper, received a phone call as he sat typing in his one-room office in Port Blair overlooking the languid waters of the Andaman Sea.The caller, Mohammed Siddiqui, was frantic and largely incoherent. Giles said he was about to hang up until he heard, in broken Hindi: "Please help me... Many people may die."Siddiqui pleaded with Giles to spread the word of dozens of Rohingya Muslims fleeing Bangladesh for Malaysia aboard a crippled fishing boat in the Andaman Sea. Eight of the passengers had already died."You can help me save lives," Siddiqui told Giles, who publishes the English-language Andaman Chronicle, which has been covering news in India's coral reef-fringed Andaman and Nicobar archipelago for more than 15 years.Siddiqui's brother and the other Rohingya passengers had paid human traffickers to smuggle them to Malaysia from cramped refugee camps in southern Bangladesh that are home to more than a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.Siddiqui, who lives in Australia, told Reuters that he learned of the fate of the vessel after his brother made an SOS call from a satellite phone on board the boat on Feb. 18, roughly a week after it embarked on the voyage from Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh."No one knew of the boat until the engine developed a snag and it drifted near Indian waters," Siddiqui said. "That was when I got to know that my brother was stuck on a boat with 80 survivors and that eight were dead due to extreme dehydration or hunger."Siddiqui said he tried to reach the Bangladesh Coast Guard and other agencies."There was just no response. Finally I decided to call some journalists and based on the GPS coordinates I realised the only person who could help was someone based in the Andaman Islands," Siddiqui said.Favoured DestinationHundreds of thousands of Rohingya were forced to flee their homeland after a crackdown by Myanmar's military in 2017. Myanmar denies accusations of genocide and says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign.The Rohingya are a minority group, most of whom are denied citizenship by Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Muslim-majority Malaysia has been a favoured destination for fleeing Rohingya. Many risk the perilous sea journey in rickety boats despite Malaysia saying last year it would no longer accept them.Siddiqui, who was given the coordinates by the fishing boat captain, passed them to Giles, who was the first person to call the Indian Coast Guard to alert them. That was Feb. 19."I told them people are dying they must send ships to help them but Indian officials instead suggested I send them details via email," said Giles.He fired off an email with the coordinates of the boat that was adrift roughly 235 km (150 miles) northeast of Port Blair, said Giles in an effort to explain the urgency.Giles, who published a story about the refugees on Feb. 21, said he only received a call from the coast guard on Feb. 23 to inform him that a rescue was under way.The Indian Coast Guard and Navy did not respond to requests for comment on the rescue operation."The Sea is not their home"But while the boat has been located, the fate of the passengers remains far from certain.India's foreign ministry confirmed the boat had been found and that two Coast Guard ships were helping those on board and repairing the vessel so that it could return safely to Bangladesh.But Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen last week told Reuters his government expects either India, the closest country, or Myanmar to take it in.Aid agencies are demanding that governments stop passing the buck and act."The law of the sea equally binds all states to come to the rescue of persons in distress at sea and deliver them to a place of safety," said Catherine Stubberfield, an Asia-Pacific spokeswoman for the UNHCR."This applies regardless of nationality, legal status, or circumstances in which people in distress are found."New Delhi has not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them, nor does it have a law protecting refugees.Giles said he feels relieved the refugees are at least getting help for now, along with food, water and medicine."I hope the Rohingya receive a warm welcome from a country at the earliest," said Giles. "The sea is not their home."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sos-call-to-local-paper-saves-81-rohingya-at-sea-but-no-country-to-take-them-in-101614775384498.html
03-03-2021||World||China kicks off its politically significant annual Parliament season||China on Wednesday began its politically significant annual Parliament season, amid mounting political and economic challenges in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and the growing adversity with the US over a host of issues including, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.The gathering of China’s political elite is taking place ahead of this year's centenary celebrations of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and increasingly assertive leadership of President Xi Jinping.Xi, 67, has established himself as the most powerful leader after Mao Zedong with prospects of life-long tenure in power following scrapping of two-year tenure rule for the Presidency.Every year in March, the full sessions of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s parliament and the advisory body the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) hold their sessions with full members totalling over 5,000 legislators and advisors.The CPPCC will begin its week-long session from Thursday which will be attended by Xi and other leaders while the NPC kicks off its meeting from March 5. The political season began on Wednesday with a nationally televised press conference by its spokesman.During this year’s meeting, the NPC, often described as a rubber stamp parliament for its routine approval of the CPC proposals, is set to endorse the 14th Five Year plan and the plan for Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.While the 14th Five-Year plan envisages a massive overhaul of the country's domestic market to boost consumption in order to reduce China's reliance on shrinking exports markets, the Vision 2035 visualises a long-term plan, reflecting the development vision outlined by president Xi.China’s status as a world’s factory has been affected by declining global markets and the trade war initiated by former US president Donald Trump, followed by his successor Joe Biden as well, by his move to ban of Chinese tech firms like Huawei, TikTok and restrictions on exports of semiconductor chips to China deepening the technology conflict between top two world economies.The relations between the US and China are at an all-time low. The two countries are currently engaged in a bitter confrontation over various issues, including trade, the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the communist giant's aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea and human rights violations in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.China is also expected to increase about seven per cent of its defence budget which last year was 1.268 trillion yuan (close to $200 billion), according to report in state-run Global Times. It is over three times higher than India’s defence budget of $47.4 billion.Security as well as Covid-19 monitoring has been increased in Beijing ahead of CPCC and NPC sessions.Last year, the two sessions were held in May instead of March due to a coronavirus outbreak. This year only, Beijing-based foreign correspondents were invited to cover the proceedings mostly through video links due to Covid-19 restrictions.Correspondents covering the events should undergo coronavirus tests every day before attending the events.Though China is exporting its coronavirus vaccines to different countries, the Chinese leadership is yet to get vaccinated. Reports say delegates attending the parliament sessions were being inoculated.Answering a question at the press conference about China's pursuing Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy, CPCCC spokesman Guo Weimin said China’s exports of vaccines to expand geopolitical clout is a narrow-minded view.China has always put the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines first, Guo said. So far China has administered 52 million vaccine doses of vaccines to people at home. Some foreign leaders have taken Chinese vaccines as well, he said.China has also provided vaccines to 69 countries and two international organisations, and exported vaccines to 28 countries, Guo said.On criticism about the recent announcement by President Xi that China eradicated absolute poverty, he said, "experts said China's poverty alleviation standard is a comprehensive one and higher than the World Bank's standard of $1.90 per day. The basic living needs of the rural population are met.""Despite the remarkable achievement pocketed in poverty alleviation cause, China's development remains unbalanced and inadequate, hence the country is poised to consolidate the gains of poverty alleviation and press ahead with the rural revitalisation strategy," he said.On the imposition of national security law in Hong Kong, much against the wishes of local people, he said the purposes of adopting and implementing the law on safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and improving its electoral system are both to uphold and improve the "one country, two systems" and to ensure its steady and sustained development in a right direction, he said.He also decried calls for boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics over allegations of genocide in Xinjiang against Uighur Muslims as "futile"Attempts to politicise sports games and disturb and sabotage the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are futile and doomed to fail, he said.The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games is scheduled to be held from February 2022 in Beijing and towns in the neighbouring Hebei province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-kicks-off-its-politically-significant-annual-parliament-season-101614776603321.html
03-03-2021||World||Israel allocates $60 million to build first quantum computer||Israel is seeking to build its first quantum computer, joining a global race for one of the world’s most important emerging technologies.The Ministry of Defense and Innovation Authority are taking bids from multinational companies, Israeli businesses and universities for a 198 million-shekel ($60 million) project to build a computer with 30 to 40 qubits, according to Aviv Zeevi, vice president at the Authority’s Technological Infrastructure Division. He expects the winner of the tender to begin work before the end of the year.“We want to be in the game,” Zeevi said. “We need to be at least at a reasonable level to be able to develop” varying kinds of hardware and software associated with quantum computers.Rather than storing information in binary 0s or 1s, like classical computers, a quantum computer’s qubits can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously, which translates into an exponential edge in computing power. In 2019, Google said that its quantum computer solved a problem in minutes that would take the fastest supercomputer about 10,000 years.The new project is part of Israel’s 1.25 billion shekel national initiative to build up quantum proficiency. While scientists say practical, widespread applications for quantum computers are still years away, countries like China, the U.S. and Germany are devoting large sums to figure out how to master this technology.Israel is a tech powerhouse that’s home to several dozen so-called unicorns, or privately owned tech firms worth over $1 billion. But there are only a handful of quantum computing startups, such as the software firm Classiq Technologies and Quantum Machines, which develops hardware and software for quantum computers.The government initiative “is a massive first step,” said Itamar Sivan, chief executive officer of Quantum Machines. “Our hope is that with continued investments we can grow the burgeoning quantum ecosystem here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-allocates-60-million-to-build-first-quantum-computer-101614776339811.html

Pyongyang does not recognise the U.N. investigator's mandate and has previously rejected U.N. allegations of crimes against humanity committed by the state.Reduced trade with China has led to a significant decrease in market activities, reducing earnings for many families reliant on small-scale market activities, Ojea Quintana said."There have been shortages of essential goods, medicines, agricultural inputs for farming and raw materials for state-owned factories," he said, voicing concern that typhoons and floods last year could lead to a "serious food crisis"."Deaths by starvation have been reported, as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them."Humanitarian operations have nearly ground to a halt and only three international aid workers remain in North Korea while relief goods have been stuck at the Chinese border for months due to import restrictions, he said.North Korea is to receive 1.7 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via the COVAX facility by the end of May, allocation figures from the GAVI vaccine alliance and World Health Organization (WHO) showed on Tuesday.Ojea Quintana urged Pyongyang to grant full access for medical and aid workers involved in Covid-19 vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-measures-to-stem-covid-19-worsen-abuses-hunger-says-un-expert-101614773920892.html
03-03-2021||World||India led the world in internet shutdowns in 2020: Report||India led the world last year in internet shutdowns that affected hundreds of millions of people, as governments cracked down on political rivals and tried to suppress protests.At least 155 internet shutdowns in 2020 disrupted access for people in 29 countries, according to a report on Wednesday from digital rights group Access Now. That included 28 full internet blackouts that plunged people and in some cases entire cities, into “digital darkness,” the report said. Most recorded incidents took place in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.“The pandemic has forced offline activities online. So when governments intentionally disrupt internet access it denies people the opportunities to continue their education, businesses, and access life-saving information about the pandemic,” said Access Now campaigner Felicia Anthonio.The digital rights campaign says governments in 2020 increasingly used shutdowns in response to ongoing violence, especially in conflict zones. Other trends in recent years include efforts to hide political instability, thwart protests and suppress dissent, it said.India RecordIndia consistently restricts access more than any other country, accounting for the lion’s share in 2020 with at least 109 disruptions, according to the report. The next highest was Yemen with six shutdowns. Indian authorities cut off access and throttled bandwidth to quell demonstrations in recent years, including protests over a controversial citizenship law after it revoked the special autonomous status of Kashmir. Most recently, tens of thousands of protesting farmers blocked highways in defiance of the government’s decision to restrict phone and Internet access.India’s Supreme Court in January ruled that indefinite internet shutdowns in Kashmir were illegal following a legal challenge from civil society groups. The government has argued shutdowns were necessary to prevent disorder, curb fake news and hate speech.Authorities in Ethiopia imposed at least four full outages, including a nationwide shutdown that lasted more than two weeks and affected more than 100 million people, the report said. A mobile network disruption in Myanmar’s Rakhine and Chin states lasted 19 months. Following a coup in February 2021, Myanmar’s junta restored access in the region, but has since ordered new blackouts as it seeks to quell protests.High CostsDisruptions overall fell last year to 155 from 213 in 2019, reversing recent trends, the Access Now report said.But major disruptions in 2020 lasted 49% longer compared with the year before, according to digital privacy and security research group Top10VPN. They cost the world economy $4 billion, nearly three quarters of which was incurred by India alone, it said.“Internet shutdowns violate human rights and they are being used against marginalized groups around the world,” said Anthonio. “Switching off the internet means a total disruption of daily activities, their rights and their lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-led-the-world-in-internet-shutdowns-in-2020-report-101614772298279.html

This to us was incredible.”The variant, identified in South Africa late last year, has taken over as the dominant strain in the nation of 60 million people and has spread to 48 other countries. Initial evidence suggests it’s 50% more transmissible than the original virus and has led to countries including the UK banning flights from South Africa.Much of the research was done by Krisp, a genetic-sequencing institute in Durban, South Africa. The research did show that antibodies generated in reaction to infections with the original virus were as much as 48% less effective against the new variant, according to data presented on the webinar.“This is indeed good news for all of us,” South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said.A small trial of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine indicated that it had limited effect on preventing mild disease from infection with the 501Y.V2 variant, leading the government to switch to Johnson & Johnson’s shot for its initial vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-variant-found-in-south-africa-paves-way-for-better-vaccines-101614771874226.html

03-03-2021||World||Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates bet on electric motor startup||As much as half of the world’s electricity is consumed by motors. They power everything from fans to electric cars and pumps to industrial machinery. Making them more efficient could go a long way in reducing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.That’s the promise of California-based startup Turntide Technologies Inc., which has commercialized a new type of electric motor. The company said on Wednesday it has raised $80 million from investors including a fund led by Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates, Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr., and co-creator of the iPhone Tony Fadell. Electric motors convert electricity into motion by using electromagnets to generate magnetic fields that turn a rotor around a shaft. That simple turning motion, depending on the size of the motor, can blow fallen leaves or bend sheets of metal.But in conventional motors, much of the magnetic field is wasted and doesn’t contribute to turning the rotor. Turntide has found a way to try and maximize that conversion by turning the magnets inside the motor on and off as often as 20,000 times a second. When the process works correctly, the motor can produce the same amount of work with up to 30% less electricity. The design of the motor dates back to 1838, said Turntide Chief Executive Officer Ryan Morris. But the fine control needed to run it efficiently had to wait until computer chips got cheap enough to run the programs.That’s what Downey likes about the technology, beyond its ability to cut emissions. “They figured out how to use a 19th century technology and use software to make it do what it always had the potential to do,” he said in an interview.Morris describes the product as “software wrapped in metal.” That’s why the company is able to outsource the manufacturing to India, China and Taiwan, but still control the intellectual property needed to run the motor efficiently.Turntide is currently focused on a niche market. It replaces the old electric motors in ventilation systems in large buildings. The cost savings from reduced electricity use means it can promise a return on investment in as little as three years. By the end of 2020, Turntide had replaced 5,000 such motors and aims to do 50,000 this year.Next, Turntide is exploring the application of its motors in pumps and compressors. Ultimately, the company’s biggest market is likely to be electric cars, though achieving the performance that electric motors in cars demand will take a few years of development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-downey-jr-and-bill-gates-bet-on-electric-motor-startup-101614770923730.html

Hartig, the museum’s director. “His humanitarianism and dedication truly exemplify what it means to be a Great American."The museum asked Fauci to contribute a personal artifact to mark the pandemic, and he chose the lumpy blue and orange ball that he used to explain the complexities of the virus in dozens of interviews.The model was made with a 3D printer and shows what the Smithsonian’s announcement calls “the various components of the SARS-CoV-2 virion (the complete, infectious form of the virus), including the spike protein.”Fauci showed off his new medal in a video call Tuesday night, calling it “an extraordinary and humbling” honor.“This has been a terrible year in so many respects,” he said. “Decades from now, people will be talking about the experience that we went through.”Fauci, 80, is the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. After serving as the beleaguered and frequently sidelined face of the Trump administration's Covid response, Fauci was retained as a senior adviser to President Joe Biden.The Great Americans Medal was founded in 2016. Previous honorees include former secretaries of state Madeleine K. Albright and Gen. Colin L. Powell, tennis star Billie Jean King and musician Paul Simon.Fauci received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian award, in 2008 from then-President George W. Bush for his decades of work, dating back to the earliest days of the AIDS crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-presents-his-personal-3d-model-of-covid-19-virus-to-smithsonian-101614768886690.html

The infection has so far killed more than 43,000 people in Texas.This was announced by Texas governor Greg Abbott said Tuesday despite a urgent warning to states from federal health officials to not let their guard down, saying the pandemic is far from over. The repeal will take effect from March 10, announced Abbott.The enforcement of the mask mandate was patchy, and some sheriffs refused to police the restrictions at all. There were reports that authorities only warned the violators verbally, or left informational flyers.The opponents of the mask mandate said that wearing them infringed upon their rights, like making personal judgements about what represented an acceptable risk to self. Other said it infringed on constitutional rights."I believe in our constitutional rights, and this is borderline infringing on some of those constitutional rights in my belief," Jason Bridges, a sheriff in Nacogdoches County, Texas, was heard saying in a Facebook video which had become widely popular on social media.Meanwhile, restaurant owners are discussing whether they, too, would relax Covid-19 safeguards in their dining rooms that were already allowed to be almost fully open after Abbott's latest order. School administrators are also scrambling to figure out the ramifications for the state's 5 million public school students.At Bob’s Steak & Chop House in Dallas, founder Bob Sambol welcomed the ability to make decisions for his own restaurant again, even though he has not decided what approach he'll take. “I have a week, thank God," Sambol said.Texas is fully reopening just ahead of the spring break holiday, which health experts worry could lead to more spread.Abbott’s rollbacks come just as the US is picking up the pace of vaccinating people. In Texas, 7.1 per cent of its nearly 30 million residents have been fully vaccinated, according to state data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mask-mandate-implementation-was-patchy-in-texas-now-locals-concerned-101614769002366.html
03-03-2021||World||London mayor Sadiq Khan tightens emission rules, buses stare at heavy fines||The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has tightened the city-wide Low Emission Zone (LEZ) rules, which means that heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), buses and coaches that fail to meet emissions standards will be hit with a daily charge of up to 300 pounds.The new standards, Euro VI (NOx and PM), apply to heavy vehicles across most of Greater London and match the emission standards of the central London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ).The LEZ, which operates 24 hours a day and every day of the year from this week, was set up to encourage the most polluting heavy diesel vehicles driving in the UK capital to become cleaner.“Toxic air pollution causes long-lasting harm and is a national public health crisis. In London it contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. There is also evidence linking air pollution with an increased vulnerability to the most severe impacts of COVID-19,” said Khan.“I've moved fast in London to implement the most ambitious plans to tackle air pollution of any major city in the world – showing what we can achieve if we are brave enough,” he said.The date for enforcement of the tougher standards was delayed from October 2020 in the face of the pandemic and its impact on supply chains using such vehicles.New data from City Hall, the Mayor’s office, shows compliance with the new standards is nearly at 90 per cent, compared to around 70 per cent in May 2019.Earlier this year, Transport for London (TfL) announced that their entire 9,000-strong core bus fleet complies with the LEZ standards, and now meets or exceeds the cleanest Euro VI emissions standards.Alex Williams, TfL’s Director of City Planning, said, “Toxic air in London is a blight on the city and we need to take bold action to clean it up. The introduction of these tighter standards for heavy vehicles and the expansion of the ULEZ will significantly reduce harmful emissions within the M25.“We have been working closely with the freight industry to prepare them for the launch of a stronger Low Emission Zone. They have responded magnificently, showing their commitment to a green recovery, with the vast majority now meeting these world-leading environmental requirements.”The introduction of tougher standards for the LEZ, alongside the planned expansion of London’s ULEZ later this year, is expected to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from road transport by around 30 per cent across London in 2021.City Hall says it will help deliver wider benefits for London, including preventing more than 1 million air pollution related hospital admissions over the next 30 years, saving the National Health Service (NHS) around 5 billion pounds.The latest in a series of reports evaluating the impact of the central London ULEZ shows that, even throughout the pandemic, compliance standards remained high.Compliance with the ULEZ at the end of December 2020 was more than 90 per cent for cars and 85 per cent for all vehicle types. This compares to 39 per cent compliance in February 2017 when the T-charge, the precursor to the ULEZ, was announced by the Mayor of London, and Londoners started preparing for the ULEZ.The report also shows that the scale of reduction in NO2 in central London in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic was similar to the reduction driven by the city's air quality programme between 2017 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-tightens-emission-rules-buses-stare-at-heavy-fines-101614768650503.html

Francis will visit the former Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, where churches still bear the signs of conflict."The people of Iraq are waiting for us. They were waiting for St. Pope John Paul II, who was not allowed to go. The people cannot be let down for a second time. Let us pray that this trip can be carried out well," he said.Francis will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham, who is revered by Christians, Moslems and Jews, and meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, 90."In the land of Abraham, together with other religious leaders, we also will take another step forward in fraternity among believers," Francis said.Al-Sistani is one of the most important figures in Shi'ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond. He commands a vast following among Iraq's Shi'ite majority and huge influence over politics and public opinion.About 10,000 security forces will be deployed to protect the pope, who will mostly likely be travelling in armoured vehicles.The number of people who will be able to see him has been severely limited because of coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-says-he-must-go-to-iraq-because-people-cannot-be-let-down-101614768295421.html

KiliAvo has challenged that in Kenya's environmental tribunal, where the case is pending, according to CM Advocates LLP, the law firm representing them.The agency's acting director general Mamo Mamo told Reuters it initially approved the EIA because of the project's endorsement by the Amboseli Ecosystem Trust, a coalition that includes community groups and government representatives, but changed its position when the Trust withdrew approval.Fruit Exports V Tourist CashWith ideal conditions for growing the fruit, Kenya's avocado export revenues surged 33% to 14 billion Kenyan shillings (about $127 million) in the year to October 2020, government data shows.As impressive as that growth rate is, such money pales in comparison to tourism, which raked in $1.6 billion in 2019. Squeezing the elephants could hit their population, conservationists say, harming a national heritage and also prejudicing the tourism trade so many people depend on."We can’t just say to the elephants: 'Would you mind not going that way because we have decided that we are going to do stuff here?'" said Vicki Fishlock, a scientist working for the Amboseli Elephant Trust group."Blockage of the corridor would surely kill the sanctuary as it depends on the animals migrating from Amboseli," added Samuel Kaanki, who chairs an association of 342 Maasai owning 20,500 acres where elephants browse, breed and migrate.He said the elephants, if blocked by farms like KiliAvo's or others, would seek alternative routes: "This would ... result in massive human-wildlife conflicts."KiliAvo's lawyers said the farm was actually 17 km (11 miles) away from Amboseli in an area designated for farming. Further, the company had employed 300 local residents, provided training and technology, proposed improving fresh water facilities and helped renovate a school, CM Advocates LLP said."Our Client continues to be the victim of constant and relentless harassment and mischaracterization of their project for ulterior motives," it said in an email to Reuters. "Our Client is actually a victim of witch-hunt and opportunism."Another conservation group, Big Life Foundation, has footage from October of four gazelles apparently stuck on one side of the fence, trying to get through. It also said the fence was damaged at least three times last month by elephants."If they are trapped in one place, populations will collapse," said Ernest Lenkoina, human-elephant conflict mitigation project manager at Big Life. "In the end, both the Maasai way of life here and the sight of elephants browsing beneath Mount Kilimanjaro could be gone forever."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avocados-threaten-to-usher-in-massive-human-wildlife-conflicts-in-kenya-101614766404682.html

Significant pressure was exerted on foreign journalists and sources seeking to report on the pandemic itself," the report said.In some cases, Chinese officials gave journalists a choice: Leave instantly or be quarantined for at least 14 days. In other cases, journalists were forced to take repeated Covid-19 tests, a delay tactic to prevent them from working.The respondents described exchanges during this approval process in which Chinese authorities hinted that permission to return hinged on more favourable coverage of China. The press group further said the Chinese government propaganda is claiming that the coronavirus originated abroad and was brought into China."As a result, fears that foreigners pose dangerous health risks have subjected correspondents to growing xenophobia, making it more challenging for them to live and work in China," the report added.Furthermore, the introduction of mandatory coronavirus checkpoints and contact tracing apps has created more opportunities for Chinese authorities to gather data on foreign journalists and their sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-using-covid-19-pandemic-to-increase-restrictions-for-foreign-journalists-101614765993849.html

So, they asked Musk if this new city will incorporate the Boca Chica Village area, where his company is building its futuristic deep-space rocket."An area much larger than Boca Chica," Musk said replying to the Twitter user.An area much larger than Boca ChicaSome people in Texas say the move is part of Musk's plan to change the name of Boca Chica, the area near the Mexican border where SpaceX’s new Starship prototypes dominate the seaside skyline.“Sending a tweet doesn’t make it so,” Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. “They have a lot of hoops and hurdles to go through before they can make it so,” he added.Trevino also said that a SpaceX representative made a “casual inquiry” recently about requirements to incorporate Boca Chica and rename it the City of Starbase.Musk has chosen Texas for his ambitious plan to build rockets to make human space travel more affordable and routine. But SpaceX has been trying to fix the issues which led to two failed rocket launches in recent months.Starship SN9 rocket, the company's latest attempt to go into deep space, exploded during a landing attempt minutes after a high-altitude experimental launch from Boca Chica.

Recorded Future calls the group RedEcho and says it had targeted as many as 10 entities under India’s power grid as well as two maritime ports when the company first notified India’s Computer Emergency Response Team on Feb. 10. Most of these connections were still operational as recently as Feb. 28, Solomon said.“There’s still an active connection between the attacker and the attackee,” Solomon said, referring to the port. “It’s still happening.”A spokesman for India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology wasn’t immediately available for comment. “Without any proof, slandering a specific side is irresponsible behavior and an ill-intentioned one,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in Beijing on Wednesday.The intrusions into India’s critical infrastructure have been occurring since at least the middle of last year, according to Recorded Future, which tracks back to the start of a bloody skirmish between Indian and Chinese soldiers at a border post in the Himalayas.Since then, authorities across India’s federal and state governments have been bickering about whether a cyberattack was responsible for the October collapse of the power grid that supplies Mumbai, an outage that brought the financial hub to a halt for several hours, impacting stock markets, transport networks and thousands of households.Watch | ‘Yes, it’s possible’: Cyber security expert on China hand in Mumbai outageRecorded Future, a privately held cybersecurity firm based near Boston that tracks malicious activity by nation-state actors, hasn’t made any connection or assertion between the traffic observed under RedEcho and the Mumbai outage. But, Solomon said, “it’s not unusual to see this type of technique used by nation states as an instrument of national power.”“This could be as simple as trying to drive influence operations to be able to signal either to the people or the government that at any given time they have leverage that can be used against them,” he added.Indian federal officials have denied that any cyberattack has occurred, but say malware was found. The National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre emailed the central Power System Operation Corp. about the threat from RedEcho on Feb. 12, the Power Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. Dispatch center employees shut down control functions that allow circuit breakers to be operated remotely. They changed user credentials and isolated vulnerable equipment.Investigators from Maharashtra state, which houses Mumbai, are due to present their findings to local lawmakers on Wednesday.Regarding the Mumbai power outage of Oct. 12, initial information suggested 14 Trojan Horses, that is malicious code, and 8 gigabyte of unaccounted foreign data could have been transferred to the main electricity board, Anil Deshmukh, Maharashtra state’s home minister, said in a briefing on Monday. He added that black-listed IP addresses had tried to log-in to the board’s servers. He didn’t attribute the attack to any country or entity.The 10 entities RedEcho infiltrated account for nearly 80% of India’s land mass from an electricity-coverage perspective, Solomon said. The intrusions could have remained unexposed and undetected until they were needed as leverage, he said.“If it was meant to take down the lights, it would have taken down the lights,” Solomon said. “It didn’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-hackers-still-actively-targeting-indian-port-in-shadow-war-says-us-firm-101614766351260.html

The country remains closed to non-resident foreigners.A Reuters poll published last month showed nearly two-thirds of Japanese companies also oppose holding the Games as planned, swinging from the previous survey showing most in favour.Japan has so far confirmed 431,250 coronavirus cases and 7,931 deaths as of Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-plans-to-ban-olympic-spectators-from-abroad-over-covid-19-fears-report-101614764909705.html

The aviation sector has been hit hard due to the travel restrictions imposed by governments around the world to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), prompting airlines to devise different strategies to tackle the challenges.Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) on Monday released preliminary traffic figures for January 2021 that showed the airline operations were “still depressed” as the spread of coronavirus variants resulted in tighter border restrictions. AAPA said that Asia Pacific airlines carried a combined total of 1.3 million passengers in January, which was less than 4 per cent of January 2020 numbers.“The industry is working with several stakeholders to prepare the ground for the sustained resumption of air travel, notably on contactless digitalized tools and passenger facilitation protocols to ensure a safe and seamless journey for travelers,” AAPA director general Subhas Menon said in a statement.Read | IndiGo flight to Lucknow makes emergency landing at Karachi airport as flyer takes illIn an attempt to boost domestic travel, the Australian flag carrier has now announced three mystery flights, each from different cities, that will take the travellers to a destination not known to them beforehand.

Niamrin found the vomit while taking a stroll along the beach after a rainstorm, washed up on the coast of Nakhon Si Thammarat province in southern Thailand.When Niamrin inspected the mass, she found that it smelled like fish. Unaware of what the mass was, she brought it back home with her. After speaking to her neighbors, she discovered that the oval-shaped mass was whale vomit which is also called ‘ambergris’.Niamrin’s neighbor then informed her that the smell emanating from the almost 15lb weighing mass could indicate that it’s a genuine piece of ambergris, hence, to check its authenticity, they held a naked flame to the 12 inches wide and 24 inches long mass which caused it to melt and then harden again after cooling down.Now, Niamrin is waiting for experts to visit her house to confirm whether the ambergris is genuine or not.According to a report in Daily Mail, Niamrin said that if the mass turns out to be genuine ambergris, she would help her community with the money she gets.Ambergris, the treasure of the seaAmbergris, a solid waxy substance which originates in the intestine of the sperm whale, is used for medicines and potions and as a spice in eastern cultures. In western cultures, the same substance is used to stabilize the scent of fine perfumes. Ambergris often floats and washes ashore on the coasts of China, Japan, Africa, and the Americas and on tropical islands such as the Bahamas. Fresh ambergris is black and soft and has an unpleasant odour. When it is exposed to sun, air, or seawater, this substance hardens and changes colour, fading to light gray or yellow and in this process develops a pleasant fragrance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lucky-haul-thai-woman-finds-lump-of-whale-vomit-worth-over-250000-101614764260339.html
03-03-2021||World||US president Biden vows enough Covid-19 vaccines for all US adults by May-end||President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the US expects to take delivery of enough coronavirus vaccines for all adults by the end of May, two months earlier than anticipated, as his administration announced that drugmaker Merck & Co. will help produce rival Johnson & Johnson's newly approved shot.With the bolstered supply, Biden also announced he would be using the powers of the federal government to direct all states to prioritize vaccinating teachers, and said the federal government would provide the doses directly through its pharmacy program.He challenged states to administer at least one dose of the vaccine to all educators by the end of March as part of his administration's efforts to reopen more schools across the nation."We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May," said Biden, who likened the partnership between the two drug companies to the spirit of national cooperation during World War II.Biden's twin announcements quickly raised expectations for when the nation could safely emerge from the pandemic with the promise of additional vaccines, but it highlighted the looming challenge facing the nation: successfully putting those doses into arms.Even as he expressed optimism, Biden quickly tempered the outlook for a return to life as it was before the virus hit."I've been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don't know for sure," Biden said, before saying his hope was sometime before "this time next year."Biden's speech was set against the backdrop of states across the country moving to relax virus-related restrictions. This comes despite the objections of the White House and the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who have raised alarm about new variants of the virus and pleaded against any relaxation of virus protocols until more Americans are vaccinated.In Texas, GOP Governor Greg Abbot moved to lift his state's mask-wearing mandate and a host of other limitations. Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer eased capacity limits on restaurants and both public and residential gatherings.Fauci has previously said the nation must achieve a vaccination rate of about 80 per cent to reach "herd immunity." Only about 8 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the pace of vaccination has been increasing, with the US setting a new daily record for injections on both Thursday and Friday of last week.In hopes of increasing vaccinations even further, the Biden administration told governors to make preparations to administer even more doses in the coming weeks.More shots are also heading toward the federally backed program to administer doses in retail pharmacies, which federal officials believe can double or triple their pace of vaccination. More than 800,000 doses of the J&J vaccine will also be distributed this week to pharmacies, on top of the 2.4 million they are now getting of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine supply.Those pharmacies will be key in getting the vaccines into the arms of teachers — particularly in the roughly 20 states where they have not been prioritized for shots — which will help reopen schools to better educate students who have been at risk of falling behind during the pandemic and reduce the burden on parents who have had to choose between childcare and a job."Let's treat in-person learning as the essential service that it is," Biden said. Teachers will be able to sign up directly through the participating retail pharmacies in their local area, the administration said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki also announced Tuesday that the federal government was increasing supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to states next week to 15.2 million doses per week, up from 14.5 million previously. States will also receive 2.8 million doses of the J&J shot this week.On a call with governors Tuesday, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said states should prepare for administering 16-17 million total weekly doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of March, climbing to 17-18 million weekly by early April. The supply of J&J doses to states, expected to dip after the initial shipment this week, will climb to 4-6 million weekly doses by the end of March and 5-6 million doses weekly through the end of April.Officials have said J&J faced unexpected production issues with its vaccine and produced only 3.9 million doses ahead of its receiving emergency use authorization on Saturday. The company has promised to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June.Before the approval of the J&J shot, Biden had suggested that it would take until the end of July to have enough vaccine for every adult in the US.Facing questions about the company's slipping delivery schedule, J&J Vice President Richard Nettles told lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week that the company had faced "significant challenges" because of its "highly complex" manufacturing process.The assistance from Merck was expected to help J&J meet its production commitments and expand supply even further, but the administration did not immediately provide specifics. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-vows-enough-covid-19-vaccines-for-all-us-adults-by-end-of-may-101614738807211.html

03-03-2021||World||Swiss to vote on banning face veils in referendum criticised as Islamophobic||"Stop Extremism!" urges a red billboard in a quiet village outside Zurich above an image of a scowling woman wearing a black headscarf and face veil.The billboard is part of a campaign by the far-right Swiss People's Party (SVP) to ban face coverings in public and which will be voted on in a binding national referendum on Sunday. Opinion polls suggest most Swiss will back it and the ban will become law."In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms," said Walter Wobmann, an SVP member of parliament and chairman of the referendum committee.The proposal predates the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seen all adults forced to don masks in many settings to prevent the spread of infection. It gathered the necessary support to trigger a referendum in 2017.It does not mention Islam directly, and also aims to stop violent street protesters and football hooligans wearing masks. Still, local politicians, media and campaigners have dubbed it the burqa ban.The proposal compounds Switzerland's tense relationship with Islam after citizens voted to ban building any new minarets in 2009. Two cantons already have local bans on face coverings.Wobmann said the vote was not against Islam itself, but added, "the facial covering is a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland."France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public.No one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates. Muslims make up 5.2% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people, with most having their roots in Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo.Swiss Muslims have said right-wing parties were using the vote to rally their supporters and demonise them and others have warned a ban could stoke wider divisions."The niqab is a blank sheet which allows people to project their fears onto it," said Andreas Tunger-Zanetti, manager of Lucerne University's Centre for Research on Religion."But ... you are very unlikely to meet someone on a Swiss street wearing one."He said a ban risked cementing Switzerland's image as anti-Islamic and could create resentment amongst some Muslims.Rifa'at Lenzin, 67, a Swiss Muslim woman, said she was totally against the ban, which was tackling a problem which didn't exist, in a country where Muslims were well integrated."Changing the constitution to tell people what they can and cannot wear is a very bad idea.. This is Switzerland, not Saudi Arabia.""We are Muslims but we are Swiss citizens who have grown up here too," Lenzin said. "This vote is simply racist and Islamophobic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-to-vote-on-banning-face-veils-in-referendum-criticised-as-islamophobic-101614762685280.html
03-03-2021||World||Nine killed as Myanmar police opens fire to disperse protests||Myanmar security forces shot and killed nine people during protests against the military coup on Wednesday, witnesses and media reported, a day after a regional diplomatic push to end the month-long crisis made little headway.Two people were killed during clashes at a protest in the country's second-biggest city Mandalay, a witness and media reports said, and one person was killed when police opened fire in the main city of Yangon, a witness there said.The Monywa Gazette reported five people were killed in that central town in police firing. One person was shot and killed in the central town of Myingyan, said student activist Moe Myint Hein, 25."They opened fire on us with live bullets. One was killed, he's young, a teenage boy, shot in the head," Moe Myint Hein, who was wounded in the leg, told Reuters by telephone.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.The violence came a day after foreign ministers from Southeast Asian neighbours urged restraint but failed to unite behind a call for the military to release ousted government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy.At least 30 people have been killed since the coup on Feb. 1, which ended Myanmar's tentative steps towards democratic rule, triggering nationwide protests and international dismay.The security forces also detained about 300 protesters as they broke up protests in Yangon, the Myanmar Now news agency reported. One activist said several protest leaders were among those taken away.Video posted on social media showed long lines of young men, hands on heads, filing into army trucks as police and soldiers stood guard. Reuters was not able to verify the footage.Protesters were also out in Chin State in the west, Kachin State in the north, Shan State in the northeast, the central region of Sagaing and the south, media and residents said."We're aiming to show that no one in this country wants dictatorship," Salai Lian, an activist in Chin State, told Reuters.'NO MORE WORDS'On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to make a breakthrough in a virtual foreign ministers' meeting on Myanmar.While united in a call for restraint, only four members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore - called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees."We expressed ASEAN's readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner," the ASEAN chair, Brunei, said in a statement.Myanmar's state media said the military-appointed foreign minister attended the ASEAN meeting that "exchanged views on regional and international issues", but made no mention of the focus on Myanmar's problems.It said Wunna Maung Lwin "apprised the meeting of voting irregularities" in November's election.The military justified the coup saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 elections were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second five-year term. The election commission said the vote was fair.Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has said the intervention was to protect Myanmar's fledgling democracy and has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday in an interview the coup was a "tragic" step back for Myanmar and the use of lethal force by its security forces was "disastrous".ASEAN's bid to find a way out of the crisis has drawn criticism from inside Myanmar, with concern it would legitimise the junta and not help the country."No more words, action," activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters in a message when asked about the ASEAN effort. She called for sanctions on businesses linked to the military.Tuesday evening's news bulletin on Myanmar state television said agitators were mobilising people on social media and forming "illegal organisations".Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.She is one of nearly 1,300 people who have been detained, according to activists, among them six journalists in Yangon, one of whom works for the Associated Press, which has called for his release.Ousted President Win Myint is facing two new charges, his lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said, including one for a breach of the constitution that is punishable by up to three years on prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nine-killed-as-myanmar-police-opens-fire-to-disperse-protests-101614762620437.html
03-03-2021||World||Beijing refutes allegations of sexual abuse made by Uyghur women: Report||As the number of Western lawmakers accusing China of genocide grows, Beijing is focusing on discrediting Uyghur witnesses behind the recent report of sexual abuse, reported FR24 News.Earlier in February, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) had reported on the abuses of women's rights in Xinjiang's 're-education camps' where women were subjected to sexual abuse, modern-day slavery and forced sterilization.To refute the report, during a regular daily press briefing last week, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin held up images of witnesses who described sexual abuse in Xinjiang.China also released explicit details about Uyghur women's fertility, sex and STDs as part of a campaign to combat global pressure on their treatment of the minority group, reported FR24 News.Chinese authorities named women, leaked what they say is private medical data and information about women's fertility, and accused some of having affairs and another of having a sexually transmitted disease.The campaign included briefings lasting several hours, with images of residents of Xinjiang and statements by family members refuting charges of sexual abuse.James Millward, professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University and expert on Xinjiang politics, said, "One of the reasons the Communist Party is so concerned about these testimonies from women is that it undermines the premise. Initial of what they are doing there, this is the fight against terrorism?""The fact that there are so many women in the camps... who don't have the slightest appearance of being violent people just shows how far it has nothing to do with terrorism," added Millward.In January, the Chinese Embassy's Twitter account was suspended for a tweet saying Uyghur women were "baby-making machines" before Beijing set up its camp system, reported FR24 News."The biological, reproductive, and gendered aspect of this is especially horrible to the world," said Millward. China "seems to have recognized this ... Now you see them trying to respond in this awkward way."Meanwhile, China declined to provide data on the number of people in the camps. Beijing had initially denied the very existence of the camps, but now claims that they are educational and vocational centers and that everyone has "graduated."Uyghurs make up most of the one million people who the UN estimates have been held in camps in Xinjiang as part of what the central government calls a campaign against terrorism.Also, Beijing has rejected calls for an independent UN investigation into Xinjiang's internment program. Journalists and diplomats are not allowed access to the camps outside of tightly controlled government tours.Joe Biden's administration has called China's treatment of Uyghurs genocide, a position recently adopted by Canada and the Netherlands.China faces sanctions such as a ban on US purchases of cotton and tomatoes from Xinjiang and calls from some Western lawmakers to boycott the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-refutes-allegations-of-sexual-abuse-made-by-uyghur-women-report-101614762483046.html
03-03-2021||World||EU months away from issuing vaccine passports for travel, memo shows||The European Union is still months away from issuing Covid-19 immunity certificates, raising the risk of another lost tourism season for the bloc’s aviation and hospitality industries.Technical work on a digital platform to authenticate travelers’ health status could take three to four months, according to a briefing note circulated to national delegations in Brussels on Tuesday. Beyond that, there are legal hurdles, the challenge of agreeing the scope of the program, and resolving thorny medical questions.The system being developed by the European Commission would confirm holders have recently tested negative, been fully vaccinated, or recovered from the coronavirus and are thus presumed to be immune.But EU member states are at loggerheads over the use of the “status certificates,” with tourism-dependent economies like Greece pushing for rapid introduction to allow for the return of travel and other activities like dining out, at least for a segment of the population. France and Belgium have resisted, citing concerns including privacy and fairness.Industry PainAirlines and hotels have also been clamoring to ease restrictions which have only been tightened over the past several months, even as vaccine rollouts progress. The International Air Transport Association last week said airlines could burn through $95 billion this year, double an earlier forecast, while passenger traffic could be limited to as little as one-third of pre-pandemic levels.“Testing, supported by digital apps and contact tracing, are all part of the solution,” Gloria Guevara, head of the World Travel & Tourism Council said last week. The group spans hotels and airlines, as well as airports, tour operators and companies like cruise lines, car rental services and travel agents.The EU has been working on technical aspects of the certificate with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization.The memo seen by Bloomberg is asking the bloc’s member states to provide feedback before the commission unveils a legislative proposal later this month. Among the issues that still need to be resolved is whether the certificates will be used to facilitate travel within the EU, and what it will mean for journeys from outside the bloc.Travel TensionOne risk for the EU is that tourism-dependent members would grow impatient and strike their own bilateral arrangements with outside countries, endangering unity. Last month, Greece and Israel reached a deal on mutual recognition of jabs. Greece is also in talks with the UK, the US, and Russia, “with various degrees of progress,” Greek Tourism Minister Harry Theoharis said last week.“Of course we hope the EU can work together as one and remove the need for bilateral discussions and agreements,” Theoharis said on a Bloomberg travel panel.The bloc also needs to establish a common approach to “proof of recovery” from Covid, according to the memo dated March 2. It’s unclear for how long a person who has survived the illness is immune to reinfection, and whether the body will be resistant to emerging variants of the virus.Vaccine RaceEU member states are racing to inoculate their populace and tame the spread of the pandemic before vaccine-resistant mutations take hold. But the rollout is lagging far behind the US and the UK.With the vast majority of the world’s population yet to be inoculated, and the virus still spreading and mutating, the bloc is preparing a “coordinated response in the event that a new variant of the virus would spread across Europe, especially if it were a vaccine-resistant variant.”The internal memo urges member states to “pre-agree on the range of emergency measures that may need to be taken in such a case, as regards testing, quarantine,” as well as travel restrictions.The commission is already working on agreements with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of the bloc’s member states, for the purchase of booster shots or new vaccines that will offer protection from emerging variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-months-away-from-issuing-vaccine-passports-for-travel-memo-shows-101614761828239.html

03-03-2021||World||Microsoft says China-linked group targets exchange email||Microsoft Corp. is urging customers to download software patches after state-sponsored hackers based in China broke into some customers’ copies of its software for email, contacts and calendar using multiple previously undiscovered flaws.The attackers used the vulnerabilities to hack into Microsoft Exchange Server, allowing them to break into email accounts and install malware to “facilitate long-term access to victim environments,” Microsoft said Tuesday.Microsoft released patches for the flaws in a blog post announcing the attack. “Microsoft has detected multiple 0-day exploits being used to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server in limited and targeted attacks,” the blog said.Previously undiscovered vulnerabilities are known as zero days, and they are valuable to hackers because there aren’t defenses against them -- at least until they are discovered and patches are created.“We are sharing this information with our customers and the security community to emphasize the critical nature of these vulnerabilities and the importance of patching all affected systems immediately,” the company said. It added that on-premise systems were affected but the online version of Exchange wasn’t.The hackers responsible are “a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China,” according to the blog. They typically target “entities in the United States across a number of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in a regular press briefing Wednesday in Beijing that conclusions on hacks into Microsoft servers should be based on complete evidence and avoid wanton accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-says-china-linked-group-targets-exchange-email-101614761776158.html
03-03-2021||World||Pakistan to enact legislation to fully implement FATF action plan: Report||Pakistan will have to enact additional laws to facilitate action by authorities to apprehend and prosecute people involved in terror financing in order to fully implement the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) action plan. This was decided at a meeting of senior officials chaired by Pakistan’s finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh to review anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing efforts in the aftermath of FATF’s plenary meeting last month. At the conclusion of the plenary meeting on February 25, FATF retained Pakistan in its “grey list” and asked the country to complete the action plan to counter terror financing before June, including steps to investigate and prosecute individuals and entities involved in such activities. Also Read | Terror financing watchdog keeps Pakistan on ‘grey list’FATF said Pakistan had “largely addressed” 24 of the 27 items in the action plan. However, FATF president Marcus Pleyer pointed out the deficiencies yet to be addressed are all “serious” as they relate to terror financing. During the meeting of Pakistan’s National Executive Committee (NEC) on anti-money laundering chaired by Shaikh on Monday, it was decided that additional legislation will have to be enacted on at least two counts to implement FATF’s action plan by June, the Dawn newspaper reported. The additional legislation has to “cover some weaknesses in the existing framework that limited the authorities from taking action, including imposing sanction or apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them”, the report said. The Dawn quoted its sources as saying that the meeting was informed reasonable progress had been made on one of the three remaining items in the FATF action plan “but two areas that required additional legislation would be time consuming”. The Pakistan government will also have to submit an updated report within 30 days to FATF on progress in legislation and other steps to be taken to address outstanding concerns. The meeting concluded there shouldn’t be any hurdle in making two more legal amendments, the report said. Shaikh asked the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and chairman of the FATF coordination committee, industries minister Hammad Azhar, to finalise the timelines for the additional legislation in consultation with the federal government and armed forces. “The strict adherence to timelines would culminate into successful completion of the FATF action plan,” Shaikh was quoted as saying in an official statement. A statement issued by FATF at the conclusion of its plenary meeting had said the outstanding actions for Pakistan include demonstrating that terror financing investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf of the designated terrorists, showing that prosecutions result in “effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions”, and demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-enact-legislation-to-fully-implement-fatf-action-plan-report-101614761312203.html
03-03-2021||World||Biden’s Covid-19 mask mandate faces a new challenge. Now from ‘red’ state Texas||Texas governor Greg Abbott announced on Tuesday that the state is lifting its mask mandate. This makes Texas the largest state that no longer requires the mask mandate, which was put in place by President Joe Biden's in the first two days in office.“Removing statewide mandates does not end personal responsibility. It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed,” Abbott said in a statement from Lubbock while rescinding statewide face mask orders. The repeal will come into effect from March 10. This also means that Texas is fully reopening just ahead of the spring break holiday, which health experts worry could lead to more spread of Covid-19.But governor Abbott justified the move saying that Texas has seen the number of cases and deaths plunge. Hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since October, and the seven-day rolling average of positive tests has dropped to about 7,600 cases, down from more than 10,000 in mid-February. But experts worry, as only 7.1 per cent of nearly 30 million residents of the state have been fully vaccinated, according to data reported by the state to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Read more: Texas utility files for bankruptcy after $2.1 billion power billWhat is the mask mandate?The mask mandate came into effect on February 1 after the CDC ordered that masks be worn while using any form of public transportation or while inside any transportation hub. Although the executive order that was passed by President Biden with respect to the masks said that masking is compulsory, it is still up to state governments to impose broader mask mandates or even reduce them.What is the politics behind the move?Abbott, a Republican, has faced sustained criticism from his party in America’s biggest red state over the statewide mask mandate. Thus, the move is a direct challenge to Biden’s mask mandate. But Abbott said that the state needs to reopen to ensure that businesses are open and employment is generated.Read more: 'Who is at fault?' Investigation into Texas blackout begins"For nearly half a year, most businesses have been open either 75 percent or 50 percent and during that time, too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities…. This must end. It is now time to open Texas 100 per cent. Every business that wants to be open should be open,” Abbott said.What about other states?Texas joins four states which have already lifted the mask mandates: Montana, Iowa, North Dakota and Mississippi. Currently, thirty-five state governments require people to wear masks in public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-covid-19-mask-mandate-faces-a-new-challenge-now-from-red-state-texas-101614759868211.html
03-03-2021||World||Hong Kong makes 100th pro-democracy arrest under national security law||Hong Kong has made its 100th arrest under a national security law imposed on the former British colony by China last year, while dozens of pro-democracy activists return to court for a mass bail hearing before their trial on subversion charges.Former Next Digital Ltd. Executive Director Stephen Ting was detained on fraud allegations, the Oriental Daily newspaper reported, citing people it didn’t identify. Police issued a statement late Tuesday confirming the arrest of a 61-year-old man “after in-depth investigation by national security department.” Police didn’t name the person or his affiliation with Next Digital.As of Tuesday, 100 people have been arrested on suspicion of activities harming national security, police said in a separate statement Wednesday. The accused include 83 male suspects and 17 female suspects, ages 16 to 79, police said.One of the most high-profile operations under the security law involved the arrest of 55 opposition figures in January. They were rounded up for taking part in an unofficial primary election and accused of trying to gain a majority in the legislature to paralyze the government.Some 47 of those people are attending a third day of arraignment hearings to decide whether they will receive bail before their subversion trial. The defendants include some of the city’s most prominent activists such as Joshua Wong, Benny Tai and Jimmy Sham, and most have objected to government requests to keep them in jail while also delaying further proceedings until at least May 31.Also read: China's electoral reform 'earthquake' set to upend Hong Kong politicsThe case comes before an annual meeting of China’s legislature opens in Beijing on Friday, with senior officials calling for lawmakers to overhaul the former British colony’s election system to further diminish the influence of pro-democracy politicians. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam plans to travel to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the National People’s Congress.Before the hearing started Wednesday, the owner of a local diner brought food and drinks to supporters of the defendants outside the courthouse. “I want to support the people here,” said Cheong Wong. “This is the least I can do.”Amnesty International Hong Kong was critical of Monday’s hearing, which started at 11 a.m. and ended about 3 a.m. the following day when one defendant fainted. Three others went to the hospital after saying they felt unwell, local media reported.An extended hearing “along with insufficient time to rest could potentially violate the right to a fair trial, and such a violation could warrant legitimate grounds for an appeal,” said Lam Cho Ming, a program manager at the human rights group. “Fair trial rights demand that there must be adequate time and facilities to prepare the defense.”More than four-fifths of people arrested since the law’s enactment have been accused of participating in some form of political activity, such as displaying banners, posting in support of the city’s independence on social media or organizing primary elections for legislative seats. Some suspects have been arrested more than once. Only one previous arrest involved an allegation of violence.“The early arrests have inevitably focused on low-hanging fruit,” said Bing Ling, a professor of Chinese law at the University of Sydney. Public expressions of anti-China sentiment are easier to prove in court and detaining high-profile individuals has a bigger deterrent effect, he said.The law granted broad new powers to authorities to stifle opposition opinion and deter protests, such as the large and sometimes violent demonstrations that shook the Asian financial hub in 2019. Lawyers, activists and Western governments have criticized the legislation for its broadly defined provisions, which bar terrorism, secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces.Lam, the city’s Beijing-appointed chief executive, has credited the law with restoring stability to the Asian financial center. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have said since it was announced that it targeted “extremely few” people suspected of endangering the country’s security. In June, the Hong Kong government said in a statement to Bloomberg News that it would be “irresponsible and scaremongering” to say that the law would provide the government sweeping powers to jail or disqualify opposition figures.So far, prosecutors have brought charges against 56 of those arrested by police. One of the most prominent is Next Digital founder Jimmy Lai, who has been denied bail while awaiting trial on charges he colluded with foreign powers to impose sanctions or engage in hostile activities against Hong Kong or China. He also faces a fraud charge.The collusion charges are based on Lai’s social media posts and comments to foreign media outlets, and on donations police say his company made to an advocacy group, according to court filings and local media reports citing police documents. Lai denies the allegations.The 47 opposition figures are being prosecuted over their roles in helping organize a primary that drew more than 600,000 voters in July last year to choose candidates for Legislative Council elections that were later postponed. Authorities say the primary and plans to force the resignation of Carrie Lam using a provision of the mini-constitution were an illegal attempt to paralyze the government.The efforts by authorities to rein in opposition appear set to continue, even though protests have mostly ended. In January, Secretary for Security John Lee said the government would strengthen intelligence gathering because behavior that endangered national security may be “driven underground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-makes-100th-pro-democracy-arrest-under-national-security-law-101614755229759.html
03-03-2021||World||Australia building world's first platypus sanctuary to promote breeding and rehabilitation||Australian conservationists on Wednesday unveiled plans to build the world's first refuge for the platypus, to promote breeding and rehabilitation as the duck-billed mammal faces extinction due to climate change.The Taronga Conservation Society Australia and the New South Wales State government said they would build the specialist facility, mostly ponds and burrows for the semiaquatic creatures, at a zoo 391 km (243 miles) from Sydney, by 2022, which could house up to 65 platypuses."There is so much to learn about the platypus and we know so little," Taronga CEO Cameron Kerr told reporters."These facilities will be critical in building our knowledge so that we don't let this iconic creature slip off the earth."Concerns about the platypus going extinct have been heightened since once-in-a-generation wildfires devastated 12.6 million hectares (31 million acres) of bush, nearly the size of Greece, in late 2019 and early 2020.Scientists estimate nearly three billion animals died in what the prime minister called the country's "black summer". A government inquiry found bushfires would likely occur more often because of warming temperatures.Unlike other famous Australian animals such as the koala or kangaroo, the beaver-like platypus is rarely seen in the wild due to its reclusive nature and highly specific habitat needs.The furry, web-footed animal, along with the echnidna, is one of just two egg-laying mammals, and generally lives around small streams and slow-moving rivers in cooler temperatures."The refuge ... will give us a chance to really learn about what sort of environments they like, and what is most likely to encourage them to breed," said Kerr.The 2019-20 bushfires followed several years of drought, and Taronga had noted beforehand an increased number of platypuses with "climate-related injuries and illnesses", it said in a statement.Last year, a separate inquiry found that koalas would be extinct in New South Wales by 2050, due to deforestation for farming and urban development.The platypus is classified as a protected species in Australia, and Taronga said that without intervention, the animal may follow a few decades later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-building-world-s-first-platypus-sanctuary-to-promote-breeding-and-rehabilitation-101614758729007.html

Hairdressers and some schools have reopened in recent days.The tally of infections rose by 9,019 to 2,460,030 on Wednesday, an increase of more than 1,000 over last week, while the death toll rose by 418 to 70,881.However, the number of cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days fell slightly, to 64 from 65.8 on Tuesday.Also read: Ahead of Easter holidays, Germany drafts plans to start easing Covid-19 lockdownThe latest draft plans obtained by Reuters provide for a tighter lockdown to be re-imposed if the number of cases rises above 100 per 100,000.The government had targeted 50 cases per 100,000 before easing the lockdown, but was pressed to relax that as the national figure stagnated above 60, while deaths and the numbers of patients in intensive care fell.However, Gernot Marx, head of the German association for intensive care and emergency medicine, continued to urge caution:"It is important that we hold out for another three weeks because, by vaccinating many people, we can significantly flatten out a third wave, despite the virus mutations," he told the Augsburger Allgemeine daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-merkel-set-to-agree-to-cautious-easing-of-covid-19-lockdown-101614755200736.html

The agency earlier said it will provide compensation of over 430 million won ($383,466) for deaths from the Covid-19 vaccine."KDCA is conducting epidemiological surveys with relevant local authorities... to confirm any link with inoculation," said Jeong.An AstraZeneca spokeswoman in Seoul said the company had no comment.Jeong noted that there were no cases of fatalities from receiving Covid-19 vaccines developed by AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech.

03-03-2021||World||Sweden's capital Stockholm hit by 100% spike in Covid-19 cases in just 3 weeks||In Sweden’s capital, the rate of coronavirus infections just doubled over the past three weeks, making a third wave seem almost inevitable.The surge in new cases follows a warning from the government of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven that Sweden might need to enforce legislation enacted earlier this year, allowing the authorities to impose what would be the country’s first lockdown since the pandemic erupted roughly a year ago.With the current infection rates, the capital area has seen a “small” increase in the number of people “so seriously ill that they are in need of hospital care,” Johan Bratt, the acting health and medical care director for the Stockholm region, said in a statement on Wednesday.There were 6,336 new cases of Covid registered in the capital last week, compared with 3,225 reported for the week beginning Feb. 1, according to data compiled by the region.The uptick follows a gloomy prognosis by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who told reporters on Tuesday that a third wave now seems impossible to avoid.“To expect a scenario in which we don’t have any increase at all in the spring is all but ruled out by now,” Tegnell said.But the country of 10.4 million people, which drew international attention for its laissez-faire approach at the outset the pandemic, is still cautious about resorting to a full lockdown.“We still believe in finding the places where we can impose more targeted measures instead,” Tegnell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedens-capital-stockholm-hit-by-100-spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-just-3-weeks-101614758023070.html

Kenya has more than 106,000 confirmed virus cases including more than 1,800 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenya-receives-receives-1-million-covid-vaccines-from-india-under-covax-initiative-101614757757221.html
03-03-2021||World||Myanmar police fire to break up protests as ASEAN diplomatic effort stalls||Myanmar security forces opened fire in several places on Wednesday to break up anti-junta protests and several people were hurt, media reported, a day after a regional diplomatic push to end the month-long crisis made little headway.Foreign Ministers from Southeast Asian neighbours urged restraint but failed to unite behind a call for the military to release ousted government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy.At least 21 people have been killed since a military coup on Feb. 1 ended Myanmar's tentative steps towards democratic rule and triggered protests across the country and international dismay.Security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters in several places, including the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay, and there were also reports of live ammunition being used in some places."Oh my eyes, it hurts," one woman in a teacher's uniform shouted as she and other protesters scattered through a cloud of tear gas in the second city of Mandalay, according to a live video feed.Nine people were hurt when police fired rubber bullets in Mandalay, the Myanmar Now news agency reported.The Monywa Gazette reported five people were wounded when security forces fired live ammunition in that central town and there were also unconfirmed reports of firing and injuries in the two other central towns, Myingyan and Magway.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.The security forces detained about 400 protesters as they broke up protests in Yangon, Myanmar Now reported. One activist said several protest leaders were among those taken away.Video posted on social media showed long lines of young men, hands on heads, filing into army trucks as police and soldiers stood guard. Reuters was not able to verify the footage.Protesters were also out in Chin State in the west, Kachin State in the north, Shan State in the northeast, the central region of Sagaing and the south, media and residents said."We're aiming to show that no one in this country wants dictatorship," Salai Lian, an activist in Chin State, told Reuters.'NO MORE WORDS'On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to make a breakthrough in a virtual foreign ministers' meeting on Myanmar.While united in a call for restraint, only four members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore - called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees."We expressed ASEAN's readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner," the ASEAN chair, Brunei, said in a statement.Myanmar's state media said the military-appointed foreign minister attended the ASEAN meeting that "exchanged views on regional and international issues", but made no mention of the focus on Myanmar's problems.It said Wunna Maung Lwin "apprised the meeting of voting irregularities" in November's election.The military justified the coup saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 elections were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second five-year term. The election commission said the vote was fair.Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has said the intervention was to protect Myanmar's fledgling democracy and has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday in an interview the coup was a "tragic" step back for Myanmar and the use of lethal force by its security forces was "disastrous".ASEAN's bid to find a way out of the crisis has drawn criticism from inside Myanmar, with concern it would legitimise the junta and not help the country."No more words, action," activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters in a message when asked about the ASEAN effort. She called for sanctions on businesses linked to the military.Tuesday evening's news bulletin on Myanmar state television said agitators were mobilising people on social media and forming "illegal organisations".It said tear gas and stun guns grenades were used to disperse crowds in Yangon and 12 rioters were arrested.Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.She is one of nearly 1,300 people who have been detained, according to activists, among them six journalists in Yangon, one of whom works for the Associated Press, which has called for his release.Ousted President Win Myint is facing two new charges, his lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said, including one for a breach of the constitution that is punishable by up to three years on prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-fire-to-break-up-protests-as-asean-diplomatic-effort-stalls-101614757160152.html

03-03-2021||World||Pakistan needs more legislations to meet remaining FATF benchmarks: Report||As Pakistan remains on the 'grey list' of the terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF), it will have to enact laws on at least two counts to meet the outstanding points of the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) action plan to meet the June deadline.According to a report by Dawn, aside from further legislations, the Pakistan government will have to submit an updated report within a month to the FATF on the progress on legislation and other steps to be taken to address the outstanding issues.The Pakistani daily's report said the additional legislation has to cover weaknesses in the existing framework, including apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them.The three remaining FATF points include demonstrating that terrorist financing (TF) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities; demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions; and demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, specifically those acting for or on their behalf.Global terror financing watchdog last week retained Pakistan on its "grey list" till June after concluding that Islamabad failed to address its strategically important deficiencies, to fully implement the action plan that the watchdog had drawn up for Pakistan.The global watchdog had in October last year asked Pakistan to deliver on all 27 points by this February. However, Islamabad failed in this regard."To date, Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has now largely addressed 24 of the 27 action items. As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan before June 2021," FATF said in a statement at the outcome of a plenary last week.Pakistan's continuation on the 'grey list' means that it will not get any respite in trying to access finances in the form of investments and aid from international bodies including International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistan has been on the FATF's grey list since June 2018.A research paper by an Islamabad-based think tank recently revealed that Pakistan sustained a total of USD 38 billion in economic losses due to FATF's decision.The research paper titled "Bearing the cost of global politics -- the impact of FATF grey-listing on Pakistan's economy" states that that grey-listing events spanning from 2008 to 2019, may have resulted in total GDP losses worth USD 38 billion, The Express Tribune reported.The report published by Tabadlab said the losses are worked out on the basis of a decrease in consumption expenditures, foreign direct investment and exports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-needs-more-legislations-to-meet-remaining-fatf-benchmarks-report-101614755944839.html

Then says he cannot||CNN anchor Chris Cuomo addressed the sexual harassment allegations against his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo at the start of Monday’s Cuomo prime time show. The journalist said that he obviously cannot report on the story due to conflict of interest."You're straight with me, I'll be straight with you," Cuomo told his audience. "Obviously, I'm aware of what's going on with my brother. And obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother.""Now, of course, CNN has to cover it," he continued. "They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so. I have always cared very deeply about these issues, and profoundly so. I just wanted to tell you that. There's a lot of news going on that matters also, so let's get after that."Read more: New York Governor Cuomo backs down on plan to review his alleged sexual misconductWhy the controversy?Chris Cuomo’s statement was considered controversial as the Cuomo brothers have often shared screen time together on CNN. On several occasions last spring, when New York was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, Governor Cuomo made several appearances on his brother’s show, even though ever since Chris Cuomo joined the network in 2013, he had been prevented from covering stories surrounding his brother.Read more: Andrew Cuomo's scandals dim luster of man dubbed ‘America’s governor’What are the allegations that Governor Cuomo faces?Governor Cuomo is facing allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior towards three women.

In a statement on Sunday, Governor Cuomo apologized saying, "I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal," he said. "Some of the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation. To the extent anyone felt that way, I am truly sorry."

The attack occurred immediately after Republican Trump, in a speech near the White House, exhorted his supporters to march to the Capitol, having repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him.The Justice Department has charged more than 300 people with crimes ranging from conspiracy to attacking police and obstructing Congress. The rioting left five dead.At least 18 people associated with the far-right Proud Boys have been charged and nine people tied to the anti-government militia known as the Oath Keepers are facing charges they conspired as far back as November to storm the Capitol to prevent Biden from becoming president.Biden took office on Jan. 20.Wray revealed that since the attacks, the FBI has also seen instances of "foreign adversaries" who have been "leveraging the events of Jan. 6 to amplify their own narratives" and push propaganda.He did not provide further details, saying he could not do so in an unclassified setting.Supporters of Trump have repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims the rioters were actually fake Trump supporters who belong to antifa. They have also repeated Trump's false claims that the election was stolen due to widespread fraud.Wray told lawmakers on Tuesday this narrative was false.To the contrary, he said, a number of the rioters belong to far-right militia movements, or were motivated by racial ideologies - but none to date appear to belong to any left-wing groups.The anti-government militia extremists, he noted, appears to be the "biggest bucket" that is trending as the FBI examines the backgrounds of the rioters.Wray said he stood by comments made by former Attorney General Bill Barr, who had infuriated Trump after the election when he said the Justice Department did not have evidence of any widespread election fraud."We are not aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud, much less that would have affected the outcome of the presidential election," Wray told lawmakers.The FBI has yet to arrest any suspects in the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, or for pipe bombs that were discovered outside the headquarters of both the Republican and Democratic national committees.The FBI has obtained a video that shows a suspect spraying bear spray on police officers, including Sicknick, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.The suspect has yet to be identified by name, and it is still unclear if the bear spray contributed to Sicknick's death.Wray said he cannot disclose a cause of death, and Sicknick's death is still under investigation.In a newly unsealed search warrant, investigators say rioters carried weapons inside the Capitol including tire irons, sledge hammers, tasers, bear spray and, in at least one case, a handgun with an extended magazine.Investigators including the FBI have come under scrutiny over why more was not done to protect the Capitol ahead of the attack.The day before, the FBI's Norfolk, Virginia, office distributed a raw, unverified intelligence report which warned that violent extremists intended to disrupt Congress.Wray told lawmakers the intelligence was shared with other law enforcement agencies three different ways, but acknowledged he personally did not see the report until a few days later.As to why other top law enforcement officials did not see it, Wray said: "I don't have a good answer to that."Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said to Wray: "What I don't understand is why this ... raw intelligence didn't prompt a stronger warning and alarm."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-evidence-us-capitol-rioters-belong-to-antifa-movement-says-fbi-chief-101614754324964.html

However, the WHO is yet to ratify five of the Chinese vaccines currently authorised by Beijing for emergency use.Observers are optimistic about borders opening up for international travel as the Covid-19 immunisation drive gains momentum across the world.The US is the worst affected nation by the coronavirus with 514,660 related fatalities and over 28 million confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.In China, Covid-19 has claimed 4,836 lives with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, the coronavirus resources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/free-travel-allowed-for-official-reasons-wu-on-us-china-collab-for-covid19-101614734937334.html
03-03-2021||World||China charges blogger for 'demeaning military casualties' of Galwan clash||A popular Chinese blogger with millions of followers has been charged for posts regarding military casualties in the Galwan valley clash with India last June.The authorities accused the popular blogger of demeaning military casualties of the border clash, South China Morning Post reported.38-year-old Qiu Ziming was charged for comments that prosecutors in the eastern city of Nanjing said, "distorted facts, defamed five soldiers who defended the Chinese border, and have led to severely negative social impacts".The comments came after China admitted for the first time that four of its soldiers had been killed and one seriously wounded during the clash that took place in the Himalayas, SCMP reported.Qiu, a former reporter with the weekly Economic Observer, had 2.5 million followers on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo when he had published two posts that suggested a commander survived the clashes because he was the highest-ranking officer there.He also suggested that more Chinese soldiers might have been killed in the conflict than those disclosed by the authorities.Last month, the Chinese military ended its months-long silence to say that four soldiers - Chen Hongjun, 33, Xiao Siyuan, 24, Wang Zhuoran, 24 and Chen Xiangrong, 18 - were killed in the conflict in the Galwan Valley in June. Their commanding officer Qi Fabao, 41, was badly wounded.State media had also released footage of the clash showing Qi walking with open arms towards Indian troops and trying to stop them. Meanwhile, the Russian news agency last month had claimed that 45 Chinese soldiers were killed in the clashes at the Galwan Valley.In a commentary on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua accused Qiu of "damaging the reputation of heroes, hurting nationalistic feelings and poisoning patriotic hearts" with his sensational posts.The Chinese Communist Party has long been accused of suppressing the idea that could undermine the sweeping authority.In just the past few years, the government has attempted to muzzle critics by making them disappear without a trace, ordering people to physically barge into their houses, or locking up those close to critics as a kind of blackmail.

03-03-2021||World||Fly me to the Moon: Japan billionaire Yusaku Maezawa offers space seats||It's the sort of chance that comes along just once in a blue Moon: a Japanese billionaire is throwing open a private lunar expedition to eight people from around the world.Yusaku Maezawa, an online fashion tycoon, was announced in 2018 as the first man to book a spot aboard the lunar spaceship being developed by SpaceX.Maezawa, who paid an undisclosed sum for the trip expected to launch in 2023 at the earliest, originally said he planned to invite six to eight artists to join him on the voyage around the Moon.But on Wednesday, in a video posted on his Twitter account, he revealed a broader application process."I'm inviting you to join me on this mission. Eight of you from all around the world," he said."I have bought all the seats, so it will be a private ride," he added.Maezawa, 45, said his initial plan of inviting artists had "evolved" because he came to believe that "every single person who is doing something creative could be called an artist."The Japanese entrepreneur said applicants would need to fulfil just two criteria: being ready to "push the envelope" creatively, and being willing to help other crew members do the same.In all, he said around 10 to 12 people will be on board the spaceship, which is expected to loop around the Moon before returning to Earth.The application timeline for spots on the trip calls for would-be space travellers to pre-register by March 14, with initial screening carried out by March 21.No deadlines are given for the next stages -- an "assignment" and an online interview -- but final interviews and medical checkups are currently scheduled for late May 2021, according to Maezawa's website.Musk 'highly confident'Maezawa and his band of astronauts will become the first lunar voyagers since the last US Apollo mission in 1972 -- if SpaceX can pull the trip off.Last month, a prototype of its Starship crashed in a fireball as it tried to land upright after a test flight, the second such accident, after the last prototype of the Starship met a similar fate in December.But the company hopes the reusable, 394-foot (120-metre) rocket system will one day carry crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond."I'm highly confident that we will have reached orbit many times with Starship before 2023 and that it will be safe enough for human transport by 2023. It's looking very promising," SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in Maezawa's video posted Wednesday.The mission will be the first private space flight beyond Earth's orbit, Musk said.Because it will not land on the Moon, but loop behind it, "we expect people will go further than any human has ever gone from planet Earth," he added.Maezawa, known for his eccentric comments and extravagant lifestyle including a penchant for pricey art, was last year valued around $1.9 billion, making him one of Japan's richest people.He made his fortune as founder of online fashion store Zozo, which he sold to Yahoo! Japan in 2019.Maezawa has previously made headlines with an online ad for a girlfriend to join him on his SpaceX flight -- only to abruptly cancel the hunt, despite attracting nearly 30,000 applicants.US space agency NASA is intending to land astronauts on the Moon, including the first woman, in 2024.One of the goals of its Artemis III voyage is to bring back a total of 85 kilograms (187 pounds) of lunar samples -- more than the average 64 kilograms brought back by Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fly-me-to-the-moon-japan-billionaire-yusaku-maezawa-offers-space-seats-101614752862953.html

He also said climate change, global health issues and cyber threats pose serious risks.Among the Russia-related issues Burns and other intelligence chiefs are expected to deal with early in the Biden administration are an investigation into recent hacking attacks of US government and private and local government data networks.A US official said Biden's Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, confirmed by the Senate in January, will lead a broad review of intelligence issues facing US agencies, including what role Russia's leadership played in the SolarWinds hack of US targets and in approving payment of alleged Russian bounties to Taliban fighters who kill American and allied forces in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cia-director-william-burns-recommends-shutting-down-beijing-funded-confucius-institutes-101614734906297.html

03-03-2021||World||Joe Biden brings no relief to tensions between US, China||worlPresident Joe Biden took office promising to move quickly to restore and repair America's relations with the rest of the world, but one major nation has yet to see any US effort to improve ties: China.From Iran to Russia, Europe to Latin America, Biden has sought to cool tensions that rose during President Donald Trump's four years in office. Yet, there have been no overtures to China.Although the Biden administration has halted the ferocious rhetorical attacks and near daily announcements of new sanctions on China that had become commonplace under Trump, it has yet to back down on any of Trump's actions against Beijing.This persistent state of low-intensity hostility has profound implications. China and the United States are the world's two largest economies and the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Their power struggle complicates global efforts to deal with climate change and recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Biden's tough stance has its roots in the competition for global power, but it's also a result of the 2020 presidential election campaign in which Trump and his allies repeatedly sought to portray him as soft on China, particularly during the pandemic that originated there. There's also little appetite from lawmakers in either party to ease pressure on China.Thus in their first month in office, Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have reaffirmed many of the Trump administration's most significant steps targeting China, including a determination that its crackdown on Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in western Xinjiang region constitutes a “genocide” and a flat-out rejection of nearly all of China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.Nor has the new administration signaled any let-up in Trump's tariffs, restrictions on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics in the US or criticism of Chinese policies toward Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong.It's also critical of Beijing's attempts to further its increasing global influence through telecommunications technology, social media and educational and cultural exchanges.Biden's nominee to head the CIA, William Burns, was explicit about his concerns over many of these issues at his confirmation hearing Wednesday. And, the newly confirmed US.ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, made a point of highlighting her unease with the state of affairs and pledged to combat Chinese attempts to exert undue pressure on other countries at the UN.The backdrop is clear: The United States is convinced that it and China are engaged in a duel for global dominance. And neither is prepared to back down.China has sounded at times hopeful that Biden will reverse what foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said were Trump administration actions that “caused immeasurable damage to the relationship between the two countries.”Those remarks followed a speech in which China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, demanded that Biden's administration lift restrictions on trade and people-to-people contacts and cease what Beijing considers unwarranted interference in the areas of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet.Wang urged the US to “stop smearing” the reputation of China's ruling Communist Party. “We hope that the US policy makers will keep pace with the times, see clearly the trend of the world, abandon biases, give up unwarranted suspicions and move to bring the China policy back to reason to ensure a healthy, steady development of China-US relations,” he said.But the anti-China rhetoric hasn't eased. Top Biden administration officials have vowed to use American power to contain what many Democrats and Republicans see as growing Chinese threats to US interests and values in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.They have all repeatedly referred to China as a strategic rival or foe, not a partner or potential friend, and have also evinced their belief that America must “outcompete” China.“Outcompeting China will be key to our national security in the decades ahead,” Burns said at his confirmation hearing. “China is a formidable authoritarian adversary, methodically strengthening its capabilities to steal intellectual property, repress its own people, bully its neighbors, expand its global reach, and build influence in American society.”“It is hard for me to see a more significant threat or challenge for the United States as far out as I can see into the 21st century than that one. It is the biggest geopolitical test that we face,” he said.At least some Asia hands in the United States see Biden as moving slowly toward potential reengagement with China in part because he wants to shore up his domestic position and make clear the US is not a victim of Chinese predation.“They are restraining themselves from the normal syndrome of a new administration running into problem-solving with China,” said Danny Russel, who was assistant secretary of state for Asia during the Obama administration and is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.Russel said Biden is "sending out messages that have the effect of showing he's not soft on China, that he's not a patsy for China, that he isn't so desperate for a breakthrough on climate change that he's going to trade away our national security interests.”Chinese academics see little difference in Biden's approach.“Continuity takes precedent over adjustment and change,” said Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at elite Nanjing University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-brings-no-relief-to-tensions-between-us-china-101614750582081.html
03-03-2021||World||Biden administration withdraws Neera Tanden’s nomination to cabinet position||The White House on Tuesday withdrew Indian-American Neera Tanden’s nomination to a cabinet position to head the office of management and budget (OMB) after she faced opposition from Republicans as well as a Democrat for her controversial tweets. She will have a role in the Biden administration still, but it was not immediately clear how.“I have accepted Neera Tanden’s request to withdraw her name from nomination for director of the office of management and budget,” US President Joe Biden said. “I have the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my administration.” Biden offered no indication of what that role will be, but it will most certainly be a position not requiring confirmation by the Senate.“I am writing to you to withdraw my nomination,” Tanden wrote to the president as it “now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities”.Tanden’s nomination, as the first Indian-American and woman of colour picked to head the OMB, had appeared to be in trouble almost from the time it was announced. Critics have called Tanden divisive citing her tweets in which she had targeted specially, and not only, Republicans over the past four years.“Very disappointed. We worked our hearts out and did everything we could to help Neera,” Shekar Narasimhan, a Democratic donor who also leads an initiative to promote Asian-descent Democratic politicians, said about Tanden pulling her nomination. “This would not have happened if Democrats stuck together and realised how critical the AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) community is to their electoral prospects in the future.”Tanden’s nomination began unravelling after Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator, announced his opposition to it. In an evenly divided 100-member Senate, Tanden would have made it home with the support of all 50 Democrats and then vice-president Kamala Harris’s tie-breaker vote.But Manchin’s opposition to her nomination left her at the mercy of the Republicans. There were hopes that moderate Republicans, who have voted against the party line, such as Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, would come to her rescue. None of them did.“Congress has to be able to trust the OMB director to make countless decisions in an impartial manner, carrying out the letter of the law and congressional intent,” Collins had said while announcing her decision. “Neera Tanden has neither the experience nor the temperament to lead this critical agency. Her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend.” Collins was among the Republicans who Tanden had once targeted in her tweets, calling her “the worst”.Some of Tanden’s defenders, however, alleged she was a victim of sexism. “I feel like there’s a little bit of sexism going on here,” William Kristol, a conservative political commentator, told The Washington Post. “It just seems like these tweets sound harsher to these old guys because they’re coming from a woman.”These same Republicans had looked the other way as one of their own, former president Donald Trump, had demeaned people in his social media posts.Other defenders of Tanden had alleged an undercurrent of racism in opposition to her nomination. The Washington Post had reported, citing activists, “Many of the president’s Black, Latino, Asian and Native American nominees are encountering more political turbulence than their White counterparts, further drawing out the process of staffing the federal government.”Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, tweeted as Tanden’s chances of being confirmed dimmed late February, “I represent one of the largest Indian-American districts in US. How do I look at what’s happening to @neeratanden and tell little girls of South Asian descent that they’ll have the same opportunities in life as white men? The answer: I can’t. And that’s a shame.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-withdraws-neera-tanden-s-nomination-to-cabinet-position-101614750031792.html

A women-led organisation, the team strongly believes in diversity and the role women can play in generating positive outcomes for society and for the economy as a whole. The investment by US DFC will help Northern Arc expand financing to many such deserving borrowers," said Northern Arc MD and CEO Kshama Fernandes.Women-owned businesses across the globe are chronically underfunded, the DFC said in a media release adding that in India, female entrepreneurs face a financing gap of hundreds of millions of dollars, while women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face a gap in the tens of billions of dollars.DFC's USD 50 million investment will help close these financing gaps. With this loan, Northern Arc will provide expanded financing to its network of inclusive financial institutions, entrepreneurs and small businesses catalysing traditionally underserved populations to create new jobs and grow their local economies, the media release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-body-announces-usd-50-million-loan-to-promote-gender-equity-in-businesses-financing-101614746218021.html

03-03-2021||World||US health experts halted trials of plasma transfusions for Covid-19 patients||US health experts said Tuesday they are halting clinical trials of convalescent blood plasma in patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms after preliminary results showed no benefit from the treatment.The trial that began in August involved just over 500 people who went to emergency rooms but did not need to be hospitalized.The people chosen for the study also had risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes or heart trouble.Some of them received the treatment -- blood plasma from people who had Covid-19 and overcame it -- and others got a placebo.Doctors looked at how many needed additional care or outright hospitalization, or who died, in the 15 days after undergoing the treatment.An independent group of experts determined that while the convalescent plasma intervention caused no harm, it was unlikely to benefit patients, the National Institutes of Health said.Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood from a Covid-19 patient that recovered. It contains anti-bodies produced by the body after being infected.In late October a study carried out in India and published in the medical journal BMJ said the treatment offered limited effectiveness.It did not reduce mortality or keep people with moderate Covid-19 symptoms from developing a serious case.Also read: Covid-19: US approves single shot J&J vaccine, UK vaccinates 20 millionMore than 100,000 people have received the treatment in the US since the start of the pandemic and many more elsewhere in the world, the NIH said.In late August, at the persistent request of then president Donald Trump, the US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization for transfusions of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients to people who were hospitalized with the disease.The then head of the FDA, Stephen Hahn, acknowledged an error at a press conference with Trump, saying he had cited figures that overestimated the benefits of the treatment.The FDA recently restricted its emergency authorization to use of plasma only with a high concentration of antibodies and for patients hospitalized with early stages of Covid-19 or with a limited ability to produce antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-experts-halted-trials-of-plasma-transfusions-for-covid-19-patients-101614734794634.html

The entire driver's side of the smaller vehicle was caved in, and the passenger side was flung wide open."Unfortunately, consular staff have confirmed the death of 10 Mexicans so far," Roberto Velasco, the foreign ministry's director for North America, said in a tweet in Spanish.Mexicans were also among the injured in the crash, he said.It was not immediately clear how fast the vehicles were going, or whether the SUV had observed a stop sign before heading into the intersection of State Route 115 and Norrish Road just outside of Holtville, about 10 miles (16.1 km) north of the border, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) said.Those killed, who included the driver of the SUV, ranged in age from 15 to 53, and minors as young as 16 were injured, said Omar Watson, chief of the highway patrol's border division. He said the driver was 22 years old.Several of the occupants were ejected from the vehicle and died on the pavement; others died inside the SUV, Watson said.Most of the survivors are Spanish-speaking, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said. Despite the presence of CBP agents and Spanish translators, Watson said it was too early to know whether the SUV's occupants were migrant workers or others who might have crossed from Mexico in the overcrowded vehicle.Although it varies by trim and model year, the Ford Expedition typically is designed to hold five to eight people.Watson said the CHP was working with the Mexican Consulate to determine who was in the vehicle and notify families of fatalities.The CBP spokesperson, who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said the agency was not in pursuit of or aware of the vehicle until the Imperial County Sheriff's Department asked for its help at the crash site.The agency does not know and is not investigating the immigration status of the people at this time.The driver of the tractor-trailer, which was earlier said to be hauling gravel but according to the CHP was not, was also hospitalized with moderate injuries, Watson said.The logo of Havens and Sons Trucking of nearby El Centro was on the side of the truck cab. A person who answered the phone at the company told Reuters it had no comment at this time.Several of the victims were taken to El Centro Regional Medical Center, the director of the hospital's emergency room, Judy Cruz, said in a news briefing posted on Facebook.Agriculture drives the economy around Holtville and El Centro. Known as the Imperial Valley, the area is a big producer of fruits, vegetables, grain and cattle despite being desert, thanks to irrigation from the Colorado River and a long growing season.Hospital officials had previously said that 27 people were in the SUV, and that 15 had died, but Watson said there were 25 passengers and 13 fatalities.Three victims were flown to other hospitals and seven others were brought to El Centro. One person died at the hospital, Cruz said.In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it will investigate the crash in concert with the California Highway Patrol. The agency's investigator-in-charge was expected to arrive on Wednesday, the NTSB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-die-in-collision-of-truck-crowded-suv-near-us-mexico-border-101614738411032.html

Brazil is among the hardest-hit countries globally, with 10,646,926 confirmed cases and 257,361 deaths from Covid-19.While the virus recedes in most of the world, Brazil is battling a spike in infections, which has been made worse by carnival and year-end gatherings. About 20 states have more than 80% of ICU beds filled, leading the National Council of Health Secretaries to call for tough measures including a national curfew and closure of airports to avoid a collapse of public and private healthcare systems networks.Also read: Coronavirus variant infected many already recovered from Covid-19: StudyA slow roll-out of vaccines -- Brazil was late to kick off its immunization campaign, and had only 6 million doses at hand when it did -- and a variant that researchers say appears more contagious has added to concern.

03-03-2021||World||Texas and other state governors ease Covid-19 rules despite warnings||Texas on Tuesday became the biggest state to lift its mask rule, joining a rapidly growing movement by governors and other leaders across the US to loosen Covid-19 restrictions despite pleas from health officials not to let down their guard yet.The state will also do away with limits on the number of diners who can be served indoors, said Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock.The governors of Michigan and Louisiana likewise eased up on bars, restaurants and other businesses Tuesday, as did the mayor of San Francisco.“Removing state-wide mandates does not end personal responsibility,” said Abbott, speaking from a crowded dining room where many of those surrounding him were not wearing masks. “It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed."A year into the outbreak, politicians and ordinary Americans alike have grown tired of rules meant to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed over a half-million people in the United States. Some places are lifting infection control measures; in other places, people are ignoring them.Top health officials, including the head of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, have responded by begging people repeatedly not to risk another deadly wave of contagion just when the nation is making progress in vaccinating people and victory over the pandemic is in sight.US cases have plunged more than 70% over the past two months from an average of nearly 250,000 new infections a day, while average deaths per day have plummeted about 40% since mid-January.Also read: Texas utility files for bankruptcy after $2.1 billion power billBut the two curves have levelled off abruptly in the past several days and have even risen slightly, and the numbers are still running at alarmingly high levels, with an average of about 2,000 deaths and 68,000 cases per day. Health officials are increasingly worried about virus mutations.“We stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained,” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned on Monday.Even so, many states are allowing restaurants to resume indoor dining, reopening movie theatres and expanding mass gatherings, while Americans are eager to socialize again.An Indianapolis-area bar was filled with mask less patrons over the weekend. In Southern California, people waited in lines that snaked through a parking lot on a recent weekday afternoon for the chance to shop and eat at Downtown Disney, part of the Disneyland. (The theme park's rides remain closed.) And Florida is getting ready to welcome students on spring break.“People want to stay safe, but at the same time, the fatigue has hit,” said Ryan Luke, who is organizing a weekend rally in Eagle, Idaho, to encourage people to patronize businesses that don’t require masks. "We just want to live a quasi-normal life.”Michael Junge argued against a mask mandate when officials in the Missouri tourist town of Branson passed one and said he hasn’t enforced it in his Lost Boys Barber Company. He said he is sick of it.“I think the whole thing is a joke honestly,” he said. “They originally said that this was going to go for a month and they have pushed it out to indefinitely. ... It should have been done a long time ago.”In San Francisco, and upbeat Mayor London Breed announced that California gave the green light to indoor dining and the reopening of of movie theatres and gyms.Florida is getting ready for spring break travellers to flock to its sunny beaches. The state is considered to be in an “active outbreak,” along with Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and South Carolina, according to the data-tracking website CovidActNow.Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis made it clear during his annual State of the State speech Tuesday that he welcomes more visitors to Florida in his drive to keep the state’s economy thriving.Municipalities can impose their own mask rules and curfews, restrict beach access and place some limits on bars and restaurants, but some have virtually no such measures in place ahead of the season.Miami Beach will require masks both indoors and out and will restrict the number of people allowed on the beach as well as in bars and restaurants.“If you want to party without restrictions, then go somewhere else. Go to Vegas,” Miami Beach City Manager Raul Aguila said during a recent virtual meeting. “We will be taking a zero-tolerance attitude towards that behaviour.”In Michigan, a group called All Business Is Essential has resisted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s virus policies, and many people are abandoning mask requirements and other measures, said group leader Erik Kiilunen.“At some point you’ve got to look yourself in the mirror and say, ‘Do I want a zero-risk life?’” he said. “It’s become a farce, really. People have quit living for a year, at what price?”“I think everybody wants things to get back the way they were,” said Aubrey D. Jenkins, the fire chief in Columbia, South Carolina, whose department issues dozens of $100 citations every weekend to bar-goers who refuse to wear masks or keep their distance. “But we still have to be real cautious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-and-other-state-governors-ease-covid-19-rules-despite-warnings-101614733121124.html
03-03-2021||World||Meghan Markle wins privacy claim against UK newspaper||Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has dubbed her victory in holding the Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) to account as a “comprehensive win for privacy and copyright” because the damage they do “runs deep”.The 39-year-old wife of Britain’s Prince Harry also thanks her husband for his support through the process, after a London High Court ruling in her favour involving articles in February 2019 that published extracts of a “personal and private” letter to her estranged father.The former actress’ legal team had sought a “summary judgment” in the case, which was granted by Justice Mark Warby in the claim for misuse of private information against the publisher of the 'Mail on Sunday’ and ‘MailOnline’."The claimant had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The ‘Mail’ articles interfered with that reasonable expectation," the judge concluded.“After two long years of pursuing litigation, I am grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers and The Mail on Sunday to account for their illegal and dehumanising practices,” said Markle in a statement after the judgment.“For these outlets, it’s a game. For me and so many others, it’s real life, real relationships, and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep,” she said.Markle, who is now based in the US with husband Harry and infant son Archie, said in her statement that the judgment was a victory for all because everyone loses when “misinformation sells more than truth” and when companies create their business model to profit from “people’s pain”.She added: “The world needs reliable, fact-checked, high-quality news... for today, with this comprehensive win on both privacy and copyright, we have all won. We now know, and hope it creates legal precedent, that you cannot take somebody’s privacy and exploit it in a privacy case, as the defendant has blatantly done over the past two years.“I share this victory with each of you — because we all deserve justice and truth, and we all deserve better.”The judge in his ruling had noted that the only “tenable justification” for the publication of extracts of the letter was to correct some inaccuracies about the letter, contained in an article in ‘People’ magazine which featured an interview with five friends of Markle.But he added: "The inescapable conclusion is that, save to the very limited extent I have identified, the disclosures made were not a necessary or proportionate means of serving that purpose. For the most part they did not serve that purpose at all. Taken as a whole the disclosures were manifestly excessive and hence unlawful."A spokesperson for ANL said: "We are very surprised by today's (Thursday) summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial.“We are carefully considering the judgment's contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal."Markle had brought a case in the High Court in England of breach of copyright, infringement of her privacy, and breaches of the Data Protection Act over articles which showed parts of a letter she had written to her 76-year-old father Thomas Markle in August 2018.Parts of the exchange between the father and daughter during a strained relationship were published in the newspaper and online in February 2019.Last year, the High Court had ruled that the newspaper publishers could also include the book ‘Finding Freedom’, written about the royals, their relationship and their decision to step away as frontline British royals, as part of their defence – a decision Meghan's legal team had tried to get overturned.Justice Warby has indicated the need for a further hearing in March to decide "the next steps" in the legal action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-wins-privacy-claim-against-uk-newspaper-101614733773766.html
03-03-2021||World||Make in India key to challenges in trade ties, says US||The Biden administration’s first substantive report outlining its trade agenda and policies has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India initiative “epitomised” the trade-restrictive challenges — as seen by the United States — confronting trade ties between the two countries. Opening up markets and removing trade barriers will be a “priority” in President Joe Biden’s trade agenda, it added.The report sent to US Congress — titled “2021 Trade Policy Agenda and 2020 Annual Report” — detailed the negotiations that took place between the two countries on an interim trade agreement over 2019-2020, calling it a “package of meaningful market access outcomes”, but offered no clues to how the new administration sees them and how it would like to proceed.India has called for talks on a “fresh package”, and to this time go beyond the “nitpicking” and constant shifting of the goalpost that characterised the Trump administration’s approach.The report identified “long-standing market access impediments affecting US exporters” as the key continuing American ask and concern. Trade frictions between the two countries, which exert the weightiest drag on ties that are otherwise on an upward trajectory, have outlasted several administrations in both countries, irrespective of the parties in power.Also Read | India-US trade ties hit by tariff policies under Donald Trump administration: US Congress report“While India’s large market, economic growth, and progress towards development make it an essential market for many US exporters, a general and consistent trend of trade-restrictive policies have inhibited the potential of the bilateral trade relationship,” the report said. India-US bilateral trade in goods and services stood at $146.1 billion in 2019. The potential is said to be many times more. President Biden, who visited India in 2013, had then said the target should be $500 billion.“Recent Indian emphasis on import substitution through a ‘Make in India’ campaign has epitomized the challenges facing the bilateral trade relationship,” the President’s trade agenda released Monday said, identifying a programme launched by Prime Minister Modi in 2014.“Opening markets and reducing trade barriers are fundamental to any trade agenda,” the report said generally of President Joe Biden’s trade agenda. “This will be a priority for the Biden administration, particularly since export-oriented producers, manufacturers, and businesses enjoy greater than average productivity and wages.”The US has sought increased access for its companies to India’s dairy and poultry markets, wants medical devices to be freed from government-regulated pricing, and resolve issues regarding IT goods.To force India to give in, former President Donald Trump had in June 2019 ended India’s access to a preferential US import promotion programme — the Generalized system of Preferences (GSP) — that allowed an estimated $6 billion worth of imports from India to enter the US duty-free.India has blamed American trade negotiators for the failure to reach an agreement, by constantly changing, and upping, their demands. “I think the last time around when we were discussing, we were nitpicking with very small issues and changing the goalposts in every subsequent conversation,” Trade and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/make-in-india-key-to-challenges-in-trade-ties-says-us-101614730963666.html
03-03-2021||World||White House budget chief nominee Neera Tanden withdraws nomination||President Joe Biden's pick to head the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, has withdrawn her nomination after she faced opposition from key Democratic and Republican senators for her controversial tweets.Her withdrawal marks the first high-profile defeat of one of Biden's nominees. Eleven of the 23 Cabinet nominees requiring Senate approval have been confirmed, most with strong bipartisan support.Also Read: What is the controversy around Neera Tanden’s Senate confirmation?"Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities," Tanden wrote in a letter to Biden. The president, in a statement, said he has "utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel" and pledged to find her another role in his administration.Tanden's viability was in doubt after Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin and a number of moderate Republicans came out against her last month, all citing her tweets attacking members of both parties prior to her nomination.Manchin, a key moderate swing vote in the Senate, said last month in a statement announcing his opposition that "her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget."Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins, meanwhile, cited Biden's own standard of conduct in opposing Tanden, declaring in a statement that "her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend."Tanden needed just 51 votes in an evenly-divided Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris acting as a tiebreaker. But without Manchin's support, the White House was left scrambling to find a Republican to support her.One potential Republican vote, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told reporters earlier Tuesday on Capitol Hill she still had not yet made up her mind on Tanden's nomination.The White House stuck with her even after a number of centrist Republicans made their opposition known, insisting her experience growing up on welfare and background working on progressive policies as the president and CEO of the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress made her the right candidate for the moment. White House chief of staff Ron Klain initially insisted the administration was "fighting our guts out" for her.Tanden faced pointed questions over her past comments about members from both parties during her confirmation hearing. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and prominent progressive lawmaker, accused her of issuing "vicious attacks" against progressives, and hadn't said whether he'd support her nomination.Tanden apologized during that hearing to "people on either the left or right who are hurt by what I've said." Just prior to the hearing, she deleted hundreds of tweets, many of which were critical of Republicans.Collins cited those deleted tweets in her statement, saying that the move "raises concerns about her commitment to transparency." She said Congress "has to be able to trust the OMB director to make countless decisions in an impartial manner, carrying out the letter of the law and congressional intent."As recently as Monday, the White House indicated it was sticking by Tanden's nomination, with press secretary Jen Psaki noting Tanden's "decades of experience" in defending their pick."We will continue of course to fight for the confirmation of every nominee that the president puts forward," Psaki insisted, but she added, "We'll see if we have 50 votes."The head of the Office of Management and Budget is tasked with putting together the administration's budget, as well as overseeing a wide range of logistical and regulatory issues across the federal government.Tanden's withdrawal leaves the Biden administration without a clear replacement. The apparent front-runner on Capitol Hill to replace Tanden was Shalanda Young, a former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee who has been actively pushed by members of the Congressional Black Caucus.Other names mentioned include Ann O'Leary, a former chief of staff for California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Gene Sperling, who served as a top economic adviser to both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-budget-chief-nominee-neera-tanden-withdraws-nomination-amid-opposition-101614730381660.html
