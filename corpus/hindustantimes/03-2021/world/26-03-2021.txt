"We are already in discussion to keep a balance so that they can use locally but at the same time continue to provide other countries vaccines from the Serum Institute of India."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-health-agency-in-talks-with-india-about-covid-19-vaccine-export-who-chief-101616779530763.html

There have been reports that some lab workers at the Wuhan laboratory had fallen sick in the fall of 2019, but not clear from what.A team of experts appointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) from around the world is in final stages of preparing a report on its investigation into the origin of the pandemic.A Chinese member on this group, Feng Zijian, was part of a team of Chinese officials who briefed diplomats in Beijing on the WHO investigation in Beijing on Friday, Associated Press (AP) has reported and said the Chinese may have done this to get out their view on the report before it is released.This expert said that the WHO team looked at four ways the virus could have got out, according to AP: a bat carrying the pathogen infected a human; a bat infected an intermediate mammal that spread it to a human; shipments of cold or frozen food; and finally, a laboratory that researches viruses in Wuhan.The expert further said at the briefing for diplomats, according to AP, WHO experts favoured “one of the two animal routes or the cold chain was most likely how it was transmitted”. The lab-leak theory was viewed as extremely unlikely.The first cases of Covid-19 were reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which is home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. WHO had said in a report in March 2020 that a large proportion of the initial cases had a direct link to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan City, where seafood, wild, and farmed animal species were sold. WHO had found that many of the initial patients were stall owners, market employees, and/or regular visitors to the market.But many experts believe the virus came from the Wuhan lab. “I am a virologist; I have spent my life in virology. I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human,” Redfield said in the CNN interview. “And at that moment in time, the virus that came to the human became one of the most infectious viruses that we know and humanity, for human-to-human transmission.”Normally when a pathogen goes from animals to humans, he said, “It takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient in human-to-human transmission. I just don’t think this makes biological sense.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-virus-may-have-escaped-from-chinese-lab-ex-cdc-official-101616779890827.html
26-03-2021||World||US: Colorado shooting suspect passed background check in legal gun purchase||The suspect in the Colorado supermarket shootings bought a firearm at a local gun store after passing a background check, and he also had a second weapon with him that he didn’t use in the attack that killed 10 people this week, authorities and the gun store owner said Friday.Investigators are working to determine the motive for the shooting, but they don’t know yet why the suspect chose the store in Boulder or what led him to carry out the rampage, Police Chief Maris Herold said at a news conference.“Like the rest of the community, we too want to know why — why that King Soopers, why Boulder, why Monday," Herold said. “Unfortunately, at this time, we still don’t have those answers."Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the quick response by officers kept others inside the store out of danger, but he declined to say how many people were there.Investigators have an idea of how many shots were fired in the gunbattle between officers and the suspect, but aren't revealing it yet, Dougherty said. The officer who was the first on the scene was killed.“Their actions saved other civilians from being killed,” Dougherty said about the officers. “They charged into the store and immediately faced a very significant amount of gunfire from the shooter, who at first they were unable to locate.”More charges will be filed against the suspect, 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, in the coming weeks in connection with the shots fired at officers, Dougherty said.John Mark Eagleton, owner of Eagles Nest Armory in the Denver suburb of Arvada, said in a statement that his store was cooperating with authorities as they investigate. The suspect passed a background check conducted by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation before purchasing a gun, Eagleton said.Authorities previously said Alissa purchased an AR-15-style gun on March 16, six days before using it in the shooting. The other weapon the attacker had was a 9 mm handgun."We are absolutely shocked by what happened and our hearts are broken for the victims and families that are left behind. Ensuring every sale that occurs at our shop is lawful, has always been and will always remain the highest priority for our business,” Eagleton said in the statement.Alissa was convicted in 2018 of misdemeanour assault after he knocked a fellow high school student to the floor, climbed on top of him and punched him in the head several times, according to police documents. He was sentenced to probation and community service.Colorado has a universal background check law covering almost all gun sales, but misdemeanour convictions generally do not prevent people from purchasing weapons. If Alissa had been convicted of a felony, his gun purchase would have been prohibited under federal law.An arrest affidavit said Alissa bought a Ruger AR-556 pistol, which resembles an AR-15 rifle with a slightly shorter stock.Alissa, who lived in Arvada, was born in Syria in 1999, came to the U.S. as a toddler and later became a U.S. citizen, according to two law enforcement officials. He would need to be a citizen to buy a gun. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Dougherty, the district attorney, said Friday that the FBI and other agencies were looking into the background of Alissa and the victims and didn’t yet have information to share.The AR-15-style gun was recovered inside the supermarket and is believed to have been used in the attack, said a law enforcement official briefed on the shooting who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Alissa made his first court appearance Thursday, where his public defender asked for the mental health evaluation but provided no details about Alissa's mental health. He is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder over shots fired at a police officer who was not hurt.Alissa entered court in a wheelchair, presumably because of a gunshot wound to the leg he got in the gunbattle with police. He was last seen handcuffed and being led out of the supermarket by police Monday. He had removed all clothing except his shorts before being taken into custody, and his leg was bloody.A rifle, a green tactical vest and a handgun were recovered inside the store, according to the arrest affidavit.Alissa was treated at a hospital before police transferred him to jail. He has since been moved to a jail outside Boulder County due to safety concerns stemming from threats made against him, county sheriff's spokeswoman Carrie Haverfield said in a statement Friday.Alissa is jailed without bail and has not entered a plea, which will come later. His next court hearing will not be scheduled for two to three months to allow his attorneys to evaluate his mental state and evidence collected by investigators.Officer Eric Talley's funeral has been scheduled for Tuesday in the city of Lafayette. Talley, 51, who joined the Police Department in 2010, had seven children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-colorado-shooting-suspect-passed-background-check-in-legal-gun-purchase-101616779505071.html

Covax needs 10 million doses immediately as an urgent stop-gap measure so these 20 countries can start vaccinating their health workers and older people within the next two weeks," Tedros said."So today I'm asking countries with doses of vaccines that have WHO emergency use listing to donate as many doses as they can to help us meet that target."Ten million doses is not much and it is not nearly enough, but it is a start," he said.The Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme ensures that 92 of the poorest countries in the world can access vaccines, with the cost covered by donors.The scheme aims to distribute enough doses to vaccinate up to 27 percent of their populations by the end of the year.It was supposed to deliver some 238 million doses by the end of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-urges-countries-to-donate-10-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-immediately-101616778727854.html

He said the high-tech weaponry on both sides could lead to a very gave conflict.Amid worsening relations between China and the West on a range of issues from human rights and trade to Hong Kong, Taiwan has said China is bolstering its ability to attack and blockade the China-claimed island.Kissinger said the United States would likely find it difficult to negotiate with a rival like China that would soon be larger and more advanced in some areas.The other question, he said, was whether or not China would accept that new order.Kissinger praised China's skill at organising itself for technological advance under state control.But he said the West had to up its game."The West has to believe in itself," Kissinger said. "That is our domestic problem - it is not a Chinese problem."He added that China's economic might did not automatically mean that it will be superior in all aspects of technology this century.Kissinger negotiated on behalf of Nixon to open China to the West in 1971 without telling George H.W. Bush, who was then Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, about the talks.Asked about Brexit, Kissinger said he had refused to campaign against leaving the EU as he saw a role for an "autonomous" Britain as a bridge between the United States and the rest of Europe.

26-03-2021||World||'Yes or no?' US lawmakers fume over Big Tech's answers on misinformation||In their first appearance before Congress since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter were asked by US lawmakers whether their platforms bore some responsibility for the riot: "yes or no?"Social media has been widely blamed for amplifying calls to violence and spreading misinformation that contributed to the Jan. 6 attempt to violently overturn the election results.Only Twitter Inc CEO Jack Dorsey replied "yes" to the question, but said the "broader ecosystem" had to be taken into account. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google parent Alphabet Inc, said the company always feels a sense of responsibility but it was a complex question.Facebook Inc's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company was responsible for building "effective systems". He also said that the rioters and former President Donald Trump should be held accountable.Lawmakers widely slammed the platforms' approach to false or dangerous content. The three companies have taken steps to curb misinformation but researchers have shown it is still widely present on the platforms."We fled as a mob desecrated the Capitol, the House floor, and our democratic process," said Democratic Representative Mike Doyle, who asked the CEOs about their responsibility. "That attack, and the movement that motivated it, started and was nourished on your platforms," he added.The hearing was virtual but advocacy group SumOfUs erected cut-outs of the three CEOs dressed as Jan. 6 rioters on the National Mall near the Capitol. One showed Zuckerberg as the "QAnon Shaman," a shirtless rioter wearing horns.In the joint hearing, held by two subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, lawmakers also questioned the executives on the proliferation of Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation and raised concerns about the impact of social media on children - including asking questions about Facebook's plan to create a version of Instagram for kids."Your business model itself has become the problem and the time for self-regulation is over. It's time we legislate to hold you accountable," said Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, chair of the Energy and Commerce committee.Some lawmakers are calling for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability over user content, to be scrapped or rejigged. There are several pieces of legislation from Democrats to reform Section 230 that are doing the rounds in Congress, though progress has been slow. Several Republican lawmakers have also been pushing separately to scrap the law entirely.In written testimony released on Wednesday, Facebook argued that Section 230 should be redone to allow companies immunity from liability for what users put on their platforms only if they follow best practices for removing damaging material.Pichai and Dorsey said in the hearing they were open to some of the changes in Facebook's proposal. Pichai said there were some "good proposals." Dorsey endorsed some of the suggestions from Zuckerberg but said it would be difficult to distinguish between small and large services.Republicans on the panel also criticized the tech giants for what they see as efforts to stifle conservative voices.Trump was banned by Twitter over inciting violence around Jan. 6, while Facebook has asked its independent oversight board to rule on whether to bar him permanently. He is still suspended from YouTube.At one point in the hearing, Dorsey appeared to grow frustrated and tweeted "?" with a poll asking Twitter users to vote "yes" or "no." There were more than 40,000 votes cast in about 30 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yes-or-no-us-lawmakers-fume-over-big-tech-s-answers-on-misinformation-101616778375779.html
26-03-2021||World||Italian PM Draghi says some drug firms appear to have double-sold vaccines||Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi firmly backed new European Union restrictions on vaccine exports while taking a swipe at pharmaceutical companies that give the impression that they may have sold their products “two or three times.”As Italy prepares to slightly ease its latest lockdown, with a plan that includes reopening schools for children up to the age of 11 starting in early April, the premier told reporters in Rome that blocking selected vaccine exports outside the EU remains an option for the bloc.“The impression is that some companies -- I won’t name any names -- sold things two or three times,” Draghi said. He added that a total blockade on virus exports outside the union would “fuel political tension.”Speaking a day after Thursday’s virtual summit of EU leaders, the former head of the European Central Bank said individual export bans “must be considered, especially for companies which don’t respect contracts.”Export RestrictionsEU leaders have guardedly supported a plan to restrict vaccine exports after it emerged that the bloc has sent more shots to the rest of the world than it’s given its own citizens. The strong-arm tactics, however, risk leading to retaliatory measures that could jeopardize the supply of ingredients and equipment for vaccine plants in Europe.Draghi, whose country along with the EU blocked an AstraZeneca Plc vaccine shipment to Australia, is seeking to accelerate a national inoculation campaign, with lockdown measures weighing on an economy that shrank by almost 9% last year.“Right now the emphasis is all on export blocks but we won’t get out of this with blocks but with vaccine production,” Draghi said. “That’s the only thing that will get us out of the pandemic.”The premier rejected a call from Austria and several other countries to overhaul the way vaccines are shared. “Some countries decided to focus on AstraZeneca, maybe also because it cost less,” Draghi said. “The situation in Austria is not dramatic, they have a higher vaccination rate than we do.”Almost 10% of the Italian population has received at least one vaccine dose, compared with 26% in the US and 43% in the UK. Draghi said that in mid-April he’ll seek parliamentary approval to widen Italy’s budget deficit to allow further economic stimulus. The premier needs a new stimulus program within weeks to bankroll higher monthly lockdown costs of as much as 15 billion euros ($18 billion) and keep the economy afloat, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Draghi called for a new fiscal framework for the EU, pointing to the US as a model with a union of capital markets and a complete banking union. He stressed the need for a common European bond as a long-term objective.Italy plans to reach 80% vaccine coverage by the end of September, and Draghi has said the country will triple daily vaccinations to about 500,000 in mid-April, exceeding that pace in May-June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-draghi-says-some-drug-firms-appear-to-have-double-sold-vaccines-101616776607157.html
26-03-2021||World||Maritime traffic jam grows outside blocked Suez Canal, salvage effort continues||A maritime traffic jam grew to more than 200 vessels Friday outside the Suez Canal and some vessels began changing course as dredgers worked frantically to free a giant container ship that is stuck sideways in the waterway and disrupting global shipping.One salvage expert said freeing the cargo ship, the Ever Given, could take up to a week in the best-case scenario and warned of possible structural problems on the vessel as it remains wedged.The Suez Canal Authority said it welcomed international offers of help, including one from the United States, although it did not say what was offered.The Ever Given, owned by the Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, got wedged Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez.A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specializing in salvaging, is working with the canal authority. using tugboats and a specialized suction dredger that is trying to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the bow. Egyptian authorities have prohibited media access to the site.An attempt Friday to free it failed, said Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the technical manager of the Ever Given. Plans are in the works to pump water from interior spaces of the vessel, and two more tugs should arrive by Sunday, the company said.An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause, the company said. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, had previously said the ship had experienced a power blackout, but it did not elaborate.Bernhard Schulte said two canal pilots had been aboard the ship when it got stuck. Such an arrangement is customary, but the ship’s captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel, according to shipping experts.In addition to the over 200 vessels waiting near the canal, more than 100 ships were en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv.Apparently anticipating long delays, the owners of the stuck vessel diverted a sister ship, the Ever Greet, to head around Africa instead, according to satellite data.Others also are being diverted to avoid the canal. The liquid natural gas carrier Pan Americas changed course in the mid-Atlantic, now aiming south to go around the southern tip of Africa, according to satellite data from MarineTraffic.com.About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East.Freeing the Ever Given is “quite a challenge” and could take five days to a week, .Capt. Nick Sloane, a maritime salvage expert who led the high-profile effort to salvage the cruise ship Costa Concordia in 2012 told The Associated Press.The Ever Given’s location, size and a large amount of cargo make the operation more complex, Sloane said. The operation should focus initially on dredging the bank and seafloor around it to get it floating again, rather than unloading its cargo, which could take weeks.That’s because the clock is also ticking structurally for the vessel, he added.“The longer it takes, the worse the condition of the ship will become, because she’s slowly sagging,” said Sloane, vice president of the International Salvage Union. “So ships are designed to flex, but not to be kept at that position with a full load of cargo for weeks at a time. So it’s not an easy situation.”International companies are preparing for the effect that the canal’s blockage will have on supply chains that rely on precise deliveries of goods. Singapore’s Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung said the country’s port should expect disruptions.“Should that happen, some draw down on inventories will become necessary,” he said on Facebook.The backlog of vessels could stress European ports and the international supply of containers, already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, according to IHS Markit, a business research group. It said 49 container ships were scheduled to pass through the canal in the week since the Ever Given became lodged.The delay could also result in huge insurance claims by companies, according to Marcus Baker, global head of Marine & Cargo at the insurance broker Marsh, with a ship like the Ever Given usually covered at between $100 million to $200 million.Those trying to free the vessel want to avoid complications that could extend the canal closure, according to an Egyptian official at the canal authority. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to journalists.Satellite and photos distributed by the canal authority show Ever Given’s bow touching the eastern wall, while its stern appeared lodged against the western wall.The Ever Given was involved in an accident in northern Germany in 2019, when it ran into a small ferry moored on the Elbe River in Hamburg. No passengers were on the ferry at the time and there were no injuries, but it was seriously damaged.Hamburg prosecutors opened an investigation of the Ever Given’s captain and pilot on suspicion of endangering shipping traffic, but shelved it in 2020 for lack of evidence, spokeswoman Liddy Oechtering told The Associated Press.Oechtering also could not say what the investigation had determined the cause of the crash was, but officials at the time suggested that strong winds may have blown the slow-moving cargo ship into the ferry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maritime-traffic-jam-grows-outside-blocked-suez-canal-salvage-effort-continues-101616773290906.html
26-03-2021||World||Covid-19 originated from Wuhan lab, says former CDC chief||A former top US health official says he thinks the coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, and began spreading as early as September 2019.Robert Redfield, who led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, told CNN in a clip aired Friday that he thinks that scenario is more likely than any alternative, including that the virus erupted after transferring from animals to humans or in a live-animal market.The most likely origin “was from a laboratory -- you know, escaped,” said Redfield, who served during former President Donald Trump’s administration. “Other people don’t believe that. That’s fine. Science will eventually figure it out.”Redfield added that he was “not implying any intentionality,” or accusing China of purposefully releasing it, and that he guesses the virus “started transmitting somewhere in September, October, in Wuhan.”Trump frequently assigned blame to China for the pandemic, calling it the “China Virus” and even “Kung Flu,” descriptions that have been criticized as helping to spawn a barrage of attacks on Asian Americans.The origin of the virus remains unclear and is a matter of dispute. Anthony Fauci, one of President Joe Biden’s top health advisers, said Friday that Redfield’s view isn’t held by a majority of health officials.The World Health Organization is due to release a report on its origins this month, informed by a team of 17 international scientists. There are four main theories, including that it came from a lab, but research by the scientists involved shows the most likely is that the virus was transferred to humans after spreading, and adapting, from bats to an intermediary host species. It’s not clear what species that was.The WHO research also found no evidence that the virus spread before December 2019, suggesting the first cases probably began no earlier than late November -- a more recent timeline than Redfield is suggesting.Redfield said the virus’s strength, in how easily it spreads, suggests it was being developed in a lab. If it had come from animals, it would have likely taken more time to adapt to spreading between humans, he said.“I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human -- and, at that moment in time, the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity for human-to-human transmission,” Redfield said. “It takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient in human-to-human transmission. I just don’t think this makes biological sense.”He was asked whether he believes the lab was working to specifically make the virus more efficient. “Let’s just say, I have a coronavirus, and I’m working on it -- most of us in the lab are trying to grow virus,” he said. “We try to make it grow better and better and better and better, so we can do experiments and figure out about it. That’s the way I put it together.”Fauci -- the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who worked with Redfield but remains in his post -- said Redfield was expressing an opinion that isn’t widely held.“The alternative explanation, which most public health individuals go by, is that this virus was actually circulating in China, likely in Wuhan, for a month or more before they were clinically recognized at the end of December,” Fauci said at a press briefing Friday. That means “the virus clearly could have adapted itself” during that time.The current CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, declined to comment at the same press briefing on Friday, saying she didn’t have any information for or against any hypothesis. “We are looking forward to a WHO report that should be coming out soon that examines the origins of this pandemic,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-originated-from-wuhan-lab-says-former-cdc-chief-101616773635223.html
26-03-2021||World||Germany raises Covid-19 warning for France after latest spike in infections||Germany raised its Covid warning on France after a rapid rise in cases there as the European Union’s two biggest countries try to deal with a resurgent pandemic that’s compounding political damage from chaotic vaccination rollouts.France is now rated a high-incidence virus area, Germany’s health authority RKI said in an update on travel recommendations. The move means that travelers from France require a negative Covid test before entering.Meanwhile, France extended a lockdown to three additional regions to try to halt the spread of the virus.Those moves are just the latest in what’s been yet another dramatic week for the EU, involving infighting between governments over vaccines, tensions with the UK over export controls, and an investigation into a stash of AstraZeneca Plc vaccines in Italy.Voters trying to keep up have been whipsawed by developments, most notably when German Chancellor Angela Merkel had to call off a planned five-day lockdown over Easter after an intense backlash. That dramatic move encapsulated the view that Europe’s leaders are failing to get to grip with a situation that is costing lives daily.German Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday that cases are rising too rapidly and the virus variants are a dangerous driver of this trend. The number of people who have tested positive out of 100,000 over the past seven days has nearly doubled in the past month to 119.1, according to RKI.“If this continues unchecked, we will face the danger that our health care system will reach capacity during the month of April,” Spahn said.Germany will also introduce mandatory testing for everyone entering the country via air. From Monday, airlines have to make sure everyone is tested before boarding the plane.“This is a precautionary measure to prevent the virus to spread because of holiday trips,” Spahn said.France’s situation looks even worse. With close to 4,700 people placed in intensive care as of Thursday, the number is approaching the peak seen last fall, at 4,900, according the French health authorities. The Covid incidence rate is at 325, almost triple Germany’s.Despite the deteriorating situation, French President Emmanuel Macron has ignored calls to put the country under a third nation-wide lockdown. He’s also defended his decision, saying numbers earlier in the year didn’t justify such action.“I have no mea culpa to make, no remorse, no failure to declare,” Macron told reporters on Thursday.Amid the Covid surge, European leaders are pushing to speed up their rollout of vaccinations, and are counting on a rapid pickup of deliveries in the second quarter.There was some good news on that front on Friday, when the European Medicines Agency approved two vaccination plants in the Netherlands and Germany.One of those is the Dutch Halix plant, which makes the drug substance for the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine and has been at the center of talks between the UK and the EU over a claim on the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-raises-covid-19-warning-for-france-after-latest-spike-in-infections-101616772509901.html

Another police official, Mohammad Alauddin, said a Chittagong hospital had received eight people with gunshot wounds, adding: "Among them four succumbed to their injuries."He identified the dead as three students and a tailor.Modi landed in Dhaka on Friday for a two-day visit to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence.After being received by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Modi met opposition and government leaders.Hundreds of protesters then clashed with police near a large mosque in Dhaka, witness Jahangir Alam said. He said dozens were hurt when police fired rubber bullets and teargas after protesters pelted them with stones and set ablaze motorcycles.Social media network Facebook and its Messenger app, which are often used to organise protests in the country, appeared to be down in some parts of Bangladesh.An official from Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission declined to comment.

She is currently a fellow at Harvard Law School’s labour and work-life programme. She grew up in Connecticut and went to Brown University and Boston College Law School. Biden, who announced Nanda’s nomination along with other senior positions on Friday, has named more than two dozen Indian-Americans to senior positions in his administration, including Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, and Vinay Reddy as director of the president’s team of speechwriters. Neera Tanden was the president’s nominee to a cabinet position before she withdrew in the face of bipartisan opposition to her nomination over controversial tweets in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-nominates-seema-nanda-as-solicitor-in-department-of-labour-101616771669709.html

Krisp, which discovered a new strain in South Africa last year that propelled a resurgence of infections in the country, found the new variant in travellers arriving in Angola from Tanzania.“It is potentially of interest,” de Oliveira said in an interview on Friday.Variants of the coronavirus have caused concern globally as, for instance, the one first identified in South Africa known as 501Y.V2 has proven more infectious and able to more easily evade some vaccines. Still, no work has been done yet on the version found in three Tanzanian travellers to ascertain whether it is more infectious or severe than other strains.The newly discovered version will be grown at laboratories at Krisp and an attempt will be made to ascertain how easily it evades antibodies, de Oliveira said. The variant comes from a lineage of the virus first identified in China, whereas many others trace their roots to Europe.Under recently deceased President John Magufuli, Tanzania stopped releasing data on coronavirus infections and opened up the economy including the resort island of Zanzibar, which attracts international tourists. Magufuli’s stance attracted criticism from neighbours and the WHO as anecdotal evidence suggested many people in the country have contracted the disease.His successor, Samia Suluhu Hassan, has yet to indicate whether she will change his policies.“This may be a big wake up call to Tanzania,” de Oliveira said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-mutated-covid-19-variant-yet-found-in-travellers-from-tanzania-101616771190577.html

The World Food Programme (WFP) won last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-civil-disobedience-movement-nominated-for-2022-nobel-peace-prize-101616770900720.html
26-03-2021||World||Republican Mitt Romney gets Profile in Courage Award for impeachment vote||US Sen. Mitt Romney was named the recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on Friday for splitting with his party and becoming the only Republican to vote to convict former President Donald Trump during his first impeachment trial.The award was created by the family of the late president to honor public figures who risk their careers by embracing unpopular positions for the greater good, and is named after Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “Profiles in Courage."“Senator Romney's commitment to our Constitution makes him a worthy successor to the senators who inspired my father to write ‘Profiles in Courage,' ” Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, said in a statement from the JFK Library Foundation. “He reminds us that our Democracy depends on the courage, conscience and character of our elected officials.”Romney, 74, said he is inspired by the memory of his late father, George Romney, an automotive executive and governor of Michigan.“When I think of courage, I think of my Dad,” said the Utah Republican, who is also the former governor of Massachusetts. “He did what was right regardless of consequence. I aspire to his example, though I have failed from time to time. We must subordinate our political fortunes to the causes of freedom, equal opportunity and truth, particularly as they are under assault here and abroad.”Trump's first trial in 2020 focused on the former president's relationship with Ukraine. Romney became the first senator in US history to vote for the conviction of a president who belonged to his own party, and was subject to intense criticism and even threats from Trump's supporters.But he did not back down, the foundation said.When Trump and many Republicans questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, Romney defended the integrity of the results and opposed efforts to overturn them.After the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection by Trump's supporters at the US Capitol, Romney called on his fellow Republican senators to stand up for the truth about the election. At Trump’s second impeachment trial, Romney was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict the former president of inciting the attack.Kennedy's book recounts the stories of eight US senators who risked their careers by taking principled stands for unpopular positions. The award was created by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation in 1989.Romney will be presented with the award, a sterling silver lantern symbolizing a beacon of hope, at a virtual ceremony in May.Previous winners have included Presidents Barack Obama, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush; US Sen. John McCain; and Liberian peace activist and Nobel laureate Leymah Gbowee. The recipients are selected by a bipartisan 15-member panel of national leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-mitt-romney-gets-profile-in-courage-award-for-impeachment-vote-101616770106174.html
26-03-2021||World||Vaccine row escalates as France accuses UK of 'blackmail'||A row over Covid-19 vaccine access escalated Friday, with France accusing Britain of "blackmail" in its dealings with the EU, and Russia and China of misusing vaccines to boost their foreign policy clout.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian's salvo came a day after the European Union threatened to ban pharma firms from exporting coronavirus vaccines to the UK and other well-supplied countries until they make good on their promised deliveries to the bloc.British-based AstraZeneca would likely be the first target of any such restrictions.The UK, Le Drian said, was under pressure because it lacked doses for second vaccine shots."The United Kingdom has taken great pride in vaccinating well with the first dose except they have a problem with the second dose," he told France Info radio."You are vaccinated when you have had both doses. Today there are as many people vaccinated with both in France as the United Kingdom," he added.'A bit handicapped'According to data compiled by AFP, Britain has administered two vaccine doses to 4.1 percent of its population, against 3.9 percent overall in France."You can't be playing like this, a bit of blackmail, just because you hurried to get people vaccinated with a first shot, and now you're a bit handicapped because you don't have the second one," Le Drian added.Le Drian did not say what precisely constituted the alleged British blackmail, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson had warned earlier in the week that trade "blockades" would chill investment."I would just gently point out to anybody considering a blockade, or interruption of supply chains, that companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed," he told lawmakers.The latest EU-UK row centres on an AstraZeneca plant in the Netherlands, which Johnson's government claims as part of the British vaccine supply chain.'New type of world war'Any suggestions of British vaccine selfishness have found robust responses in British media, with The Times accusing President Emmanuel Macron of "evident anglophobia" and "petty jingoism", and The Sun calling him "arrogant".EU chief Ursula von der Leyen's stark warning of a vaccine export stop came after a video summit of all 27 EU leaders and stoked fears that cross-Channel rivalry could damage global efforts to combat the pandemic.France has made clear it sees vaccine policies feeding not just European, but global competition for influence."We are looking at a new type of world war," Macron said after the EU summit. "We are looking in particular at Russian and Chinese attacks and attempts to gain influence through the vaccine."This situation, he said, meant the EU had to strengthen its own vaccine capabilities.- 'Absolutely disagree' -His foreign minister on Friday also accused Russia and China of using their vaccines to gain influence abroad even before they had finished inoculating their own populations, a claim rejected by Moscow."We absolutely disagree with the fact that both Russia and China are waging some kind of war," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. "And we absolutely disagree with the fact that Russia and China are using the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines as tools of influence."Russia and China have, for their part, accused Western countries of hoarding vaccines to the detriment of poor nations.Russia has applied to Europe's medicines regulator EMA to gain approval for the use of its Sputnik V vaccine in the 27-nation bloc, but is still waiting for an answer.The German government said Friday that it would be open to using Sputnik V once it had EMA approval.In the meantime the developers are pushing Sputnik V -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- in other regions and say the jab has been registered in 55 countries around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-row-escalates-as-france-accuses-uk-of-blackmail-101616769002928.html

26-03-2021||World||Taiwan reports largest ever incursion by Chinese air force||Twenty Chinese military aircraft entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone on Friday, in the largest incursion yet reported by the island's defence ministry and marking a dramatic escalation of tension across the Taiwan Strait.The island's defence ministry said the air force deployed missiles to "monitor" the incursion into the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone. It also said its planes warned the Chinese aircraft, including by radio.It marked the largest incursion to date by the Chinese air force since Taiwan's defence ministry began disclosing almost daily Chinese military flights over the waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea last year.Some of the Chinese aircraft flew in the airspace to the south of Taiwan and passed through the Bashi Channel which separates the island from the Philippines, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement.A person familiar with Taiwan's security planning told Reuters the Chinese military was conducting exercises that would simulate an operation against U.S. warships that sail through the Bashi Channel.China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up military activities near the democratic island in recent months, a move Taiwan says jeopardizes regional stability.The presence of so many Chinese combat aircraft on Friday's mission - Taiwan said it was made up of four nuclear-capable H-6K bombers and 10 J-16 fighter jets, among others - was unusual and came as the island's air force suspended all training missions after two fighter jet crashes this week.There was no immediate comment from China's defence ministry. Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country's determination to defend its sovereignty.Earlier on Friday, Taiwan and the United States signed their first agreement under the administration of new president Joe Biden, establishing a Coast Guard Working Group to coordinate policy, after China's passing of a law that allows its coast guard to fire on foreign vessels.While the United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself and is the island's main arms supplier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reports-largest-ever-incursion-by-chinese-air-force-101616767982152.html

26-03-2021||World||US Senate panel splits along party lines on Justice Dept nominee Vanita Gupta||The Senate Judiciary Committee has ended in a tie vote over the nomination of Indian-American civil rights lawyer Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general of the United States, amid objections from the Republicans.The committee on Thursday voted 11-11 on Gupta’s nomination. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, can now file a discharge motion on her nomination to allow a full Senate vote on her nomination.If confirmed, Gupta, 46, would be the first woman of colour to serve as associate attorney general, and the first civil rights lawyer to serve in one of the top three positions at the US Department of Justice. More than 100 organisations have urged the Senate to confirm Gupta.“Under the provisions of S. Res. 27, Leader Schumer may now file a discharge motion on Ms Gupta’s nomination to place her on the executive calendar,” the Senate Judiciary Committee said after it voted for the nomination of Vanita Gupta to be US Associate Attorney General by a vote of 11-11.Ahead of the vote, all Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote a letter to Senator Durbin demanding a second confirmation hearing on Gupta.“While under oath, Vanita Gupta misled the Committee on at least four issues: Her support for eliminating qualified immunity; her support for decriminalising all drugs; her support for defunding the police; and her death penalty record," they wrote."Unfortunately, in her responses a week later to our written questions, Ms.Gupta was no more forthcoming. In some cases, she doubled down on her misleading statements from the hearing, and in others, she refused to answer altogether," the Republican senators wrote.“We urge you to immediately schedule a second hearing with Ms. Gupta so that she can answer for her misleading statements, and for her refusal to respond to our written questions," they wrote.Dick Durbin, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "Vanita Gupta is an exceptionally well-qualified person to be Associate Attorney General… her extensive support from prominent conservatives is not an aberration," said Senator"It is the natural result of the fact that she has worked across the partisan divide throughout her entire career,” Durbin said.In his remarks during the voting process, Durbin said that he is “struggling to understand” the fierce opposition of the Republicans to this nominee.“She is extraordinary. She has the support of law enforcement groups that any one of us would be proud to have. And yet, she continues to be labelled as soft on crime or wanting to defund the police, and there’s no truth to that whatsoever,” Durbin said.The Democrats alleged that during the Judiciary Committee’s vote on Gupta’s nomination to be Associate Attorney General, Committee Republicans did everything in their power to block the vote on this highly qualified and historic nominee – filibustering for nearly two hours and then invoking an obscure Senate rule to prevent the Committee from meeting beyond 12:00 PM.“This obstruction of a nominee with broad support from across the political spectrum left Chair Durbin with no option but to call a roll call vote before the Committee meeting was terminated by Republicans’ invocation of this rule,” said a media release issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee.Meanwhile, on the Senate floor, Republican Senator John Cornyn discussed the alleged ties of Gupta to the firm Avantor, which sells a chemical that has been linked to the illicit drug trade in Mexico.“The nominee for the third highest-ranking position at the Department of Justice has profited to the tune of millions of dollars from Avantor stock,” he alleged.“Vanita Gupta has been nominated to serve as the Associate Attorney General and she is a very large shareholder in this publicly-traded company. This isn't just a blind investment in a mutual fund, this is the family business. Ms. Gupta's father is Avantor’s Chairman of the Board,” Cornyn said.“I cannot support the nomination of Ms Gupta to serve as Associate Attorney General and I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose her nomination as well,” he said.In a statement after the split vote, Wade Henderson, interim president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said that Gupta is exactly the leader the country needs in this role at this critical moment.“Now is not the time for baseless and harmful partisan tactics. With broad support that crosses ideological divides, Gupta is a consensus builder who will bring vital civil rights and racial justice experience to the Justice Department. The country needs Gupta and her experience in this important role now, and the Senate must take swift and immediate action to confirm her,” he said.Gupta currently is president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. She previously served as Acting Assistant Attorney General and head of the US Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration.The Heritage Foundation think tank, alleged that Gupta is a far-Left partisan activist who supports defunding the police and packing the Supreme Court, among a host of other extreme policies.“While President Biden gives lip service to unity and bipartisanship, Gupta’s nomination continues a disturbing trend of bowing to the liberal wing of his party when making nominations for key posts in his administration. Senators should reject Vanita Gupta for this post,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-splits-along-party-lines-on-justice-dept-nominee-vanita-gupta-101616767140673.html

The black Mujib jackets have been designed with 6 buttons, two pockets on the lower half and a front pocket on the left, as worn by Rahman.In keeping with the eco-friendly nature of the Khadi fabric, the covers for these jackets too have been made of black Khadi cotton fabric with Khadi India’s logo embroidered over it.During the National Day event, Prime Minister Modi handed over the Gandhi Peace Prize 2020, being conferred by India upon Rahman, to his daughters -- Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana."This is one of the most memorable days of my life. I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with Gandhi Peace Prize," said Modi.The Gandhi Peace Prize is an annual award instituted by the government of India since 1995, the 125th birth anniversary commemoration year of Mahatma Gandhi.The Gandhi Peace Prize 2020 was conferred on Bangabandhu early this week. It was for the first time that the award was given away posthumously.Modi arrived in Bangladesh on a two-day visit to attend the celebrations of the golden jubilee of the country's independence, the birth centenary of Rahman and hold talks with his counterpart Hasina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-dons-mujib-jacket-as-he-pays-tribute-to-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-101616765742943.html

The United States is leading the immunisation drive with over 133 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine already administered, which is more than one-fourth of the total Covid-19 shots administered globally.According to a CNN report, most US states have announced their plan to open up immunisation for all eligible individuals, which means 16 and older will be able to get Pfizer-BioNTech jab while 18 and older will be able to receive Moderna’s and Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccines. The states that have already opened vaccination for the general public are Mississippi, Alaska, West Virginia, Utah, Georgia and Arizona.Here’s the schedule announced by other states, according to CNN, to open vaccination eligibility to the general public:March 29: Oklahoma, Texas, Ohio, North Dakota, LouisianaMarch 30: MinnesotaMarch 31: IndianaApril 1: Montana, ConnecticutApril 2: New HampshireApril 5: Michigan, Tennessee, Idaho, Iowa, Florida, NevadaApril 7: North CarolinaApril 9: MissouriApril 12: Illinois, KentuckyApril 15: CaliforniaApril 19: Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode IslandApril 27: MarylandMay 1: Wisconsin, Oregon, South Dakota, WashingtonMay 3: South CarolinaNew Mexico, Virginia, Colorado have planned to open up the vaccination in April but haven’t set an exact date. On the other hand, Nebraska, Kansas, Hawaii, Delaware have indicated to allow vaccination for all individuals in May or later. It is still unclear when Alabama, Arkansas, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wyoming will allow vaccination for the general public.The United States has crossed the grim milestone of 30 million Covid-19 cases and has reported more than 546,000 related deaths so far, the highest in the world. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a new vaccination goal of 200 million Covid-19 shots within his first 100 days in office. The earlier goal of 100 million doses of vaccine to be administered within the same time frame was reached ahead of the schedule last Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-these-us-states-have-shared-plan-to-vaccinate-general-public-101616765202844.html

This time, India handed over 109 ambulances for the people of Bangladesh. I extend my heartiest thanks to PM Modi, his government and the people of India. Before this, India had cooperated with us and gifted us vaccines for Covid,” Prime minister Hasina said while addressing an event to mark Bangladesh's National Day.Also Read: PM Modi meets 'Muktijoddhas' of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War"India is not only our next-door neighbour, we have a historical, social, cultural heritage and geographical rapport. The people and government of India were immensely involved in the evolution process of Bangladesh during our liberation war in 1971," she said.Remembering the military coup of 1975, in which her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed, she said, "I remember with great anguish, August 15 1975 - a dark night for Bangladesh when the Father of the Nation was assassinated. My mother, three brothers, two sisters-in-law, a 10-year-old brother, and uncle were brutally assassinated, and I remember all those who attained martyrdom that night.”“During those difficult times, India sheltered about 10 million people who fled from Bangladesh in the face of persecution by Pakistani soldiers, in the face of killing, genocide and rape. India gave them shelter, food and medication. They helped our freedom fighters with all types of cooperation," she said.Hasina was addressing the event, of which PM Modi was also a part, at the National Parade Ground in Dhaka. PM Modi is on a visit to the country after the Bangladesh government invited him to take part in the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of its independence. The invite is seen as a step towards strengthening the 50-year-old diplomatic ties between the two nations.Bangladesh is also celebrating the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is also the recipient of this year's Gandhi Peace Prize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/during-our-good-times-and-bad-bangladesh-pm-expresses-gratitude-to-india-101616765520510.html
26-03-2021||World||How UK Covid variant tore through an English island and onto the world stage||Warm weather brings tourists to the Isle of Sheppey, a flat, marshy island near the mouth of the River Thames. Each summer, they fill Sheppey's many caravan parks or flock to villages with seaside attractions geared toward old-school British tourists: pubs and penny arcades, mini-golf and fish and chips.Another kind of visitor stays all year round. Clustered in fields and marshes in eastern Sheppey are three prisons holding about 2,500 men. Giant wind turbines stand like sentries outside the lichen-clad walls of HMP Elmley, the largest of the three, where a 52-year-old prison officer named Paul Tottman worked.On Oct. 28, a Wednesday, he returned home "very angry," said his wife, Laura. Covid-19 infections among HMP Elmley's staff and prisoners were rising, and Tottman, who was asthmatic, felt vulnerable. On Thursday, she said, the prison called to tell Tottman that he had been in contact with a Covid-positive person and should self-isolate. Soon, Tottman also tested positive, and was feverish and fighting for breath.Sheppey had barely been touched by the pandemic's first wave last spring. This time, the disease tore through the prison and across the island. It hit the Tottman family hard. Laura and their daughter Hattie fell ill, and within a week of his test, Paul was taken to hospital. "Then it started to go downhill," Laura said.Sheppey has been prone to invasion ever since Ivar the Boneless and his Viking hordes conquered it in the ninth century. The arrival of a deadlier and more transmissible variant of coronavirus – the B.1.1.7 "variant of concern" – was also swift and destructive. Although scientists say the first known case was later traced elsewhere in the county of Kent, it was Sheppey and its borough of Swale where the variant first took hold.The new variant quickly spread from Kent across London and southern England, going from an estimated 3% of cases in England at the end of October to 96% at the start of February. The surge pushed Britain's Covid death toll into six figures; it now stands at 126,000. Two-thirds of those deaths have occurred since Sept. 20, when the variant was first detected.The so-called Kent or UK variant has now been reported in more than 100 countries. Recent research has shown that it is not only more contagious but also more deadly, although existing vaccines still work against it. The variant's arrival has fuelled a rise in infections elsewhere in Europe that threatens to outpace sluggish vaccination programs. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts it will be America's dominant variant by the end of this month; experts warn that the country should be bracing for impact and not – as many states are – loosening restrictions.The Kent variant was identified by the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, or COG-UK, a unique scientific endeavour set up last March to explore how genomic research might help tackle the pandemic. Since it emerged in 2019, the coronavirus has mutated thousands of times. These mutations can be tracked by sequencing, or "reading," their complete set of genetic instructions, or genomes.Solving the mystery of the Kent variant was a race against time by the COG-UK scientists, who have sequenced almost half of the world's catalogue of Covid-19 genomes. The first case of B.1.1.7 was later traced back to September, but scientists didn't fully connect it to the surge in cases until December, when they confirmed their fears: The variant was so transmissible, it was leap-frogging restrictions put in place to tackle the virus.At the time, COG-UK was sequencing about 9,000 samples a week, using leftover swabs from the labs where most of Britain's Covid-19 tests are processed. For most of last year, that process took about two weeks. But collecting and sequencing genomes is – relatively speaking – the easy part. Much harder is quickly establishing whether a variant is more contagious or deadly – or, in B.1.1.7's case, both. A range of factors can explain a jump in infections, from a super-spreader event to a change in human behaviour as hot weather turns to cold.Also, although two weeks between swabbing and sequencing is fast by the standards of genomic research, it wasn't fast enough to keep up with a highly transmissible variant. While scientists puzzled from afar, funeral directors on Sheppey worked 18-hour days to cope with the dead, and Kent's hospitals filled up with patients who were often too sick to save.In the end, COG-UK's scientists relied upon a timely tipoff from a distant colleague and a hack involving Covid tests to zero in on the Kent variant and more quickly confirm how dangerous it was. "There wasn't some set method for detecting a variant like this," said Erik Volz, a genetic epidemiologist at Imperial College London and member of COG-UK. "We had to do it on the fly and develop methods as we went."Although the scientists couldn't stop the variant's conquest of Britain, they had become a warning system for the world. And Sheppey had become an improbable breeding ground for a variant that spans the globe.The island as a place apartSheppey is no stranger to contagion. Off its western coast lies Deadman's Island, a mudbank strewn with human bones thought to belong to men and boys who died of infectious diseases on prison ships moored nearby in centuries past. One such disease was "marsh fever," later known as malaria, carried by Sheppey's swamp-bred mosquitoes. Britain's last major outbreak of malaria happened on the island, brought there by troops returning from World War One. (After an earlier conflict – the Battle of Trafalgar – Admiral Nelson's body was brought ashore at Sheppey preserved in a barrel of booze.)The tidal strait that separates Sheppey from the rest of Kent is narrow and spanned by two bridges, the larger opened only in 2006. Some locals still regard the island as a place apart. Angela Harrison, a local councillor responsible for health, was born on Sheppey and said she knew people who had never left it. Central London lies only 40 miles up the Thames, but Sheppey (population: 40,000) feels untouched by metropolitan wealth or values.Harrison said it became clear in late October that a new wave of infections had hit the island particularly hard. "Everyone was asking the same question: Why – what have we done?" she said. Some islanders blamed outsiders for bringing in the virus, she said, or blamed each other for not wearing face masks. Sheppey was vulnerable because many people work in food distribution centres, care homes or the holiday parks – jobs they can't do while sheltering at home.Bill Tatton, a councillor who represents Sheppey East, lives in Warden, a village flanked by large caravan holiday parks. In hindsight, he said, the island ought to have shut the two bridges and implemented a "sensible lockdown – no one in, no one out, for two weeks."Tatton added: "There were people ... who said, 'Since they built that very high bridge across the Swale, we've had nothing but problems.'"The bridge links Sheppey to the rest of Kent, known as the "Garden of England" for its past abundance of orchards and hops gardens, and for its beaches, castles and postcard-perfect English villages. But Kent is less idyllic than its image suggests. "There's a big class divide, a big geographical divide," said Jackie Cassell, a public health expert at Brighton and Sussex Medical School who grew up on Sheppey. "Most of the money is in the middle of the county and most of the poverty is at the edges."One of those edges is Sheppey's main town of Sheerness. It ranks among the most deprived areas in Britain; about half of its children live in poverty. Many people trace Sheppey's decline to the closure of the Sheerness Naval Dockyard in 1960, which threw thousands out of work. Hundreds more lost their jobs when the steelworks shut in 2011.These days, jobs on Sheppey are generally scarce and low-quality, said Tatton, the councillor. Many islanders seek jobs on what they call "the mainland" – that is, Britain.Prison falls prey to pandemicOne of Sheppey's biggest employers is Her Majesty's Prison Service. Tottman had worked at HMP Elmley for 22 years. Laura said her husband accepted that Covid made a tough job riskier. Socially distancing was often impossible in cells and cramped walkways, and ventilation was poor."You can't just open the windows and let fresh air in," Laura said. On Nov. 6, Tottman was taken to a hospital in Margate, a seaside town in Kent. Laura spoke to him regularly via Facetime, his voice muffled by an oxygen mask.Mike Rolfe, who worked with Tottman at HMP Elmley, is the founder of the Criminal Justice Workers' Union, which says it represents about 450 staff across Sheppey's three prisons. "It was really just a free-for-all once we had that disease in prison," he said. "Even those who were really careful were catching it quite easily." Rolfe estimates that 75% of HMP Elmley's 500 staff tested positive for Covid during the recent surge. At one point, he said, about 100 staff were off work.The prison service said it took "quick and decisive action" at the start of the pandemic to limit the spread of the virus. This included halting social visits for adult prisoners, creating 1,200 temporary cells and making more PPE available to staff. The prison service also said it had mandated the wider use of face masks by its staff in guidance published on Oct. 12 – by which time, said union leader Rolfe, the outbreak at HMP Elmley had begun."We weren't wearing face masks right up until we had a problem," he said. Asked about this issue, a spokesman for the prison service said efforts by its staff had saved lives and kept Covid cases and deaths "significantly lower than predicted."A local hospital overwhelmedBy this time Covid infections were rising nationwide. On Oct. 31, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced England's second national lockdown, lasting four weeks. Restaurants, pubs, gyms and non-essential shops were shut, but – unlike during the first lockdown in March – schools remained open, streets were busier, and many trades continued.The lockdown drove down infections across Britain, but not on Sheppey. By Nov. 18, Swale borough was Britain's worst-hit Covid hotspot, with an infection rate of 631.7 cases per 100,000 people. The rate in Sheppey East, where the prisons are located, was eye-popping: 2,079.5 per 100,000 people, or about nine times the national average.A Sheppey entrepreneur called Henry Cooper watched the disease rip through his family. Cooper, who runs a caravan park, fell ill after a family gathering in late September. In a matter of weeks, Covid-19 had killed his grandfather, hospitalized his father and pushed Cooper to what felt like death's door. "The whole island just exploded with Covid," he said. "It was absolutely terrifying."Jeffrey Barrett is a statistical geneticist and the director of the Covid genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, a COG-UK member that processes about half of Britain's genome data. Initially, Barrett and other COG-UK scientists attributed Sheppey's spike in cases not to a new variant but to the outbreak at HMP Elmley. The outbreak, they speculated, might have infected the wider community.Barrett said it is now clear that the prison wasn't infecting the wider community; the community was infecting the prison.The same spike that Barrett studied from afar was flooding Medway Maritime Hospital. The hospital is in Gillingham, on the mainland, a 30-minute drive from Sheppey, and serves the island and the rest of populous northern Kent. In the first two weeks of November, the number of Covid patients at Medway Maritime doubled.By the end of November, it would be the busiest Covid hospital in Britain, with almost half of its adult general and acute-care beds occupied by patients with the disease. Ambulances lined up for hours outside as staff struggled to make room for the sick.Each morning from his hospital bed in Margate, prison officer Tottman sent his wife messages to tell her how he had slept. On Nov. 16, the messages stopped. Overnight, Tottman had been put on a ventilator and into a medical coma.Three days later, he was transferred to St. Thomas' Hospital in central London for ECMO treatment. ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, is a risky, last-ditch procedure that did the work of Tottman's ravaged lungs, offering them a chance to heal.Laura travelled up to London to see him. She put on a protective apron, mask and visor, and sat next to her husband. Tubes snaked in and out of his comatose body. Laura was hopeful. She felt her husband was lucky to have this rare treatment.Zeroing in on the variantAt the end of November, Britain's latest infection figures were published. They were stark. Despite the weeks-long national lockdown, cases were still surging in Kent and southeast England, and public health officials couldn't explain why."We were not thinking of it as a matter of national urgency at that point," said Barrett, the statistical geneticist. In the days and weeks ahead, however, Britain's genomic scientists zeroed in on B.1.1.7.The first breakthrough came in early December, when Andrew Rambaut, a British evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, got a tipoff from a scientist thousands of miles away. The scientist, a Brazilian named Tulio de Oliveira, had noticed an unusual set of mutations on the virus when investigating a spike in cases in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. In doing so, De Oliveira had uncovered the so-called South African variant, which has blunted the effectiveness of some vaccines.Based on this tip, Rambaut began combing Britain's genome databases, and B.1.1.7 stood out for two reasons. First, it had quickly accumulated a startling number of mutations, 23 in all. Second, Rambaut noticed that eight of those mutations were on the spike protein, which helps the virus lock on to human cells. This was significant because it potentially affected how transmissible the virus is.More proof was needed. That's when Volz, the genetic epidemiologist, got involved, working out how fast B.1.1.7 was spreading.He said that COG-UK's surveillance data showed a rapid rise in samples of B.1.1.7. "The scale of that growth was faster than anything I had seen before," Volz said.By Dec. 7, Volz had come up with an estimate by comparing the growth of B.1.1.7 with other variants that the new variant was 70% more transmissible. Even so, Volz was confused – initially – because variants sometimes show fast growth spikes, then fizzle out. But "the more we studied it, the more concerning it became," he said.The next day, Dec. 8, was a momentous one. Britain became the first Western country to start vaccinating people against Covid, sparking hope that the virus might finally be contained. Rambaut joined a call with experts from Public Health England, a government agency that handles health emergencies, to discuss the variant that threatened to dash those hopes. The scientists decided to ramp up their investigations into B.1.1.7.Tracking a variant by sequencing its entire genome is accurate but slow. But Barrett, the statistical geneticist, made a discovery that speeded up the process.Standard, gene-based Covid tests don't sequence an entire genome. They look for three genes, and come back positive if at least two are clearly detected. By December, some laboratories had noticed that an unusual number of positive tests were failing to detect one of those three targeted genes. Barrett was asked to work out why, and soon found the answer: The tests were failing to detect the gene because a variant had mutated it. And that variant was B.1.1.7.This meant COG-UK's scientists could now track the new variant through Covid tests with the missing gene. And because results from tests take days, rather than the weeks required to sequence a genome, they could track the variant much faster.By mid-December, scientists confirmed that B.1.1.7 was behind the surge in cases – and it was likely more contagious than previous variants. "Everyone was like, 'Oh shit,'" Barrett said.By Dec. 18, the evidence was formally considered by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, a committee of scientists that provides risk assessment and mitigation advice to the government. The group expressed "moderate confidence that demonstrates a substantial increase in transmissibility compared to other variants."The next day, Johnson announced that the new variant was up to 70% more transmissible than its predecessors. The government abruptly cancelled Christmas plans for millions. Dozens of countries banned flights from the UK. French authorities temporarily stopped all arrivals from the Eurotunnel, which connects Britain – via Kent – with the rest of Europe. Britain was cut off, an island alone in a pandemic world.Race between vaccines and variantPaul Tottman, the Sheppey prison officer, didn't respond to ECMO treatment. "His lungs were just too badly damaged," said his wife, Laura. Five days before Christmas, with his family at his bedside, doctors at St. Thomas' turned off Tottman's life support. "He was only 52," said Laura. "He had years ahead of him."Britain is now emerging piecemeal from a three-month lockdown that, alongside a fast-moving vaccination programme, has sharply reduced the number of Covid-19 deaths and infections. It is a race between the variant and the vaccines, said Erik Volz, who predicted that B.1.1.7 will continue to grow globally but will "hit a wall once we get more people vaccinated."Jeffrey Barrett said scientists were now expanding and accelerating COG-UK's genomic surveillance system, allowing them to respond more quickly to outbreaks and mutations. Scientists, he said, usually operate on incentives that define their careers: They publish work and get credit for it. "Now the incentive is: Save humanity," Barrett said. "That overrides individual careers. I hope we retain a bit of that in the future."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-uk-covid-variant-tore-through-an-english-island-and-onto-the-world-stage-101616763092086.html
26-03-2021||World||Migrant arrivals to Europe lower but deaths remain high||The number of migrants and asylum-seekers who reached Europe in 2020 is the lowest it has been in the past decade, according to a report released Friday by the United Nations migration agency. But deaths and disappearances on sea routes remain alarmingly high with only a small fraction of bodies recovered and victims identified.Of the 93,000 people who entered Europe irregularly last year, roughly 92% did so via the Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean Sea as well as through the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa to Spain’s Canary Islands, often on unseaworthy boats.Arrivals in the Canaries, considered part of the Schengen area, increased by 750% last year following tougher border controls and interceptions on the Mediterranean by North African countries.The sea routes are lethal. The International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrants Project has confirmed the death or disappearances of at least 2,300 people last year. This number is higher than in 2019 when 2,095 victims were recorded and slightly lower than in 2018 which had 2,344.The Central Mediterranean north of Libya saw 984 people perish in 2020. Meanwhile, on the Atlantic route to the Canaries at least 849 victims were verified — more than four times as many as in any previous year, according to the report, “Maritime Migration to Europe.”But the organization admits its data is incomplete. So-called “invisible shipwrecks,” when entire boats disappear and leave no survivors, are especially concerning, the report said.In 2020 there were at least 19 cases of invisible shipwrecks in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, with 571 people reported missing, according to IOM data requested by the AP.“Such cases are extremely difficult to detect, let alone verify, and are yet another indication that the true number of deaths on maritime routes to Europe is far higher than indicated by the available data,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-arrivals-to-europe-lower-but-deaths-remain-high-101616763675770.html
26-03-2021||World||PM Modi hands over Gandhi Peace Prize for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to his daughter||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday handed over the Gandhi Peace Prize 2020, being conferred by India upon Bangladesh's 'Father of the Nation' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to his daughter Sheikh Rehana and the younger sister of premier Sheikh Hasina.Modi arrived in Bangladesh on a two-day visit to attend the celebrations of the golden jubilee of the country's independence, the birth centenary of ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and hold talks with his counterpart Hasina.Speaking at the 50th National Day programme of Bangladesh at the National Parade Square, Prime Minister Modi said it was an honour for India to confer Gandhi Peace Prize on Mujibur Rahman.Modi, who was wearing a 'Mujib Jacket' as a tribute to Bangladesh's Father of the Nation, said that Bangabandhu’s leadership and bravery had ensured that no power could enslave Bangladesh."This is one of the most memorable days of my life. I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with Gandhi Peace Prize," said Modi.He handed over the award, a citation, a plaque and a shawl to Sheikh Rehana in the presence of Prime Minister Hasina.Hasina in his address thanked Prime Minister Modi and the Government of India for bestowing the prestigious honour on her father, who is also the Father of the Nation.The Gandhi Peace Prize is an annual award instituted by the government of India since 1995, the 125th birth anniversary commemoration year of Mahatma Gandhi.The Gandhi Peace Prize 2020 was conferred on Bangabandhu early this week. It was for the first time that the award was given away posthumously.Modi earlier said Bangabandhu was a champion of human rights and freedom, and a hero to Indians as well.The award carries an amount of ₹1 crore, a citation, plaque and an exquisite traditional handicraft/ handloom item.Mujibur Rahman was imprisoned in Pakistan when Bangladesh was born. Pakistan was forced to set him free on January 8, 1972.He returned to Dhaka on January 10, 1972. He later took over as Prime Minister of Bangladesh but was assassinated by some military officers during a coup d'etat on August 15, 1975. His wife, brother, sons and daughters-in-law were also assassinated along with him. Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana survived as they were in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-hands-over-gandhi-peace-prize-for-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-to-his-daughter-101616763473845.html

26-03-2021||World||Trains collide in southern Egypt, killing at least 32||Two trains collided Friday in southern Egypt on Friday, causing three passenger cars to flip over, killing 32 people and leaving 66 injured, health authorities said.Dozens of ambulance vehicles were rushed to the scene of the crash, which took place in the southern province of Sohag, said a statement by Egypt’s heath ministry.Local media displayed videos from the scene showing flipped wagons with passengers trapped inside and surrounded by rubble. Some victims seemed unconscious, while others could be see bleeding. Bystanders carried bodies, laying them out on the ground near the site of the accident.Egypt’s railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and poor management. Official figures show that 1,793 train accidents took place in 2017 across the country.In 2018, a passenger train derailed near the southern city of Aswan, injuring at least six people and prompting authorities to fire the chief of the country’s railways.In the same year, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said the government lacks about 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $14.1 billion, to overhaul the run-down rail system. El-Sissi spoke a day after a passenger train collided with a cargo train, killing at least 12 people, including a child.A year earlier, two passenger trains collided just outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, killing 43 people. In 2016, at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.Egypt's deadliest train crash took place in 2002, when over 300 people were killed when fire erupted in speeding train traveling from Cairo to southern Egypt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trains-collide-in-southern-egypt-killing-at-least-32-101616760834891.html
26-03-2021||World||China outlines Covid-origin findings ahead of WHO report, says country has 'nothing to hide'||Chinese officials briefed diplomats Friday on the ongoing research into the origin of Covid-19, ahead of the expected release of a long-awaited report from the World Health Organization.The briefing appeared to be an attempt by China to get out its view on the report, which has become enmeshed in a diplomatic spat. The US and others have raised questions about Chinese influence and the independence of the findings, and China has accused critics of politicising a scientific study.“Our purpose is to show our openness and transparency," said Yang Tao, a Foreign Ministry official. “China fought the epidemic in a transparent manner and has nothing to hide.”The report, which has been delayed repeatedly, is based on a visit earlier this year by a WHO team of international experts to Wuhan, the city in central China where infections from a new coronavirus were first reported in late 2019.The experts worked with Chinese counterparts, and both sides have to agree on the final report. It's unclear when it will come out.Feng Zijian, a Chinese team member and the deputy director of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the experts examined four possible ways the virus got to Wuhan.They are: a bat carrying the virus infected a human, a bat infected an intermediate mammal that spread it to a human, shipments of cold or frozen food, and a laboratory that researches viruses in Wuhan.The experts voted on the hypotheses after in-depth discussion and concluded one of the two animal routes or the cold chain was most likely how it was transmitted. A lab leak was viewed as extremely unlikely, Feng said.His remarks were reported by state broadcaster CCTV, which said envoys from 50 countries and the League of Arab States and the African Union attended the briefing at the Foreign Ministry.“China firmly opposes certain countries’ attempts to politicize the origin tracing issue and make groundless accusations and hold China accountable,” the ministry said in an online post about the briefing.Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, "I would like to stress that virus tracing is a scientific issue that should be studied by scientists through cooperation.”She told reporters that the experts are still discussing the contents and translation of the report, and she did not know when it would be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-outlines-covid-origin-findings-ahead-of-who-report-says-country-has-nothing-to-hide-101616759905400.html
26-03-2021||World||In retaliatory move, China now sanctions UK entities, lawmakers||China has sanctioned individuals including lawmakers and entities in the UK over what it called “lies and disinformation” about the situation in Xinjiang. This comes days after Britain imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over alleged rights abuses in the northwestern Chinese province.Beijing’s move is retaliation against a set of coordinated sanctions imposed by the US, the European Union, Britain and Canada against China over what they claim are human rights violations against the Uighur Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).Beijing applied retaliatory sanctions against the EU earlier this week.Among those sanctioned on Friday by China were nine UK individuals and four entities including chairman of the foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat and other MPs and scholars, the Chinese foreign ministry said.Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith and the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission have been sanctioned because they “maliciously spread lies and disinformation”.Four entities named by Beijing were the China Research Group, Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers, a London-based law firm.The tit-for-tat sanctions mean that the targeted individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering Chinese territory, the ministry said, adding that Chinese citizens and institutions will also be prohibited from doing business with them.“China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not to go further down the wrong path,” the ministry said. “Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions.”Activists and UN rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang where they have allegedly been tortured and forced into labour among other violations of human rights.China, repeatedly denying all accusations of abuse, says camps are for vocational training and deradicalisation.Beijing has also said the inmates have been released from the camps.Access to the Xinjiang camps is strictly restricted, making it impossible to independently verify whether all the camps have closed.Earlier this week, Beijing sanctioned 10 individuals including EU lawmakers and four entities for harming “…China’s sovereignty and interests and maliciously spread lies and disinformation”.“It (the EU) must stop lecturing others on human rights and interfering in their internal affairs. It must end the hypocritical practice of double standards and stop going further down the wrong path. Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions,” the Chinese statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-retaliatory-move-china-now-sanctions-uk-entities-lawmakers-101616758108999.html
26-03-2021||World||Dominion Voting sues Fox News for $1.6 billion over 2020 US election claims||Dominion Voting Systems on Friday filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, arguing the cable news giant falsely claimed in an effort to boost faltering ratings that the voting company had rigged the 2020 election.It's the first defamation suit filed against a media outlet by the voting company, which was a target of misleading, false and bizarre claims spread by President Donald Trump and his allies in the aftermath of Trump's election loss to Joe Biden. Those claims helped spur on rioters who stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6 in a violent siege that left five people dead, including a police officer. The siege led to Trump's historic second impeachment.Dominion argues that Fox News, which amplified inaccurate assertions that Dominion altered votes, “sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process,” according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The Associated Press.Some Fox News on-air reporting segments have debunked some of the claims targeting Dominion.There was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, a fact that a range of election officials across the country — and even Trump's attorney general, William Barr — have confirmed. Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, key battleground states crucial to Biden’s victory, also vouched for the integrity of the elections in their states. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies were dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, which has three Trump-nominated justices.Still, some Fox News employees elevated false charges that Dominion had changed votes through algorithms in its voting machines that had been created in Venezuela to rig elections for the late dictator Hugo Chavez. On-air personalities brought on Trump allies Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, who spread the claims, and then amplified those claims on Fox News’ massive social media platforms.Dominion said in the lawsuit that it tried repeatedly to set the record straight but was ignored by Fox News.The company argues that Fox News, a network that features several pro-Trump personalities, pushed the false claims to explain away the former president's loss. The cable giant lost viewers after the election and was seen by some Trump supporters as not being supportive enough of the Republican.Attorneys for Dominion said Fox News’ behavior differs greatly from that of other media outlets that reported on the claims.“This was a conscious, knowing business decision to endorse and repeat and broadcast these lies in order to keep its viewership,” said attorney Justin Nelson, of Susman Godfrey LLC.Though Dominion serves 28 states, until the 2020 election it had been largely unknown outside the election community. It is now widely targeted in conservative circles, seen by millions of people as one of the main villains in a fictional tale in which Democrats nationwide conspired to steal votes from Trump, the lawsuit said.Dominion’s employees, from its software engineers to its founder, have been harassed. Some received death threats. And the company has suffered “enormous and irreparable economic harm," lawyers said.Dominion has also sued Giuliani, Powell and the CEO of Minnesota-based MyPillow over the claims. A rival technology company, Smartmatic USA, also sued Fox News over election claims. Unlike Dominion, Smartmatic’s participation in the 2020 election was restricted to Los Angeles County.Dominion lawyers said they have not yet filed lawsuits against specific media personalities at Fox News but the door remains open. Some at Fox News knew the claims were false but their comments were drowned out, lawyers said.“The buck stops with Fox on this,” attorney Stephen Shackelford said. “Fox chose to put this on all of its many platforms. They rebroadcast, republished it on social media and other places.”The suit was filed in Delaware, where both companies are incorporated, though Fox News is headquartered in New York and Dominion is based in Denver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dominion-voting-sues-fox-news-for-1-6-billion-over-2020-election-claims-101616757466651.html
26-03-2021||World||Explained: North Korean missiles getting more agile, evasive||In resuming its ballistic testing activity after a yearlong pause, North Korea has demonstrated a potentially nuclear-capable weapon that shows how it continues to expand its military capabilities amid a stalemate in diplomacy with the United States.The two short-range missiles the North fired into the sea this week were its first meaningful provocation since the inauguration of President Joe Biden, who on Thursday delivered a restrained response to the launches, saying “there will be responses if they choose to escalate.”Since a provocative run in North Korean nuclear and missile tests in 2016 and 2017, much of the US focus has been on North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missiles that pose a direct threat to the American homeland.But experts say North Korea’s growing arsenal of shorter-range solid-fuel weapons are more destabilizing for U. allies South Korea and Japan. And the latest launches underscored the North’s efforts to improve its capacities for delivering nuclear strikes and overwhelming missile defense systems.The MissileNorth Korea’s state media said Friday the weapons it fired a day earlier from its eastern coast were a new type of "tactical guided projectile” that borrowed the core technology of an earlier system.According to the Korean Central News Agency, the new solid-fuel missiles, which are designed to be fired from land vehicles, could be armed with warheads weighing as much as 2.5 tons. During Thursday’s tests, the missiles demonstrated low-altitude, maneuverable flight and accurately hit a sea target 600 kilometers (372 miles) away.Analysts say the North likely tested an upgraded version of a system modeled after Russia’s Iskander mobile ballistic missiles. Their flatter trajectories compared to conventional ballistic weapons make them fly at an altitude where air is dense enough to allow for maneuverability. The unpredictability makes them harder to be intercepted by missile defense systems, experts say.South Korea’s military took an unusually long time to release its assessment on the launches Thursday before it said hours later that the missiles traveled as far as 450 kilometers (279 miles).Kim Dong-yub, a professor from Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies, said the discrepancy between the South Korean and North Korean assessments possibly shows how difficult it is for radar systems to accurately track these missiles during flight.“Even if our military got things wrong, it doesn’t matter for now as they could easily adjust their assessment after analyzing satellite data,” said Kim, a former South Korean military official. “But how are you going to do that in times of war?”The WarheadWhether missiles traveled 450 kilometers or 600 kilometers, that’s more than enough range to hit any corner of mainland South Korea. And experts say the North’s efforts to arm them with huge warheads indicate they are being designed for nuclear strikes.The tests came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a January ruling party congress vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of US-led sanctions and pressure and issued a broad wish list of military hardware that included new tactical nuclear weapons.If North Korea successfully develops an operational system, these missiles will provide an ability to launch tactical nuclear attacks on military bases and other strategic targets in South Korea, said Yang Wook, a military expert who teaches at South Korea’s Hannam University.“We have long said it would be difficult for North Korea to put nuclear warheads on (short-range) missiles if it fails to make them small and light enough,” said Yang. But North Korea would no longer have to do so if its missiles could reliably deliver a warhead of 2.5 tons, which Yang said would be more than three times heavier than most warheads on existing North Korean missiles.Lee Choon Geun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said the missiles would pose a huge threat for South Korea even if they are conventionally armed.“A conventional warhead of 2.5 tons would be enough to bust deeply built bunkers,” he said. “That capacity would also allow for something more powerful than tactical nuclear weapons, possibly thermonuclear devices.”More TestingNorth Korea has a history of testing new US administrations with weapons demonstrations aimed at forcing the Americans back to the negotiating table.Kim Jong Un so far has nothing to show for his ambitious summits with former President Donald Trump, which collapsed in 2019 over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s disarmament steps.While Thursday’s launches were less provocative compared to the nuclear and ICBM tests in 2017 that inspired war fears before the North shifted toward diplomacy with the Trump administration in 2018, most experts say the North is likely to dial up its testing activities.The North conducted more than a dozen short-range launches amid stalled diplomacy in 2019 and 2020 as Trump dismissed the tests despite the threat they posed to South Korea and Japan. The United States stations a total of 80,000 troops in the two Asian countries, the core of America’s military presence in the Asia-Pacific region.“These missiles are no joke because it seems pretty clear they’re aiming to mount nuclear warheads,” and evade missile defense systems, said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security.She said the nature of these missiles would require US and South Korea to develop an effective response by returning to their normal scale and scope of joint military exercises, which have been downsized under the Trump administration to make room for diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-north-korean-missiles-getting-more-agile-evasive-101616756256586.html
26-03-2021||World||How to dislodge a 200,000-ton ship from a canal wall||When you can’t shift a ship that’s stuck fast into the wall of a canal that’s vital to world trade, there’s only one thing to do: call the salvage guys.The Ever Given container ship -- a 200,000-ton behemoth -- has been blocking what is arguably the world’s most important waterway, the Suez Canal, since Tuesday morning.The struggle to dislodge it is now turning the world’s attention to the work of SMIT Salvage, a legendary Dutch firm whose employees parachute themselves from one ship wreckage to the next, saving vessels often during violent storms. The company is synonymous with some of the most daring naval salvages, including lifting a sunken Russian nuclear submarine in 2001, and removing fuel from inside the Costa Concordia cruise ship after it ran aground in Italy in 2012.SMIT, a unit of Royal Boskalis Westminster NV, is one of the companies appointed by Ever Given’s owner to help move the vessel. The first job will be to work out exactly how entrenched in the wall the ship is, said Boskalis spokesman Martijn Schuttevaer.“It will be critical to inspect the vessel and how deeply it is lodged in the embankment,” Schuttevaer said. “The question is how solidly she has been grounded.”The answer to that question will dictate what comes next. The salvors could have to find a way to lighten the vessel’s enormous weight so that it can be pulled to a less obstructive position. At the moment, it’s blocking the path of more than 100 vessels.The canal handles something like 10% of seaborne trade, spanning everything from finished goods to oil, gas, and dry-bulk commodities. And those cargoes aren’t flowing while the Ever Given is stuck.The process of making the ship lighter means removing things like the ballast water, which helps keep ships steady when they’re at sea. Fuel will probably have to be unloaded too, Schuttavaer said.In a worst-case scenario, it could be that some of the carrier’s containers -- usually filled with everything from furniture to televisions -- may have to be taken off. How long that process lasts would depend on how much equipment is around to do the heavy lifting. It can often involve flying in helicopters to remove the crates one by one.SMIT was due to fly an 8-person team in at dawn Thursday local time to board and inspect the vessel and the grounding. A big part of the initial underwater assessment is how much the banks slope at that point in the canal. Japan’s Nippon Salvage Co. has also been hired to assist in the re-floating, according to a person familiar with the matter.Such teams are usually led by a salvage master, often a former captain or someone with knowledge of the industry, but can also include divers, welders and crane operators, according to Joseph Farrell III, director of business development at Resolve Marine, another company that offers salvage services. He declined to comment specifically on the Ever Given.Stern TestPictures now seen across the globe of the vessel spread fully across the canal, point to the first major hurdle. It ran aground both at the front and at the back, almost perpendicular to the canal walls. That’s leaving very little room to simply tow it away from either end, SMIT says.For now, the focus is on dredging around the vessel. The canal authority has dispatched two of its dredgers, the Mashor and the 10th of Ramadan, to remove sand from underwater before rescuers attempt to pull it. From the shore, excavators are also working around the vessel. Western shipping experts who analysed photos of the Ever Given calculated that her protruding bulb was as much as 5 meters buried into the canal wall.Not everything in the grounding has been bad news. One thing that’s likely to make the process easier is that the ship has gotten itself stuck in sand, rather than rock. More malleable material around the Ever Given should make for a slightly smoother escape.There are already tug boats around the ship working to help with its removal, but with such a giant vessel, bigger ones with more horsepower are usually needed. Crews are hoping that periods of higher tide over the next few days will be conducive to helping free the Ever Given.Until then, the world’s commodity and maritime markets -- and the world trade they serve -- will be left hanging, waiting on the professionals to help shift a 200,000-ton ship.“There’s only a few companies in the world that do what we do,” said Farrell. “It’s a challenge, the container ships are always the biggest jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-to-dislodge-a-200-000-ton-ship-from-a-canal-wall-101616755893329.html
26-03-2021||World||Amazon denies reports of workers urinating in bottles, ‘heckles’ US senators||E-commerce giant Amazon has resorted to a combative tone on social media to defend the allegations of poor working conditions and exploitation of loopholes in the tax system. Amazon News, which describes itself as an official Twitter account for news about the e-commerce firm, pushed back against claims made in several media reports about workers urinating in plastic bottles to save time for meeting the targets.According to a Business Insider report, Amazon imposes strict time breaks and targets for warehouse workers and issues warning to those who don’t meet the goals or take extended breaks. English journalist James Bloodworth, who worked undercover at Amazon, has also documented the working condition in his book titled ‘Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain’. “I was the person who found the pee in the bottle. Trust me, it happened,” tweeted Bloodworth.It started with a tweet from an Amazon executive, Dave Clark, taking a jibe at Vermont senator Bernie Sanders’ plan to meet the company’s workers in Alabama who are attempting to unionise. Clark said that he welcomes Sanders to Birmingham, a city in Alabama, and appreciates his push for a progressive workplace, however, he suggested that the senator himself has failed to deliver progressive legislation.“I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace,” tweeted Clark. The Amazon executive then highlighted the company’s minimum wage policy of $15 per hour, something the Democrats, including US President Joe Biden, have been pushing for.Wisconsin congressman Mark Pocan said that paying workers $15 an hour doesn't make the company a progressive workplace when “you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles”. “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one,” Amazon News replied to Pocan’s tweet.1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one.The reply has so far received around 3000 likes and has been quote-tweeted at least 15,000 times. According to dictionary.com, when replies to a tweet vastly outnumber likes or retweets, it’s called “getting ratioed” in Twitterverse. It means people are objecting to the tweet and considering its content bad, often indicating a PR disaster for companies.In another Twitter fight, when Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren posted a video of her discussing the tax system and talking about a bill to make the “most profitable companies pay a fair share”, Amazon News replied saying the company doesn’t make the law and “just follow them”. It also asked Warren to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour while she’s “working on changing the tax code”.“I didn’t write the loopholes you exploit, @amazon – your armies of lawyers and lobbyists did. But you bet I’ll fight to make you pay your fair share. And fight your union-busting. And fight to break up Big Tech so you’re not powerful enough to heckle senators with snotty tweets,” replied Warren.I didn’t write the loopholes you exploit, @amazon – your armies of lawyers and lobbyists did.

26-03-2021||World||US Supreme Court weighs taking up major gun rights case||The US Supreme Court on Friday will discuss taking up a major new gun rights case involving a National Rifle Association-backed challenge to a New York state law that restricts the ability of residents to carry concealed handguns in public.The nine justices will discuss the case at their private weekly conference at a time of heightened concern about gun violence in the United States following a pair of mass shootings in a span of a week, one in Georgia and the other in Colorado, that killed a total of 18 people.Two gun owners and the New York affiliate of the NRA, an influential gun rights group closely aligned with Republicans, are asking the justices to hear an appeal of a lower court ruling throwing out their challenge to a policy that requires a state resident to show "proper cause" to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun outside the home.Lower courts rejected the argument made by plaintiffs that the restrictions violated the US Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.The court is not expected to announce whether it will take action on the appeal until Monday at the earliest.If the justices do eventually take up the case and hear oral arguments, they would once again step into a swirling debate over gun rights in a nation that has a gun fatality rate consistently higher than other rich countries.Democratic President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged the Senate to approve two bills passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on March 11 that would broaden background checks on gun buyers. Biden also called for a national ban on assault-style weapons, while the White House said he is considering executive actions to address gun violence that would not require the approval of Congress.Numerous mass shootings in the United States have failed to spur the US. Congress to pass gun control legislation sought by Democrats, thanks in large part to opposition from congressional Republicans and the NRA.The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority is seen as holding an expansive view of Second Amendment rights.The New York case, if accepted, could lead to the most consequential ruling on the scope of the Second Amendment in more than a decade. The court in a landmark 2008 ruling recognized for the first time an individual's right to keep guns at home for self-defense, and in 2010 applied that right to the states.The plaintiffs in the New York case are asking for that right to be extended beyond the home. A ruling against New York could force lower courts to cast a skeptical eye on new or existing gun control laws.Under New York's law on carrying concealed handguns, a resident may obtain licenses that are restricted to hunting and target practice, or if they hold certain jobs such as a bank messenger or correctional officer. But to carry a concealed handgun without restriction, an applicant must convince a firearms licensing officer of an actual - rather than merely speculative - need for self-defense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-weighs-taking-up-major-gun-rights-case-101616755132827.html

It's the biggest genocide in our history," Lula told Germany's Der Spiegel weekly, adding that Bolsonaro had lied to the Brazilian people about the pandemic."We must save Brazil from Covid-19," the former president added, saying that "Brazil will not withstand it if this man continues to govern in this way".As Brazil surpassed 300,000 deaths from the virus on Wednesday, Lula called on Bolsonaro to apologise to the families of victims.More than 12 million people in total have been infected in Brazil, including the virus-sceptical far-right President Bolsonaro.The country has seen record daily infections in the last week and thousands of deaths per day, blamed on a local variant of the virus that is believed to be more contagious.Lula, 75, led Brazil through an economic boom from 2003 to 2010 as head of the left-wing Workers' Party before being sentenced to a total of 26 years in prison on charges of taking bribes in 2017.After the corruption conviction against him was annulled earlier this month, recent opinion polls suggest that he is the best-placed politician to challenge far-right incumbent Bolsonaro in next year's elections.Brazil's supreme court ruled Tuesday that the former president had been convicted by a "biased" judge.In the interview published Friday, Lula claimed that the conviction was the result of a "pact between the judiciary and some parts of the media" in order to remove his successor and party colleague Dilma Rousseff from office and prevent him from running in the 2018 elections.Asked whether he would run against Bolsonaro in 2022, the former president said that it was not the time to talk about candidacies."Our attention should be focused not on the election, but on fighting the virus and vaccinating the public," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-covid-deaths-biggest-genocide-in-our-history-former-prez-lula-da-silva-101616754360202.html
26-03-2021||World||UK MPs vote to extend emergency Covid laws until September||British lawmakers have voted unanimously to extend the emergency legislation for lockdown measures to control the spread of coronavirus for another six months, until September.In a House of Commons vote on Thursday night, the Coronavirus Act 2020 was passed by 484 votes to 76, a majority of 408.An expected rebellion within the ruling Conservative Party ranks saw 36 Tory backbenchers vote against the government legislation in opposition of the continuing curbs on freedoms and 21 Labour MPs as well as the Liberal Democrats also voted against the extension."I cannot answer whether we will be retiring it in six months. My preference would be yes, but given the last year, I think a prediction would be hasty," UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs ahead of the vote on the emergency powers, which must be reviewed every six months by law.The minister said that 12 provisions in the legislation were no longer needed because of progress that had been made in dealing with the deadly virus. These include easing some responsibilities on the social care sector, laws governing the retention of biometric data for health and security purposes, and obligations on businesses that work in the food supply chain."Although this act remains essential and there are elements of it which we are seeking the renewal of, we have always said we will only retain powers as long as they are necessary," he said.The act was described as "draconian" by several MPs ahead of the vote, with Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, dubbing it "excessive and disproportionate"."The libertarian in me is also trying to protect people's fundamental right to life and their ability to live their lives normally,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said ahead of the vote.“And the only way really to restore that for everybody is for us to beat the disease and the best path to freedom is down the cautious but irreversible road map that we've set out – that's what the freedom lover wants," he said.As part of the Commons vote this week, MPs also approved the regulations underpinning the steps to ease restrictions from March 29 – as laid out in Johnson’s “roadmap” out of lockdown.The Coronavirus Act had been fast-tracked through Parliament back in March last year to bring in emergency powers to respond to the pandemic as the UK went into its first stay-at-home lockdown.The government has said that while the legal extension runs until September, it hopes to be able to lift most restrictions on gatherings and travel by June 21 as part of its roadmap.The special powers under the Act include allowing the emergency registration of healthcare professionals such as nurses, the power to temporarily close schools and prevent tenants from being evicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mps-vote-to-extend-emergency-covid-laws-until-september-101616752678771.html

26-03-2021||World||Indian-American Dr Vivek Murthy sworn in as US Surgeon General||Indian-American physician Vivek Murthy has been sworn in as the 21st Surgeon General of the US, a role in which his top priority would be to end the coronavirus pandemic that has severely hit the country and be a voice for science.“Honoured to be sworn in as your Surgeon General. I owe this day to my family who has guided & supported me every step of the way,” Dr Murthy, 43, said on Thursday soon after being sworn in as the top doctor of the country by Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra.He has occupied the position of America’s Surgeon General for the second time. In 2011, president Barack Obama tapped him to serve on the advisory group on prevention, health promotion, and integrative and public health.“I stand ready to work with you to end this pandemic & build a world where good health is within everyone’s grasp,” he said.“Ready to take on this position as the Nation’s Doctor to help end this pandemic, be a voice for science, & support our nation on its path to rebuilding and healing,” said Dr Murthy, who now is the highest ranking Indian-American in the Biden administration.Covid-19 has taken the lives of several members of Murthy's extended family. During his confirmation hearing in February, he said that seven of his family members in India and America have died due to the virus.A day earlier Murthy was confirmed by the Senate by 57-43 votes.As US Surgeon General, Murthy will advise President Biden on the coronavirus pandemic and will be the federal government’s leading voice on public health.In 2013, Obama nominated Dr Murthy to be the Surgeon General. He was the youngest ever to hold the office at the age of 37. However, he had to abruptly leave the position during the Trump administration.During his previous tenure as 19th Surgeon General, Dr Murthy has created initiatives to tackle America’s most pressing public health challenges.As “America's Doctor he helped lead the national response to a range of health challenges, including the Ebola and Zika viruses, the opioid crisis, and the growing threat of stress and loneliness to Americans' physical and mental wellbeing.He also issued the first Surgeons General’s report on Alcohol, Drugs and Health, in which he challenged the nation to expand access to prevention and treatment and to recognise addiction as a chronic illness, not a character flaw. Dr Murthy continued the office’s legacy on preventing tobacco-related disease, releasing a historic Surgeon General’s report on e-cigarettes and youth.Prior to his tenure as Surgeon General, Dr Murthy co-founded VISIONS, a global HIV/AIDS education organization; the Swasthya Project, a rural health partnership that trained women in South India to become community health workers and educators; TrialNetworks, a technology company dedicated to improving collaboration and efficiency in clinical trials; and Doctors for America, a nonprofit mobilising physicians and medical students to improve access to affordable care.His scientific research has focused on vaccine development and the participation of women and minorities in clinical trials. As an internal medicine doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and at Harvard Medical School, Dr Murthy cared for thousands of patients over the years and trained undergraduates, medical students, and medical residents.Raised in Miami, Dr Murthy received his bachelor of arts degree from Harvard, his masters in business administration from the Yale School of Management, and his MD from the Yale School of Medicine.Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said that Dr Murty is an exceptionally talented, experienced, and compassionate leader who will continue guiding our country forward in our efforts to finally defeat this virus and tackle the many public health crises the country faces — from an epidemic of gun violence to environmental injustice.Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus chair Congresswoman Judy Chu said that it is significant that Dr Murthy will be one of the top Asian Americans in federal government at a moment when Asian American and Pacific Islanders communities are being disproportionately impacted by both the coronavirus as well as surging anti-Asian discrimination and violence.“During this critical time, it is significant to have a Surgeon General who understands these differences between communities and the need to target help where it is most needed in culturally and linguistically competent ways. I applaud President Biden for elevating such a qualified public health expert as Dr Murthy and for his commitment to building a diverse federal workforce that more closely resembles the country we serve,“ she said.The US has the highest coronavirus case tally in the world at 30,079,283 and the highest death toll at 546,822.Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance and some 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed their doors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-dr-vivek-murthy-sworn-in-as-us-surgeon-general-101616752044656.html
26-03-2021||World||At least 5 dead after tornado cluster sweeps through US' Alabama, Georgia||Blaring tornado sirens and howling winds roared across parts of western Georgia early Friday as severe storms pounded southern states, including in Alabama where at least five people died in twisters that wrecked homes, splintered trees and crumpled businesses.Meteorologists said a large, dangerous tornado swept through metro Atlanta's Coweta County around midnight Friday, sparking a tornado emergency for the city of Newnan and surrounding communities. There were several reports of downed trees and power lines.Newnan police asked residents to “get off the roads” in a Facebook post, explaining that emergency officials were surveying the area. Newnan Utilities said the storm knocked out its phone and internet services but that they were “fully aware of downed lines, gas leaks and many impassable roads.”Coweta County said its public schools would be closed Friday due to the extensive damage.Newnan Mayor Keith Brady said no fatalities were immediately reported.The strong storm followed a series of tornadoes that ripped through Alabama on Thursday, including one that authorities said travelled roughly 100 miles (160 kilometres) across the state.Check out this incredible drone footage of a violent, wedge tornado in Ashby, Alabama on Thursday! #ALwx #Tornado #TornadoWarning #dronephotography pic.twitter.com/h1Hw6Rcai0Significant damage in Pelham. And this is just one house. #alabamatornado @WVTM13 pic.twitter.com/QdCP1RybNqIn east Alabama, Calhoun County Sheriff Matthew Wade said five people died in a twister that cut a diagonal path across the county, striking mostly rural areas — something that likely kept the death toll from being higher.“Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go to the families, and we are going to do our best to let them know we love them,” Wade said at an evening briefing.Multiple twisters sprang from a “supercell” of storms, said John De Block, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Birmingham.Vast areas of Shelby County near Birmingham — the state’s biggest city — were badly damaged.In the city of Pelham, James Dunaway said he initially ignored the tornado warning when it came over his phone. But then he heard the twister approaching, left the upstairs bedroom where he had been watching television and entered a hallway — just before the storm blew off the roof and sides of his house. His bedroom was left fully exposed.“I’m very lucky to be alive,” Dunaway, 75, told Al.com.Firefighters outside a flattened home in the Eagle Point subdivision, also in Shelby County, said the family that lived there made it out alive. Nearby homes were roofless or missing their second stories.Farther west in the city of Centreville, south of Tuscaloosa, Cindy Smitherman and her family and neighbours huddled in their underground storm pit as a twister passed over their home.A tree fell on the shelter door, trapping the eight inside for about 20 minutes until someone came with a chain saw to help free them, said Smitherman, 62. The twister downed trees, overturned cars and destroyed a workshop on the property.“I’m just glad we’re alive,” she said. “Praise the Lord.”Centreville Mayor Mike Oakley told ABC 33/40 news that a local airport was hit. “We have aeroplanes torn apart like toys. We’ve got homes along here that are totally destroyed, trees down, power lines down. It’s pretty devastating.”As many as eight tornadoes might have hit Alabama on Thursday, De Block said. He said investigation teams will review eight suspected tornado tracks, and the final twister number will depend on if any of those tracks can be connected.First lady Jill Biden postponed a trip to Birmingham and Jasper, Alabama, that she had planned for Friday because of the severe weather, her office said in a news release.“Thinking of everyone in Alabama and all of those impacted by the severe weather across the South tonight. My prayers are with the grieving families. Please stay safe,” Biden tweeted late Thursday.Earlier, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey issued an emergency declaration for 46 counties, and officials opened shelters in and around Birmingham.Other parts of the southern U.S. were also affected, with dangerous thunderstorms and flooding concerns for parts of Tennessee, Kentucky and the Carolinas.In addition to deaths in Alabama, Mississippi had a storm-related death on Wednesday. Ester Jarrell, 62, died in that state’s Wilkinson County when a large tree toppled over onto her mobile home after heavy rain soaked the ground, an official told AP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-at-least-5-dead-after-tornado-cluster-sweeps-through-alabama-georgia-101616749117589.html
26-03-2021||World||Pakistan govt to buy 7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from China: Minister||Pakistan is planning to buy 7 million doses of the coronavirus vaccines from China as the nation is experiencing a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, a top minister has said, its first purchase from any country.Earlier, Pakistan has said that it is not planning to buy vaccines anytime soon as it aims to tackle the Covid-19 challenge through herd immunity and donated vaccines from friendly countries like China.Herd immunity occurs when a large number of people, usually 70 to 90 per cent, become immune to a contagious disease after being infected to it.Planning Minister Asad Umar, who also heads the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) – on Thursday said that the first consignment would arrive in Pakistan before the end of this month.“We are in the process to procure Sinopharm and CanSino from China. Two batches of the vaccines, including 1 million doses of Sinopharm vaccine, will reach Pakistan by the end of this month,” Umar said.He said the government was planning to bring more people into the vaccination drive by including those over the age of 50 years from next month. Earlier, only health workers and those above 60 years of age were being vaccinated.Pakistan launched its vaccination drive on February 2 with the frontline health workers which was expanded on March 10 when people of 60 were included. But the country has faced problems in getting enough vaccines to include everyone.The country aims to vaccinate 70 million people this year.Pakistan is also endeavouring to procure vaccines from other sources, including the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) – a global initiative for equitable access to the vaccines led by Unicef, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others.Last year, Gavi had announced to provide 17 million doses to Pakistan in March. However, as the pandemic escalated worldwide, Europe’s own production could not meet the requirement of its own population and the doses could not reach Pakistan.Initially, China donated 500,000 doses of Sinopharm on February 1. In March, Pakistan received the second shipment of half a million doses of vaccines donated by China.Meanwhile, the virus is spreading rapidly and Pakistan has recorded 10.3 per cent positivity, the second time when positivity crossed double digits this week, according to the ministry of National Health Services.For the first time in eight months, Pakistan reported over 4,000 coronavirus cases on Friday as the third wave of Covid-19 intensified.The country has recorded 645,356 coronavirus cases. The death toll climbed to 14,091 after 63 more people died in the last one day.

26-03-2021||World||North Korea confirms missile tests as US Prez Joe Biden warns of response||North Korea on Friday confirmed it had tested a new guided missile, as President Joe Biden warned of consequences if Pyongyang escalates tensions amid stalled nuclear negotiations.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said the two “new-type tactical guided projectiles” accurately hit the target off the eastern coast on Thursday. Photos on the website of the North’s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed a missile lifting off from a transport erector launcher amid bright flames.KCNA quoted top official Ri Pyong Chol, who supervised the test, as saying that the new weapon’s development “is of great significance in bolstering up the military power of the country and deterring all sorts of military threats existing on the Korean Peninsula.”Japanese officials said both weapons tested Thursday were ballistic missiles, which are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions. According to South Korean officials, North Korea fired two other missiles on Sunday but they were likely cruise missiles, which are not banned.The test-firings were the North’s first major provocation since Biden took office in January. Some experts say North Korea aimed to apply pressure on the Biden administration to boost its leverage in future talks.“We’re consulting with our allies and partners,” Biden told a news conference Thursday. “And there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly. But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.”The United States has asked for a meeting of the UN Security Council committee that monitors sanctions against North Korea, and it’s set to take place Friday morning behind closed doors. The committee includes representatives from all 15 nations on the council.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who’s pursuing better ties with North Korea, issued a rare criticism of Pyongyang on Friday over the launches.“I know very well our people have big worries about North Korea’s missile launches yesterday,” Moon said during a military ceremony. “Now is time for South and North Korea and the United States to make efforts to (resume) talks. An act that hampers the dialogue mood is not desirable at all.”US-North Korea talks on curbing the North’s nuclear ambitions have been in a limbo for about two years due to disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. In January, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he would expand his weapons arsenal and build up his country’s military capability to cope with what he called American hostility.KCNA said the new weapon’s warhead weight has been improved to 2.5 tons (5,510 pounds). It said Thursday’s test also confirmed the reliability of the improved version of the weapon’s solid fuel engine, which would boost missile mobility, and of its low-altitude, maneuverable flight.South Korean observers said the weapon is likely an upgraded North Korean version of the Russian-made Iskander, a short-range nuclear-capable missile designed to fly at a low altitude and make in-flight guidance adjustments. They said it has a better chance of evading missile defense systems in South Korea.Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said Friday the North Korean weapon is a new type of ballistic missile that was shown during a military parade in Pyongyang in January. Kishi said Japan would strengthen its missile defense system to “ensure peace and safety.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-missile-tests-as-us-prez-joe-biden-warns-of-response-101616747801193.html
26-03-2021||World||Myanmar protest deaths top 300 as US, UK, impose sanctions||The death toll for protesters confirmed killed in Myanmar since last month’s military takeover has surpassed 300, a group that verifies details of deaths and arrests announced Friday.Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said its tally of 320 dead includes only documented cases, with the actual number of casualties “likely much higher.” It said 11 people were killed Thursday, when it also managed to verify 23 deaths that occurred previously.The group also said that as of Thursday, 2,981 people had been arrested, charged or sentenced in the crackdown since the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Most, including Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, remain detained.The army's seizure of power halted the Southeast Asian nation’s move toward democracy that began when Suu Kyi’s party took office in 2016 for its first term, after more than five decades of military rule.The movement against the junta and its takeover received a major boost Thursday when the United States and Britain announced tough sanctions against two military-owned conglomerates with vast holdings in many sectors.The U.S. Treasury Department said its action against Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation Limited targets the army’s control of large parts of the country’s economy, “which is a vital financial lifeline for the military junta.”The sanctions against the two companies and their holdings block access to any property they control in the United States and effectively bars any U.S. person or company from conducting any sort of business with them, including supplying them with funds or providing goods or services.Myanmar’s home-grown “Civil Disobedience Movement” against military rule is targeting the economy in order to make it difficult for the junta to govern. It has advocated work stoppages by state enterprise workers, bank closures and disinvestment by foreign companies.Myanmar’s economy is already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which surged there in the second half of last year.The World Bank, in a Asia-wide review released Friday, forecast that Myanmar’s economy will contract by 10% in 2021 after growing a meager 1.7% in 2020 and 6.8% in 2019.Anti-coup protests continued Friday in cities and towns across Myanmar, despite the threat of lethal force by the security forces. Reports on social media of casualties caused by the security forces could not immediately be confirmed.At about 4 a.m. Friday, unidentified people tossed firebombs at the headquarters of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party in Yangon, but nearby residents managed to put out the fire before it could cause any major damage.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners described a typical deadly confrontation Thursday in Taunggyi, in Shan State in eastern Myanmar, when “the junta used live ammunition, trying to create a combat zone of residential areas, resulting in four civilians shot and killed, one dead body was dragged away, some other civilians were injured.“Moreover, junta forces raided houses and violently arrested youths and civilians, thereafter destroying motorcycles, cars and barricades. They stormed streets unprovoked, shouted obscenities and vandalized property.”The Civil Disobedience Movement — CDM — which was founded largely by medical workers, has drawn plaudits for its strategy, including a nomination for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize by six social science professors at the University of Oslo in Norway.“Our nomination is a recognition of this anti-coup resistance that is working for peace and democracy through non-violent means,” said their nomination letter.Speaking for the six, Professor Kristian Stokke told The Associated Press their hope is that “the Peace Prize nomination will generate further international recognition and support for the movement and its peaceful aims and means.”A leading member of the CDM, who asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety, said the nomination “reiterates the need for the junta ... to refrain from any type of violence and peacefully and immediately transfer the power to the democratically elected leaders of the nation.”Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize for 1991 for leading a nonviolent struggle against a previous military dictatorship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protest-deaths-top-300-as-us-uk-impose-sanctions-101616746616666.html
26-03-2021||World||China slaps sanctions on UK lawmakers over Xinjiang claims||China announced retaliatory sanctions on senior British politicians including the former leader of the ruling Conservative Party for “maliciously spreading lies and disinformation” about its Xinjiang region.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced it is targeting nine individuals and four entities in the U.K. in a statement on Friday morning.The nine sanctioned individuals are former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the party’s policy adviser Neil O’Brien, chair of Parliament’s foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat, David Alton, Tim Loughton, Nusrat Ghani, Helena Kennedy, Geoffrey Nice and Joanne Nicola Smith Finley.The individuals and their relatives are banned from entering China or trading with Chinese citizens and institutions. Any assets they have in the Asian nation will also be frozen, the statement said. The four entities hit are the China Research Group of U.K. lawmakers, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uyghur Tribunal and Essex Court Chambers.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab hit back in a statement. “It speaks volumes that, while the U.K. joins the international community in sanctioning those responsible for human rights abuses, the Chinese government sanctions its critics.“If Beijing want to credibly rebut claims of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, it should allow the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights full access to verify the truth. “The Chinese Foreign Ministry said sanctions that London earlier levied on China over allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang were “based on nothing but lies and disinformation” and “grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs”.The message being sent to the U.K. and Europe is that by “siding with the U.S., they will not do themselves any good,” said Wang Yiwei, director of the Center for European Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. China’s aim is to eliminate the influence of these individuals, which removes them as stumbling blocks to future cooperation, he said.TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTakeDuncan Smith vowed to wear the sanction as a “badge of honor”, posting on Twitter that it was the duty of lawmakers to call out the Chinese government’s “human rights abuse” and “genocide”.Ghani said on Twitter she would not be “intimidated or silenced”. She told BBC radio: “This is a wake up call for all democratic countries and lawmakers that we will not be able to conduct our business without China sanctioning us for just attempting to expose what’s happening in Xinjiang and the abuse against the Uyghurs.”Earlier this week the U.K. joined the U.S., Canada and the European Union in imposing sanctions against China over alleged human rights abuses of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Western governments accuse China of interning up to 1 million Muslim Uyghurs in camps and compelling them to work, while also forcing children across the region into boarding schools.The U.S. and lawmakers in Canada and the Netherlands have labeled Beijing’s actions in the region bordering Central Asia as genocide.China dismisses the allegations, saying it is building infrastructure to boost the economy, providing jobs and educating children.Multinationals are becoming ensnared in the controversy, with Chinese social-media users calling for boycotts of Hennes & Mauritz AB and Nike Inc. for not using cotton grown in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-sanctions-on-uk-lawmakers-over-xinjiang-claims-101616747224806.html
26-03-2021||World||Strong winds resulted in grounding of MV Ever given, crew safe||MV Ever Given, the massive Japanese-owned container vessel that has created a logjam in the Suez Canal after it ran aground this week, has an all-Indian crew of 25 members who are all currently safe. The ship’s management and Egyptian officials have contended that strong winds resulted in the 200,000-tonne ship getting wedged across the canal on March 23. The blockage has affected the daily movement of goods worth an estimated $9.6 billion, according to data from Lloyd’s List. Ever Given, among the largest container vessels in the world, was sailing from China to Rotterdam when the incident occurred. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the technical manager of Ever Given, said in a statement that the vessel was transiting northbound through the canal with two canal pilots on board, and that initial investigations suggested it “grounded due to strong wind”. Also Read | Suez Canal block could hit product supply chains. Here’s why“All 25 crew are safe and accounted for. All crew are Indian nationals and remain onboard. The crew are working closely with all parties involved to re-float the vessel. The hard work and tireless professionalism of the Master and crew is greatly appreciated,” BSM said. According to the Suez Canal Authority’s official rules of navigation, a ship’s master or captain will be held responsible for any accidents while transiting through the canal. “Masters are held solely responsible for all damage or accidents of whatever kind resulting from the navigation or handling of their vessels directly or indirectly by day or night,” says the section of the rules of navigation related to pilotage. Shoei Kisen Kaisha, the Japanese owner of Ever Given, said in a separate statement that there was “no information on crew injuries caused by this accident and oil spills”. The company also apologised for “causing a great deal of concern to the vessels scheduled to sail and their related parties while navigating the Suez Canal due to the accident of this vessel”. Evergreen Marine, the Taiwanese firm that operates Ever Given, too cited the ship’s owner as confirming that the crew, vessel and cargo “are all safe, and no marine pollution has materialised”. The Taiwanese firm also indicated that all expenses related to the recovery operation and third party liabilities would have to be borne by the owner. “As the vessel is chartered, the responsibility for the expense incurred in the recovery operation; third party liability and the cost of repair (if any) is the owners,” Evergreen Marine said in a statement. BSM said its priority is to safely re-float Ever Given and ensure that marine traffic in the Suez Canal resumes. “The focus now is on dredging to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the vessel’s bow. In addition to the dredgers already on site a specialised suction dredger is now with the vessel and will shortly begin work. This dredger can shift 2,000 cubic metres of material every hour,” BSM said. Shoei Kisen Kaisha acknowledged that “the situation is extremely difficult”, while Evergreen Marine said two professional maritime rescue teams from Smit Salvage of the Netherlands and Nippon Salvage of Japan had been appointed to help free the vessel. “These teams will be working with the Captain and the Suez Canal Authority to design a more effective plan for refloating the vessel as soon as possible,” the Taiwanese shipping firm said. Earlier reports that the vessel, which is 400 metres long and 59 metres wide, had been partially refloated have proved to be incorrect. With about 12% of global trade passing through the Suez Canal, which provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe by connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, shipping firms are now considering the use of a longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa that can take a fortnight longer. About 50 merchant vessels and 1.45 million barrels of oil pass through the Suez Canal daily. Authorities are now hoping to free Ever Given at high tide during March 27-28. If this attempt fails, the next opportunity is expected to be only after a fortnight, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-winds-resulted-in-grounding-of-mv-ever-given-crew-safe-101616744307931.html
26-03-2021||World||Kenosha shooting: Jacob Blake sues officer who shot him last year||Jacob Blake Jr., the Black man from Kenosha, Wisconsin who was shot by a police officer last year and was left paralyzed from the waist down, has sued the cop who fired at him in a federal court.Blake was shot several times in the back in the presence of his young children in August, sparking several days of deadly protests against police brutality and racism in his hometown and across the country.Earlier this year, Wisconsin prosecutors cleared Rusten Sheskey, the officer involved in the shooting, saying he acted in self-defense.Blake's latest 19-page lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin sought an unspecified amount in compensation for the injuries he suffered, and "a substantial sum" in punitive damages.His lawyers also demanded to be paid for costs, legal fees, "and such other relief as is just and equitable."Blake's lawyers did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Protests erupted last summer after a viral cellphone video showed Blake walking around the front of his car with Sheskey following and opening fire after Blake opened the door.But investigators said the video was incomplete and failed to show that Blake was armed with a knife and had resisted arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-shooting-jacob-blake-sues-officer-who-shot-him-last-year-101616742216266.html
26-03-2021||World||Egypt races to free giant vessel blocking Suez Canal||A giant container ship remained stuck sideways Friday in Egypt's Suez Canal, as authorities race to free the vessel and reopen traffic in a crucial East-West waterway for global shipping.The Ever Given, a Panama-flagged ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, ran aground Tuesday in the narrow, man-made canal dividing continental Africa from the Sinai Peninsula.The ship, owned by Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, has blocked traffic in the canal, leaving dozens of smaller ships stranded in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.The vessel's bow was touching the eastern wall, while its stern appeared lodged against the western wall — an extraordinary event that experts said they had never heard of happening before in the canal's 150-year history.The ship ran aground some 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) north of the southernly mouth of the canal, near the city of Suez, an area of the canal that's a single lane.The Suez Canal Authority, which operates the waterway, has deployed several tugboats in efforts to refloat the massive vessel, including a specialised suction dredger that is able to shift 2,000 cubic metres of material every hour.As of Friday morning, the vessel remained grounded in the same position, with tugboats and dredgers still working to free it, according to Canal service provider Leth Agencies.It reminded unclear when the route would reopen.An Egyptian canal authority official called the refloating a “very sensitive and complicated” operation which needs to “be handled very carefully". They want to avoid "any complications" that could extend the canal closure. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to talk to journalists.A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specialised in salvaging, started working with the canal authority Thursday. The rescue efforts have focused on dredging to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the vessel's bow.The canal authority said late Thursday that they would need to remove between 15,000 to 20,000 cubic metres (530,000 to 706,000 cubic feet) of sand to reach a depth of 12 to 16 metres (39 to 52 feet). That depth is likely to allow the ship to float freely again, it said.It wasn't immediately clear what caused the Ever Given to become wedged on Tuesday. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, said the ship had experienced a blackout without elaborating.Evergreen Marine Corp, a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, said in a statement that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea, but that none of its containers had sunk.The Suez Canal also blamed bad weather for the incident.The blockage has caused headaches for global trade. Around 10% of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Mideast.At least 150 ships were waiting for the Ever Given to be cleared, including vessels near Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea, Port Suez on the Red Sea and those already stuck in the canal system on Egypt's Great Bitter Lake, Leth Agencies said.Using data from Automatic Identification System trackers on ships at sea, data firm Refinitiv shared an analysis with the AP showing over 300 ships remained en route to the waterway over the next two weeks.Some vessels could still change course, but the crush of ships listing the Suez Canal as their destination shows that an even-greater backlog looms for shippers already under pressure amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-races-to-free-giant-vessel-blocking-suez-canal-101616740763511.html

26-03-2021||World||China announces sanctions on Britons as UK joins EU move in Xinjiang||China on Friday announced sanctions on British individuals and entities following the UK's joining the EU and others in sanctioning Chinese officials accused of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region.A statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the move by the Western bloc was based on “nothing but lies and disinformation, flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations".Britain's ambassador to China has been summoned for a diplomatic protest, the statement said. Sanctioned individuals and groups would be barred from visiting Chinese territory and banned from having financial transactions with Chinese citizens and institutions.Nine British individuals and four institutions were placed on the sanctions list, including member of Parliament Iain Duncan Smith and the Conservative Party's Human Rights Commission. Smith is a former leader of the Conservatives.China's sanctions are the latest move in an increasingly bitter row over Xinjiang, where Beijing is accused of detaining more than 1 million members of Uyghur and other Muslim minority group engaging in forced labour and imposing coercive birth control measures.Chinese state TV called Thursday for a boycott of Swedish retail chain H&M as Beijing lashed out at foreign clothing and footwear brands following Monday's decision by the 27-nation European Union, the United States, Britain and Canada to impose travel and financial sanctions on four Chinese officials blamed for abuses in Xinjiang.“China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not go further down the wrong path. Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions," the Foreign Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-sanctions-on-britons-as-uk-joins-eu-move-in-xinjiang-101616736524965.html
26-03-2021||World||US Covid-19 cases are rising again, reversing months of progress||Covid cases in the US are rising again, reversing course after months of decline and threatening another setback in the return to normality.The seven-day average of new cases jumped to 57,695 Wednesday, 9.5% above the prior week, marking the biggest increase since Jan. 12, according to Johns Hopkins University data.While that’s a fraction of the mid-January peak, the change in direction is worrisome as states fling open their economies, variant cases multiply and the country races to vaccinate as many people as possible to stave off another wave.“We are not out of danger,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which produces influential Covid-19 projections. “We’re slowing down, and in many places going in the wrong direction.”New York case numbers reported this week by Johns Hopkins appeared artificially inflated after data lags. But that didn’t have a meaningful impact on the national trend, which is rising to roughly the same degree even without New York.“Now is not the time to let up. We have the goal in sight, we need more vaccines and we need more effective ways to get it out,” said Isaac Weisfuse, a medical epidemiologist and adjunct professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “It’s really nothing short of a tragedy for somebody to get infected and die at this stage.”An almost 10% uptick should have states reconsidering reopening plans and trying to accelerate vaccination, focusing on the hardest-hit neighborhoods, Weisfuse said. Growing pandemic fatigue among younger Americans, especially those traveling for spring break, is a significant concern, because they’re less likely to have received shots.The US has vaccinated 1 in 4 people, and last week averaged about 2.5 million doses per day, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. That’s not enough to reach herd immunity and many public-health experts fear another surge could occur before the immunization push reaches full steam. Texas, Tennessee and Alabama are among the slowest in the country, which may reflect vaccine hesitancy among Republicans, especially men.While vaccinations and waning seasonality of the coronavirus are playing to America’s advantage, that’s weighed against more-contagious variants, increasing mobility and declining mask-wearing, Mokdad said.Case declines in big states such as California, Texas and Florida have masked rises elsewhere. “We’re seeing a localized surge, but we could see it everywhere,” Mokdad said. “If we are not quick to dialing back or imposing mandates to slow down the surge, yes, we’re going to see a surge in cases.”Hospitalizations in some states also are beginning to defy the downward trend. Seven states, including New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, reported increasing average daily Covid-19 admissions for a week straight, according to a University of Minnesota analysis of data from the Department of Health and Human Services.“It’s important not to ignore changes, especially when those changes become more consistent” said Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a health-care risk management professor leading the analysis.The good news: Fewer of those hospitalizations may lead to intensive-care admissions or deaths, because the vaccination campaign has focused on elderly Americans and those most at risk, Karaca-Mandic said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-are-rising-again-reversing-months-of-progress-101616734503902.html

Reuters could not independently verify all the accounts.The killings have drawn outrage and prompted some sanctions from Western countries, including the United States. The use of lethal force against civilians had also been condemned by some Southeast Asian neighbours, which tend to be restrained in their criticism."Crimes against humanity are committed daily," said the non-profit Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) group, which has been recording the deaths as well as nearly 3,000 people arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.The group had recorded 320 deaths by March 25.Its data show at least 25 percent of those who were killed died from shots to the head, raising suspicions they were deliberately targeted for killing. Full data is not available for every death."Everything points to troops adopting shoot to kill tactics to suppress the protests," Amnesty International said earlier this month.The junta denies using excessive force and says that its actions have met international norms in the face of a situation it says is a threat to national security.Nearly 90% of the dead were male. Some 36% were aged 24 or under.The youngest victim, seven-year-old Khin Myo Chit, was shot dead in the second city of Mandalay on Tuesday. She was at her home with her father when she was killed.Win Kyi, 78, is the oldest person recorded to have been killed and was among around 50 people killed in Yangon's Hlaing Thayar district on March 14, the bloodiest day so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-300-people-killed-by-myanmar-forces-since-coup-claims-advocacy-group-101616728561138.html

The number could continue to rise as officials link more deaths to the storm that knocked out power to more than 4 million customers in Texas.Many homes went without power or drinkable water for days after subfreezing temperatures, failing power plants and record demand for heat pushed Texas' electric grid to the breaking point.Texas officials earlier this month put the initial tally of deaths at 57 but warned it would increase.The disaster has launched a congressional investigation and led to the ouster of the head of the state's embattled electric grid, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-death-toll-from-february-storm-outages-surpasses-100-101616728164278.html
26-03-2021||World||US going to hold China accountable to follow rules, says Joe Biden||The United States working with its partners and allies is going to hold China accountable to follow the rules, US President Joe Biden has said, as he referred to his recent meeting with leaders from Quad countries involving Australia, India and Japan.“Earlier this month, and apparently got the Chinese attention, that's not why did it, I met with our allies and -- how we're going to hold China accountable in the region, Australia, India, Japan, the United States, the so-called Quad, because we have to have democracies working together,” he said.Addressing his first solo news conference in the East Room of the White House on Thursday, Biden said that soon he is going to invite an alliance of democracies to come to Washington DC to “discuss the future”. “We are going to make it clear that, in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules, to follow the rules, whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or the agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things,” he asserted.The conference was attended by 30 reporters from various media outlets, including two foreign correspondents.Biden, in response to a question, said he sees stiff competition with China.“China has an overall goal -- and I don't criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That's not going to happen on my watch because the United States is going to continue to grow and expand,” he said.After becoming the 46th President of the United States on January 20, Biden has spoken with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping over the phone once. The phone call, he said, lasted for two hours.Biden said as vice president during the Obama administration, he spent hours together with Xi.“It was very, very straightforward. He doesn't have a democratic with a small D bone in his body, but he's a smart, smart guy. He's one of the guys like Putin who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future. Democracy can't function in an ever complex world,” he said.“So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were his people on the call as well as mine listening, we had a two-hour conversation, for two hours. And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I told him in person on several occasions, that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition,” he added.“Two, that we'll have strong competition but we'll insist that China play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're going to need three things to do that I'm telling our people. First, we're going to invest in American workers and American science,” the US President.Biden said he is setting up his administration to be able to do that.“The second thing we're going to do is we're going to reestablish our alliances,” he asserted.“I've been very clear with it. It's not anti-Chinese. We have talked about it.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-going-to-hold-china-accountable-to-follow-rules-says-joe-biden-101616727724545.html

We will respond accordingly. But I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.”The United States asked for a meeting of the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea and it will take place Friday morning behind closed doors. The committee includes representatives from all 15 nations on the council.US-North Korea talks on curbing the North's nuclear ambitions have been in a limbo for about two years due to disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. In January, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he would expand his weapons arsenal and build up his country's military capability to cope with what he called American hostility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-missile-tests-as-joe-biden-warns-of-response-101616725689487.html
26-03-2021||World||EU faces major shortfall in AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines as third wave surges||EU leaders voiced frustration on Thursday over a massive shortfall in contracted deliveries of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, as a third wave of infections surged across Europe.With inoculation programmes running far behind those of Britain and the United States, the bloc's executive warned that vaccine exports by the British-Swedish company would be blocked until it delivers the shots it promised to the EU."We have to and want to explain to our European citizens that they get their fair share," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference after a video-conference summit of the European Union's leaders."The company has to catch up, has to honour the contract it has with the European member states, before it can engage again in exporting vaccines," she said.Of 300 million doses due to be delivered to EU countries by the end of June, Astrazeneca aims to deliver only 100 million.That has contributed to a stuttering start to vaccination rollouts. As of March 23, Britain had administered nearly 46 shots for every 100 people, compared with under 14 per 100 in the 27-nation bloc it left last year, according to figures compiled by website Our World In Data.This week, the European Commission unveiled plans to tighten oversight of vaccine exports. This would allow greater scope to block shipments to countries with higher inoculation rates.The EU is divided over whether to take a tougher line on vaccine exports by companies that do not meet contractual commitments. French President Emmanuel Macron made it clear he was fully behind it."It's the end of naivety," he told a news conference after the summit. "I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments with Europeans."QUARREL WITH BRITAINEurope's troubled vaccine rollout has led to a quarrel with Britain, which has imported 21 million doses made in the EU, according to an EU official. Britain says it did a better job negotiating with manufacturers and arranging supply chains.The EU says it should share more, notably to help make up the shortfall in contracted deliveries of AstraZeneca shots.Brussels and London sought to cool tensions on Wednesday, declaring they were working "to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens".Highlighting the EU's difficulties, U.S. biotech Novavax is delaying signing a contract to supply its vaccine to the bloc, an EU official told Reuters on Thursday, due to problems sourcing some raw materials.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he and other leaders hoped the stricter approach to vaccine exports would not be applied, and warned of "broader consequences" if it is.Von der Leyen, seeking to counter accusations that the EU's threat of export blocks amounted to "vaccine nationalism", presented slides showing that 77 million vaccine doses had been shipped from EU plants to over 40 countries since the start of December.She said the EU would still hit its target to have 70% of adults inoculated by the summer and noted that, although a third wave of infections was underway, mortality increases were slower than the spread of the virus due to vaccinations of the elderly.io)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-faces-major-shortfall-in-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccines-as-third-wave-surges-101616719333017.html

That’s my expectation,” Biden told reporters in a wide-ranging news conference, the first of his young presidency.He later pushed back against a reporter's suggestion that his 2024 plans were definite.“I said, ‘That is my expectation,’” Biden said. “I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four-and-a-half, three-and-a-half years ahead for certain."Traditionally, there is no question as to whether a first-term president will run for reelection. Former President Donald Trump, for example, announced his plans to seek reelection on his first day in office. But questions about Biden's 2024 intentions have swirled since even before his November victory — because of his age. At 78, Biden is the oldest person to assume the presidency.In office only two months, his 2024 plans have a direct effect on his political strength. If viewed as a one-term president, Biden would effectively be a lame duck with diminished sway at home and abroad as he pursues an aggressive agenda.Given a high-profile opportunity to clarify his status Thursday, he sought to create the impression he was not a lame duck, but he avoided making any definite promises.Should he run again, Biden said he “would fully expect” to choose Vice President Kamala Harris to be his running mate again. "She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner,” he said.Biden seemed exasperated when asked if he expected Trump to run on the Republican side in four years.“I don’t even think about it. I have no idea," Biden said, suggesting that Trump may not even be part of the Republican Party.It may seem early, but several Republican presidential prospects are already jockeying for position ahead of the GOP’s 2024 nomination fight.On Friday, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to deliver a speech in Iowa, which traditionally holds the nation's first presidential primary contest. Trump has teased another run, but he would be 78 himself at the beginning of the next president’s term.With a Democrat in the White House, there has been virtually no jockeying on the Democratic side so far. Harris would be the most likely successor should Biden step aside, but she would probably face competition. So soon after taking office, however, Harris' allies have taken no steps to prepare for a presidential bid of her own.Privately, many Democrats believe Biden will not seek a second term. But publicly, there's few willing to question his intentions.“He’s starting out by so far successfully improving our pandemic response both from a health perspective and economic perspective, which lays the groundwork for a successful term and reelection strategy," said Democratic strategist Josh Schwerin. “He's running.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plan-to-run-for-re-election-joe-biden-hints-at-2024-campaign-101616717349774.html
26-03-2021||World||Tech CEOs told ‘time for self-regulation is over’||The chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter appeared before Congress on Thursday to answer questions about extremism and misinformation on their services in their first appearances since pro-Trump rioters assaulted the US Capitol on January 6.Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg; Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google parent Alphabet Inc; and Twitter Inc CEO Jack Dorsey are testifying before the joint hearing by two subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Lawmakers began the hearing by criticising the social media platforms for their role in the riot and in the spread of Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.“You failed to meaningfully change after your platform has played a role in fomenting insurrection and abetting the spread of the virus and trampling American civil liberties,” said Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, chair of the Energy and Commerce committee.“Your business model itself has become the problem and the time for self-regulation is over. It’s time we legislate to hold you accountable,” he added.“The witnesses here today have demonstrated time and again that promises to self-regulate don’t work,” said Jan Schakowsky, chair of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, in an opening statement. “They must be held accountable for allowing disinformation and misinformation to spread across their platforms, infect our public discourse, and threaten our democracy.”Republicans on the panel also criticised the tech giants for what they see as efforts to stifle conservative voices.Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican, criticised the power of tech companies’ algorithms to determine what children see online.“Over 20 years ago, before we knew what Big Tech would become, Congress gave you liability protections. I want to know, why do you think you still deserve those protections today?” said McMorris Rodgers, the committee’s top Republican. “What will it take for your business model to stop harming children?”Some lawmakers are calling for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online websites from liability over user content, to be scrapped or rejigged. Some Democrats, including President Joe Biden, agree.The tech executives differ in their support for making changes to Section 230. In his prepared opening remarks, Zuckerberg said he supports making the liability protection conditional on having systems in place for removing unlawful material. Under Zuckerberg’s proposal, a third party would determine whether a company’s systems are adequate.Google’s Pichai, whose company owns the most popular internet search engine, signalled that he is opposed to any changes to the law. Reforming it or repealing it altogether “would have unintended consequences -- harming both free expression and the ability of platforms to take responsible action to protect users in the face of constantly evolving challenges,” he said in prepared testimony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tech-ceos-told-time-for-self-regulation-is-over-101616713691094.html
26-03-2021||World||Suez Canal block could hit product supply chains. Here's why||The cargo ship blocking the Suez Canal is holding up traffic that carries nearly $10 billion worth of goods every day, so a quick clearing of the logjam is key to limiting the economic fallout.Efforts continued Thursday to dislodge the Ever Given container ship and restore traffic on the critical man-made waterway that connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides a shipping shortcut between Europe and Asia.HOW VITAL IS THE CANAL TO SHIPPING?About 10% of all global trade flows through the 120-mile-long canal, which allows tankers and container ships to avoid a long trip around the southern tip of Africa.The iconic shipping journal Lloyd’s List estimates that goods worth $9.6 billion pass through the canal every day. Lloyd’s says about $5.1 billion of that traffic is westbound and $4.5 billion is eastbound.About one-fourth of that traffic is on container ships –- like the one that is currently burrowed into one side wall of the canal. Lloyd’s says more than 50 ships traverse the canal on an average day, carrying 1.2 billion tons of cargo.WHAT EFFECT WILL THIS HAVE ON SUPPLY CHAINS?When it comes to shipping goods from Asia to Europe, there are virtually no alternatives such as rail or truck transportation, said Sharat Ganapati, an economics professor at Georgetown University. The blockage will delay a range of parts and raw materials for European products such as cotton from India for clothes, petroleum from the Middle East for plastics, and auto parts from China, he said.“The fact that you have the most pivotal node in the trading network being blocked is going to have important welfare effects around the world,” said Woan Foong Wong, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.There will be less direct impact on the United States, which receives most shipments from Asia on the West Coast. Still, imports from Europe may be delayed, and the blockage will prevent empty shipping containers from being returned to Asia, adding to a container shortage caused by rising demand for consumer goods during the pandemic.“If you get a bump in one place, that is going to percolate through the system,” Ganapati said. “It is going to take a while to get things un-gummed up.”HOW WILL CONSUMERS BE AFFECTED?It's possible that US consumers will feel some impact if shipping is disrupted for more than a few days. Finished products from Asia to the United States go over the Pacific. However, some components for products that are assembled in Europe and shipped to the US could be delayed by the canal closure.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the canal blockage likely won’t have much impact on the US or global economies unless it drags on for weeks or months.It may push up oil prices, “but we are not talking dollars on the barrel, we are talking pennies on the barrel,” Zandi said.Germany's economy could suffer, though, if the blockage delays the shipment of auto parts to that company's large car manufacturers, Zandi said.And Spain, Italy, and France could see higher gas prices because they rely on oil shipments through the canal, Ganapati said.WHAT ABOUT OIL SHIPMENTS?About 1.9 million barrels of oil a day go through the canal, according to Lloyd’s. That’s about 7% of all seaborne oil. The closure could affect shipments of oil and natural gas from the Mideast to Europe. S&P Global Platts Analytics said about 1 million barrels of crude and 1.4 million barrels of gasoline and other refined products flow from the Middle East and Asia north through the canal to Europe on the average day.Jim Burkhard, who heads crude oil research at IHS Markit, said the impact on the global oil market will be limited if the canal is cleared soon. Energy demand is still weak due to the pandemic, and the Sumed pipeline has unused capacity to move oil around the canal, from one end near Alexandria, Egypt, to a terminal near the Red Sea.“If this were to last a month, there are other options — you can sail around Africa. Of course, that would add cost,” Burkhard said. “If this ship is moved in the next week, it will be a footnote in history when it comes to the oil market.”The price of benchmark international crude rose after the blockage, but prices retreated Thursday. Analysts attributed the price drop to an industry group’s report of large US inventories and concern that pandemic-related lockdowns in Europe will further dent demand for energy – outweighing concern about the stuck ship.COULD OIL-RELATED PRODUCTS BE SLOWED?Shipments of Europe-bound refined petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel also go through the canal, and they will be delayed. Burkhard said refineries in Europe could be pushed to temporarily increase production to pick up the slack, Burkhard said.Tankers using the Suez carry 8% to 10% of the world's liquefied natural gas, according to research firms. Wood Mackenzie analyst Lucas Schmitt said only a few LNG shipments were near the canal when the blockage occurred.“We don’t expect major bottlenecks unless the situation drags on,” Schmitt said. He added that the timing of the incident — it's spring, when LNG demand typically eases — means it will have less impact on prices than recent delays at the Panama Canal had. Those delays caused LNG shipping rates to surge, according to data from S&P Global Platts Analytics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-block-could-hit-product-supply-chains-here-s-why-101616709943534.html
26-03-2021||World||Man in Atlanta grocery had 6 guns, wore body armor: Police||A worker at an Atlanta grocery store heard “clicking sounds," and it sounded to him like someone was loading weapons inside a restroom stall, he told police. Then he saw an an “AR-15-style rifle" leaning against the wall.The sharp-eyed Instacart worker is getting credit for helping officers to stop the man wearing body armor and carrying a half-dozen guns from roaming through the Publix grocery store Wednesday, police said.The new details are included in police incident reports released Thursday by Atlanta police. The man's intentions are not explained in the reports.The worker, Charles Russell, “heard clicking sounds from the bathroom stall," a police report states. “It sounded to him like someone was loading firearms."Russell then alerted a manager at the store, urging him to call 911.Two Atlanta police officers arrived. One grabbed a rifle from his patrol car, put on a ballistic helmet and went into the store, where he apparently surprised the armed man as he came around the corner from the restroom.“I immediately ordered the accused to put his hands up and don't move to which he complied," the officer wrote in his report. “The accused appeared to be surprised when he saw us that close to him."Officers then arrested Rico Marley, 22, without a shot being fired.The pistols he had were loaded with rounds in chambers, and a revolver was also fully loaded, the officer wrote. He then looked inside Marley's bag and found a loaded AR-15-style rifle and a loaded shotgun, said the officer, who noted that the suspect was wearing body armor.Marley waived his initial court hearing Thursday. He’s charged with five counts of criminal attempt to commit a felony; and six counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, police said.Investigators also said Marley was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation. It’s unclear whether he had an attorney.Russell told WSB-TV that when he saw the man in the store's bathroom, he immediately thought of Tuesday's mass shooting at a King Sooper's in Boulder that left 10 people dead.“It possibly could have stopped something,” Russell told the TV station.Marley's arrest also happened days after eight people were fatally shot at three massage businesses in the Atlanta area.Police have been working to determine what exactly Marley planned to do with the arsenal. There were no reports of Marley pointing a weapon or using a weapon before authorities arrived.____Martin reported from Marietta, Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-in-atlanta-grocery-had-6-guns-wore-body-armor-police-101616709785358.html
