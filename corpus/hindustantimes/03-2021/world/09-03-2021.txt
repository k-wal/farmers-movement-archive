It will be held about a year-and-half after the Quad was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers in September 2019, and reflects the desire of the group to present a united front to key challenges, including China’s belligerence across the region.Also Read: Ahead of Quad summit, Indian and Japanese PMs agree to bolster cooperationPM Modi will participate with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden in the “first Leaders’ Summit of the Quadrilateral Framework, being held virtually,” the ministry said in a statement.Besides discussing regional and global issues of shared interest, the leaders will “exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”.The Quad summit will be an opportunity to exchange views on “contemporary challenges such as resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, and climate change,” the statement added.The leaders will also review efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and “explore opportunities for collaboration in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region,” the statement said without giving details.Reports have suggested that the other members of the Quad could invest in India’s vaccine production capabilities to expand the delivery of doses across the region, especially to counter China’s vaccine diplomacy. India is the world’s largest producer of vaccines and has supplied almost 58 million doses to 65 countries, including 7.7 million doses provided as grants.Also Read | 'Quad summit to become feature of Indo-Pacific engagement': MorrisonChina has pledged to provide more than 460 million doses of its own vaccines to nations across the world but is yet to ramp up actual supplies.Ahead of the Quad summit, Modi and Suga had a 40-minute phone conversation and agreed to bolster cooperation both bilaterally and through the four-nation group to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.The two prime ministers also discussed defence and security cooperation and Suga expressed serious concerns about China’s actions in the area ranging from Hong Kong to the East China Sea.Modi and Suga agreed the India-Japan partnership can play a “pivotal role in addressing common challenges”, and emphasised that “their engagement with like-minded countries such as Australia and the US in the form of Quad consultations holds value and agreed that these useful discussions must continue,” the external affairs ministry said.A readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders “shared the recognition that cooperation towards realising a Free and Open Indo-Pacific is becoming increasingly important and to this end, shared the view to steadily advance both Japan-India bilateral cooperation and Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral cooperation”.Suga expressed “serious concerns regarding unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea, China’s Coast Guard Law and the situation in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,” the Japanese readout said. While exchanging views on the region, the two leaders “confirmed that they have grave concerns over the situation in Myanmar and they would closely work together in this vein,” the readout added.Suga also sought “understanding and cooperation toward the early resolution” of the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.The two leaders welcomed progress on the high-speed rail project in Maharashtra and the signing of a memorandum of cooperation for specified skilled Indian workers to be employed in Japan.They also agreed to celebrate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Japan in 2022. Modi also invited Suga to visit India at the earliest for the annual bilateral summit.The US has taken the lead in organising both the Quad summit and the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the group on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions. During their meeting, the foreign ministers reiterated the Quad’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.The Quad, formed in 2007, was revived in 2017 as a gathering of senior officials. It was upgraded to the ministerial level in 2019, reflecting the desire of the four countries to work more closely on shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and India’s growing comfort with the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-quad-summit-on-march-12-bolstering-cooperation-indo-pacific-on-agenda-101615312616202.html

While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.Also Read | Suicide to racism: Harry, Meghan on royal mess"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members."Buckingham Palace has come under mounting pressure to respond to the claims made in an Oprah Winfrey interview first broadcast on Sunday, which triggered a crisis unseen since the anguished days of Harry's late mother, Diana, in the 1990s.It set off a whirl of speculation about the identity of the senior royal who asked how dark their child's skin would be before he was born.Meghan, whose mother is black and father is white, also spoke about how she had suicidal thoughts, but failed to receive any support during her time in the royal family.Winfrey was left open-mouthed by the racism claim, which reportedly left the palace in turmoil and scrambling how best to address it.Prince Charles, Harry's father and the heir to the throne, earlier ignored a question about what he made of the interview, as he made his first public appearance since the row erupted.A YouGov poll of 4,656 people after the interview aired on British television on Monday indicated almost a third (32 percent) felt the couple was unfairly treated, the same proportion as those who thought the opposite.But older people were more likely to side with the royal family, the poll suggested.'Blowing up his family' Harry and Meghan's claims have been likened to a bomb being dropped on Britain's most famous family and one of the country's most revered institutions.Attempts have been made to draw in Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has himself been accused of racism during his time as a newspaper columnist.But he refused to comment, even as political calls mounted for a full inquiry and the White House and former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton spoke out.Also Read: Buckingham Palace silent, in turmoil after Meghan, Harry's tell-all interviewHowever Zac Goldsmith, a junior British foreign minister and close ally of Johnson, said former army captain Harry was "blowing up his family".Johnson's spokesman declined to say whether Goldsmith was speaking for the government.The level of controversy about the royals has not been seen since the 1990s, during the very public collapse of the marriage of Harry's parents.His mother, princess Diana, collaborated with the author Andrew Morton in a revealing 1992 biography and gave a bombshell BBC television interview in 1995.In it, she said both she and Prince Charles had been unfaithful, how he was unfit to be king, and that she felt isolated, struggling with self-harm and bulimia.Morton said Harry and Meghan's claims would "shudder down through the generations in the same way that Diana's did".But Meghan's estranged father Thomas Markle defended the royals, saying he hoped the skin tone comment was "just a dumb question"."It could just be that simple, it could be somebody asked a stupid question, rather than being a total racist," he told Britain's ITV.Millions of views Just over 17 million viewers watched Winfrey's two-hour interview with Harry and Meghan on US broadcaster CBS on Sunday night.More than 11 million people then tuned in to watch it in full on ITV in Britain, the channel said.The couple dramatically quit royal life last year and now live in California with their young son, Archie, and are expecting their second child, a daughter, this summer.Harry, 36, has admitted his mother's death in Paris in 1997 -- in a high-speed car crash as she tried to flee paparazzi photographers -- has affected his mental health and coloured his view of the media.He and Meghan, 39, have accused newspapers of racial stereotyping, particularly set against coverage of Harry's sister-in-law, Kate, who is white.But their comments about the suffocating strictures of royal life and claims of unwavering attitudes have wider implications for the monarchy itself -- and what it represents.Black Lives Matter protests last year prompted calls for a reassessment of the legacy of the British Empire headed by the queen and her ancestors.Global impact?Neither the queen, now 94, and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, made the racist comment, Winfrey told CBS.But it could still be damaging as the monarch is head of the Commonwealth, an organisation comprising 54 mainly former British colonies, many of them in Africa, and 2.4 billion people.Mass immigration has transformed Britain since the queen came to the throne in 1952, with a rising number of people who define themselves as British-Asian, black-British or of mixed race.The historian David Olusoga wrote in The Guardian that Harry and Meghan's claims were "not just a crisis for the royal family -- but for Britain itself".Harry himself used a racist slur against a former military colleague and was once pictured wearing a Nazi soldier's uniform at a fancy-dress party.But he has said meeting Meghan had made him confront the issue, and he is now championing projects to tackle racism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-responds-to-harry-and-meghan-s-racism-accusations-101615311845846.html
09-03-2021||World||Czech Republic's hospitals struggle with rising Covid cases||With record numbers of COVID-19 patients filling up intensive care units in the Czech Republic, the first patient to be moved outside of the country was transported to southern Poland on Tuesday.The 68-year old woman was moved to Raciborz in Poland from a clinic in the town of Usti nad Orlici, in the Pardubice region. Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek said six other patients from a different region should be taken to Germany.Pardubice was the first entire region of the country’s 14 to declare last week intensive care units in its five regional hospitals were overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients in serious condition and it could not take any more. The Plzen region in western Czech Republic followed suit, while a number of individual hospitals elsewhere have to transfer their patients to clinics across the country.“To work as a nurse is difficult any time,” said Jirina Spelinova, chief nurse at the neurological surgery ward in Pardubice hospital in the capital of the same-name region located 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Prague.“But it’s much more difficult during the pandemic,” Spelinova said. Besides the necessity to work in protective gear, staff "are so busy that they have no time to eat, drink, or, I’m sorry to say it, go to the toilet.”Spelinova’s ward was converted to a COVID ward, a common practice adopted by many clinics across the country to be able to treat those infected. But even those expanded capacities have reached their limits.Health Minister Jan Blatny has predicted that this week will be “the most critical” for the struggling hospitals.According to his ministry’s figures 8,478 COVID-19 patients needed hospitalization on Monday. Of those, a record high of 1,789 were in intensive care. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths has risen over the past two weeks from 1.44 per 100,000 people on Feb. 22 to 1.88 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University. That figure is the worst in the worldThe nation of 10.7 million has had over 1.3 million confirmed cases with 22,147 deaths. It currently has the highest per-capita infection rate in the EU, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.To cope with the surge attributed to a highly contagious coronavirus variant, the Czech Republic activated a plan to move dozens of its patients to hospitals in Germany, Poland and Switzerland.The three countries previously offered treatment in their hospitals, together with Austria and Slovenia.The government has also ordered medical and other university and high school students and also medical personnel at outpatient clinics to help out at the struggling hospitals.They should help reach a goal to add 100 intensive care beds and another 570 oxygen-supported ones, Blatny said.Spelinova said the nurses have to cope with a high level of distress.“When more people are dying these days, it’s extremely demanding for them," she said.Another nurse, Michaela Krehlova from the respiratory ward, said the high influx of patients makes 12-hour shifts stressful. “You feel you don't spend enough time with everyone,” she said.“It's tough to cope with more often and sometimes unexpected deaths, especially of younger patients."Meanwhile, the Statistics Office said on Tuesday that 15,900 people died in the Czech Republic in January, the highest number for that month in 70 years.According to the Health Ministry, 4,767 people died of COVID-19 in January, the second biggest death toll after November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czech-republic-s-hospitals-struggle-with-rising-covid-cases-101615310564096.html

They include Vivek Murthy, a nominee for surgeon general; Vanita Gupta, nominee for associate attorney general; and Bharat Ramamurti and Sameera Fazili, deputy directors of the president’s National Economic Council.Varghese, whose parents had moved to the US from Kerala, will head a federal agency — the way it had worked when Barack Obama was president — that provides military support for White House events and functions, including food service, presidential transportation, medical support and emergency medical services, and hospitality services. Varghese had earlier served as executive director of Biden’s inauguration committee and chief operating officer of the campaign.Varghese also goes back to the Obama-Biden administration. He was assistant to the president for management and administration and special assistant to the president and deputy director of advance.Varghese is a graduate of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the Maurice A. Dean School of Law at Hofstra University, according to a PTI report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-appoints-indian-american-maju-varghese-as-whmo-director-101615310963692.html
09-03-2021||World||Mexico ignores efficacy concerns, signs deal for 36 mn Covid vaccines with China||Mexico announced a huge bet on Chinese vaccines Tuesday, without making public any information about their efficacy.Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the Mexican government has signed agreements for 12 million doses of the yet-unapproved Sinopharm vaccine and increased to a total of 20 million doses its contracts for the Coronavac dose made by China’s Sinovac.The total of 32 million doses, plus at least 4 million doses of the CanSino shot, would dwarf the estimated 5 million vaccine doses Mexico has acquired from other sources.However, Ebrard’s office has repeatedly refused to answer questions about the efficacy of the Chinese shots.Sinopharm has claimed its vaccine was 79% effective based on interim data from clinical trials, but like other Chinese firms, it has not publicly released its late-stage clinical trial data.Experts in Hong Kong have assessed the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine at about 51%. That shot has already been approved for use in Mexico.The CanSino vaccine has been approved in Mexico and reportedly has an efficacy rate of around 65.7%,A total of six vaccines have been approved for use in Mexico, which has received relatively small amounts of each. Mexico has administered only about 4.7 million doses of all vaccines, a tiny amount given the country’s population of 126 million.The government policy sets up the odd situation in which some Mexicans, mainly in urban areas, will receive the Pfizer vaccine, which has around 95% efficacy, while most will get one of the Chinese vaccines with a much lower effectiveness.Amid a dearth of public data on China’s vaccines, hesitations over their efficacy and safety are still pervasive in the countries depending on them.Inoculations with Chinese vaccines already have begun in more than 25 countries. None of China’s three vaccine candidates used globally have publicly released their late-stage clinical trial data.Mexico has suffered almost 190,100 confirmed deaths. However, Mexico does so little testing that government excess-death figures suggest the real toll was well above 220,000 at the start of January, when the government stopped releasing that data. Test-confirmed cases total over 2.1 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-ignores-efficacy-concerns-signs-deal-for-36-mn-covid-vaccines-with-china-101615310537524.html

I grew up as an only child.""The last time I saw her must have been at least 18 or 19 years ago. And before that, 10 years before that," she added.Following which, Samantha came ahead and denied the claims with some proof to back her up."I don't know how she can say I don't know her and she was an only child. We've got photographs over a lifespan of us together so how can she not know me?," she said in an interview.Fox News reported that Samantha showed photos featuring the two of them together at various stages of their respective upbringing, including one from Samantha's college graduation in 2008, which flies in the face of Meghan's claim that they hadn't seen each other in almost two decades.In the 200 minutes long show, the Duchess also claimed that her half-sister had changed her last name to 'Markle' in her 50s, shortly after she began dating Prince Harry.However, Samantha showed proof that her name has been Markle for a lot longer than that, including a petition for name change dated in 1997 as well as her college diploma, which clearly states her name as Markle, Fox News quoted."I was a Markle before she was. I thought that was kind of weird that she'd say I only changed my name back when she met Harry. Markle's always been my name," Samantha said.Further, she added that she had 'no sympathy' left for Meghan after her wrong claims."Depression is not an excuse for treating people like dishrags and disposing of them," she concluded referencing to both herself and her father, Thomas Markle, who both have their own complicated story with the Duchess of Sussex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-s-half-sister-questions-interview-claims-presents-evidence-101615310106258.html

In addition, Boeing put orders for 16 planes back into its backlog, indicating it is now more confident that those sales will go through.The orders could indicate that airlines are starting to feel more optimistic about a rebound in travel, which has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. In the US, the number of air travelers has been ticking up with the rollout of vaccines against Covid-19, although air travel remains far below pre-pandemic levels. Boeing suffered several months when it reported no orders, as airlines parked unneeded planes and cut costs to conserve cash.Several of the February orders had been previously announced, including a United Airlines commitment to buy another 25 Boeing 737 Max jets. Boeing said other customers that it declined to identify ordered 14 Max planes, and it reported 27 new orders for its KC-46 military refueling plane.Chicago-based Boeing said it delivered 22 commercial planes last month including 18 Max jets, led by five to Southwest Airlines and three to United.The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two crashes that killed 346 people. Regulators in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Brazil and other countries cleared the plane to resume flying after Boeing changed an automated flight-control system that played a role in the crashes.Boeing says 14 airlines around the world are now flying passengers on Max jets, including American, United and Alaska airlines. Southwest plans to resume Max flights later this week.Shares of Boeing rose more than 2% in late-morning trading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-sees-positive-net-orders-for-airplanes-for-first-time-in-15-months-101615308446667.html
09-03-2021||World||US President Biden likely to nominate Lina Khan to Federal Trade Commission post||The White House is vetting Lina Khan, a Columbia Law School antitrust expert who is a critic of large technology companies, for the Federal Trade Commission, and President Joe Biden is likely to nominate her, according to people familiar with the matter.The FBI is conducting a background check on Khan, one of the people said, which would pave the way to her nomination. A second person said that her nomination is proceeding.White House spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. Politico reported earlier that Biden had decided to nominate her for the FTC.Her selection would be another signal that the president is preparing to square off against the technology industry’s biggest companies. The people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because her nomination hasn’t been announced.Khan, whose research focuses on technology markets, previously worked as an aide to FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra as well as for the New America Foundation and its spin-off, the Open Markets Institute. In a 2017 article for the Yale Law Journal titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” she argued that current U.S. antitrust law insufficiently counters the anti-competitive effects of Amazon-type, platform-based business models.Khan “has been one of the brightest intellectual stars in the antitrust world in a generation -- broadly recognized, even by people that don’t agree with her,” Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, said in an interview.Khan also served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, which conducted a 16-month investigation into tech companies and determined that the biggest internet platforms have all abused their gatekeeper power over the digital economy. The panel is preparing to introduce legislation to reform antitrust laws.The committee’s report recommended a series of far-reaching antitrust reforms, including a measure that would prohibit a dominant tech platform from operating in competition with the firms dependent on it -- much the way banking laws once barred large lenders from acquiring insurers, real estate firms, and other non-banking companies. The committee also recommended restrictions on acquisitions by dominant firms.Khan’s selection follows the March 5 announcement that Biden would tap another Columbia law professor, Timothy Wu, to join the National Economic Council as a special assistant on technology and competition policy.Wu has been an outspoken advocate for aggressive antitrust enforcement against U.S. technology giants. His appointment elevates to a senior position in the administration a leading antitrust expert, favored by progressives, who has assailed the power of dominant tech companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. Both companies were sued by U.S. antitrust enforcers last year for allegedly abusing their monopoly power.If confirmed by the Senate, Khan would join the five-member FTC at a time when tech giants are grappling with a reckoning in Washington that could transform the industry.A lawsuit the FTC and state attorneys general brought against Facebook in December could lead to the breakup of the company, while the Justice Department’s complaint against Google targets the heart of its business -- internet search.Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations of Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.Other key and as-yet unfilled antitrust positions in Biden’s administration include a chief for the Justice Department’s antitrust division and permanent chairman for the FTC.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-likely-to-nominate-lina-khan-to-federal-trade-commission-post-101615306229911.html

Russia has never participated and does not intend to participate in such campaigns against other vaccines," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters."All these statements are absurd, have no basis in fact, and we really regret that anyone would take such statements seriously," he added.Russia's own flagship Sputnik vaccine has been authorised by 46 countries, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets it abroad.It could be produced in western Europe for the first time after a deal to make it in Italy was signed by the RDIF sovereign wealth fund and Swiss-based pharmaceutical company Adienne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/absurd-russia-on-us-charge-of-trying-to-discredit-western-covid-19-vaccines-101615306235490.html
09-03-2021||World||Pak election commission to not take action on vote buying claims in Senate polls||Pakistan's top election body on Tuesday refused to take action on the allegations of vote buying in the recent Senate elections just on the basis of video clips unless those involved in offering and getting bribes were named.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) said this on a plea challenging the election of Opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement's (PDM) candidate and former premier Yusuf Raza Gilani to the Senate. The top electoral body was expected to hear the petition on March 11 but it took up the case after a request by the government.A four-member commission of ECP headed by Altaf Ibrahim Qureshi heard the petition. The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of Prime Minister Imran Khan was represented in the hearing by counsel Ali Zafar.The PTI has challenged the victory of former premier Gilani as Senator on the basis of alleged fraud, urging the ECP not to issue notification of his success.Gilani became a Senator after defeating PTI candidate Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on March 3, a big blow to Prime Minister Khan who had personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.The government's allegations are based on a video of Gilani's son Ali Haider, who is shown talking with some PTI members and telling them how a vote can be "spoiled".The PTI, in its petition, said that since seven votes were "spoiled" in the Senate elections and its candidate lost by just five votes, it showed that the PTI lawmakers in the video were bribed.Refusing to take action on allegations of vote buying in the polls just on the basis of video clips, the ECP urged the government's lawyer to make all persons involved in the video scandal a party to the case and said that if the charges of giving and receiving bribes are proven, then action should be taken against all the culprits.Government's counsel Zafar was reluctant to name those who allegedly received bribes but after initial refusal he agreed to do so after consultation with the government. The ECP asked him to file a fresh petition.In another development, the Islamabad High Court was set to hear on Wednesday a petition by PTI member Ali Nawaz in which he challenged the election of Gilani to the Senate.Chief Justice Athar Minallah will hear the petition seeking to declare his victory unconstitutional and illegal as he had won through rigging and bribery.The new challenge to Gilani came in the wake of his nomination as the Opposition's joint candidate for the Senate chairman election scheduled on March 12.PDM, an alliance of 11 parties, also nominated Maulana Ghafoor Haidri of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) for the post of deputy chairman of Senate.In an effort to sway votes in a tight competition, the government offered to support Haidri if his party supported Sadiq Sanjrani, who is supported by the government for the Senate chairman. However, Haidri rejected the offer.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Khan, addressing the Cabinet meeting, said that technology such as electronic voting machines (EVM) would be used in future to avoid voting fraud."We can't have the kind of elections which have happened in the past… We need to use EVM technology for transparent elections and I want regular updates on it," he said.After Shaikh's defeat, Prime Minister Khan had last week lashed out at the election commission, accusing it of discrediting democracy, damaging the morality of the nation and failing to stop corruption in the closely-contested Senate elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-election-commission-to-not-take-action-on-vote-buying-claims-in-senate-polls-101615305484705.html
09-03-2021||World||Meghan and Harry row divides UK along age lines: Poll||Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's explosive interview has divided public opinion in Britain, a poll showed Tuesday, with those under 25 most likely to feel they were unfairly treated.In the Oprah Winfrey interview, first aired in the United States on Sunday, the couple accused royal family members of asking how dark their baby's skin would be.Meghan, a mixed-race former television actress, said she had felt suicidal and was refused help by palace aides.A poll by YouGov taken after the interview aired in Britain on Monday evening, indicated that almost a third (32 percent) felt Meghan and Harry were unfairly treated by the royal family, while the same percentage thought their treatment was fair.But there was a clear split along age lines.The younger generation took the side of Meghan and Harry, who are both in their 30s and married in 2018, while the older generation were more likely to back the royal family led by the 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth II.Sixty-one percent of those aged 18 to 24 thought the couple were unfairly treated, while 50 percent of those over 65 thought they were fairly treated, a view only shared by 13 percent of the youngest group.Another question on whether people's general sympathies lay with Meghan and Harry or with the other royals, found that overall more British people -- 36 percent -- favoured the Queen and the royal family, while 22 percent chose Harry and Meghan.The polling agency spoke to 4,656 British adults after the show aired on ITV commercial television, with an audience of more than 11 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-and-harry-row-divides-uk-along-age-lines-poll-101615303675457.html
09-03-2021||World||US House readies final vote on Prez Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 package||The US House of Representatives could approve the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill as early as Tuesday, with a vote allowing the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.Approval of the package, which is one of the biggest US anti-poverty measures since the 1960s, would give Biden and the Democrats who control Congress a major legislative victory less than two months into his presidency."It's really just a matter of paperwork. But we are going to have a vote as soon as we can," Democratic Representative Katherine Clark, the assistant House speaker, told CNN.The Senate, where Democrats have effective control, passed its version of the bill on Saturday after a marathon overnight session. The upper chamber of Congress eliminated or pared back some provisions in an original House bill, including an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.Now that the bill has passed the Senate, it must be approved again by the House before it can make its way to Biden's desk.The House was still awaiting the Senate version late on Monday. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that lawmakers would "take it up Wednesday morning at the latest."Democrats hold a very narrow majority in the House, meaning they cannot withstand many votes by their members against the bill.The first version of the bill passed the House without a single Republican vote. Two moderate Democrats joined Republicans in voting against that version. One of them, Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, said on Monday he would now vote for the bill with the Senate changes."My concerns remain on the size and scope of this bill but believe the Senate changes provide meaningful relief for Oregonians in need," Schrader wrote in a post on Facebook.Republicans, who broadly supported economic relief early in the coronavirus pandemic, have criticized the price tag of the Biden relief package.Some progressives in the House have criticized the Senate's changes. But Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters she thought members of her group would back the legislation.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised the legislation at a news conference on Monday, saying that while there were some changes on the margins, it represented the "core" of what Biden originally proposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-readies-final-vote-on-prez-biden-s-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-101615303654509.html
09-03-2021||World||1 in 3 women endure physical or sexual violence: WHO||Nearly one in three women worldwide is subjected to physical or sexual violence during her lifetime, pervasive criminal behaviour that has increased during the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.The UN agency urged governments to prevent violence, improve services for victims and tackle economic inequalities that often leave women and girls trapped in abusive relationships.Boys should be taught in school about the need for mutual respect in relationships and mutual consent in sex, WHO officials said.“Violence against women is endemic in every country and culture, causing harm to millions of women and their families, and has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Some 31% of women aged 15-49, or up to 852 million women, have experienced physical or sexual violence, the WHO said in what it called the largest-ever such study, encompassing national data and surveys from 2000-2018.A husband or intimate partner is the most common perpetrator and a disproportionate number of victims are in the poorest countries, it said. True figures are likely far higher due to under-reporting of sexual abuse, a heavily-stigmatised crime."These numbers are very shocking and really are sort of a wake-up call for governments to be doing much more to prevent this violence," report author Claudia Garcia-Moreno said.In some regions, more than half of women face violence at some point, she told Reuters, citing Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia.Countries with the highest prevalence include Kiribati, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Afghanistan, WHO data show.The lowest rates are in Europe, up to 23%, over a lifetime.Violence starts at an "alarmingly young" age, the WHO said.One in four adolescent girls aged 15-19 who have had a relationship have been subjected to either physical or sexual violence, Garcia-Moreno said."This is a very important and formative time in life. And we know that the impacts of this violence can be long-lasting and can affect physical and mental health and lead to unwanted pregnancies and other complications," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-in-3-women-endure-physical-or-sexual-violence-who-101615303188279.html

09-03-2021||World||UK businesses bought fake Google reviews from firms found in search results: Report||A consumer group has exposed a web of paid-for reviewers providing fake reviews to dozens of UK businesses listings on Google, ranging from home improvement companies to a stockbroker. The consumer group, Which?, set up a fake company and bought bogus reviews to probe how some businesses are opting for shortcuts to build a good customer rating.Notably, companies selling Google reviews in bulk were all easily found in the tech giant’s own search results, the report said. Which? created a fake business listing called Five Star Reviews and bought 20 Google reviews for around $150 from a site named Reviewr. The firm providing paid-for reviews claimed to offer “100% permanent reviews” that won’t be deleted and the investigators even got the option to choose a star rating of their liking for each review.The Google accounts, which were used to plant the fake reviews, had reviewed similar businesses all around the country. Nearly 50 companies, including a stockbroker, a dentist, a London estate agent, and a bakery in Edinburgh, had at least three reviewers in common, suggesting that these businesses paid the same company to post “glowing appraisals”.“Companies that are taking shortcuts to rise up the ranks dishonestly are in breach of Google's terms of use, and may well steal business from those operating honestly. Our investigation revealed that, in some cases, they may pose a threat to consumers, too,” the report said, elaborating on the risk of fake reviews.A stockbroker in Canary Wharf had reportedly received a lot of negative reviews as many wrote “shockingly poor customer service” and one of the reviewers claimed to have lost £27,000 worth of investment because the business acted against his wishes. Between two to four months prior to the investigation, the stockbroker received 30 five star reviews in quick succession. Which? was able to link many of the reviewers identified in the investigation.Google told Which? that it uses automatic detection systems to filter out fake reviews but admitted that the automated systems aren’t perfect. "Our policies clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences and information, and we closely monitor 24/7 for fraudulent content, using a combination of people and technology,” a Google spokesperson was quoted by the consumer group as saying.In its report, Which? has called on the competition and markets authority (CMA) to take strong action against sites that host reviews if they find that they are failing to prevent fake reviews from flooding their platforms. It has also urged the regulator to take swift and effective action to stop sites from trading or facilitating the trading of fake reviews.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-businesses-caught-buying-fake-google-reviews-for-a-turnaround-report-101615299229689.html

They often go to Delaware when the first lady's traveling, and they're adjusting to their new home," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told MSNBC in an interview, adding she had no specific details about the report.First Lady Jill Biden has said she has been trying to settle the two German Shepherds settled into their new 18-acre home in Washington, D.C. since Biden took office Jan. 20.Biden adopted Major in November 2018 from the Delaware Humane Society. Champ joined the family in 2008 when Biden was elected vice president under President Barack Obama.Jill Biden last month noted the canines have had to get used to the White House as well as its many staffers."I've been getting obsessed with getting our dogs settled because we have an old dog and we have a very young dog," she told "The Kelly Clarkson Show" in a Feb. 28 interview. "So that's what I've been obsessed with, getting everybody settled and calm."In 2008, as former President George W. Bush was winding down his second term, his Scottish Terrier Barney bit the finger of a reporter who tried to pet him, according to the Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-has-no-comment-on-biting-report-involving-biden-s-rescue-dog-101615300204303.html

"We're certainly not out of the woods yet, even on this wave."More than 120,000 people in Britain have died from Covid-19, the fifth highest official global toll, but it has also had one of the world's fastest vaccine rollouts, with more than a third of the population already receiving at least one dose.Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said it was not possible to stop all Covid-19 deaths even with a successful vaccine rollout, although the size and severity of future surges in infections could be reduced with a cautious approach."All the modelling suggests there is going to be a further surge... The ratio of cases to deaths will go right down as a result of vaccination, but not right down to zero, unfortunately," Whitty told lawmakers.Schools in England re-opened to all pupils on Monday. The next steps in lockdown easing have been pencilled in at five-week intervals but officials have said that data, rather than dates, will dictate the pace.Asked why encouraging data couldn't lead to an acceleration of that timetable, Vallance said three to four weeks were needed to generate and assess the data, and the government wanted to give one-week notice of changes to rules."I think if you truncate that you are essentially flying blind," Vallance said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-uk-offcials-urge-caution-on-easing-lockdown-restrictions-101615297517271.html
09-03-2021||World||Ahead of Quad summit, Indian and Japanese PMs agree to bolster cooperation||Ahead of a planned summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga agreed on Tuesday to bolster cooperation both bilaterally and through the four-nation group to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.During a 40-minute phone conversation, the two prime ministers also discussed defence and security cooperation and Suga expressed serious concerns about China’s actions in the area ranging from Hong Kong to East China Sea.The conversation came ahead of a planned summit of the leaders of the Quad nations – India, Australia, Japan and the US – that is expected to be held as early as Friday as part of the Biden administration’s focus on bolstering the group and countering China’s actions across the region.Modi and Suga “shared the recognition that cooperation towards realising a Free and Open Indo-Pacific is becoming increasingly important and to this end, shared the view to steadily advance both Japan-India bilateral cooperation and Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral cooperation”, said a readout from Japan’s foreign ministry.There was no official word on the conversation from the Indian side.The two prime ministers also exchanged views on bilateral relations and “concurred that they would continue their effort to materialise the ‘Japan-India Special Strategic and Global Partnership’ through cooperation in such areas as security and defence, economic relationship including digital fields and people-to-people exchanges”, the readout said.Suga expressed “serious concerns regarding unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea, China’s Coast Guard Law and the situation in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region”, the readout said. While exchanging views on the regional situation, the two leaders “confirmed that they have grave concerns over the situation in Myanmar and they would closely work together in this vein”, the readout added.Suga also sought “understanding and cooperation toward the early resolution” of the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.The two leaders welcomed progress on the high-speed rail project in Maharashtra and the signing of a memorandum of cooperation for specified skilled Indian workers to be employed in Japan.Confirmation regarding the Quad Summit came from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who told a news conference last week he had discussed the matter with US President Joe Biden, Modi and Suga in recent conversations.The US has taken the lead in organising both the summit and the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the Quad on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions. During their meeting, the four foreign ministers reiterated the Quad’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.The Quad, formed in 2007, was revived in 2017 as a gathering of senior officials of the four countries. It was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers in September 2019, reflecting the desire of the four countries to work more closely on shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and India’s comfort with the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-quad-summit-indian-and-japanese-pms-agree-to-bolster-cooperation-101615296120324.html

People are just going to want to maybe travel a little less in the future and do it more efficiently, and be able to go places without having to take the travel or commute time,” Zuckerberg said in an interview with The Information.″Obviously, people are going to keep on being cars and planes and all that. But the more that we can teleport around, not only are we personally eliminating commutes and stuff that’s kind of a drag for us individually, but I think that’s better for society and for the planet overall, too,” he added.Read more: Facebook to pay $650mn settlement over US privacy disputeZuckerberg said this could allow workers to live wherever they want and “basically teleport to work.”Reflecting on the ease of access that virtual teleportation would bring to people’s lives, Zuckerberg said, “There are going to be all these awesome use cases that come from this....rather than calling someone or having a video chat, you just kind of snap your fingers and teleport, and you’re sitting there and they’re on their couch and it feels like you’re there together.”Read more: Russia sues Google, Facebook, Twitter for not deleting protest content: ReportThe Facebook chief executive’s remarks come at a time when the social media giant is set to release a pair of smart glasses with Ray-Ban later this year.

This includes archives related to Algeria War, the statement said.Under French laws, almost all archives of the French state, including on defense and security issues, should be made available to the public after 50 years except information that could compromise some people's security. Yet a complex and long request process was preventing researchers and academics from working on these archives.The new procedure will “significantly reduce the delay,” the French presidency said.Broadening the opening of archives on the war was part of Macron’s commitments to reckon with France’s colonial-era wrongs in Algeria.In 2018, Macron formally recognized the responsibility of the French state in the 1957 death of a dissident in Algeria, Maurice Audin, admitting for the first time the French military’s use of systematic torture during the war.Last week, Macron met with four grandchildren of an Algerian independence fighter to tell them that Ali Boumendjel had been tortured and killed by French soldiers in 1957.Macron also wants to honor Gisele Halimi, a French feminist who supported Algeria’s independence and denounced the use of torture by the French military during the war. He hopes to have her reburied at the Pantheon monument in Paris, a resting place for some of France’s most distinguished citizens.Macron also plans to attend three commemoration ceremonies by next year, which will mark the 60th anniversary of the end of Algeria's war for independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-speed-up-opening-of-secret-archives-on-algeria-war-101615290240673.html

I couldn't do anything but I was praying for God to save and help the children," she said.First she saw a man shot in the head fall dead in front of her -- then she felt the sting of tear gas."I felt like the world was crashing," she said."I'm very sad it happened as I was begging them."A local rescue team confirmed to AFP that two men were shot dead on the spot during Monday's clash, though it did not confirm whether live rounds or rubber bullets were used.On Tuesday, one of the deceased, Zin Min Htet, was laid in a glass casket and transported on a golden hearse covered in white and red flowers.Mourners raised three fingers in a symbol of resistance, as a musical ensemble of brass instrument players, drummers and a bagpiper in crisp white uniforms led the funeral procession.- 'All Myanmar is grieving' - Kachin, Myanmar's northernmost state, is home to the Kachin ethnic group, and the site of a years-long conflict between ethnic armed groups and the military.Tens of thousands have fled their homes to displacement camps across the state -- and among the organisations aiding them have been Christian groups.Monday was not Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng's first encounter with the security forces -- on February 28 she made a similar plea for mercy, walking slowly towards police in riot gear, getting on her knees and pleading for them to stop."I have thought myself dead already since February 28," she said of the day she made the decision to stand up to the armed police.On Monday, she was joined by her fellow sisters and the local bishop, who surrounded her as she pleaded for mercy for the protesters."We were there to protect our sister and our people because she had her life at risk," Sister Mary John Paul told AFP.The city has seen frequent crackdowns from authorities since the coup, including a violent dispersal of peaceful teachers last month that sent several into hiding.So far, more than 60 people have been killed in anti-coup demonstrations around the country, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group.Fear runs deep for Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng, but she said she must be brave and will continue to stand up for "the children"."I can't stand and watch without doing anything, seeing what's happening in front of my eyes while all Myanmar is grieving," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shoot-me-instead-myanmar-nun-pleads-with-junta-forces-101615289496514.html

It is so damaging. I felt physical pain," Moore-Gilbert told Sky News Australia.Moore-Gilbert, a specialist in Middle East politics at the University of Melbourne, said her mental health deteriorated after two weeks."I thought if I could, I would kill myself."After nine months imprisonment, Moore-Gilbert was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which she sought to oppose through a series of hunger strikes.In her most daring opposition, however, Moore-Gilbert said she once attempted to escape."One day I was just like, ‘You know what? I’m going to do it. I have nothing to lose’," Moore-Gilbert told Sky News."There were spikes on part of the wall, so I just took some socks with me and put them over my hands and then grabbed onto them, hoping they weren’t too sharp."Once on the roof of the prison, Moore-Gilbert said she could have scaled down the walls and made a run for a nearby town. However, she said she decided not to proceed as she was in a prison uniform, didn't speak the local language and feared the consequences of being caught.Eventually she was released in a prisoner swap and back in Australia, Moore-Gilbert said she is focused on her recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/contemplated-suicide-british-australian-academic-held-in-iran-for-2-years-101615284213429.html

About 190 billion yuan ($29.3 billion) will be channelised into building new expressways and upgrading existing highways and improving road connectivity in the remote and largely rural areas of Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) - the second-largest province in China - state media agency Xinhua reported, quoting TAR’s transportation department. “Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China is planning to spend about 190 billion yuan in the 2021-2025 period on transportation infrastructure projects,” the report said. “The money will be used on building new expressways, upgrading existing highways and improving the road conditions in rural areas, among other fields, according to the regional transportation department,” it said.“By 2025, the total mileage of highways in Tibet will exceed 120,000km, and that of expressways will exceed 1,300km,” TAR’s transportation department said in a statement shared in the Xinhua report.The announcement was made last week in Lhasa, the provincial capital of TAR, coinciding with the annual session of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, in Beijing.The push to boost connectivity and transport infrastructure in the massive province fits in with Beijing’s overall strategy to strengthen border security and road networks against the backdrop of the worst military standoff with India in decades.Tibet’s transportation infrastructure has seen “marked improvement” in the 2016-2020 period.“Its road network reached a total length of 118,800km at the end of last year, up over 50% from the end of 2015,” according to the regional transportation department.China has separately pumped in billions of dollars in building a rail network through a difficult terrain in south-eastern Tibet, near the border with Arunachal Pradesh.Dual-use airports, from where both military and civil aviation can operate, have also been built at strategic locations in TAR.Chinese military experts believe that building infrastructure in TAR is important for ensuring an efficient military logistics system in the remote region. China has other ambitious plans for the frontier province.On Friday, it was revealed that it was planning to build a “passageway” connecting Tibet with South Asia.China is also undertaking a massive dam project in Medog county near the border with Arunachal Pradesh.

EU officials have said deliveries could start in April.In an updated roll-out plan published last month, Ireland forecast that it would receive 602,000 J&J shots in the second quarter - around 15% of its total quarterly supply - and would start administering the vaccine in the first week of April."The assumption on Johnson & Johnson is about 600k over quarter two, but primarily back-ended. Smaller numbers in mid-April," Health Service Executive (HSE) chief Paul Reid told a parliamentary committee.Ireland has administered almost 525,000 vaccines among its population of 4.9 million, primarily using the Pfizer-BioNTech , vaccine. Almost 150,000 have also received the second of their two doses.Reid said Ireland expects to receive 1.1 million vaccines by the end of March, with a revised 1.2 million target for first quarter deliveries drifting into the first week of April.Between delays in supply and changes to the sequencing and prioritisation of who gets which shot, the HSE has changed its operating plan 15 to 17 times since the programme began at the start of the year, he added."Our first quarter has been an experience of high levels of frustration on supply issues, to be frank. Pfizer has been more stable but we did have one change to their supply line. Moderna , of late, unstable and certainly AstraZeneca has been unstable," he said."That has been an EU-wide issue as well. We would expect the second quarter to have a higher level of predictability."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-expects-first-doses-of-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-by-midapril-101615292590205.html

09-03-2021||World||EU says Russian disinformation campaign set Germany as its main target||Germany is the top target of Russian disinformation campaigns in the European Union, a report said on Tuesday, as ties between Moscow and the West hit new lows over the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.The EU's disinformation watchdog, which is run by the bloc's External Action Service, said in the report it had documented 700 cases of deliberately fake or misleading reporting that aimed to spread disinformation about Germany since launching a tracking database in late 2015.That compares to more than 300 cases for France, over 170 for Italy and 40 for Spain, said the watchdog, which was set up after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and aims to combat what it sees as a deliberate smear campaign by Russia."Germany is singled out as the main target for Russian disinformation efforts among European member states," said the watchdog, which is called EUvsDisinfo.EUvsDisinfo said the Kremlin was trying to portray Germany as a country driven by "irrational Russophobia" to draw attention away from Russia's violations of human rights and international law."(Russia's approach) intends to create uncertainty, sow discord, give Russian officials for manoeuvre... The Kremlin doublespeak exploits Europe's, and Germany's commitment to dialogue," the report said.SanctionsGermany was among EU countries advocating for more sanctions on Russia over the case of Navalny, who received medical treatment in Berlin and recovered in the Black Forest after being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent last year.Navalny, an anti-corruption activist, says the Kremlin was behind the attack, which Moscow denies. He was arrested after returning to Moscow from Germany in January and is now serving a new jail sentence in a Russian penal colony.The EU last month agreed to blacklist four senior Russian officials over the Navalny case, adding to economic sanctions it had earlier slapped on Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin's support of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.EUvsDisinfo said Russia had depicted Germany as instrumental in driving the new sanctions that followed a trip by the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, to Moscow in February.While Borrell called for Navalny's release, he also played up the need for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Russia in areas such as climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. During his visit, however, Moscow expelled four EU diplomats, including one from Germany.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany, has long been critical of Moscow's human rights record, but Berlin has resisted US pressure to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that would pump more Russian gas to Europe via Germany.EU leaders will discuss next steps in their troubled relationship with Russia at a summit on March 25-26.

The United Arab Emirates had supported the Syrian opposition during the early years of the war.But as the Syrian army recaptured most of the territory from the opposition, the UAE and other Arab countries made openings toward Assad's government. In 2018, the UAE reopened its embassy in Damascus, for the first time since the start of an organized Arab diplomatic boycott in 2011.Syria near-complete isolation has increased since the Trump administration in 2019 enacted legislation known as the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. The sanctions, which US officials said aimed to hold “accountable the Assad regime for atrocities it has committed against its own people,” target Assad, his close circle of associates and family, senior security officials and troops as well as the Central Bank and any institutions believed to have played a role in the violence in the war in Syria.While Assad may have won the military war against his opponents with the help of backers Russia and Iran, he faces an even bigger challenge of governing while more than 80% of his people live in poverty.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov did not elaborate on the Syrian conflict at the press conference beyond saying that Russia “supports a political settlement” there, as well as in war-scarred Libya and Yemen.In Libya, the UAE and Russia provided military aid to east-based Libyan commander Khalifa Hifter as his forces battled the UN-recognized government for control of the country's capital last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-on-syria-challenge-rapprochement-says-uae-minister-101615291590878.html

09-03-2021||World||UK stocks: FTSE 250 up 18%, beats major global benchmarks||Investors have done well out of the UK reopening trade. The reversal in fortune for many domestically-focused stocks has been sharp. But the easy money has probably already been made.Since Nov. 6, the last trading day before Pfizer Inc. cheered the world with positive Covid-19 vaccine results, UK stocks have performed strongly. The FTSE 250 index, traditionally seen as a better domestic indicator than the FTSE 100, is up 18%. It’s beaten most major international benchmarks in local currency terms. Across both indices, stocks with at least two-thirds of their sales coming from the UK have done even better, rising on average 25%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Within that group, cyclical sectors like financials and housebuilders have shone.The more recent gains here reflect the UK’s aggressive vaccine rollout. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a timetable for ending lockdown, starting with schools resuming in-person this week. But the upswing is mainly a reflection of just how badly the UK’s largely services economy got hit by the pandemic: The FTSE 250 was among the worst performing indices when the virus struck. The bounce-back simply puts it on par with the wider European stock market in terms of valuation and performance since late February 2020. The UK plans to lift all restrictions on social contact by late June, depending on the trajectory of infection rates. Stocks moved more in anticipation of this than after the aspiration was announced last month. Much now depends on earnings forecasts ticking higher if stock gains are to continue. Yet it remains unclear what lasting damage the pandemic will inflict on the UK economy. Frictions imposed by Brexit, currently out of the headlines, could starting creeping into corporate commentary.Also read: Sunak delivers crisis Budget to rescue Covid-hit UK economyWhat about sterling? It’s been a beneficiary of getting a Brexit deal finally done, and this has amplified recent returns on British assets for overseas investors. The stability of the currency has doubtless removed a deterrent against international investors buying UK stocks, but even amid prevailing dollar weakness, it may not be positive incentive to do so.Of course, there are still good arguments for UK equities as a whole, including the more internationally focused large-cap stocks: They remain very cheap on a relative basis. Higher government bond yields driven by global economic recovery would favor markets with weightings to so-called value sectors like the UK’s, over the more growth-oriented US, as strategists at Citigroup Inc. point out. The FTSE 100 is on 15 times forward earnings; the S&P 500 22 times. It’s a defense based largely on London’s dull “old economy” composition.But tellingly, the M&A market has so far shown little enthusiasm for pure-UK stocks. The companies that buyout firms have been picking off have some reopening appeal but generate only a minority of their revenue in their home market — mid-cap stocks like security firm G4S Plc, private jet refueller Signature Aviation Plc and Aggreko Plc, which rents out power generators for events. The revaluation of UK domestic stocks has been rapid in recent weeks. The longer term challenges they face haven’t gone away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-stocks-ftse-250-up-18-beats-major-global-benchmarks-101615281223782.html

She was freed in exchange for the release of three Iranians who were held in Thailand.“It’s extreme solitary confinement room designed to break you. Its’ psychological torture. You go completely insane. It is so damaging. I would say I felt physical pain from the psychological trauma I had in that room. It’s 2-meter by 2-meter box,” Moore-Gilbert told Sky News.“There were a few times in that early period that I felt broken. I felt if I had to endure another day of this, you know, if I could I’d just kill myself. But of course, I never tried and I never took that step,” she added.Moore-Gilbert was a Melbourne University lecturer on Middle Eastern studies when she was picked up at the Tehran airport as she tried to leave the country after attending an academic conference in 2018. She was sent to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, convicted of spying and sentenced to 10 years. She vehemently denied the charges and maintained her innocence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/freed-academic-describes-psychological-torture-in-iran-101615290471192.html
09-03-2021||World||Chinese generals urge more spending to prepare for US conflict 'trap'||China must boost military spending to prepare for a possible confrontation with the US, top generals said, in an unusual acknowledgment of the risk of a clash between the world’s two largest economies.The two generals -- members of the Central Military Commission led by President Xi Jinping -- made the comments during the annual national legislative session in Beijing. CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang, China’s top uniformed officer, said the country needed to brace for a “Thucydides Trap,” an inevitable conflict between a rising power and an established one.“Facing the ‘Thucydides Trap’ and border disturbances, the military must step up its efforts to improve its capabilities,” Xu said Friday, although the transcript wasn’t released until later. “The most important thing is internal unity and cohesion and improvement of overall capabilities. If you are strong, you will have long-term stability, as well as invincibility.”Xu’s reference to “border disturbances” may be an allusion to China’s deadly clash with India last year, as well as territorial disputes in the South and East China seas. Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, who also sits on the CMC, said separately that “containment and counter-containment will be the main tone of bilateral ties between China and US”Chinese president Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that the country’s security situation faces “relatively big instability and uncertainty” at a group discussion during the legislative session, without elaborating, state broadcaster CCTV reported. He urged the army to coordinate priorities of military construction and war preparedness, and to get ready to “face up to various kinds of complexities and difficulties at any time.”The remarks represented a rare admission from China about the growing risk of a confrontation with the US after escalating disputes under President Donald Trump over everything from trade to Taiwan. Chinese leaders have repeatedly played down the risk a Thucydides Trap, with Xi saying during 2015 a visit to the U.S. that such a conflict wasn’t inevitable so long as countries avoided strategic miscalculations.A national security strategy document released last week by US President Joe Biden affirmed Trump’s designation of China as a “strategic competitor.” The strategy seeks to put less emphasis on using the American military to resolve conflicts and pledges to work with “like-minded countries” to forge a common approach to Beijing.The “Thucydides Trap” refers to ancient Greek historian Thucydides’ explanation of the Peloponnesian War as an inevitable clash between a rising Athens and the established regional power, Sparta. The term was coined by Graham Allison, a professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, who argued that China would threaten to displace U.S. influence, possibly resulting in an unhealthy rivalry or armed conflict.Xi has vowed to make China a great military power, pledging to complete the modernization of the armed forces by 2035 and build a world-class military capable of winning wars across all theaters by 2050. China projected defense spending growth of 6.8% this year, up from 6.6% last year, the slowest pace in three decades.Wei, the defense minister, said struggles over containment efforts would “last throughout the whole process of China’s national rejuvenation.”“China’s national security has entered a phase of high risks. Tasks are mounting for the defense sector and military,” Wei said, adding China “must comprehensively strengthen training and preparedness for war and improve the strategic capability to win over strong enemies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-generals-urge-more-spending-to-prepare-for-us-conflict-trap-101615289379204.html
09-03-2021||World||China has breached all provisions of UN Genocide Convention in Xinjiang: Report||The Chinese government’s actions against Uyghurs in Xinjiang have breached every provision of the UN Genocide Convention, according to a new report by more than 50 experts in international law, genocide and war crimes. Azeem Ibrahim, co-author of the report released on Tuesday by Washington-based think tank Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said there is overwhelming evidence to support the allegation of genocide. The report estimates between 1-2 million people have been detained in some 1,400 extrajudicial internment facilities created in Xinjiang since 2014. It also details allegations of sexual assault, forcible sterilisation, psychological torture, brainwashing and an unknown number of deaths in these camps. “Uyghur detainees within the detention sites are systematically tortured, subjected to sexual violence, including rape, and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment, deprived of their basic human needs, and severely humiliated,” the report said. The report’s findings are largely in line with assessments by the US state department, which said in December 2018 that Chinese authorities had detained more than 2 million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities in internment camps since 2017. The report by Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, which was founded as a nonpartisan think tank in 2019 by Fairfax University of America, is being seen as possibly the first independent analysis of the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang. Also Read | China rakes up India’s ban on apps, FDI curbs at WTOBeijing has denied all allegations of rights abuses and defended its actions in Xinjiang as necessary to combat radicalisation and terrorism in the region following a string of attacks. Chinese officials have described the detention camps as “vocational training centres” that are part of a poverty alleviation campaign. Foreign minister Wang Yi told a news conference last week that the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang are “preposterous”. China is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948, and Article II of the convention defines genocide as acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. These acts include killing members of the group, causing bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group “conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”, imposing measures to prevent births within the group, and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. The Newslines Institute’s report, which was prepared in cooperation with the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, concluded that the evidence available shows “China is responsible for breaches of each provision of Article II of the [Genocide] Convention”. “In this context, the Head of State, President Xi [Jinping], launched a ‘People’s War on Terror’ in the region and made the Uyghur-concentrated areas the front line, arguing that extremism has taken root in Uyghur society. Camp guards reportedly follow orders to uphold the system in place until ‘Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and other Muslim nationalities, would disappear...until all Muslim nationalities would be extinct’,” the report said. “High-level officials gave orders to ‘round up everyone who should be rounded up,’ ‘wipe them out completely…destroy them root and branch,’ and ‘break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections and break their origins.’ Officials have likened the mass internment campaign to eradicating tumours and even uprooting weeds hidden among crops, which require spraying ‘chemicals to kill them all’,” the report added. The report further said: “The intent to destroy the Uyghurs as a group is further demonstrated by the comprehensive government policies and programs directed at erasing all aspects of Uyghur identity, community, and domestic life, and institutionalising Uyghur children in state-run orphanages. “Pursuant to these government campaigns, local authorities have eliminated Uyghur education, destroyed ethnically distinct Uyghur architecture and household features, and damaged or completely demolished the majority of mosques and sacred sites, while closing off other sites or converting them into commercial spaces, and destroying essential elements of Uyghur identity and communal bonds.” The report is supported by some of the world’s most respected legal authorities, such as Baroness Helena Kennedy, Irwin Cotler and ambassador David Scheffer. Ibrahim said: “This is the first independent expert legal analysis that applies the Genocide Convention to the available evidence. China’s intent to destroy the Uyghurs is more evident than previously understood based on explicit statements, state policy, directives and legal regulations originating at the highest level of State, President Xi, who has vowed to continue these policies for years to come as recently as a September 2020 conference setting the policy direction for the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-breached-provisions-of-un-genocide-convention-in-xinjiang-report-101615289722524.html

"We don't demand that they be in favour of China's socialist system; we only ask them to love the motherland and Hong Kong."But under President Xi Jinping, China has taken a markedly authoritarian turn and adopted a much less flexible definition of the term "patriots".After Beijing imposed a sweeping security law on the city last year, many of Hong Kong's most prominent dissidents are in jail, face prosecution or have fled overseas.Song said China was not trying to create a "monolithic government" in Hong Kong."Hong Kong is a pluralistic society where there is a blend of Chinese and Western culture," he said."But anyone who challenges the fundamental system of the state and undermines Hong Kong's constitutional order does not count as a true patriot," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loyalty-to-ccp-will-decide-if-hong-konger-is-patriot-says-chinese-official-101615281027363.html

The House of Representatives must still pass the Senate version of the package for it to become law.Also read: US Senate approves $1.9 tln bill, oil prices rise on global economic recoveryBrent prices have pulled back from Monday's high above $70 per barrel.

The issues that Meghan has raised of racism and mental health are really serious issues,” said Starmer."It is a reminder that too many people experience racism in 21st-century Britain. We have to take that very, very seriously. Nobody, but nobody, should be prejudiced (against) because of the colour of their skin or because of their mental health issues,” he said, when asked about the controversy during a visit to a school in east London.“This is bigger than the royal family. For too many years we have been too dismissive and too willing to put these issues to one side," he added.Asked by Oprah Winfrey whether there were concerns among royals that her child would be "too brown" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: "If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."Harry and Meghan refused to name individuals behind the alleged racist comments but Winfrey later told CBS, the US network which broadcast the interview, that off camera Harry had stressed that “neither his grandmother [Queen] nor grandfather [Prince Philip] was part of that conversation”.The allegations have prompted widespread speculation over which royal may have made the comments.In the two-hour interview shot near Harry and Meghan’s new home in California, Winfrey asked them about their decision to step back as frontline royals and whether they have any regrets about moving away.While Harry said he felt relieved that he had been able to protect his wife and children, as the couple await the birth of a baby girl in the coming months, Meghan said she regretted that she had trusted the “institution” of the monarchy when they had assured her that they would protect her from false media attacks.The former actress’ revelations about her mental health struggles, which involved thoughts about not wanting to be “alive anymore”, have attracted the maximum reaction on social media and other channels."It's vital that when people reach out for support or share their experiences of ill mental health that they are treated with dignity, respect and empathy," mental health charity Mind said, in response to attacks on Meghan’s interview.Prince Harry expressed hurt that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan about the "colonial undertones" of news headlines and articles."No one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts," he said.Meghan also told Winfrey she felt betrayed by her father Thomas Markle's conduct in the run up to their wedding in 2018.Thomas Markle told ITV on Tuesday that the interview was the first time he had heard his daughter speak for several years."I'm very disappointed about it.

The committee will also be given powers to select many legislators.It was "solely China’s internal affair on how to design and improve the system," Song said, adding "destabilising forces" had taken advantage of "loopholes" in the past.Critics have decried Beijing's moves as the end of democratic dreams in the former British colony, whose mini-constitution states universal suffrage as its goal.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Also read: Hong Kong minister warns citizens against ‘oblivious’ criticism of ChinaOnly half of its legislature is currently picked through democratic vote, a proportion which will shrink under the new system. Other seats in the legislature and the electoral committee taken by lower-level, democratically elected district council officials, are expected to be scrapped.The changes to the electoral system follow a series of moves by Beijing to reassert its control over China's most restive city and set it on an increasingly authoritarian path.China imposed a sweeping national security law in June 2020 and authorities have since arrested most high-profile opposition politicians and activists for offences under the new law or related to the 2019 protests.Song said China wanted to create a new "democratic" electoral system, which will "fully respect" the public's democratic rights. He did not elaborate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/could-mean-end-of-democracy-critics-decry-hong-kong-voting-system-101615263525209.html
09-03-2021||World||Hong Kong minister warns against ‘Oblivious’ criticism of china||Hong Kong’s top legal official warned residents to steer clear of criticisms of the government that stray too far from the facts, as officials defend Beijing’s plan to overhaul the city’s elections.Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng said in an interview Tuesday that opinions were “no more than an utterance of no value” if the facts weren’t established. Cheng was answering a question about what kind of criticism would be legal in the former British colony as Beijing implements a range of legal changes including a national security law and the electoral overhaul.“Some of the statements that are sometimes uttered, that we hear, are actually not based on facts, or perhaps oblivious of the facts that exist,” Cheng told Bloomberg Television. “And I think that is what one has to be very careful not to embark upon.”@EngleTV asks Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng on @BloombergTV.'One must not use fake news and an opinion that is not fact-based,' she says. Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong are fanning out to defend the most significant changes to the city’s political system since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Chinese lawmakers are expected to approve a sweeping electoral overhaul later this week that will require future candidates for elected office to be “patriots” and secure nominations from a pro-Beijing committee.An official in China’s Foreign Ministry office in Hong Kong provided the clearest definition yet of what that quality entails, saying: “Patriots should respect the Chinese Communist Party.”“Anyone who challenges the fundamental system of the state and undermines Hong Kong’s constitutional order does not count as a true patriot,” said Song Ru’an, a deputy commissioner in the office.Beijing’s moves, including its imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong outlawing speech deemed subversive or secessionist, have been criticized by the US and UK as a violation of China’s treaty commitment to maintain the city’s “high degree of autonomy.” On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, including Senators Ed Markey and Mitt Romney, called on the Biden administration to work with allies and partners to support the people of Hong Kong.Cheng, who was among senior officials sanctioned by the US Treasury in August on allegations of “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy,” on Tuesday reiterated the government’s argument that the security law had restored stability. “Please look at the actual facts and then see what’s happening in Hong Kong,” she said in response to the lawmakers’ statement.Hong Kong authorities have so far arrested 100 people on allegations of violating the security law, with most accused of participating in some form of political activity, such as displaying banners or posting in support of the city’s independence. The total includes 47 opposition figures charged last week with “conspiracy to commit subversion” over their aborted “35-plus” election campaign last year to win a majority on the Legislative Council and force Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign by voting down her budget.The electoral overhaul would go further by making it harder to for such opposition politicians to seek and win office, effectively ending the only open elections under Beijing’s rule. Lam said Monday that the proposal being drafted behind closed doors in Beijing would be locally enacted without the usual public consultation process.“The political structure is no longer ensuring the governance of the -- the efficacy of -- of the whole administration into a proper efficient way that serves the people in Hong Kong,” Cheng said. “And it is for that reason that the National People’s Congress sees the pressing need for that to be taken.”Cheng, who sits on the security committee established by the law, declined to explain why “35-plus” campaign constituted subversion, saying she couldn’t comment on specific cases. “We should move away from this topic and talk about other things, because we cannot talk about a case,” Cheng said.She also rejected as “totally absurd” criticism that the national security law had undermined the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary. “There is no threat on the judicial independence -- and I say it loud and clear and with confidence,” Cheng said.In December, the Communist Party’s People Daily newspaper published a commentary warning that the government could transfer media tycoon Jimmy Lai’s foreign collusion case to mainland courts after a decision to grant him bail. Lai was later sent back to jail after Hong Kong’s highest court affirmed a higher standards for releasing security law suspects before trial.The security law lets Cheng issue certificates requiring some cases to be tried without a jury, a power that local media including the South China Morning Post say she exercised to prosecute an activist accused of driving a motorcycle into a group of police officers in July. Cheng said the power would be “exercised independently and fairly and without any interference” and that a three-judge panel would uphold defendants’ rights.“One talks about ‘no jury’ as if it’s something that is such a big, worrying thing,” Cheng said. “We’re going to write down the reasons, and the, and the findings of fact and the legal basis upon which the conclusion of the verdict -- be it convict or acquit -- is going to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-minister-warns-against-oblivious-criticism-of-china-101615287537039.html

The government said that 316 of the injured have been discharged and 299 remain in care in various hospitals in the city.More than 60 people were also rescued from under the rubble by the civil protection corps and fire service, the government said.President Teodoro Obiang Nguema said the government will hold an emergency meeting to look into how victims can quickly receive aid from Equatorial Guinea before international aid arrives.Investigations into the blast have begun, he said in a Tuesday statement.The president initially the explosion was due to the “negligent handling of dynamite” in the military barracks and the impact damaged almost all the homes and buildings in Bata.The vice president, who is also charged with defense and security, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, said Tuesday that investigations so far showed the fire may have begun when a farmer set fire to his plot to prepare it for food production and a breeze spread the flames to the nearby barracks where the high-caliber ammunition was stored.Images shown on state TV showed plumes of smoke rising above the explosion site as crowds fled. Roofs of houses were ripped off.Equatorial Guinea, an oil-rich West African country of 1.3 million people located south of Cameroon, was a colony of Spain until it gained its independence in 1968. Bata has roughly 175,000 inhabitants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-from-explosions-in-equatorial-guinea-rises-to-98-101615284995249.html
09-03-2021||World||From land of promise to pariah state: Myanmar coup rattles foreign firms||Shortly after the military seized power, 55 foreign investors in Myanmar from Coca Cola to Facebook signed a statement committing to the country and employees there during developments of "deep concern".A month on, those pledges are being sorely tested with Myanmar's economy all but paralysed by massive anti-coup protests, widespread strikes and the junta's killing of dozens of protesters drawing calls for boycotts and sanctions.A sudden about-turn from Australia's Woodside Petroleum, one of the signatories to the statement, exemplifies the challenges. It said on February 27 it was reducing its presence in the country amid concerns about violence and would pull its offshore exploration team - just one week after saying drilling would not be affected.This week, fashion giant H&M, which has around 45 direct suppliers in Myanmar and is also a signatory to the statement, said it had paused new orders from the country due to transport and manufacturing disruptions.H&M is not, however, taking any immediate decision on its long-term future in Myanmar."We fully recognise the complexities ... in balancing different aspects to ensure that the people in Myanmar are not negatively affected," said Serkan Tanka, Myanmar country manager at H&M.One large global firm has already made a dramatic exit. Kirin Holdings Co is winding up a beer alliance with a military-linked company after coming under pressure from activist groups.Escalating violence, which has seen more than 50 protesters killed, is only adding to the uncertainty facing companies anxious about reputational risk."If this goes on for months, more would probably just totally leave," said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.RISKY BUSINESSOperating in Myanmar has long been a wrestle between high risk and potential high reward for foreign business.The opening up of one of Asia's last frontier markets in 2011 after half a century of military rule led to a surge in foreign direct investment. Net inflows peaked at $4.7 billion in 2017 compared with $900 million in 2010, according to the World Bank.But even before the coup, firms were grappling with crumbling infrastructure, constant power disruptions, legal uncertainty and an economy controlled in large parts by the military.While all foreign firms will be assessing and will be assessed over their next moves, energy companies - some of the longest standing foreign investors in Myanmar - are particularly likely to come under further pressure.The United Nation's human rights investigator on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a report last week that countries should impose sanctions on Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is now controlled by the military and represents its largest source of revenue.Total, which has been in Myanmar since 1992, and Chevron have a large offshore gas project in partnership with MOGE. A Chevron spokesperson said it will comply with all applicable laws and sanctions. Total declined comment on the threat of sanctions.Telecom and internet companies too are in a difficult position as they deal with intermittent shutdowns of services and new amendments to cyber laws that threaten human rights.Norway's Telenor, which has a mobile licence in Myanmar, said on Monday that the amendments broaden the powers of the military and reduce civil liberties, calling for the restoration of a sound legal framework in Myanmar.Facebook on Feb. 2 banned the Myanmar military from using its Facebook and Instagram platforms.Just how corporates should respond to Myanmar's challenges is a matter of hot debate.Chris Sidoti, an expert on Myanmar who was part of a UN-led fact-finding mission in 2019, says all foreign firms should suspend their businesses in Myanmar because the military has taken over every facet of government.Rights group Burma Campaign UK has called on Western brands to be diligent with who they work with but not to abandon Myanmar workers. Nearly half a million people in Myanmar are employed in factories producing textiles for retailers like H&M, Adidas, Gap and Zara.John Bray, director at business consultancy Control Risks, said that pressure on firms in Myanmar needed to be guided by an assessment of "complicity"."If you are providing a service for the Myanmar people, which they are paid for and which promotes the development of the economy, I don't think you're complicit in what is going on in the streets," said Bray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-land-of-promise-to-pariah-state-myanmar-coup-rattles-foreign-firms-101615286342862.html

EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations with a vaccine maker if at least four member countries request it.Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets Sputnik V abroad, told Italian television on Sunday it was collaborating with pharmaceutical company Adienne to produce the vaccine in Italy.The Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce later said there were plans for production to start in Italy in June and that the deal paved the way to create the first Sputnik V production facility in Europe.EMA earlier this month said it would review data from ongoing trials of the vaccine until there was enough evidence for a formal marketing authorisation application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developers-of-sputnik-v-question-neutrality-of-eu-regulator-demand-apology-101615286121844.html

Emergency Service arrived on the scene after the school administrative body dialled 911. "The school was immediately evacuated and students were transferred to the bus garage," the tweet read.All Newaygo County schools went into lockdown in compliance with the county's emergency operations plan until authorities determined there were no further threats to students, CNN further stated.Michigan State Police spokesperson Michelle Robinson, told the CNN reporters that their initial investigation said the student had no ill intent and did not intend to detonate the device.The 16-year-old was rushed to the hospital for moderate to severe injuries, while the four other students were taken to the hospital by their parents for minor injuries. The classroom teacher also went to the hospital, as the explosion involved smoke and there was concern about the chemicals potentially used in the device, Robinson said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms were on scene to assist with identifying what kind of material was involved in the explosion and the circumstances contributing, tweeted the state police.The incident is being investigated by the Newaygo Police Department and the Michigan State Police Hart Post with the full assistance of Newaygo Public School staff.

09-03-2021||World||EU to go ahead with tech tax with or without Joe Biden||European Union leaders are poised to affirm their commitment to a unilateral tax on tech giants if they fail to agree on a global framework with partners, including Joe Biden’s US administration, by the middle of this year.Over a summit later this month, leaders will “stress the need to urgently address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy to ensure fairness and effectiveness,” according to an early draft of a joint communique seen by Bloomberg. While vowing to work on “a consensus-based solution by mid-2021,” leaders will “confirm readiness to move forward if a global solution is not forthcoming,” according to the draft, which is still subject to change.Frustrated by the slow progress in international negotiations on rules of taxing profits, several EU countries already implemented or planned levies on the revenue of companies such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the jurisdictions where they operate. Those so-called digital services taxes sparked a dispute with former President Donald Trump‘s administration, which lined up retaliatory sanctions.Past efforts to reach consensus on similar levies have failed in the EU, where unanimity is required among all 27 members states. Some countries have insisted the bloc should first give more time to the global negotiations on tax rules at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Signs of progress emerged last month when the US dropped a key demand in negotiations, lifting a barrier that raised transatlantic trade tensions and prevented an international deal.US ConcessionIn a video summit in February, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told her counterparts at a meeting of financial officials from the Group of 20 that the US is no longer insisting on a so-called safe harbor rule that would allow US companies to opt out of new tax rules.Despite the move by Biden’s administration, there is still some distance to go to get a global deal on how to tax global tech giants. Beyond the issue of safe harbor, the US and Europe have long been at odds over the scope of any new rules and how they should be enforced.The EU’s executive arm is due to present it’s plans for a digital tax as soon as next month with the proceeds going to the bloc’s budget, including repayments on the jointly backed debt issued to fund the Covid economic recovery plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-go-ahead-with-tech-tax-with-or-without-joe-biden-101615283268673.html

EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations with a vaccine maker if at least four member countries request it.The Italian-Russian chamber of commerce said in a statement issued on Monday, a public holiday in Russia, that the move paved the way for the creation of the first Sputnik V production facility in Europe.It said there were plans for Italian production to begin in June and that it hoped that 10 million doses of Sputnik V could be produced there by the end of the year."This agreement is the first of its kind with a European partner," Vincenzo Trani, head of the chamber, said in the statement. "It can be called a historic event, which is proof of the good state of relations between our countries and shows that Italian companies can see beyond political differences."The Lugano-based Adienne Pharma & Biotech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kirill Dmitriev, head of the RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets Sputnik V internationally, told Italy's RAI 3 television channel on Sunday that many Italian regions were keen to produce the vaccine and that RDIF had struck an agreement with Adienne to produce Sputnik in Italy."...What we are offering is a true production partnership that will create jobs in Italy, and you can control the product, because it will be produced in Italy, and this product can not only save many lives in Italy, but it can be exported," he said.A senior European Medicines Agency (EMA) official urged European Union members last week to refrain from approving Sputnik V at the national level while the agency was still reviewing it, prompting the vaccine's developers to demand a public apology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-vaccine-could-be-made-in-europe-for-first-time-after-italy-deal-101615281977265.html

09-03-2021||World||Hong Kong minister warns citizens against ‘oblivious’ criticism of China||Hong Kong’s top legal official warned residents to steer clear of criticisms of the government that stray too far from the facts, as officials defend Beijing’s plan to overhaul the city’s elections.Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng said in an interview on Tuesday that opinions were “no more than an utterance of no value” if the facts weren’t established. Cheng was answering a question about what kind of criticism would be legal in the former British colony as Beijing implements a range of legal changes including a national security law and the electoral overhaul.“Some of the statements that are sometimes uttered, that we hear, are actually not based on facts, or perhaps oblivious of the facts that exist,” Cheng told Bloomberg Television. “And I think that is what one has to be very careful not to embark upon.”Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong are fanning out to defend the most significant changes to the city’s political system since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Chinese lawmakers are expected to approve a sweeping electoral overhaul later this week that will require future candidates for elected office to be “patriots” and secure nominations from a pro-Beijing committee.The moves, including Beijing’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong outlawing speech deemed subversive or secessionist, have been criticized by the U.S. and U.K. as a violation of China’s treaty commitment to maintaining the city’s “high degree of autonomy.”On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, including Senators Ed Markey and Mitt Romney, called on the Biden administration to work with allies and partners to support the people of Hong Kong.Cheng, who was among senior officials sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in August on allegations of “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy,” on Tuesday reiterated the government’s argument that the security law had restored stability. “Please look at the actual facts and then see what’s happening in Hong Kong,” she said in response to the lawmakers’ statement.Hong Kong authorities have so far arrested 100 people on allegations of violating the security law, with most accused of participating in some form of political activity, such as displaying banners or posting in support of the city’s independence. The total includes 47 opposition figures charged last week with “conspiracy to commit subversion” over their aborted “35-plus” election campaign last year to win a majority on the Legislative Council and force Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign by voting down her budget.The electoral overhaul would go further by making it harder to for such opposition politicians to seek and win office, effectively ending the only open elections under Beijing’s rule. Lam said Monday that the proposal being drafted behind closed doors in Beijing would be locally enacted without the usual public consultation process.“The political structure is no longer ensuring the governance of the -- the efficacy of -- of the whole administration into a proper efficient way that serves the people in Hong Kong,” Cheng said. “And it is for that reason that the National People’s Congress sees the pressing need for that to be taken.”Cheng, who sits on the security committee established by the law, declined to explain why “35-plus” campaign constituted subversion, saying she couldn’t comment on specific cases. “We should move away from this topic and talk about other things, because we cannot talk about a case,” Cheng said.She also rejected as “totally absurd” criticism that the national security law had undermined the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary. “There is no threat on the judicial independence -- and I say it loud and clear and with confidence,” Cheng said.In December, the Communist Party’s People Daily newspaper published a commentary warning that the government could transfer media tycoon Jimmy Lai’s foreign collusion case to mainland courts after a decision to grant him bail. Lai was later sent back to jail after Hong Kong’s highest court affirmed a higher standards for releasing security law suspects before trial.The security law lets Cheng issue certificates requiring some cases to be tried without a jury, a power that local media including the South China Morning Post say she exercised to prosecute an activist accused of driving a motorcycle into a group of police officers in July. Cheng said the power would be “exercised independently and fairly and without any interference” and that a three-judge panel would uphold defendants’ rights.“One talks about ‘no jury’ as if it’s something that is such a big, worrying thing,” Cheng said. “We’re going to write down the reasons, and the, and the findings of fact and the legal basis upon which the conclusion of the verdict -- be it convict or acquit -- is going to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-minister-warns-residents-against-oblivious-criticism-of-china-101615275739936.html

The bullet struck near her left eye, went through her neck and lodged in her shoulder.She recovered after months of treatment at home and abroad before co-writing a best-selling memoir titled "I am Malala", which drew even more international attention.Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as a 17-year-old in 2014, sharing the award with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India.She graduated from Britain's Oxford University last year and has since created a digital publication for girls and women, and formed her own TV production company."I believe in the power of stories to bring families together, forge friendships, build movements, and inspire children to dream," she was quoted as saying in Monday's statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malala-signs-deal-with-apple-tv-to-produce-documentaries-on-women-children-101615273016986.html
09-03-2021||World||Texas attorney journal contests Trump ban, Twitter files lawsuit||Twitter has filed a lawsuit against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, claiming the Republican used his office to retaliate against it for banning the account of former President Donald Trump following the riot at the US Capitol.Days after the deadly January insurrection, Paxton announced an investigation into Twitter and four other major technology companies for what he called “the seemingly coordinated de-platforming of the President.” The attorney general's office demanded that the companies produce a variety of records related to their content moderation policies and troves of internal communications.Twitter responded Monday with a federal lawsuit alleging Paxton is seeking to punish it for taking Trump's account offline — a decision the social media company says is protected free speech. It asks a judge to declare the decision to be under the ambit of the First Amendment and to, in essence, halt Paxton's investigation.“Paxton made clear that he will use the full weight of his office, including his expansive investigatory powers, to retaliate against Twitter for having made editorial decisions with which he disagrees,” lawyers for the company wrote in the suit filed in a Northern California court.Also read: 10 US states, including Texas, sue Google for ‘anti-competitive’ online ad salesSpokespersons for Paxton's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening.Twitter’s counterpunch comes as states, in addition to federal lawmakers and governments outside the US, are cracking down on tech companies they see as having amassed too much power in the past decade. This includes antitrust and anti-monopoly regulation, internet privacy laws as well as attempts to regulate how platforms like Twitter, Facebook and others moderate their sites.In December, Paxton led 10 Republican attorneys general in suing Google for allegedly running an illegal digital-advertising monopoly in cahoots with Facebook.GOP politicians in roughly two dozen states have also introduced bills that would allow for civil lawsuits against platforms for what they call the “censorship” of posts. Almost always, this means what they view as the censorship of conservative or Christian religious viewpoints.While there is no evidence that tech companies are biased against conservatives, the narrative has been popular with Republicans since before President Trump was elected and only grew louder throughout his term. Trump getting banned for life from Twitter and suspended temporarily from Facebook after inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riots only reinforced it.In launching his investigation, Paxton cited the First Amendment when he says tech companies’ banishment of Trump “chills free speech” and “wholly silences” those who disagree with them.However, Twitter — as well as the other companies Paxton targeted, including Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon — is a private firm, so the First Amendment does not apply to its decisions on what material to allow on its services. Unlike the government, Twitter is allowed to silence people. The company had long given Trump and other world leaders broad exemptions from its rules against personal attacks, hate speech and other behaviours. But after five people were killed at the Capitol riot, the company said Trump's tweets amounted to glorification of violence while plans were circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.Twitter's suit comes as Paxton is facing other legal challenges, including an FBI investigation into claims that he used his office to benefit a wealthy donor.He is also awaiting trial on unrelated securities fraud charges dating back to 2015. Paxton pleaded not guilty and the case has been stalled for years over legal challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-attorney-journal-contests-trump-ban-twitter-files-lawsuit-101615263504104.html

Justin Riemer said in a letter to Trump’s Save America Political Action Committee in response to Trump’s demanding his name not be used.That includes using his name in materials for its upcoming donor retreat at a hotel near Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach where Trump is expected to participate, Riemer said.Lawyers for Trump have demanded that the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee immediately stop using his “name, image and/or likeness in all fundraising, persuasion, and/or issue speech.”The RNC pushed back a little, saying the party “has every right to refer to public figures as it engages in core, First Amendment-protected political speech, and it will continue to do so” in pursuit of common goals of electing Republican candidates and advancing conservative policies, Riemer said in the letter.A Trump spokesman, Jason Miller, didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Trump has vowed to defeat the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him in January and to help elect GOP candidates in 2022. The demand letter suggests, however, that assistance will be provided on his terms. He has made it clear he wants contributions for those efforts to go to his Save America political action committee and other entities he controls.Also read: US to accept new visa applications by those denied due to Trump 'Muslim ban'The former president issued a statement Monday night saying contributions should be made to Save America and not be given to what many on the right label Rinos, or Republicans in name only.“No more money for Rinos,” Trump said in the statement issued through his PAC. “They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base—they will never lead us to Greatness.”Representatives of the NRCC and NRSC didn’t respond to requests for comment, but the NRSC sent out a fund-raising email on Sunday asking donors to become “Official Trump Defenders” if they “care about protecting President Trump’s legacy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rnc-says-trump-will-allow-his-name-to-be-used-in-fundraising-101615263470184.html
09-03-2021||World||Night raid on Myanmar protesters draws international alarm||Myanmar authorities cordoned off part of the commercial capital of Yangon on Monday night while searching for student protesters, drawing international condemnation as crowds defied a curfew to resist the crackdown.Embassies of the US, UK, Canada, Germany and others sent tweets late on Monday warning that security forces had surrounded a group of young people in the Sanchaung neighborhood of Yangon. People in surrounding areas swarmed the streets as videos of the situation spread on social media.By midnight, there were no reports of deaths from the standoff, the Associated Press reported. Security forces chased crowds, fired stun grenades and harassed residents watching from their windows, it said. Myanmar has regularly shut down the internet in the early-morning hours, making it difficult to get information.Residents said security forces used sound bombs, slingshots, tear gas shells and fired warning shots to disperse several hundred peaceful protesters in the Sanchaung area.“They blocked all the four main roads so these protesters had nowhere to go but to run into nearby apartments and hide inside the apartments with the support of house owners,” said Zaw Moe Aung, a resident. “They were raising their voices very peacefully, chanting to release detained leaders and immediately end the military dictatorship.”The troops, who stayed in the neighborhood late into the night, also threatened to enter home and buildings to search for the demonstrators, according to Myo Win Maung, who witnessed the scenes but eventually left after locals and people from other Yangon neighborhoods poured into the streets to protect the protesters.Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy issued a statement in support of the protesters and decried the violence against them. “We warn against such efforts which must end soonest,” the statement said.“The Embassy is very concerned about reports of many young people being trapped in Sanchaung and other parts of Yangon,” the German Embassy in Yangon said. “We urgently appeal to the security forces to abstain from the use of force and detentions against residents and others, and to let all peaceful protesters return to their homes immediately.”Myanmar’s military government also moved to shutter five local media outlets reporting on the protests. An order from the junta-appointed information minister revoked the licenses of Mizzima, DVB, 7Day News, Myanmar Now and Khit Thit Media, banning them from publishing any content.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing accused media outlets of misleading the international community, saying that security authorities used minimal force against protesters. He put the death toll at 34, about half of the figures reported by local media outlets, according to a broadcast on state-run MRTV.The general also said the detention of Sean Turnell, an Australian economic adviser to detained former leader Aung San Suu Kyi, had revealed some state economic secrets. “We managed to detain Sean Turnell in time when he’s about to leave the country,” Min Aung Hlaing was quoted as saying.Australia, which suspended defense cooperation with Myanmar after the coup, has demanded Turnell’s release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/night-raid-on-myanmar-protesters-draws-international-alarm-101615266976871.html

09-03-2021||World||US firms in China see growth, improved ties after Covid-19 pandemic||American businesses in China see their industries growing this year after the Covid-19 pandemic dented profits in 2020, with growing hopes the two nations will seek to mend ties, a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce shows.Some 81% of the 345 respondents expect industry growth this year and 45% see relations with the US improving, a jump of 15 percentage points from last year, according to a report released on Tuesday.The surge in optimism on bilateral ties came on the back of Joe Biden’s election as the new US president, AmCham China chairman Greg Gilligan said.“We think the issues remain the same, but stylistically things should improve with more traditional measures of diplomacy, including multilateralism, and frankly, getting back to the table for the US and China to speak to each other,” Gilligan said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.Gilligan also called on both countries to use “as narrowly as is appropriate” the ideas of national security and law enforcement, in order to broaden commercial opportunities.Half of the survey respondents said the investment environment is improving and just 12% said it is deteriorating, the lowest proportion since the question was first introduced in the survey in 2012. Only 56% made profits in 2020, the least since the question was polled 19 years ago, with a fifth suffering losses.“With China leading in economic recovery and the new U.S. administration in place, our members are cautiously optimistic regarding business growth in China,” Gilligan wrote in the report.Global business travel disruptions, the inability for expatriate staff to return to China due to government entry restrictions, and uncertainty around business decision-making were the biggest ways in which the pandemic impacted American companies’ operations in China.Despite emerging optimism, bilateral tensions were still seen as the companies’ biggest business challenge, followed by increasing labor costs, competition from private local companies, and inconsistent regulatory interpretation and unclear laws and enforcement.Ensuring a level playing field is the top action Beijing could take to help foreign businesses, the survey shows. Meanwhile, Washington could help by refraining from aggressive rhetoric and tit-for-tat actions. The survey was conducted between October and November last year.Other highlights:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-firms-in-china-see-growth-improved-ties-after-covid-19-pandemic-101615266362833.html
09-03-2021||World||A quick swab and a boarding pass: Israel's El Al launches check-in Covid-19 test||Israel's El Al airlines launched a pilot programme at its Tel Aviv airport check-in counters on Monday to test unvaccinated passengers for Covid-19 before allowing them to board a non-stop flight to New York.Just before stepping up to the counters, 112 of the 280 passengers on flight 003 were required by El Al to undergo a nose swab - a rapid antigen test, with results within 15 to 20 minutes, that detects protein fragments specific to the coronavirus. All 112 passed the test.Airlines have for months been lobbying governments for such measures to prevent people from having to go into quarantine on arrival.With some 40 percent of Israelis over the age of 16 already fully vaccinated after their second dose of Pfizer /BioNTech's vaccine, most of those tested at the airport were children, who under current health guidelines are not given the shots."He was good. He only cried for a second," said the mother of a 10-month-old after the nose swab by a medical team stationed in front of the check-in desk.For 5-year-old Hili Lazarof, the test was "okay".The aim of the test was to ensure no one on the plane carried the coronavirus or could infect others. But masks were still mandatory for the duration of the 12-hour flight."What we are trying to do in this concept is basically taking three layers of protection for the passengers," El Al Chief Executive Avigal Soreq told Reuters.He was referring to government-issued vaccination certificates issued in Israel's world-leading inoculation rollout, PCR tests which all Ben Gurion airport passengers must take up to 72 hours before takeoff, and the rapid-result swab.Such testing could reduce social distancing that limits turnover at airports and cramps passenger comfort, and allow business as usual for duty-free shops and restaurants, said Leehu Hacohen, El Al's vice president for operations."Today's flight is, I think, the first in the world where you will know that you have verified that everyone onboard is certainly clean and non-coronavirus contagious," he told Israel's Army Radio.Some passengers were annoyed they had to have another test after a negative result in their PCR swab, grumbling to ticket agents about a wait that took a bit longer than the promised 15 minutes.But Hodaya Meshita, 27, from Savannah, Georgia said about her rapid test: "It's uncomfortable for a few seconds." She has had only one dose of a two-shot vaccine so far.Soreq said El Al would likely carry out similar swabbing in New York next week and then see whether to add the process to other flights as the airline and Israel's tourism industry struggle to recover from the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-quick-swab-and-a-boarding-pass-israel-s-el-al-launches-check-in-covid-19-test-101615265497771.html
09-03-2021||World||China lays out ambitious five-year targets at National People's Congress||China’s economic planners are used to setting ambitious targets, and its latest five-year plan running to 2025 is no exception. Here are some of the most impressive numbers outlined by the government at its annual National People’s Congress, which kicked off Friday.Research Spending to Rival USChina’s leadership is worried about US sanctions cutting off access to core technologies, and wants to make the economy more dependent on innovation as traditional growth engines like urbanization are slowing. A top priority is increasing spending on research and development, which covers basic scientific research and spending by companies on the development of new products.The government is targeting 7% annual growth in R&D spending through 2025, which would bring its total spending to 3.76 trillion yuan ($580 billion) by the end of the period. That’s more than the $548 billion the US spent in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available.10 Million New Urban Residents a YearChina wants 65% of its population to live in towns and cities by 2025, up from 60.6% in 2019. As the population will stay roughly constant at 1.4 billion over that period, that means about 50 million people will need to move permanently from rural to urban areas over the next five years.Read more: Here’s Everything You Need to Know About China’s NPC So Far84,000 New Doctors a YearThe public health care system is underfunded by developed-world standards. Beijing is targeting a ratio of 3.2 doctors per 1,000 people by 2025, up from 2.9 today. Due to China’s vast population, that means about 420,000 extra physicians need to be trained by then. The government has a pool of more than 9 million new college graduates each year to recruit from.20 New Nuclear ReactorsChina is backing nuclear power as part of its drive to cut carbon emissions. The government aims to have 70 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity by 2025 from about 50 gigawatts at the end of last year. That would equate to about 20 new reactors.New Forests Larger Than South KoreaAs part of its environmental aims, Beijing wants to increase the size of the nation’s forests. Trees soak up carbon dioxide, absorb water and help reduce the flooding that plagues large parts of the country. Huge tree-planting schemes have been common for over a decade, although some are criticized because of their lack of biodiversity.The plan is for forests to cover 24.1% of the country’s total land area by 2025, up from 23.2% in 2019. As China is the world’s third-largest country by area -- being roughly the same size as the US that will mean planting more than 11 million hectares of new forests by 2025, about the same size as the US state of Ohio, and larger than South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lays-out-ambitious-five-year-targets-at-national-people-s-congress-101615255565121.html
09-03-2021||World||Lawyers probing Cuomo have dealt political figures in high profile cases||The lawyers tapped to investigate sexual harassment allegations against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo both have experience handling high-profile cases involving men accused of abusing their power.One of the attorneys, Joon Kim, was a federal prosecutor who directed investigations that sent one of Cuomo's top aides to prison on a bribery conviction and led to the conviction of another on charges connected to a massive economic development project that Cuomo championed.The other investigator, Anne L. Clark, is an employment lawyer who once represented a woman in sexual harassment lawsuit filed against a powerful New Jersey politician.New York Attorney General Letitia James appointed Clark and Kim on Monday to look into accusations against the Democratic governor made by several women, including three former staffers in his administration.“These are serious allegations that demand a rigorous and impartial investigation. We will act judiciously and follow the facts wherever they lead,” Kim said in a statement released by James' office.The allegations include asking questions about the women's love lives and discussing his own, making inappropriate comments about their appearance and, in some cases, subjecting them to unwanted kisses or too-intimate hugs.Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately, and said some of the allegations are false. But he has apologised for engaging in what he called office “banter” that some women “misinterpreted” as flirting. He has said he didn't realize he was making anyone uncomfortable.“The people of New York deserve an exhaustive and independent investigation into these allegations, and I am committed to seeing it through,” Clark said in a statement via James' office. The Associated Press left messages with both Clark and Kim seeking further comment.Kim served as acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York for 10 months in 2017 and 2018, taking over after his predecessor, Preet Bharara, was abruptly fired by President Donald Trump.The office would later be deeply involved in investigating members of Trump's inner circle, including his lawyer Michael Cohen and political strategist Steve Bannon. But during Kim's tenure, its highest-profile cases involved public corruption.Kim held various top posts in the office while it investigated Joseph Percoco, a longtime Cuomo friend and aide whom the governor once likened to a brother.Percoco was convicted in 2018 and is serving a six-year sentence for accepting more than USD 300,000 from companies that wanted to gain influence with Cuomo's administration.Cuomo wasn't accused of wrongdoing, but testimony presented an unflattering picture of his office's inner workings.After Percoco's conviction, Cuomo said there's “no tolerance for any violation of the public trust.” His opponents, meanwhile, said the case showed the governor hadn't done enough to address chronic corruption in state government.Kim also was a key figure in the US attorney's office while it investigated the state's Buffalo Billion high-tech construction project, a probe that led to the conspiracy and wire fraud conviction of a man whom Cuomo once called his “economic guru” — Alain Kaloyeros, a former head of the State University of New York's Polytechnic Institute. He was sentenced in 2018 to 3 1/2 years in prison but has remained free while his case is appealed.Days into his tenure as the acting US attorney, Kim announced prosecutors wouldn't seek criminal charges against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, after investigating whether his administration solicited campaign contributions from people seeking official favors from the city.Kim, who has been in private practice for the last three years, was known in the US attorney's office as being detail-oriented while also having a good sense of humour that people didn't always recognise.Clark is a New York City law firm partner who has handled sexual harassment, disability discrimination and equal pay cases.Among her past clients is a woman who sued former New Jersey state Assembly Speaker Garabed “Chuck” Haytaian, accusing him of repeatedly kissing and groping her against her wishes while she worked for the Assembly in the mid-1990s. Haytaian denied the allegations.The state eventually paid the woman USD 175,000 to settle the case. Haytaian, who also chaired the state Republican Party for a time, later retired from political life.Earlier in Clark's career, she worked for what was then the National Organisation for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund; it's now called Legal Momentum.She was periodically quoted in the media — including about a 1993 Supreme Court case that hinged on whether a Tennessee-based forklift rental company president's sexual innuendos and sexist remarks, which he said were jokes, amounted to an abusive work environment.A lower court had said no, reasoning that the executive's conduct was offensive but wouldn't have been expected to “seriously affect” an employee's psychological well-being.Clark, who wasn't involved in the case, saw it differently: “You shouldn't have to suffer a nervous breakdown before you can make a claim,” USA Today quoted her as saying.The Supreme Court ultimately also disagreed and sent the case back to the lower court to proceed.

09-03-2021||World||Fully vaccinated people can gather without masks, CDC says||Fully vaccinated Americans can gather with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing a mask or social distancing, according to long-awaited guidance from federal health officials.The recommendations also say that vaccinated people can come together in the same way — in a single household — with people considered at low-risk for severe disease, such as in the case of vaccinated grandparents visiting healthy children and grandchildren.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the guidance Monday.The guidance is designed to address a growing demand, as more adults have been getting vaccinated and wondering if it gives them greater freedom to visit family members, travel, or do other things like they did before the Covid-19 pandemic swept the world last year.“With more and more people vaccinated each day, we are starting to turn a corner,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.During a press briefing Monday, she called the guidance a “first step” toward restoring normalcy in how people come together. She said more activities would be ok'd for vaccinated individuals once caseloads and deaths decline, more Americans are vaccinated, and as more science emerges on the ability of those who have been vaccinated to get and spread the virus.The CDC is continuing to recommend that fully vaccinated people still wear well-fitted masks, avoid large gatherings, and physically distance themselves from others when out in public. The CDC also advised vaccinated people to get tested if they develop symptoms that could be related to Covid-19.The CDC guidance did not speak to people who may have gained some level of immunity from being infected, and recovering from, the coronavirus.Officials say a person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of vaccine. About 31 million Americans — or only about 9% of the US population — have been fully vaccinated with a federally authorized Covid-19 vaccine so far, according to the CDC.Authorized vaccine doses first became available in December, and they were products that required two doses spaced weeks apart. But since January, a small but growing number of Americans have been fully vaccinated, and have been asking questions like: Do I still have to wear a mask? Can I go to a bar now? Can I finally see my grandchildren?The guidance was “welcome news to a nation that is understandably tired of the pandemic and longs to safely resume normal activities,” said Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the CDC.“I hope that this new guidance provides the momentum for everyone to get vaccinated when they can and gives states the patience to follow the public health roadmap needed to reopen their economies and communities safely,” said Besser, in a statement.But some said the guidance is too cautious.Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska College of Public Health, said the guidance is reasonable in many respects — with the exception of travel.The CDC did not change its recommendations on travel, which discourages unnecessary travel and calls for getting tested within a few days of the trip. That could seem confusing to vaccinated people hoping to visit family across the country or abroad.“They need to relax travel for those vaccinated” and to immediately publish electronic standards for documents that show whether a person is fully vaccinated, said Khan, who formerly was a leading CDC disease detective.The new guidance also says nothing about going to restaurants or other places, even though governors are lifting restrictions on businesses, said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who formerly was Baltimore’s health commissioner.Wen has said the CDC should have had some kind of post-vaccination guidance ready in January, when some people first began to finish their second doses. And she called the guidance that came out Monday “far too cautious.”“The CDC is missing a major opportunity to tie vaccination status with reopening guidance. By coming out with such limited guidance, they are missing the window to influence state and national policy,” Wen said, in an email.But some people who are fully vaccinated were pleased by Monday's news.Ruth Michienzi was among those receiving her second and final vaccine dose at a pharmacy inside a Stop and Shop supermarket in Woburn, Massachusetts on Monday morning.The 91-year-old resident of nearby Burlington said she’s fine with having to still wear a facemask in public and follow other safety guidelines even after being fully vaccinated.But Michienzi also said she’s excited to finally be able to take off her mask in front of her three great grandchildren. She’s seen them in person since receiving her first shot about a month ago, but has kept her mask on.“I hope they remember me,” she said.“I’ve been doing all of that for a year, and I don’t want that year to be wasted,” Michienzi said of the safety regulations. “I think it’s smart to wait.”A pair of customers, who weren’t in line to receive shots, though, openly groused about the continued restrictions and voiced fears that stricter mandates on travel and socializing would follow, even as more are vaccinated.Grace McShane, 61, of Melrose, also received her second dose Monday at the same supermarket.She says she qualified for the vaccine because she’s high risk, including suffering a heart attack last year. The in-home caregiver said she too was fine with the continued restrictions even after being vaccinated.“Even if you’re vaccinated, it’s better to be safe than sorry. This is the new normal. This is part of life and you just have to adapt to it,” McShane said.She said she’s looking forward to hugging her three grandchildren without having to wear a mask. Her grown children have also been vaccinated as essential workers, she said.“Just cuddle and give them hugs,” McShane said. “That’s all I want to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-people-can-gather-without-masks-cdc-says-101615250241193.html
09-03-2021||World||Kamala Harris to make UN debut as US VP at gender equality meeting||Kamala Harris is due to make her United Nations debut as US vice president next week when she addresses an annual United Nations meeting on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.Harris will speak at the virtual 65th Commission on the Status of Women on March 16, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Monday, adding Washington would also join a UN "Group of Friends for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls.""We all believe and understand that when women do better, countries do better," Thomas-Greenfield said. "It is time we translate our noble commitments into concrete action."She said the United States would take a leading role to combat sexual and gender-based violence around the world and to push for more women to be included in peace talks globally.Under former US President Donald Trump's administration, the United States led a push at the United Nations against the promotion of women's sexual and reproductive rights and health because it sees that as code for abortion. It has opposed such language in UN resolutions.In May, the Trump administration accused the United Nations of using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to promote access to abortion through its humanitarian response to the deadly global outbreak. The United Nations rejected the accusation.The Trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) because it said it "supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization." The United Nations said that was an inaccurate perception.U.S. President Joe Biden intends to restore UNFPA funding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-make-un-debut-as-us-vp-at-gender-equality-meeting-101615249329580.html
09-03-2021||World||Myanmar protesters defy curfew; media outlets ordered shut||Demonstrators in Myanmar’s biggest city came out Monday night for their first mass protests in defiance of an 8 pm curfew, seeking to show support for an estimated 200 students trapped by security forces in a small area of one neighborhood.The students and other civilians earlier took part in one of the many daily protests across the country against the military’s seizure of power last month that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.The military government also placed a major curb on media coverage of the crisis. It announced that the licenses of five local media outlets — Mizzima, DVB, Khit Thit Media, Myanmar Now and 7Day News — have been canceled.“These media companies are no longer allowed to broadcast or write or give information by using any kind of media platform or using any media technology,” it said on state broadcaster MRTV.All five had been offering extensive coverage of the protests, often with livestreaming video online. The offices of Myanmar Now were raided by the authorities Monday before the measure was announced. The government has detained dozens of journalists since the coup, including a Myanmar Now reporter and Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, both of whom have been charged under a public order law that carried a penalty of up to three years in prison.The night's street protests began after police cordoned off part of Yangon’s Sanchaung neighborhood and were believed to be conducting door-to-door searches for those who fled attacks by security forces to seek shelter in the homes of sympathetic strangers.News of their plight spread quickly on social media, and people poured into the streets in neighborhoods all over the city to show solidarity and in hopes of drawing some of the pressure off the hunted protesters. On some streets, they constructed makeshift barricades with whatever was at hand.In the Insein district, they spread across road junctions, singing songs, chanting pro-democracy slogans and banging objects together.The diplomatic missions of the United States, Britain, Canada and the European Union all issued statements urging the security forces to allow the trapped people to return safely to their homes. Although all have been sharply critical of the Feb. 1 coup and police violence, it is unusual for such diplomatic statements to be issued in connection with a specific, ongoing incident.“There is heightened tension caused by security forces surrounding Kyun Taw Road in Sanchaung Township, Yangon. We call on those security forces to withdraw and allow people to go home safely,” said the U.S. Embassy's statement.By midnight Myanmar time, there had been no reports of clashes between police and protesters, although security forces chased crowds, harassed residents watching from windows, and fired stun grenades. They also were some reports of injuries from rubber bullets.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is following developments in the Sanchaung district where “many of those trapped are women, who were peacefully marching in commemoration of International Women’s Day,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.“He calls for maximum restraint and urges for the safe release of all without violence or arrests,” Dujarric said, and for respect of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression for peaceful demonstrators voicing “their hopes and desires for the future of their country."Guterres also called the occupation of a number of public hospitals in Myanmar by security forces “completely unacceptable,” the U.N. spokesman said.The nighttime hours have become increasingly dangerous in Myanmar. Police and army units routinely range through neighborhoods, shooting randomly to intimidate residents and disrupt their sleep, and making targeted arrests.Security forces shot and killed two people in northern Myanmar during the day, local media reported.The Irrawaddy online newspaper said the victims were shot in the head during anti-coup protests in Myitkyina in Kachin State. Graphic video on social media showed protesters backing away from tear gas, responding with rocks and then fleeing after a fusillade of what seemed to be automatic gunfire.Demonstrators hurriedly carried away the injured, including one apparent fatality, a person with a severe head wound. A second body was seen later on a stretcher, his head covered with a cloth.Another shooting death took place in Pyapon, a city about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Yangon.To date, the government's violent crackdown has left more than 50 protesters dead. At least 18 people were fatally shot Feb. 28 and 38 on Wednesday, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office.Security forces also clamped down on anti-coup protesters elsewhere Monday, firing tear gas to break up a crowd of about 1,000 people demonstrating in Pyinmana, a satellite town of the capital, Naypyitaw. The protesters deployed fire extinguishers to create a smokescreen as they fled from authorities.Thousands of protesters who marched in Mandalay, the second-largest city, dispersed on their own amid fears that soldiers and police were planning to break up their demonstration with force.Meanwhile, an armed force from one of Myanmar’s ethnic groups was deployed to protect anti-coup marchers in the wake of a brutal crackdown by the junta.The unit from the Karen National Police Force arrived shortly after dawn to accompany about 2,000 protesters near Myitta in Tanintharyi Region in southeastern Myanmar. They carried an assortment of firearms including assault rifles as they marched ahead of the column down dusty rural roads.The Karen police force is under the control of the Karen National Union, one of many ethnic organizations that have been fighting for greater autonomy from the central government for decades. The KNU employs both political and, through its armed wing, military means to achieve its aims.Large-scale protests have occurred daily in many cities and towns since Myanmar’s military seized power, and security forces have responded with ever greater use of lethal force and mass arrests.On Sunday, police occupied hospitals and universities and reportedly arrested hundreds of people involved in protesting the military takeover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-defy-curfew-media-outlets-ordered-shut-101615249234962.html
09-03-2021||World||In draft deal for Afghan peace, US wants Taliban in interim govt||A draft peace agreement proposed by the US to “jump-start” the peace talks in Afghanistan envisages the formation of a transitional government with the Taliban and includes provisions to prevent terror-related activities on Afghan soil.The draft “Afghanistan Peace Agreement” is the second key document related to the Biden administration’s efforts to push the peace process in Afghanistan that has leaked in recent days, following US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s letter to President Ashraf Ghani on the next steps envisaged by Washington.The draft agreement includes three elements – guiding principles for a new constitution and a new state structure; terms for a transitional government involving the Taliban; and terms for a permanent ceasefire. It includes “options for power-sharing” to facilitate a settlement.Blinken’s letter to Ghani included four elements - asking the UN to convene a meeting of India, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and the US to discuss a unified approach on Afghanistan, asking Turkey to convene a meeting of the Afghan side and the Taliban, getting the Afghan side and the Taliban to agree on ways to speed up discussions on a settlement, and a plan to reduce violence.There was no official word from the Indian side, but people familiar with developments said New Delhi will stick to its position on backing an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process. India wants any eventual outcome to ensure that Afghan soil isn’t used for terror activities, the people said.The US proposal states that a “transitional peace government of Afghanistan” will be formed once the peace agreement is signed and this formation will exist until it “transfers power to a permanent government following the adoption of a new constitution and national elections”.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said, “It is a fraught process, but it also the best possible solution in the available circumstances. There is no real possibility of taking weapons away from the Taliban, and one can look at buying their loyalty to bring them into the mainstream. Variations of this solution have been paraded by other US administrations, but there really is no other solution without economic development,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-draft-deal-for-afghan-peace-us-wants-taliban-in-interim-govt-101615247735379.html
09-03-2021||World||Suicide to racism: Harry, Meghan on royal mess||Prince Harry and his wife Meghan alleged in an explosive interview on Sunday that they encountered racist attitudes and a lack of support that drove the Duchess of Sussex to thoughts of suicide.In a two-hour tell-all interview by Oprah Winfrey, the legendary talk show host, the former royal couple painted a deeply unflattering picture of life inside the royal household, depicting a cold, uncaring institution that they had to flee to save their lives.Meghan told Winfrey that at one point “I just didn’t want to be alive anymore”. She said she sought help through the palace’s human resources department but was told there was nothing it could do. Meghan, 39, admitted that she was naive at the start of her relationship with Harry and unprepared for the strictures of royal life.The former television star, who is biracial, said that when she was pregnant with son, Archie, there were “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born”. Markle clarified she had not heard this conversation herself. “That was relayed to me from Harry from the conversations the family had with him,” she told Winfrey.Harry confirmed the conversation, saying: “I was a bit shocked.” He said he would not reveal who made the comment, though Winfrey said he told her it was not either of his grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II or Prince Philip. Markle said she was told that her son would not be granted a royal title or security even before he was born.“The allegation that there were discussions in the palace about how dark Meghan’s first baby might be is a devastating one,” Jonny Dymond, BBC’s royal correspondent, noted.Harry said he had lived in fear of a repeat of the fate of his mother, Princess Diana, who was covered constantly by the press and died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Harry revealed he currently has a poor relationship with William and said things got so bad with his father that at one point Prince Charles stopped taking his calls. “There is a lot to work through there,” Harry said about his father.Harry and Meghan, known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced they were quitting royal duties last year. The interview was widely seen as their first opportunity to explain their decision.In a rare positive moment in the interview, though, the couple revealed their second child, due in the summer, would be a girl.The palace has not responded to the interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-to-racism-harry-meghan-on-royal-mess-101615246997911.html
