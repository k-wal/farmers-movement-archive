The virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, praised the panel for speaking up, saying it showed the system of checks and balances worked.'NEGATIVE REPORTS'The new doubts about the shot's efficacy coincide with its rollout in dozens of countries and clouds the timeline for its potential emergency use authorization in the United States."This is indeed an extraordinary act. The negative reports about this vaccine do not stop, although my assessment is that it is well tolerated and safe, but clearly less effective than the two mRNA vaccines," said Peter Kremsner, from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.Vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna that use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to produce an immune response both had efficacy rates of about 95% in their pivotal clinical trials, far above the 50% benchmark set by global regulators.AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot has faced questions since late last year when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data from an earlier trial with two different efficacy readings as a result of a dosing error.Confidence in the vaccine took a further hit this month, when more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended giving out the shot after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.The European Union's drug regulator said last week the vaccine was clearly safe, but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained skeptical about its safety.The latest trial data, which has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers or regulators, was based on 141 infections among 32,449 participants.Stephen Evans, a pharmacoepidemiology professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the up-to-date data request may have to do with efficacy readings from recent cases, which may include new virus variants and thus lower protection rates."The other vaccines may also show such reduced efficacy and we don't know by how much," he said.The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of Covid-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.It has been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorization in more than 70 countries.Many countries are relying heavily on the shot to end the pandemic, and several state leaders have taken it publicly to boost confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-rebuke-over-outdated-data-astrazeneca-to-publish-full-us-trial-results-101616523396053.html

It has only been activated once by NATO, after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.Former US President Donald Trump often criticized NATO partners for failing to pay their fair share of the defense burden, claiming falsely that they owed the alliance or the United States money.Early in his tenure, he threatened not to come to the defense of any country that did not meet NATO spending guidelines, causing deep concern among member nations close to Russia’s borders, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.The ministers noted that members of the 30-nation alliance “are making good progress on fairer trans-Atlantic burden sharing; we welcome the efforts made by all Allies in Europe and North America that contribute to our indivisible security. We must and will do more.”They also vowed that NATO would continue to adapt in the face of “rising threats and systemic competition,” and underlined that “Russia’s aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-affirms-unity-as-minsters-put-donald-trump-era-behind-them-101616519447307.html

They flew at full staff for a few hours on Tuesday morning before being lowered again to mark the Boulder killings.Biden, whose personal life has been marked by the loss of his first wife, and two children, is expected to offer condolences to the families of victims. He did the same in Atlanta on March 19, and to the families of more than 525,000 dead from coronavirus on March 11."A day will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye, as unbelievable as that is now," he said in Atlanta, during a speech originally planned to celebrate the passage of his $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. "It will take a while, but I promise you it will come."Biden has in recent weeks promoted the coronavirus stimulus bill while grappling with a surge of migrants along the US southern border with Mexico.Now his two-month-old administration faces increased pressure to fulfill promises on gun regulation. Any effort to move the United States toward greater gun control has historically been difficult with Democrats in favor and Republicans largely opposed.Biden will visit Ohio State University's James Cancer Hospital to mark the healthcare bill anniversary and promote a $100 million grant the hospital received under the Affordable Care Act to upgrade its radiation oncology department, according to White House officials.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) - the signature 2010 legislative achievement of then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat under whom Biden served as vice president - has survived repeated attacks from Republicans, on Capitol Hill and in the courts. It is expanding under Biden's watch.The federal exchange reopened in mid-February for a special enrollment period, with more than 206,000 people signing up for coverage in the first two weeks, nearly triple the number during the same time frame last year, when access was limited to life-changing events, federal data shows.There are about 28 million Americans without health insurance, down from about 46.5 million in 2010, when the ACA was passed, according to the latest federal figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-step-into-familiar-role-as-counselor-in-chief-after-colorado-shooting-101616518691223.html

The office is based in Manhattan.The president also intends to nominate Breon Peace, who worked under former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, as the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District, based in Brooklyn, the person said. Lynch served in the same role before she became attorney general.Biden will also nominate Trini Ross, a longtime federal prosecutor, to run the office in the Western District, based in Buffalo, the person said.The person could not discuss the matter publicly ahead of an official announcement.Williams was a law clerk to federal Judge Merrick Garland, before Garland became attorney general. He currently works at the chief of the U.S. attorney’s office’s securities and commodities task force and supervises a team of more than 20 prosecutors. He has been involved in a number of high-profile prosecutions in New York, including of former state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and of former U.S. Rep.

23-03-2021||World||India abstains from UNHRC vote on Sri Lanka’s human rights record||India on Tuesday abstained from a crucial vote at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Sri Lanka’s rights record, though New Delhi called on Colombo to carry forward the reconciliation process and address the aspirations of the Tamil minority.The 47-member UNHRC adopted a resolution – sponsored by a group of countries that includes the UK, Germany and Canada – which gives UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet the mandate to collect and preserve evidence of crimes related to Sri Lanka’s civil war that ended in 2009 with the defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels.A total of 22 countries voted for the resolution that was very critical of Sri Lanka’s failure to address human rights violations that occurred during the civil war. The resolution also contended the human rights situation has deteriorated under the Rajapaksa administration and that rights defenders and ethnic and religious minorities are facing problems.Eleven countries, including Bangladesh, China and Pakistan, voted against the resolution, while 14 countries, including India, Indonesia, Japan and Nepal, abstained.In a statement before the voting on the resolution on “Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka”, Pawankumar Badhe, first secretary at India’s permanent mission in Geneva, said New Delhi believes states have the primary responsibility for protecting human rights.“We would urge the government of Sri Lanka to carry forward the process of reconciliation, address the aspirations of the Tamil community and continue to engage constructively with the international community to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected,” Badhe said.India’s approach to human rights in Sri Lanka, he said, was guided by “two fundamental considerations” – support to the Tamil minority for equality, justice, dignity and peace, and ensuring the unity, stability and territorial integrity of the island nation.“We have always believed that these two goals are mutually supportive and Sri Lanka’s progress is best assured by simultaneously addressing both objectives,” he added.India also supports the world community’s call for Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitments on devolution of political authority to the Tamils, including through early holding of elections to provincial councils and ensuring that these councils are able to operate effectively in line with the 13th amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution, Badhe said.India has traditionally shied away from backing direct UN intervention on human rights issues because of its sensitivities related to the Kashmir issue. At the same time, the Modi government has repeatedly pressed Sri Lanka to take steps to devolve powers to the Tamil minority and address their aspirations.The Tamil Nadu assembly election, to be held during April-May, is also believed to have been a factor behind India’s decision to abstain. The status of Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority is often a factor in Tamil Nadu’s politics.Though the Sri Lankan government reached out to India to vote against the resolution at the UNHRC, New Delhi has been irked with Colombo for reneging on a 2019 tripartite India-Japan-Sri Lanka agreement for developing the East Container Terminal at Colombo port.The Sri Lankan government scrapped the deal last month following pressure from labour unions and instead offered to develop the West Container Terminal with Indian and Japanese investors.Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena made a distinction while thanking countries that voted against the resolution or abstained. In a tweet, he appreciated “the support shown at Geneva” by countries such as India and Japan that abstained, and in another tweet, he extended a “very warm Thank You for solid support” shown by countries that voted against the resolution.While presenting the resolution at the UNHRC, British ambassador Julian Braithwaite said: “Impunity has become more entrenched; progress in emblematic cases has stalled.” But Sri Lankan ambassador MCA Chandraprema rejected the document as “unhelpful and divisive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-abstains-from-unhrc-vote-on-sri-lanka-s-human-rights-record-101616518376995.html

As transmission continues, more variants are likely to emerge, including those that could evade vaccines.“The global access to vaccines are at risk because of the demands that high- and upper middle-income countries are putting on the global supply,” he said. “This is not just a moral outrage, it is also economically and epidemiologically self defeating.”These trends could put the world back at “square one,” Tedros said. “As long as the virus continues to circulate anywhere, people will continue to die, trade and travel will continue to be disrupted and the economic recovery will be further delayed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truly-worrying-trends-who-chief-on-rising-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-101616516660694.html

Then, he went back to their homeland -- but not before he placed her in the hands of a young man who was to help her cross the river into Texas.“He just said to go on my own and take care of myself,” she said.What happened to the man who was to be her guide is unclear, but the pony-tailed girl met up with a group and pressed on, vigorously swinging her arms to keep up as they trekked north through the Rio Grande Valley on Sunday under a half-moon. Temperatures had dipped into the mid-50s; the girl wore a yellow jacket decorated with cartoonish drawings of trains, and a black mask to protect her from Covid-19.The AP is not using the girl’s name. It does not normally name children without permission from their parents, and the identity of her father could not be obtained.But her journey illustrates the extraordinary risks taken by migrant parents to get their children across the border, even if it means abandoning them for the most perilous part of the trip.These desperate decisions represent a dilemma for the fledgling administration of President Joe Biden as it attempts to restore an orderly asylum system: In trying to adopt a more humane approach to protect minors traveling alone, more children may be put at risk.Nearly 9,500 migrant children arrived at the border in February, up 60% from a month earlier. The government is rushing to set up more facilities to house them and speeding up the process to place them with relatives in the US. The city and county of San Diego said Monday that its downtown convention center would host migrant children for an average of 30 to 35 days.Single adults are almost always expelled, while families are sometimes expelled and sometimes allowed to remain in the United States to pursue asylum.The girl did reach the United States. A fellow Honduran migrant, 25-year-old Fernanda Solis, said she found her crying alone on a dirt path north of the Rio Grande after midnight, as a helicopter hovered overhead and border agents addressed migrants through a loudspeaker.Solis tried to comfort the girl, who was cold, hungry and thirsty. She told her they could walk together to turn themselves over to Border Patrol agents and seek asylum.The girl gained confidence as she walked a route commonly used by Central American migrants. She answered questions unhesitatingly: She turns 8 next month. She should be going into third grade, though she did not complete second because of the pandemic.She pressed ahead to a country where she knows no one but a family member in South Carolina.“That’s how she acts. She is brave,” Solis said.The girl said her father had no more money to cross the border with her.“He lost his job,” she said, simply.Solis said she was able to gather that the girl’s father had recently tried to cross with her, but they were both quickly expelled back to Reynosa, Mexico, under pandemic-related powers the Trump administration invoked. Biden has kept the powers -- known as Title 42 for the section of an obscure public health law -- in place.“The girl told me they had tried to cross together, but they were returned. This time, he just sent the girl for her to turn herself in,” Solis said.A federal judge halted expulsions of unaccompanied children in November, after the Trump administration had turned back at least 8,800. But an appeals court panel of three Trump-appointed judges ruled in January that they could resume. Biden, in a break with Trump, decided to release children to relatives with notices to appear in immigration courts.The Honduran girl turned herself over to Customs and Border Protection; the agency did not respond to a request for information about her whereabouts.Her story is being repeated again and again along the border. On Sunday, a Salvadoran man approached a journalist to ask whether his 13-year-old daughter would qualify to stay if she crossed on her own.“The parents are saying ‘We are not going to make it. We have to be very realistic here, but if I send my child up to the bridge, and they cross alone, they’ll have to take them in,’” said Jennifer Harbury, a Texas-based human rights advocate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7yearold-girl-s-solo-journey-to-us-border-shows-risks-parents-take-101616514396744.html

We must fight for it.”The 44-year-old Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken opponent, was arrested on Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.Last month, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.Navalny’s arrest fueled a series of protests that drew tens of thousands to the streets across Russia. Authorities detained about 11,000 people, many of whom were fined or given jail terms ranging from seven to 15 days.Several top Navalny associates have faced charges of violating coronavirus restrictions by calling for protests, and have been put under house arrest.Russian officials have rejected demands from the United States and the European Union to free Navalny and stop the crackdown on his supporters.Moscow also has rejected the European Court of Human Rights’ demand to release Navalny, describing it as unlawful and “inadmissible” meddling in Russia’s domestic affairs.Earlier this month, Navalny posted a note confirming that he arrived at a prison colony in Pokrov in the Vladimir region, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of Moscow, to serve his sentence. The facility stands out among Russian penitentiaries for its particularly strict regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalnys-allies-call-for-major-protest-across-russia-101616513988917.html

Asked about her position on stalled WTO talks on an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 drugs proposed by India and South Africa, she said she was not opposed to it.However, she said that it was important to also seek to boost manufacturing through other routes because the talks were "taking some time"."What I have proposed is a third way because people are dying," she said, adding that this included lowering export barriers and using existing capacity to increase output.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disappointed-wto-chief-okonjo-iweala-on-eu-vaccine-export-restrictions-101616514406621.html
23-03-2021||World||Myanmar's military junta defends crackdown amid intensifying protests||Myanmar's military junta on Tuesday took the offensive to try to justify last month's coup and subsequent actions against those opposed to it, even as street demonstrations continued against the takeover.At a news conference in the capital Naypyitaw, the military presented a video of a former political colleague of ousted national leader Aung San Suu Kyi claiming he had handed over large amounts of cash and gold to her personally, in what the military has characterised as corruption. Such allegations were previously denied by her lawyer.Many of the protests Tuesday were staged in a way that avoided confrontations with authorities, who have not hesitated to use lethal force to break up demonstrations. Some marches were held before dawn in Yangon, the country's biggest city, and elsewhere and went unmolested. Other protests adopted the tactic of having signboards or other inanimate objects lined up in the street to serve as proxies for human demonstrators.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has verified 261 protesters' deaths nationwide but says the actual total, including cases where verification has been difficult, is probably much higher. It said 2,682 people have also been arrested or charged since the coup, with 2,302 still detained or sought for arrest.In its news conference, the military presented displays of seized homemade weapons and videos of street battles to argue that the demonstrators are violent and that its efforts to stop them are justified. However, in the weeks since the February 1 coup, protesters only began using organised violence after more than 100 demonstrators had been shot dead by police and soldiers.The allegations against Suu Kyi made by former Yangon Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein were first mentioned by the military several weeks ago. Last week the military-controlled Myawaddy TV station aired a similar video with a construction magnate who also claimed to have made large payoffs to Suu Kyi. That video was replayed at Tuesday's news conference.No supporting evidence for the allegations has been offered, and they are generally dismissed as an effort by the military to frame Suu Kyi so she can be discredited and tried on a serious criminal charge. She is already being held on several more minor charges.A report in the state-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper on Tuesday said the junta has expressed fresh concern about civil servants, teachers and medical workers joining the Civil Disobedience Movement that is the vanguard group opposing last month's military takeover.The report referred to the opposition group as CDM, the initials by which it is popularly known. The group encourages employees of key enterprises, such as government offices, to stay away from work.In what was a relatively conciliatory tone compared with earlier threats, the junta at its Monday meeting was reported to have described failing to show up at work as “not a crime but a violation of the civil service disciplines.”It said that for first offences, civil servants would have to sign confessions, but further offences would be dealt with according to civil service rules.Previously, government employees have been detained for joining the CDM, and striking state railway workers have been kicked out of their government-supplied housing if they don't agree to go back to work.Myanmar labour unions on March 7 issued a joint call for an extended nationwide work stoppage, with the goal of a “full, extended shutdown of the Myanmar economy.”In a statement, they called for the strike to continue “until we receive our democracy back.”Tuesday's report of the junta's meeting also highlighted teachers' absences from work, saying some have joined the CDM, as have health workers.The junta repeated its claims that civil servants, teachers and doctors joined the CDM under threat.“They should make a complaint to the respective authorities about the matter,” said the newspaper's account of the junta meeting. “Some teachers and doctors are still absent from work as they are worried that they may face punishment if they return to the unit," junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing was cited saying.Although the CDM does not advocate violence, the movement has painted those who don't give it support as collaborators with the junta with blood on their hands, who may be ostracised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-military-junta-defends-crackdown-amid-intensifying-protests-101616513260771.html

He said the investigation is in the early stages but that detectives believe the suspect was the only shooter, Dougherty said.A law enforcement official briefed on the shooting told The Associated Press that the gunman used an AR-15 rifle, a lightweight semi-automatic rifle.

Why US needs stricter gun laws?||Multiple mass shootings across the United States within a week, particularly the Monday incident in a Colorado supermarket which claimed 10 lives, have resulted in a renewed call for stricter gun laws. In 2021, there have been at least six mass shooting incidents with four or more killed, including spa shootings in Georgia which killed six Asian American women. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren took to Twitter to call on Democrats to get rid of the filibuster and pass gun safety legislation, adding that a huge majority of Americans support it.“Week after week, month after month, year after year – the gun violence doesn't end. And things won't get better until Democrats get rid of the filibuster and finally pass gun safety legislation that a huge majority of Americans support. What are we waiting for – another tragedy?” she tweeted.Week after week, month after month, year after year – the gun violence doesn't end. And things won't get better until Democrats get rid of the filibuster and finally pass gun safety legislation that a huge majority of Americans support. What are we waiting for – another tragedy?US House of Representatives, led by Democrats, recently passed two bills aimed at strengthening federal gun laws while the majority of Republicans opposed the legislation. The first bill, passed with 227-203 votes, would provide for background checks on all firearms sales and transfers, including those purchased over the internet, at gun shows and through certain private transactions.'Charleston loophole'The second bill, passed in the House with only two Republicans supporting it, would close the so-called “Charleston loophole”. Apart from the age limit, certain individuals, including those with felony convictions and prison sentence exceeding one year or guilty of unlawfully possessing controlled substances within the past year, are prohibited from purchasing firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968.In the vast majority of cases, the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS) returns a definitive result when an individual submits to a background check for purchasing a gun. However, in some cases, the system fails to make an immediate determination on the eligibility of the prospective buyer.Under the current law, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) gets only three business days to probe the submission and if the agency doesn’t conclude the investigation in the stipulated time period, the gun seller gets the discretion of proceeding with the firearms sale. In 2015, a shooter with a criminal history misused this loophole of “default proceed” sales to purchase firearms and went on to commit a hate crime at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine worshippers at the historic African American church.Democrats are hoping to close this loophole through the second bill by giving authorities 10 business days for federal background checks before a gun sale can be licensed. Although Democrats control the 100-members Senate with 50 seats plus a tie-breaker vote of vice president Kamala Harris, the bill, like most legislation, would need 60 votes to end the debate to go for a full vote on the Senate floor. This procedure allows senators to filibuster and debate the bill endlessly to stall the vote.In order to eliminate the filibuster, all 50 Democratic senators have to be on board with the plan but at least two Democrats - Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have opposed the idea of ending the procedure. With sweeping voting rights, strongly backed by Biden, also facing the roadblock of the filibuster, the US Senate is rapidly moving towards a showdown over the procedural manoeuver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-are-we-waiting-for-colorado-shooting-triggers-call-for-stricter-gun-laws-101616511355037.html

23-03-2021||World||More than 2,300 children killed in Yemen war between 2018-2020: Aid agency||Children accounted for a quarter of civilian casualties over the last three years in Yemen's grinding war between Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the internationally recognised government, a child relief agency said Tuesday.More than 2,300 children were killed between 2018 and 2020, Save the Children said in a new study. However, the group said the actual toll is likely to be much higher.“Yemeni children have been living through a horrific and endless nightmare for six years now. Children continue to be killed and injured on a near-daily basis," said the organization's country director, Xavier Joubert.Save the Children's report comes on the heels of a UNICEF statement issued Saturday, saying that eight children were killed and 33 wounded this month alone.Philippe Duamelle, UNICEF's representative to Yemen, said the casualties happened in several areas including the provinces of Taiz and Hodeida, where fighting between forces of the internationally recognized government and Houthi rebels has recently intensified.On Monday, Saudi Arabia offered their Houthi rivals a cease-fire plan that includes the reopening of the international airport in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, which has been under siege for almost six years. The Houthis downplayed the offer, claiming it did not offer anything new.“All parties to the conflict must fully implement a cease-fire as soon as possible," said Joubert. "The cease-fire should be used to work towards a sustainable peace and a political solution to this war — it's the only way to truly end this humanitarian catastrophe.”Like other relief agencies, the London-based Save the Children deplored plummeting funding levels for relief efforts in the war-stricken country. The group said its funds for aid to children in Yemen has dropped by more than 40% compared to last year.“If the U.N.'s predictions are correct, the worst famine in decades could kill hundreds of thousands of children. We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening,” said President and CEO Janti Soeripto.Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 when the Houthis took control of the capital Sanaa and much of the country's north, forcing the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition, backed at the time by the U.S., entered the war months later to try to restore Hadi to power.Now mired in stalemate, the war has killed about 130,000 people — including more than 12,000 civilians — and spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis in a country that was already the Arab world's most impoverished nation.The Biden administration has been keen to stop the war in Yemen. Earlier this month, the U.S. envoy for Yemen, Tim Lenderking, urged the Houthis to accept his cease-fire proposal. However, the rebels are still pushing aggressively to take the government stronghold of Marib, in central Yemen.Also Tuesday, Human Rights Watch accused the Houthis of firing indiscriminate artillery and missiles into heavily populated areas as they push to take Marib. The New York-based group called on the rebels to halt their attacks and allow unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians trapped by the fighting.Afrah Nasser, the group's Yemen researcher, said the Houthis have “shown a shocking disregard for the well-being and safety of civilians.” A spokesman for the Houthis was not immediately available for comment.Last week, a Houthi missile reportedly hit a fuel station at a Marib market, killing at least two civilians and wounding seven.“It was tragic seeing blood and flesh of bodies spread on the ground and the damaged cars ... The explosion was huge, and we felt it across all Marib city,” HRW quoted an unnamed witness as saying.The group said Houthi artillery and heavy weapons have hit several camps for displaced people last month in the city. Already, four displacement camps have been abandoned since the start of the offensive, the U.N. migration agency said.Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yehia Sarie, meanwhile, said they targeted Saudi Arabia's southwestern Abha airport with a bomb-laden drone.There was no immediate comment from the Saudi-led coalition on the attack, which came a day after Saudi Arabia announced a cease-fire initiative in Yemen.Sarie also claimed they shot down a U.S. MQ-9 drone over Marib. He did not say which country operated the drone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-2-300-children-killed-in-yemen-war-between-2018-2020-aid-agency-101616510412340.html
23-03-2021||World||'Busy on other fronts': White House without Trump stays quiet on OPEC||When oil prices surged during Donald Trump's term in the White House, OPEC and its allies had to brace for a Twitter storm demanding action to bring prices down.That has all changed under US President Joe Biden. His team barely uttered a word this month when crude soared to more than $70 a barrel, an almost 40% rise from the start of 2021."Biden's people are busy on other fronts, like fighting the pandemic," said one OPEC source.It is not just that Twitter is no longer the preferred means to communicate US demands. OPEC sources say no-one from the Biden administration has even reached out informally to OPEC to complain about the latest oil price rise, which was fuelled by a decision in March by OPEC, Russia and others to stick broadly to existing production restrictions rather than to open the taps.When the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet again on April 1, traders and market sources say the group known as OPEC+ can pursue policies to prop up prices in the knowledge the White House won't be breathing down its neck."Right now is the ideal point in time," said an oil trade source and veteran OPEC watcher. "One doesn't need to worry about backlash from Washington, as Trump is gone."After a demand slump sent oil prices crashing in 2020, crude has rebounded. Brent hit $71.38, on March 8, after the OPEC+ decision on March 4 to keep most of their production curbs in place.Yet, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki made no direct comment about the OPEC decision when asked about it on March 4 and instead said the United States was focused on helping Americans via the U.S. economic stimulus package.Oil prices have now eased from their highs but are still up almost 20% this year, trading at $62 on Wednesday.A spokesperson for the National Security Council (NSC) at the White House said there had been no U.S.-OPEC contact on oil policy or prices since Biden took office on Jan. 20, although that did not mean the oil market was off the radar."The Biden Administration continues to monitor oil market developments carefully as economies reopen and oil demand recovers to ensure economic stability as a short-term imperative," the spokesperson said.'FAR LESS VOCAL'For now, OPEC+ delegates expect there will be no output increase or only a modest one agreed on April 1.Asked if Washington wanted OPEC+ to agree to pump more oil, the NSC spokesperson said the government was "committed to supporting policies that ensure the American people have reliable access to sustainable and affordable energy resources."The contrast with Trump's approach could not be more stark. The former US president often took to Twitter to address the group directly and to demand publicly that it change policy."REDUCE PRICING NOW!" Trump tweeted in July 2018, addressing a group he called the "OPEC Monopoly" in a month when crude hit $80.In April 2020, when prices crashed, hammering U.S. oil producers as well as others, Trump engaged in talks that included Saudi Arabia and Russia, leading to a deal in which OPEC+ agreed a record supply cut. Most curbs remain in place."The Biden administration has been far less vocal and I don't see them interacting much with OPEC+ in the near term either," said Samuel Ciszuk, who founded consultancy ELS Analysis and previously worked for the Swedish Energy Agency.Since taking office, Biden has kept his distance from Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two leading producers in OPEC+.His administration imposed sanctions on some Saudis over the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the U.S. president has said he thought his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was a killer, sending diplomatic ties to a new post-Cold War low."Firstly, on a political level both Russia and Saudi Arabia have been pointedly shunned by Biden himself in his first months, in order for him to send a message," Ciszuk said."And from a market and economics perspective, I think the Biden administration has also had to focus elsewhere."The NSC spokesperson said Biden's team was not seeking to play a less active role than Trump's administration in trying to influence OPEC policy but the emphasis was on clean energy."The United States will utilise its strong relationships with other major oil producing economies to meaningfully advance the clean-energy transition and jointly pursue a path towards our climate goals," the spokesperson said.That goal was to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/busy-on-other-fronts-white-house-without-trump-stays-quiet-on-opec-101616507179550.html

So, while you attacked them, they might come to us. We controlled areas along the border because we have our national security concerns. But if your army can control the trenches, we will leave the next day."He said the Ethiopian government had also raised accusations of widespread looting and rights abuses by Eritrean soldiers."The Eritrean government has highly condemned it and said they will be accountable if any of their army participated in this."Fighting erupting in Tigray after forces loyal to the regional government - the Tigray People's Liberation Front - attacked army bases across the region overnight and in the early hours of Novem 4.The attacks initially overwhelmed the federal military, which later launched a counter offensive alongside Eritrean soldiers and forces from the neighbouring region of Amhara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopian-pm-confirms-eritrean-troops-entered-tigray-during-recent-conflict-101616504090862.html
23-03-2021||World||Polish writer facing prison for calling president 'moron'||A Polish writer is being facing up to three years of imprisonment for calling the nation's president a “moron” on social media.Jakub Zulczyk had criticized the manner in which Polish President Andrzej Duda — a close ally of former President Donald Trump — had reacted to the electoral victory of President Joe Biden last year.Zulczyk wrote on Facebook on Monday that a district prosecutor in Warsaw had filed an indictment against him based on an article in the penal code that makes it a crime to insult the head of state.Zulczyk said he believed that he is probably "the first writer in this country in a long time to be tried for what they wrote.”People have also been charged in the past for insulting previous Polish presidents in the post-communist era under the country's broad insult laws. Fines or fines or community service — and not years in prison — are seen as the most likely punishment.However, the case also comes amid what many see as an erosion of democratic standards in Poland since a right-wing populist party, Law and Justice, won power in 2015. Government critics accuse the authorities of aggressively harnessing prosecutorial powers to promote those in power.The comment in question concerns a critical response by Zulczyk to a congratulatory tweet by Duda after U.S. media called the election for Biden on Nov. 7.Duda offered his congratulations to Biden “for a successful presidential campaign. As we await the nomination by the Electoral College, Poland is determined to upkeep high-level and high-quality PL-US strategic partnership for an even stronger alliance.”At the time of Duda's tweet, many other European leaders were offering full-fledged congratulations to Biden. At home, Duda was criticized by many for suggesting that Biden's victory was somehow not definitive and that the Electoral College could still somehow change the result.That same day, Zulczyk wrote on Facebook that as someone with a master's degree in American studies, he had never heard of a “nomination by the Electoral College” in the U.S. system. He said the Democratic candidate had clearly won the election.“Joe Biden is the 46th president of the United States. Andrzej Duda is a moron," he wrote.Prosecutors made their indictment based on the complaint of a private individual, and it was unclear if Duda had been informed about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polish-writer-facing-prison-for-calling-president-moron-101616499502501.html

The company will “immediately engage” with the independent panel monitoring the trial to share its analysis with the latest efficacy data.In a brief statement last night, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the monitoring board charged with ensuring the safety and accuracy of the vaccine trial had expressed concern that results included outdated information.The institute, headed by Anthony Fauci, urged AstraZeneca to work with the data and safety monitoring board to “ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible.”The disclosure marks the latest hitch for AstraZeneca, which said on Monday that the vaccine was found to be 79% effective in preventing Covid-19 in a U.S. clinical trial of more than 30,000 volunteers. The shot, developed with the University of Oxford and viewed as a frontrunner to help curb the pandemic, has been beset by complications.It’s now at the center of a supply showdown with the European Union, just days after concerns about blood clots prompted a dozen countries to suspend immunizations.More Concerns“The last thing this vaccine needs is more concern when we kind of thought we were at that point now where we’d put to bed all the other concerns,” said Paul Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, who is conducting clinical studies in Australia on four Covid-19 vaccine candidates.After the vaccine was cleared for use in the UK and many other nations, AstraZeneca is preparing to seek approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. That greenlight may now be delayed.The shares traded 1.1% lower Tuesday in London.The efficacy rate in the US trial was stronger than the 70% figure AstraZeneca reported from an earlier study. But those data were an average of different readings -- 62% and 90% -- from two arms of the trial. Because of a manufacturing error, one group of participants had received a lower first dose, which produced the higher reading, compared with those getting two standard doses. Further analysis suggested it was the greater dosing gap rather than amount that had created the difference.Something ‘Significant’The Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent panel, also brought its concerns about the US trial results to the British drugmaker and to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a U.S. agency that partially funded the shot’s development.“It was referring to outdated information, and it’s kind of hard to imagine how outdated information could be included when these vaccines are all fairly new,” said Griffin, an infectious-disease physician and microbiologist. “The impression I got was that it seemed to be something very significant they were alluding to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-to-share-more-data-on-covid-vaccine-after-us-calls-results-outdated-101616501629658.html

Eleven members voted against the resolution.India was among 14 countries which abstained from voting.Sri Lanka described the draft resolution as "unwarranted, unjustified and in violations of the relevant articles of the United Nations’ Charter…"India urged that the government of Sri Lanka to carry forward some process of reconciliation, address the aspirations of Tamil community and continue to engage constructively with the international community to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected.Sri Lanka was earlier defeated at three consecutive resolutions at the UN rights body when Gotabaya’s elder brother and incumbent Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was the country's president between 2012 and 2014.The government of Gotabaya Rajapaksa had officially withdrawn from co-sponsoring the previous resolution undertaken by the previous government. It had called for an international investigation into alleged war crimes committed by both the government troops and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the final phase of the near-three-decade-long civil war that ended in May 2009.Sri Lanka was assured of support from China, Russia and several Muslim countries, including Pakistan.Ahead of the voting on the resolution, President Gotabaya and Prime Minister Mahinda made phone calls to world Muslim leaders.The resolution calls upon "the (Sri Lankan) government to ensure prompt thorough and impartial investigation, if warranted, prosecution of all alleged crimes relating to human rights violations and serious violations of international human rights law".The resolution has been tabled by Core Group on Sri Lanka consisting of the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Malawi, Montenegro, and North Macedonia at the 46th Session of the (UNHRC) in Geneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-abstains-as-unhrc-adopts-resolution-against-sri-lanka-s-rights-record-101616500973957.html

23-03-2021||World||Evanston, Illinois, becomes first US city to pay reparations to Black residents||Evanston, Illinois, on Monday became the first U.S. city to make reparations available to its Black residents for past discrimination and the lingering effects of slavery.The Chicago suburb’s City Council voted 8-1 to distribute $400,000 to eligible Black households. Each qualifying household would receive $25,000 for home repairs or down payments on the property.The program is being funded through donations and revenue from a 3% tax on the sale of recreational marijuana. The city has pledged to distribute $10 million over 10 years.Qualifying residents must either have lived in or been a direct descendant of a Black person who lived in Evanston between 1919 to 1969 and who suffered discrimination in housing because of city ordinances, policies or practices.Alderman Rue Simmons, who proposed the program that was adopted in 2019, said pro-reparations groups have offered pro-bono legal assistance if the program is challenged in court.“This is set aside for an injured community that happens to be Black, that was injured by the city of Evanston for anti-Black housing policies,” Simmons said.The City Council acted after dozens of citizens addressed the body and the plan received some pushback from several.Alderman Cicely Fleming, the lone vote against the plan, said she supports reparations, but what the City Council was debating is a housing plan that is being called reparations. She said the people should dictate the terms of how their grievances are repaired. Fleming described the program as paternalistic, and it assumes Black people can’t manage their own money.Hundreds of communities and organizations across the country are considering providing reparations to Black people. They range from the state of California to cities like Amherst, Massachusetts, Providence, Rhode Island, Asheville, North Carolina, and Iowa City, Iowa; religious denominations like the Episcopal Church; and prominent colleges like Georgetown University in Washington.The efforts, some of which have been underway for years, have gained momentum in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody last May in Minneapolis. President Joe Biden has even expressed support for creating a federal commission to study Black reparations, a proposal that’s languished for decades in Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evanston-illinois-becomes-first-us-city-to-pay-reparations-to-black-residents-101616500736338.html
23-03-2021||World||US health body questions AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine trial data||AstraZeneca may have released outdated information on its latest Covid-19 vaccine trial, giving an "incomplete" picture of its efficacy, a leading US health agency said on Tuesday, casting doubt on the shot's potential US rollout and plunging its developers, once again, into controversy.The surprise public rebuke from federal health officials comes just one day after interim data from the drugmaker showed better-than-expected results from the U.S. trial. That had been seen as a scientific counter to concerns that have dogged the shot over its effectiveness and possible side effects.The vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in the large trial that also took place in Chile and Peru, according to the data. It was also 100% effective against severe or critical forms of the disease and hospitalisation, and posed no increased risk of blood clots.The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent committee overseeing the trial, has "expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data," the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said in a statement https://bit.ly/3scE3ji released after midnight in the United States."We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible," it said, adding that the DSMB had informed AstraZeneca of its concerns.AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Its shares were down 1.2% in midmorning trade.The statement raises fresh questions about the vaccine's efficacy as it is being administered in dozens of countries worldwide and clouds the timeline for its emergency use authorization in the United States."This is indeed an extraordinary act. The negative reports about this vaccine do not stop, although my assessment is that it is well tolerated and safe, but clearly less effective than the two mRNA vaccines," Peter Kremsner, from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.Rival vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that use so-called mRNA technology produced efficacy rates of around 95% each, far above the 50% benchmark set by global regulators.The DSMB is organised by NIAID, and its role is to provide study oversight and evaluate clinical data to ensure safe and ethical conduct of the study. NIAID is headed by U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and is part of the National Institutes of Health."DSMB externalisations of concerns are deeply unusual for multinational pharma companies and suggest an extraordinary high level of friction between the DSMB and the sponsor," Citi analysts said in a note.DOUBTS RAISEDHailed as a milestone in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic when it first emerged as a vaccine contender, the AstraZeneca shot has faced questions since late last year when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data with different efficacy readings due to a measurement error.Later analysis suggested the dosing interval rather than the amount of dose administered was responsible for the difference.Confidence in the vaccine took a further hit this month when more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended the shot after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.The European Union's drug regulator said last week it was safe but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained sceptical about its safety.Fauci, who also serves as chief medical advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden, said on Monday the U.S. trial found no indication at all of the rare blood clots and the statement from the NIAID didn't raise questions about the trial's findings regarding blood clotting.The latest data, which has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers, was based on 141 infections among 32,449 participants.Analysts had noted AstraZeneca's achievement of producing strong trial data against a backdrop of more infectious variants spreading in the United States and other countries.Stephen Evans, a pharmacoepidemiology professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the up-to-date data request may have to do with efficacy readings from recent infections which may include new variants and thus lower protection rates."The other vaccines may also show such reduced efficacy and we don’t know by how much. It does not leave me concerned particularly unless they had found a safety issue that was being hidden, which does not appear to be the case."The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of Covid-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.It has been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorization in more than 70 countries. Many countries are relying heavily on it to end the pandemic, and several state leaders have taken the shot to boost confidence in the vaccine including South Korea's President Moon Jae-in who received it on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-body-questions-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-data-101616500153626.html
23-03-2021||World||US urges court to certify India's request to extradite 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana||The Biden administration has urged a federal court in Los Angeles to certify India's request to extradite fugitive Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, saying he meets all the criteria required for the handover.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian has scheduled the extradition hearing for April 22.Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian, in his submission before a federal US court in Los Angeles, California, said Rana, 59, meets all the criteria to be extradited to India for his trial in the Mumbai terrorist attack. On February 4, Rana's attorney had opposed his extradition."The United States respectfully requests that following the April 22, 2021, extradition hearing, the Court certify India's request for Rana's extradition for the Secretary of State's surrender decision," Lulejian said in his 61-page court submission on Monday.Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India."Fugitive Tahawwur Hussain Rana is wanted in India to stand trial for offences related to his role in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, that resulted in the death of 166 people, the injury of 239 people, and the damage to property in excess of USD 1.5 billion," Lulejian said.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated the extradition proceeding.Lulejian said the criteria warranting certification of extradition are satisfied in this case.These criteria are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.India's extradition request contains evidence to establish probable cause that the individual appearing in court is the fugitive who committed the offence for which extradition is requested, Lulejian argued.In his court submission on February 4, Rana's attorney had argued that Rana's extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences.Lulejian said that the court should find that Rana's extradition is not barred under Article 6 of the India-US Extradition Treaty.Although there is ample evidence that Rana aided and abetted the Mumbai attack, he claims that he should not be extradited because probable cause is lacking. Rana's claim is based on an improper attempt to attack the credibility of a key witness against him, Lulejian said.Rana also does not contest that he is the person who India alleges committed the charged crimes. Instead, he challenges only whether Article 6 of the treaty bars his extradition and whether probable cause exists to believe that he committed the offences for which India requests his extradition, the Assistant US Attorney said.Lulejian said Headley's plea agreement is irrelevant because Rana cannot benefit from its terms. Not only is Rana in a different position than Headley because he did not plead guilty or cooperate with the United States, as is his right, but his inability to benefit from the negotiated terms of Headley's plea agreement is confirmed by the text of the plea agreement itself.He said Rana's extradition proceedings are separate from Headley's criminal proceedings and are being litigated by a different United States attorney's office from the one who negotiated the plea agreement with Headley.According to its very terms, Rana has no rights under Headley's plea agreement and is therefore prohibited from relying on it in an attempt to undermine the United States' position on his extraditability under the treaty, he added."Rana has failed to demonstrate that he cannot be extradited to India as a result of his prior prosecution in the United States," the attorney said.Rana attempts to undermine India's evidence of probable cause by questioning the credibility of the key witness, David Headley. Not only is Rana's challenge improper in this extradition proceeding, but his claims are also not supported by the law or the evidence, Lulejian said.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-urges-us-court-to-certify-india-s-request-to-extradite-tahawwur-rana-101616499547825.html
23-03-2021||World||Iran: Road accident kills at least 14, including 8 children||A road accident in southeastern Iran on Tuesday killed at least 14 people, including eight children, an Iranian semi-official news agency reported.There were no details as to what caused the accident. The crash involved three cars, the report said, and also left 11 people injured.The accident comes as Iran is celebrating the Persian New Year, or Nowruz, which began on Saturday. Many Iranians are traveling during the holidays — despite warnings by health officials over the pandemic. Iran has struggled with the region's worst outbreak of the coronavirus, with over 1.8 million registered cases and 61,951 deaths.The ISNA news agency quoted Mojtaba Khaledi, spokesman of the country’s emergency department, as saying the accident took place around noon near the city of Zahedan in Sistan and Baluchistan province.The fatalities among the children were two girls and six boys, aged between 3 years and 8 years. Two men and four women also died in the accident, he added. The casualties were taken to a hospital in Zahedan.Iranian police said road traffic increased 52% during this Nowruz holiday, compared to the same period last year. So far, since the holiday-related traveling started last Friday, more than 120 people have died in road accidents.With some 17,000 annual deaths, Iran has one of the world’s worst traffic safety records. The grave toll is blamed on wide disregard for traffic laws, unsafe vehicles and inadequate emergency services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-road-accident-kills-at-least-14-including-8-children-101616498601382.html

Another one in the United States is listed as a back-up supplier. Currently, only the plant in Belgium, run by Thermo Fisher Scientific, is producing shots for the EU.The Commission has also started a procedure foreseen under the contract with AstraZeneca that could lead to legal action against the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-use-all-tools-available-over-astrazeneca-shortfalls-eu-vaccine-chief-101616498132793.html
23-03-2021||World||'Disgraceful' sex acts in parliament rock Australia's government||Leaked videos of staff from Australia's conservative government performing sex acts in parliament, including one man masturbating over a female MP's desk, left Scott Morrison's administration facing yet another major scandal Tuesday.The prime minister -- already under pressure for his handling of sexual assault allegations including that a female government adviser was raped by a colleague -- called the behaviour "disgraceful" and "absolutely shameful".The videos and photos, which had allegedly been shared in a group chat of coalition government staff before being leaked by a whistleblower, were first revealed by The Australian newspaper and Channel 10 late Monday.The graphic images have prompted fresh outrage from female lawmakers and the Australian public, coming on the heels of the rape allegations that sparked mass nationwide protests.The whistleblower, identified only as Tom, told the news outlets that government staffers and MPs often used a Parliament House prayer room to have sex, and alleged that sex workers had been brought into the building "for the pleasure of coalition MPs".He also said a group of staffers routinely swapped explicit photos of themselves and he received so many he had "become immune to it".He said there was a "culture of men thinking that they can do whatever they want" and while he did not think the staffers had broken any laws, "morally, they are bankrupt".One aide was immediately fired and the government has promised further action.Minister for Women Marise Payne said the revelations were "beyond disappointing" and highlighted the need for a government-ordered inquiry into parliament's workplace culture.Cabinet minister Karen Andrews said she had had an "absolute gutful" of sexism in politics and her "conscience will no longer allow me to remain quiet".She told reporters in Canberra that the ruling Liberal Party should consider gender quotas for its political representatives.The fresh sexism revelations on Tuesday prompted Indigenous Senator Lidia Thorpe to disclose alleged sexual harassment by four male politicians since she took office just six months ago.Thorpe, a representative for the Greens party, told the Canberra Times the "brazen" harassment had included "suggestive" remarks and unwanted touching."These are men that write our laws - men that should know better," she tweeted. "What they've done is violating behaviour. It's physical. It's sexualising, objectifying behaviour - it makes me feel physically sick."Australia's parliament has been repeatedly criticised for a "toxic" workplace culture that has allegedly spawned persistent bullying, harassment and sexual assault of women -- particularly in the ruling coalition.Former government staffer Brittany Higgins alleged publicly last month that she had been raped by a colleague in a minister's parliamentary office in 2019.And earlier this month, Attorney-General Christian Porter vigorously denied swirling accusations he had raped a 16-year-old girl in 1988 when they were both students.The controversies have placed growing pressure on the prime minister, who critics say has fumbled the government's response.Morrison grew emotional at a press conference in Canberra on Tuesday when talking about the importance of his wife, mother and daughters, also saying women had endured a "very traumatic" month."These events have triggered, right across this building and indeed right across the country, women who have put up with this rubbish and this crap for their entire lives, as their mothers did, as their grandmothers did," he said.Tens of thousands of women this month joined "#March4Justice" rallies to protest sexual violence and gender inequality, calling for systemic change in politics and wider Australian society.The opposition Labor party, which already has gender quotas in place, has not been immune from similar allegations. A Facebook group of female workers recently detailed alleged sexual harassment by male colleagues and politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disgraceful-sex-acts-in-parliament-rock-australia-s-government-101616497398470.html

Here's the list||The shooting at a Colorado supermarket on Monday, which claimed 10 lives, including that of a police officer, was among at least seven mass shootings in the last seven days across the United States. The rise in the incidents of gun violence has renewed the discussion around gun control, a contentious issue in the United States as Democrats and Republicans hold a contrasting view on the matter. Former US president Donald Trump was against stricter gun laws but Joe Biden, who ran a successful presidential campaign, had promised to completely ban assault weapons after taking the office.In the US, nearly 40,000 people were killed in 2019 in incidents involving firearms, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which means 12 deaths per 100,000 people. In 2021, there have been at least six mass shooting incidents so far with four or more killed, including Monday’s shooting in the Boulder area of Colorado and spa shootings in Georgia which killed six Asian American women. However, the US federal government has no centralised system to track firearm incidents and mass shootings around the country.Take a look at the seven mass shooting incidents within as many days:Atlanta, Georgia, March 16: A white gunman, Robert Aaron Long, went on a shooting rampage last Tuesday at three Atlanta-area massage parlours that sent terror through the Asian American community. The 21-year-old suspect was charged with killing eight people in the worst mass shooting in the United States in almost two years.Stockton, California, March 17: A group of people gathered and preparing for a vigil in Stockton were targeted in a drive-by shooting. According to the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office, a total of five people were shot but all were “uncooperative with the deputies on the scene.” They were treated and released from the hospital as none had life-threatening injuries.Gresham, Oregon, March 18: Four victims were taken to the hospital following a shooting in the city east of Portland. The Gresham police department said in its initial report that lots of police resources were trying to gather information on what exactly happened.Houston, Texas, March 20: Five people were shot after a “disturbance” inside a club, said the Houston police department on Twitter.Dallas, Texas, March 20: A total of eight people were injured in a mass shooting at the Pryme Night Club, one of the victims, a 21-year old Latin female, died from her injuries. According to the Dallas police department, the suspect was involved in a verbal argument with another patron in the club after which he produced a firearm and began shooting inside the club.Philadelphia, March 20: According to police officials, gunfire erupted inside and outside a rental hall adjacent to Hot Pot Cuisine in north Philadelphia's Nicetown neighbourhood. The shooting at an illegal large gathering in Philadelphia killed one person and wounded five others.Boulder, Colorado, March 22: The shooting at a Colorado supermarket killed 10 people and a suspect was taken into custody, authorities said. Police said that they were investigating the incident and didn’t have the details on the motive of the shooting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-supermarket-incident-among-7-mass-shootings-in-us-in-as-many-days-101616495469239.html

23-03-2021||World||'Global political turbulence': Russia, China call for UNSC summit||Russia and China said on Tuesday they wanted a summit of permanent members of the U.N. Security Council amid what they called heightened political turbulence, with Moscow saying they both believed the United States was acting in a destructive way.The two allies, whose relations with the West are under increasing strain, made the call for a summit in a joint statement after talks between their foreign ministers in the city of Guilin."At a time of increasing global political turbulence, a summit of the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council is particularly necessary to establish direct dialogue about ways to resolve humankind's common problems in the interests of maintaining global stability," they said in a statement published on the Russian foreign ministry's website.Moscow has long been pushing for such a summit.The statement did not mention the United States by name. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that Moscow and Beijing were both unhappy with U.S. behaviour."We noted the destructive nature of U.S. intentions, relying on the military-political alliances of the Cold War era and creating new closed alliances in the same spirit, to undermine the U.N.-centered international legal architecture," said Lavrov."We emphasised that against the background of active attempts by the West to promote its concept of a 'rules-based world order', the joint efforts of Russia and China...to preserve the modern system of international law are becoming more and more relevant."Both countries' ties with Washington are strained.U.S. and Chinese officials on Friday concluded what Washington called "tough and direct" talks in Alaska, while Russia's ambassador is back in Moscow for talks after U.S. President Joe Biden said he believed President Vladimir Putin was a killer.Kicking off his two-day trip to China on Monday, Lavrov issued a call for Moscow and Beijing to reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar.Tuesday's joint statement urged other countries to refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of Russia and China.Lavrov said Russia and China regarded European and Western sanctions as unacceptable.On Monday, the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on a handful of Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Russia too is braced for a new round of U.S. sanctions over what Washington says was its meddling in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, which Moscow denies.Lavrov also took a swipe at the European Union, accusing Brussels of destroying Russia-EU ties. He said that Moscow only had relations with individual EU nations now."On the Western front there are no changes, but in the East there is an intensive agenda which grows richer every year," he said.(Reporting by Andrew Osborn, Maxim Rodionov and Alexander Marrow in Moscow and by Stella Qiu and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-political-turbulence-russia-china-call-for-unsc-summit-101616494875063.html

Paris and other regions have been under a new lockdown since Saturday, although the government is encouraging open-air activities and more businesses are open than during previous confinements.Macron said the priority was to immunize most vulnerable people and seniors “to relieve pressure on the hospital system,” according to a pool report. So far, the vaccination was open only to people over 75, patients with preconditions or medical staff, but the number of people above 75 in intensive care has dropped, highlighting the need to expand eligibility to the vaccination campaign.Around 9% of French people have received at least one vaccine jab. The government aims to have immunized 10 million people by mid-April, 20 million in mid-May and 30 million mid-June -- less than half of the total population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-expand-covid-19-vaccination-to-people-above-70-says-macron-101616494505939.html

Authorities took samples from the pigs and river water for examination, and pigs on nearby farms would be tested, it said.The magazine reported Monday that dozens of pig carcasses had been discovered on the Inner Mongolia section of China’s second-longest river and some were rotting in the water, turning the spotlight back onto food and water safety. The authorities also found 17 dead sheep and one cow carcass and vowed to crackdown on the practice of discarding dead animals, it said.The latest discovery comes as China’s hog herd is recovering from the ravages of African swine fever. The disease broke out in the country in 2018 and destroyed almost half the hogs in the world’s largest pork producer. Concerns over food safety and rising costs of pork production have accelerated the closure of small pig farms in favor of larger, more efficient facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-collects-48-dead-pigs-discarded-along-the-yellow-river-101616485515074.html

23-03-2021||World||Extremist groups thrive on Facebook despite bans: Report||A new outside report found that Facebook has allowed groups — many tied to QAnon, boogaloo and militia movements — to glorify violence during the 2020 election and in the weeks leading up to the deadly riots on the U.S. Capitol in January.Avaaz, a nonprofit advocacy group that says it seeks to protect democracies from misinformation, identified 267 pages and groups on Facebook that it says spread violence-glorifying material in the heat of the 2020 election to a combined following of 32 million users.More than two-thirds of the groups and pages had names that aligned with several domestic extremist movements, the report found. The first, boogaloo, promotes a second U.S. civil war and the breakdown of modern society. The second is the QAnon conspiracy, which claims that Donald Trump is waging a secret battle against the “deep state” and a sect of powerful Satan-worshipping pedophiles who dominate Hollywood, big business, the media and government. The rest are various anti-government militias. All have been largely banned from Facebook since 2020.But despite what Avaaz called “clear violations" of Facebook’s policies, it found that 119 of these pages and groups were still active on the platform as of March 18 and had just under 27 million followers.Facebook acknowledged that its policy enforcement “isn't perfect,” but said the report distorts its work against violent extremism and misinformation.The company said in a statement that it has done more than any other internet company to stanch the flow of harmful material, citing its bans of “nearly 900 militarized social movements” and the removal of tens of thousands of QAnon pages, groups, and accounts. It added that it is always improving its efforts against misinformation.On Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are slated to testify before Congress about extremism and misinformation on their platforms.Facebook has tightened its rules against violence, hate and misinformation in the past year. In October, it banned QAnon groups across its platform. Before that, it would remove them only if they expressly supported violence. It has also banned extremist and militia movements and boogaloo groups with varying degrees of success.For instance, while Facebook banned “Stop the Steal" groups from its platform, Avaaz — like The Associated Press — found that such groups and the #stopthesteal hashtag remained active on the platform after the purge.Facebook's failures, Avaaz said, “helped sweep America down the path from election to insurrection."According to the report, the social network provided a “fertile ground" for misinformation and toxicity that contributed to radicalizing millions of Americans, helping create the conditions in which the storming of the Capitol became a reality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremist-groups-thrive-on-facebook-despite-bans-report-101616494147323.html
23-03-2021||World||Saudis seek US help to thwart rising attacks on oil sites||Saudi Arabia is seeking more help from the US to defend its oil facilities, underscoring the kingdom’s concern about recent missile and drone strikes that it’s linked to arch-rival Iran.The requests were put to President Joe Biden’s administration since January, according to a Saudi official, who asked not to be named as the matter is private. Saudi Arabia is also asking other allies for support to thwart almost-daily attacks on cities and towns, the official said.On Sunday, the Saudi navy began drills in the Persian Gulf to enhance the security of “vital installations” and oil fields, and secure freedom of navigation in the region’s waters, the official Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, will take part, according to SPA.The military exercises follow three attacks on Aramco sites this month alone. On Friday, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran, said they were responsible for drones and missiles that targeted a 120,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. They also claimed strikes on the world’s biggest oil-export terminal of Ras Tanura and on a fuel depot in Jeddah.InterceptedSaudi officials said their air-defense systems and fighter jets intercepted the projectiles used in all the attacks, preventing them from causing substantial damage. Amin Nasser, Aramco’s chief executive officer, said the incidents haven’t impacted the company and that it will continue to supply petroleum to customers around the world “under any scenario.”Still, oil analysts have said the risk of a major crisis in the Gulf is rising.“We are one incident away from a major conflagration,” said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “If one of these drone or ballistic-missile attacks results in significant civilian casualties, it could potentially lead to a more direct confrontation between the Saudis and the Iranians.”A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting a grinding war against the Houthis since 2015 in an effort to restore Yemen’s United Nations-recognized government. The conflict’s created what the UN has called the world’s worst humanitarian disaster and pushed the Yemeni population to the brink of famine.Peace EffortsSince coming to power, Biden has rescinded a decision by his predecessor, Donald Trump, to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization, and stepped up efforts to secure a ceasefire. He’s also halted the sale of offensive weapons to the coalition, though his administration’s pledged to continue providing Saudi Arabia with equipment to defend its territory.Saudi Arabia has welcomed the prospect of peace talks, despite the increase in Houthi attacks that analysts and diplomats say are intended to increase the group’s leverage. The danger, they say, is that a successful strike on Saudi oil installations could force the kingdom into an escalation it doesn’t want.Coalition planes pounded Houthi bases over the weekend in retaliation for the refinery attack.The Saudi government on Monday proposed a series of steps to end the war in Yemen, though the Houthis appeared to reject the plan.Riyadh says the missiles and drones used to target its infrastructure are Iranian manufactured or supplied, a view shared by the UN. That’s led to claims that Iran is using the Houthis to pressure the U.S. as the two nations tussle over how to revive nuclear diplomacy and remove American sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Abqaiq AttacksThe most prominent attack claimed by the Houthis came in September 2019, when explosive-laden drones swarmed Aramco’s Abqaiq oil-processing plant and Khurais field. They temporarily knocked out about half of Saudi Arabia’s production capacity and caused crude prices to spike.Oil markets have taken comfort from the recent attacks not being anywhere near as damaging, according to Bob McNally, president of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. Moreover, unlike in 2019, there’s plenty of spare capacity around the world due to deep supply cuts that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia started last year.While Brent crude prices have risen 24% this year to around $64 a barrel, they have dropped this month, mostly due to concerns about a third coronavirus wave.Still, “the increase in the frequency of airborne attacks and the focus on energy infrastructure will mean some risk premium remains in oil prices,” said Bill Farren-Price, a director at research firm Enverus. “The situation demands a diplomatic push to reduce tensions.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-seek-us-help-to-thwart-rising-attacks-on-oil-sites-101616475595627.html

The Starship, which is being developed in Boca Chica in Texas, launched its first prototype in March 2020 when its prototype SN8 performed the first high-altitude test flight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/well-before-2030-musk-on-spacex-landing-starship-rockets-on-mars-101616493822959.html
23-03-2021||World||Yellen, Powell to face deficit, inflation fears at US Congress||Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will enter a heatedly partisan arena on Tuesday to kick off two days of congressional hearings assessing the economic policy response to the Covid-19 crisis.Less than two weeks after President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill that failed to win a single Republican vote in Congress, the hearings will feature lawmakers positioning over the impact of the package and plans for the next one. Biden’s advisers are preparing a long-term program that could be as much as $3 trillion, though no decisions have been made, people familiar with the talks said Monday.Yellen is expected not only to highlight the improved economic outlook and dramatic expansion in help to households from the bill, but also telegraph the need for more spending -- partly paid for with higher taxes. The administration is now working on a longer-term support program for the economy, and Democrats may use the hearings to advocate inclusion for their preferred measures.GOP members will assail the Democrats for piling on debt for a far-left agenda at a time when an economic rebound was already under way -- risking a spike in inflation. Powell, meantime, will be looking to stay out of the political crossfire, while repeating his pledge to hold off on tightening monetary policy until deep into the recovery.“I suspect there will be lots of questions on the sustainability of deficits and the debt -- and ‘aren’t the deficits and debt big problems that will come back to haunt the United States?’” said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Group AG.Yellen’s already made her answer clear, repeatedly saying over the past two months that the U.S. can afford to borrow more with interest rates historically low. Expect her to point out that despite much higher debt, the cost to service those obligations is the same is it was in 2007.Powell’s take has been to set aside addressing debt sustainability for now. He said last month that “the time to prioritize those concerns is when we’re close to full employment, when the taxes are rolling in and we can do it without so much pain.”The duo testify before the House Financial Services Committee at noon Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. Wednesday. The appearances are required by the March 2020 Cares Act, which gave the Treasury and Fed hundreds of billions of dollars of firepower to fight the crisis.Questions from lawmakers could range widely. The following are some of the items to expect.Economy Bouncing BackYellen and Powell will repeat their assessments that the U.S. is bouncing back nicely from a devastating shock, thanks to fiscal and monetary policy support, but also flag that it has not fully recovered.“While we’re seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we’re digging out of: The country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak,” Yellen said in her opening remarks, which were released Monday evening.New Fed projections point to 6.5% GDP growth this year, with unemployment seen falling to 4.5% by year’s end. Still, more than 9 million Americans remain out of work and the Covid-19 virus has not yet been contained.Yellen also gave credit to lawmakers for passing the third massive stimulus bill in a year. “I am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact,” she said in the prepared remarks.Aid Disbursement UpdateYellen may be asked for fresh numbers on how much money has been delivered so far under Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Last week, the Treasury reported it had disbursed $242 billion of the $442 billion it expects to send to individuals under the law. Lawmakers will also be keen to hear when aid for state, local, territorial and tribal governments will be released.State Tax CutsYellen may also get pressed by Republicans over whether new relief will limit the ability of state governments to cut taxes. The law doesn’t explicitly bar states from cutting taxes but does prohibit them from using federal aid to offset tax cuts.Asked during a phone briefing Thursday how the Treasury will enforce the law if states shift money within their budgets, department officials said the agency is in the process of crafting rules that will explain how the restrictions work.Inflation Fear and MarketsBoth Yellen and Powell may be asked about inflation fears, with critics saying that ultra stimulative fiscal and monetary policy settings run the risk of a surge in consumer prices. The sharp selloff in longer-dated Treasuries this quarter has only amplified those concerns.Related: Treasuries Bull Market That Began in 1981 Has Finally EndedEach key policy maker has predicted that a jump in prices, especially compared with depressed levels a year ago, will prove temporary. Last week, Powell said he expected a “pop” in inflation measures beginning this month, but said it would be a “one-time sort of bulge in prices.”Interest RatesDemocrats will also be happy to hear Powell repeat the Fed’s commitment to ultra-easy monetary policy. Watch for the Fed chief to repeat that the central bank won’t act on forecasts of inflation, but only on hard data points showing that the economy is back to full employment and there’s sustained achievement of the 2% target for price gains.“The recovery is far from complete, so, at the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes,” Powell said in testimony prepared for delivery Tuesday.Build Back BetterThe Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers are moving forward on a long-term economic package that could total up to $3 trillion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, though they cautioned that no decision had been made. The program will feature a range of initiatives from infrastructure and combating climate change to increasing subsidies for child and elder care, strengthening workers’ rights and expanding Obamacare.Democratic lawmakers may ask for each policy makers’ thoughts on their favored measures for inclusion. Powell almost certainly will seek to avoid comment, as he did in hearings last month -- a contrast to his repeated calls last year for more fiscal support to fight the impact of the pandemic.“You’ve seen him pivot already,” said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. “Last year he was pleading with them” for more spending. “This year he’s saying, ‘I can’t say anything.’”Financial RegulationThe Biden administration has signaled interest in tightening scrutiny of big banks. Separate discussions are already underway at the Treasury about reforming the structure of the market for U.S. Treasuries in order to make it more resilient -- after the episode in March 2020 when trading nearly seized up amid an investor flight to cash, forcing the Fed to inject massive liquidity.“There’ll be a huge conversation about banks and bank regulation,” predicted Carpenter at UBS. “And lawmakers will ask, ‘Is there something broken in markets and why do you have to keep swooping in to save them?’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yellen-powell-to-face-deficit-inflation-fears-at-us-congress-101616463916190.html
23-03-2021||World||US climate envoy Kerry to take part in summit co-hosted by China||The Biden administration is set to participate in a climate summit co-hosted by China on Tuesday, just days after its first face-to-face talks with that country descended into bickering.John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate, is to participate in the Ministerial on Climate Action, according to two people familiar with the matter. Yet no separate virtual session is planned between Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, the people said.The virtual ministerial session, organized by the European Union, Canada and China, is intended to bring together representatives of more than 30 countries, including some of the world’s top emitters of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.In a joint statement earlier this month, the U.S. and European Union highlighted the ministerial meeting as one of several “key milestones for increasing momentum” and encouraging more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions-cutting goals before a United Nations climate summit in Glasgow this November.The U.S. also is holding its own virtual meeting with top-emitting countries on April 22.Despite a fraught U.S.-China relationship, Kerry has emphasized the U.S. can “find a way to compartmentalize” its global warming discussions with China, which is the world’s top emitter, responsible for almost 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns about other matters , such as protecting intellectual property, are “obviously significant issues,” Kerry said on March 2 at CERAWeek by IHS Markit, “but the climate crisis is not something that can fall victim to those other concerns and contests.”Kerry, a former secretary of State and U.S. senator, has been in touch with Xie since they were both appointed, and further conversations between the two are expected, according to one of the people familiar with the interactions.Tuesday’s meeting comes as the U.S. seeks to rebuild trust after the country’s departure from the Paris climate agreement under President Donald Trump. Since the U.S. formally rejoined the pact in February, Kerry has been meeting with climate negotiators globally to underscore the country’s commitment to the accord.Kerry, who helped broker the landmark agreement when he led the State Department under President Barack Obama, pressed climate concerns in meetings with top European Commission officials earlier this month. A renewed alliance between the U.S. and the E.U. on climate issues could shift the dynamics of crucial global talks, encouraging China and other major polluters to step up their efforts to reduce emissions, Kerry said at the time.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-climate-envoy-kerry-to-take-part-in-summit-co-hosted-by-china-101616470064563.html

23-03-2021||World||'Psychopathic leader': Brazil governor says Bolsonaro mishandled Covid-19 crisis||The governor of Brazil's Sao Paulo state on Monday, in an interview to the CNN news network, called the country's president Jair Bolsonaro a "psychopathic leader" who mishandled the Covid-19 crisis.Responding to a question on the healthcare system in the state, Joao Doria said that much of Brazil's pandemic death toll could have been prevented had Bolsonaro "acted with the responsibility that his position gives him."Brazil has recorded the second-most coronavirus deaths, after the United States, and the situation is worsening. Brazil's average daily death toll -- currently the highest worldwide -- has more than tripled since the start of the year, to 2,259. Brazilian media reports Bolsonaro is scrambling to find a way to deal with the surging Covid-19 cases, with the government sacking a health minister last week without naming a replacement in the official gazette.The latest wave of Covid-19, fueled by a local, more contagious variant of the coronavirus, is pushing many Brazilian hospitals to the breaking point, news agency AFP reports."We are in one of those tragic moments in history when millions of people pay a high price for having an unprepared and psychopathic leader in charge of a nation," said Joao Doria, the governor of Sao Paulo, where educational institutes and commercial establishments have remained shut since early this month. One of Bolsonaro's fiercest critics, Doria also criticised the messy situation over allotment of the country's health ministry amid an unprecedented health crisis. "We're in the middle of a pandemic... and we have two health ministers. Which in reality means we don't have any," Joao said. Sao Paulo's state government has said it had obtained guarantees from oxygen suppliers that they will be able to keep up supply for public hospitals, and announced that brewer AmBev will also produce the gas at one of its plants in the state.Hundreds of Brazilian business leaders and economists have already called for a new policy approach as the country grapples with spiking Covid-19 deaths and overwhelmed hospitals. Rio de Janeiro, where more than 90 per cent of intensive care beds are full, announced last week that only essential shops will be allowed to open and an overnight curfew would be imposed for ten days, while beaches will remain closed. Reuters reports that a letter, published in newspapers on Monday and signed by former central bank chiefs and some of Brazil's richest bankers, underscored a growing revolt by business leaders against the Brazillian president whom many had backed for his 2018 election. The message from such prominent economists and bankers cut at Bolsonaro's core political argument that he has defended jobs by opposing lockdowns, which the letter called a "false choice between saving lives and ensuring support for the vulnerable."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/psychopathic-leader-brazil-governor-says-bolsonaro-mishandled-covid-19-crisis-101616489059603.html
23-03-2021||World||Coal markets roiled as Australia’s flood crisis worsens||The deluge that’s inundating Australia’s eastern states is hampering shipments from the world’s biggest coal export terminal.Heavy rainfall and damaging winds are expected to continue on Tuesday, including in the key coal regions of the Hunter Valley and the Port of Newcastle. That is likely to see prices of the power-station fuel extend Monday’s climb to a two-year high, as coal in Europe also gained on the news.Overnight there were 870 rescue operations in New South Wales state, as dams overflowed and catchments flooded. A further 15,000 people may be evacuated today, after 18,000 people were forced to leave their homes on Monday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters earlier today.The one-in-100 year flooding event forced companies from Glencore Plc to Yancoal Australia Ltd. to cut production, while Whitehaven Coal Ltd. said there is a backlog of ships at the Port of Newcastle.“This type of temporary weather event does not typically have any lasting impact,” the Port of Newcastle said in a statement. “The port continues to operate and is monitoring conditions closely.”The rain is forecast to ease on Wednesday, but Berejiklian warned “the rivers will keep rising.”“Shutdowns and disruptions to coal mining operations and exports will impact 1Q gross domestic product. Yet, the flood damage is unlikely to have a significant impact on other economic variables. In many cases, the economic costs of natural disasters are canceled out by subsequent reconstruction and recovery activity.”The drenching comes as some parts of Australia are still recovering from the catastrophic bushfires of last summer that razed an area the size of the U.K., wiping out communities and billions of animals. While The fires were linked to climate change, it isn’t clear yet whether the floods have a similar causation.“Little is known about how the frequency of weather events like this one will change with global warming,” said Todd Lane, a professor at the University of Melbourne’s School of Earth Sciences. “In a warmer world the atmosphere can hold more moisture, so as the climate continues to warm events like this have the potential to produce more rain when they occur.”Southern areas of neighboring Queensland state are also on flood watch. Disruptions to freight and logistics services are impacting fresh produce supplies and have also hampered Australia’s rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine.The floods are also impacting on the agricultural sector, with the dairy industry reporting lost animals, power outages and stalled transport that could affect milk deliveries.The Bureau of Meteorology said around 10 million Australians in every mainland state and territory except Western Australia were currently subject to a weather warning, covering “an area similar to the size of Alaska.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coal-markets-roiled-as-australia-s-flood-crisis-worsens-101616463889193.html

"The United States wants to rebuild our partnerships, first and foremost with our NATO allies, we want to revitalise the alliance."After four years of friction with Washington under the presidency of Donald Trump, who said the alliance was obsolete, NATO's European allies have also welcomed the change in tone under new US President Joe Biden.Stoltenberg has set out areas where NATO could modernise over the medium term - from climate measures to more sustainable funding of military operations - and needs US support,Asked about any possible withdrawal from Afghanistan, Blinken said a US review of options was still underway and he would listen and consult with allies. NATO foreign ministers will discuss Afghanistan over the next two days in Brussels."We went in together, we have adjusted together and when the time is right, we will leave together," Blinken said of Western involvement in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-brussels-blinken-offers-boost-for-nato-cooperation-on-afghanistan-101616490405564.html

Speaking on his first visit to NATO, Blinken said he was due to meet his German counterpart, Heiko Maas, to discuss the issue."President (Joe) Biden has been very clear, he believes the pipeline is a bad idea, bad for Europe, bad for the United States, ultimately it is in contradiction to the EU's own security goals," Blinken said as he met NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg."It has the potential to undermine the interests of Ukraine, Poland and a number of close partners and allies," Blinken said, saying that a US law required Washington to impose sanctions on companies participating in the Nord Stream 2 project.Nord Stream 2 will bypass Ukraine, a Western ally, potentially depriving it of valuable transit fees. It will also increase European energy dependency on Russia and compete with shipments of US liquefied natural gas.The pipeline is already around 95% built, and could be finished by September, analysts who monitor tracking data say.The United States fears Russia could use Nord Stream 2 as leverage to weaken EU states by increasing dependency on Moscow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-nato-united-states-warns-germany-over-nord-stream-2-pipeline-101616490097560.html

Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires Aftab Hasan Khan made the remarks while addressing an event organised to mark Pakistan Day. The comments came against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral relations after the armies of the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) last month. “Pakistan wants to have friendly relations with all countries including India,” Khan said, according to a statement issued by the Pakistan high commission. “To achieve peace between Pakistan and India, both countries shall resolve all outstanding issues including [Jammu and Kashmir] through dialogue,” he said. Peace within South Asia is “inevitable” for the larger interest of the region, he added. Also Read | Pakistan delegation on Indus water in India to hold talksKhan spoke after raising the Pakistani flag at the brief ceremony with limited participation that was organised in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Messages from the president and prime minister of Pakistan were also read out at the ceremony. Noting that Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah had made a resolve to create a separate homeland on March 23, 1940, Khan said the day is observed as Pakistan Day every year. He stressed the importance of each generation making its own contribution to realise Jinnah’s vision. The Indian and Pakistani high commissions in Islamabad and New Delhi are currently headed by the deputy chiefs of mission as Pakistan decided not to post an envoy in the Indian capital after Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was scrapped in August 2019. Pakistan also expelled the Indian envoy and downgraded diplomatic ties.

Last week, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa said the time has come for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, though he cautioned that any peace process would be susceptible to disruption without the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Bajwa’s conciliatory remarks came a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations.

The provincial total has risen to 200,969 and the death toll is 6,039."Punjab government has issued new SOPs for public places, bazaars and other activities that involved gatherings," she said while speaking to a private news channel.She said the Punjab government has done satisfactory arrangements to deal with the third wave of Coronavirus, adding, the district administration had started a crackdown on violations of SOPs (standard operating procedures).Dr Yasmin Rashid also said that Lahore was becoming the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, as 1,824 new cases have been reported.Pakistan has reported 633,741 cases so far. 13,935 people have succumbed to the infection in the country.Last week, Pakistan imposed a complete ban on travel from 12 countries, including South Africa, Rwanda and Tanzania, in a bid to curb the spike of coronavirus cases.Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-micro-smart-lockdown-imposed-in-cities-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101616488455154.html
23-03-2021||World||Myanmar junta blames protesters for violence as EU, US impose sanctions||Myanmar's military accused anti-junta protesters of arson and violence as Western countries imposed more sanctions on individuals and groups linked to last month's coup and an ensuing brutal crackdown on dissent.Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said 164 protesters had been killed in the violence and expressed sadness at the deaths."They are also our citizens," he told a news conference in the capital Naypyitaw on Tuesday.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group says at least 261 people have been killed in the harsh crackdown by security forces.Three people were killed in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay in unrest on Monday, including a teenage boy, witnesses and news reports said.Security forces staged more raids in parts of Yangon on Monday night with shots fired and some people wounded, the Mizzima news service reported.The junta has tried to justify the coup by saying a Nov. 8 election won by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was fraudulent - an accusation the electoral commission rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency.Zaw Min Tun blamed protesters for violence and arson and said nine members of the security forces had been killed."Can we call these peaceful protesters?" he said, while showing a video of factories on fire. "Which country or organisation would regard this violence as peaceful?"He said strikes and hospitals not fully operating had caused deaths, including from Covid-19, calling them "undutiful and unethical".The spokesman also accused media of "fake news" and fanning unrest and said reporters could be prosecuted if they were in contact with the CRPH, as the remnants of Suu Kyi's government is known locally. The military has declared the CRPH an illegal organisation.He gave granular details or how the NLD had created hundreds or even thousands of extra ballots in numerous townships by inventing voters, including in Suu Kyi's own constituency. Videos of people saying they were paid by NLD representatives were shown at the news conference.Also shown was video testimony of former Yangon chief minister Phyo Min Thein saying he visited Suu Kyi multiple times and gave her money "whenever needed".Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, is being held in detention. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.Overnight helpThere were also more examples of demonstrations overnight staged without people in a bid to avoid becoming targeted by security forces trying to stamp out organised rallies.In Hsipaw in Shan State the names of dead protesters written on cards were laid out next to candles with a sign reading "We spirits don’t want the junta", DVB TV News reported.Elsewhere, helium-filled balloons were released on Monday bearing messages calling for international help. Street protesters were replaced by toy cars or dolls, some led by cardboard cutouts or manikins dressed in outfits.The European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Monday against individuals involved in the coup and the repression of the demonstrators.The EU sanctions were the bloc's most significant response since the overthrow of Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1.The 11 people it targeted included General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar military and head of the junta that has taken power.The EU already has an arms embargo on Myanmar and has targeted some senior military officials since 2018.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters before the meeting that the military repression "has reached an unbearable extent".Stronger measures are expected soon as the bloc moves to take aim at businesses run by the military, EU diplomats said.Washington had already sanctioned Min Aung Hlaing and the measures announced on Monday expanded the list.The US action targeted senior policeman Than Hlaing and military officer Aung Soe, as well as two Burmese Army divisions, the 33rd Light Infantry and 77th Light Infantry.US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said members of the 33rd Division had fired live rounds into a crowd in Mandalay. Both units were part of the security forces' "planned systemic strategies to ramp up the use of lethal force", he said.There was no immediate response from the junta, which has shown no sign so far of being swayed by international condemnation of its actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-blames-protesters-for-violence-as-eu-us-impose-sanctions-101616489009342.html
23-03-2021||World||Australian PM promises to improve treatment of women in politics||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised significant cultural change to improve the treatment of women in the parliament.Morrison on Tuesday announced in Canberra that he would address every government staffer to discuss the mistreatment of women in the Parliament House.It comes after a staffer was fired on Monday night after allegedly engaging in a lewd act on the desk of a female member of parliament (MP). The government has launched an investigation into fellow staffers who allegedly swapped images and videos filmed at the Parliament House.Morrison, who has faced criticism of his handling of rape allegations against a former staffer and the historical rape allegation denied by Attorney-General Christian Porter, said he was "shocked" and "disgusted" by the reports."I am shocked and I am disgusted. It is shameful. It is just absolutely shameful," he told reporters in the press conference while fighting back tears."We must get this house in order. We must put the politics aside of these things and we must recognize this problem, acknowledge it, and we must fix it."These events have triggered, right across this building, and indeed right across the country, women who have put up with this rubbish and this crap for their entire lives, as their mothers did, as their grandmothers did."Morrison said he was "open" to a discussion about quotas for female representation in the Liberal Party after Industry Minister Karen Andrews said it was time for "serious considerations."At the press conference, when asked about whether he had lost control of the ministerial staff, Morrison said that "no one individual" can be overwatch on every single inch of this place every second of the day."What I am held accountable is what I do now and that is what I am outlining to you today.

China earlier said that its vessels near Whitsun Reef were sheltering from the wind.“We stand with the Philippines, our oldest treaty ally in Asia,” the US Embassy said. Manila has filed a diplomatic protest with China, and called for the Chinese vessels to immediately leave what it considers part of its exclusive economic zone.The incident comes amid continued tensions between the US and China, and as the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte builds friendly ties with Beijing while maintaining its alliance with Washington.Duterte will discuss the incident with China’s envoy to Manila, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Tuesday, while repeating that the two nations can talk things out as friends. More than 180 vessels were still near the reef, the Philippine military said after patrolling the area on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rips-china-s-maritime-militia-backs-philippines-in-spat-101616488263902.html
23-03-2021||World||Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un share messages reaffirming China-N Korea alliance||The leaders of China and North Korea are reaffirming their traditional alliance following contentious talks between top diplomats from Washington and Beijing and diplomatic isolation and economic problems in the North that have left it ever-more dependent on the Chinese.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger “unity and cooperation” with China in the face of challenges posed by “hostile forces” while exchanging messages with Chinese President Xi Jinping.According to KCNA and China’s Xinhua news agency, Xi in his own message to Kim described bilateral relations as a “valuable asset” to both countries and vowed to make unspecified contributions to the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.KCNA said Xi also expressed a commitment to “provide the peoples of the two countries with better life.” Some analysts saw this as an indication that China would soon provide North Korea with badly needed food, fertilizer and other aid that had been significantly reduced amid the pandemic border closures.Xinhua said the leaders’ messages were exchanged during a meeting between Chinese senior diplomat Song Tao and North Korean Ambassador to China Ri Ryong Nam during a meeting in Beijing on Monday.The exchange between the leaders came as the Biden administration steps up diplomatic efforts to strengthen cooperation with Asian allies South Korea and Japan to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat and China’s growing regional influence.Top U.S. and Chinese officials traded sharp and unusually public barbs in Alaska last week in their first face-to-face meetings since President Joe Biden took office, where Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington is united with its allies in pushing back against Chinese authoritarianism.The contentious talks in Anchorage came after Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to Japan and South Korea for talks that mainly focused on North Korea and China.During his visit to Seoul, Blinken sternly criticized North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and human rights record and pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince the North to denuclearize.The North has so far ignored Biden’s administration’s efforts to reach out, saying it won’t engage in meaningful talks with the United States unless Washington abandons what Pyongyang sees as “hostile” policies, which clearly refers to the U.S.-led sanctions and pressure over its nuclear program.KCNA said Kim addressed the state of the North’s relations with the United States and South Korea and said communication between him and Xi was required in the face of changed “external situations and reality,” apparently referring to the new U.S. administration.Kim’s message “stressed the need to strengthen the unity and cooperation between the two parties and two countries to cope with the hostile forces’ all-round challenges and obstructive moves,” KCNA said.Kim’s message to Xi was clearly in response to last week’s visits by Blinken and Lloyd to Japan and South Korea, which signaled the start of the Biden administration’s efforts to create a coordinated approach with its allies on North Korea, said Cheong Seong-Chang, director of North Korea studies at South Korea’s private Sejong Institute.Cheong said it was notable that Xi did not publicly express his support for Kim’s stated plans to expand the North’s nuclear capabilities and instead stressed regional stability.This shows that China prefers diplomacy over a revival of tensions in the Korean Peninsula, and despite its friction with the United States, could still endorse a resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang, he said.China had advocated a “two-track approach” to the issue, whereby the U.S. would offer security guarantees to North Korea in exchange for Pyongyang abandoning its nuclear weapons programs.The meetings in Anchorage reflected increasingly troubled relations between the United States and China, which are at odds over a range of issues from trade to human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong and China’s western Xinjiang region, as well as over Taiwan, China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic.Responding to Blinken’s criticism about his government, Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi said Beijing had no intention to back down on any issue and that the United States should stop pushing its own version of democracy at a time when America itself has been roiled by domestic discontent.As North Korea pursued diplomacy with the U.S. starting in 2018, it also worked to strengthen relations with China, its traditional ally and economic lifeline. But Kim has nothing to show for his ambitious summits with then-President Trump, which collapsed in 2019 over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s disarmament steps.The North’s economic woes have been compounded by pandemic border closures and devastating natural disasters that wiped out crops last summer. At a ruling party congress in January, Kim vowed to further expand the North’s nuclear program and urged his people to be resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance.South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers late last year that North Korea’s trade volume with China fell by 75% during the first 10 months of 2020. That led to a shortage of raw materials that plunged the North’s factory operations to its lowest level since Kim took power in late 2011, and a jump in the prices of imported foods like sugar and seasonings.Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was to arrive in South Korea later on Tuesday for talks on North Korea and other regional issues. Public spats between Washington and Moscow erupted this week after Biden during an ABC interview characterized Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “killer” and said Putin will “pay a price” for his efforts to undermine the 2020 U.S. election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-kim-jong-un-share-messages-reaffirming-china-n-korea-alliance-101616488406647.html
23-03-2021||World||Pakistan reaches out to China to ensure supply of Covid-19 vaccine||Pakistan on Tuesday reached out to its all-weather ally China for ensuring the supply of the coronavirus vaccine, as the country is grappling to contain the third wave of the pandemic that has also hit Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi held a telephone conversation with his Chinese counterpart and State Councilor Wang Yi, underscoring that Pakistan had devised an elaborate plan of vaccination across the country as part of its efforts to combat the pandemic, according to the Foreign Office (FO).“To reinforce Pakistan’s capacity to effectively and expeditiously fight the pandemic, Foreign Minister Qureshi discussed with his Chinese counterpart the supply of Covid-19 vaccine from China to Pakistan during March-April 2021,” the FO said.Foreign Minister Wang reassured that China will continue to firmly support Pakistan in its fight against the pandemic and accord highest priority to the requirements of its time-tested friend, according to FO.Qureshi also expressed gratitude to China for earlier gifting Pakistan 1.5 million doses of the Chinese vaccine, underlining that it had played a pivotal role in protecting precious human lives.China on Wednesday gifted another 500,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccine to Pakistan, the Dawn reported.He thanked Prime Minister Li Keqiang’s message wishing Prime Minister Imran Khan speedy recovery from Covid-19. Wang also wished swift recovery to Pakistan premier Khan.Khan, 68, and his wife Bushra Bibi, 47, tested positive on Saturday for the Covid-19, two days after he got the first shot of a vaccine.Both the Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen Pakistan-China “All-Weather Strategic Co-operative Partnership”. The two sides also agreed to maintain high-level exchanges.The exchange came as Pakistan recorded another 3,270 new cases in the last 24 hours, taking the national tally of infections to 633,741, according to the ministry of National Health Services.Seventy two people died during the period, with the total number of COVID-19 deaths jumping to 13,935 in the country. A total of 2,485 are in a critical condition.Pakistan on Monday announced new stringent measures, including restrictions on commercial activities to control the spread of the virus.In Pakistan, Covid-19 vaccination is so far being carried out through the Adult Vaccination Counters (AVCs). However, the government’s response to procure vaccines remained very slow and it is largely eyeing donations to vaccinate the increasingly vulnerable population.Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, last month allowed private firms to import coronavirus vaccines and agreed to exempt them from price caps.The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) last week notified the procedure for determining the maximum retail prices of imported Covid-19 vaccines in the country.Official sources said that the maximum sale price of Sputnik V Russian vaccine will be fixed at ₹8,449 for two doses and China’s Convidecia at ₹4,225 per injection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-reaches-out-to-china-to-ensure-supply-of-covid-19-vaccine-101616487990401.html

23-03-2021||World||Bitcoin dubbed ‘far too costly’ in Norway as cashlessness rules||Norway recently emerged as the world’s most cashless society, but its central bank governor says people shouldn’t start turning to Bitcoin as an alternative.Oystein Olsen, the governor of Norges Bank in Oslo, says it’s inconceivable that Bitcoin -- the most popular cryptocurrency -- will replace the money that’s currently controlled by central banks.Bitcoin is “far too resource-intensive, far too costly and most importantly, it doesn’t preserve stability,” Olsen said in a phone interview. “I mean, the basic property and task for a central bank and central-bank currency is to provide stability in the value of money and in the system, and that is not done by Bitcoin.”Olsen’s dismissal of Bitcoin comes not long after one of Norway’s most prominent businessmen, Kjell Inge Rokke, endorsed the cryptocurrency, arguing it will ultimately be on the right side of monetary history. He even suggested a single Bitcoin might one day “be worth millions of dollars.”On Monday, one Bitcoin traded at around $57,000, almost 900% up from its value roughly a year ago. Elon Musk is a fan, as is Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management. Matt McDermott, global head of digital assets for Goldman Sachs Global Markets Division, recently said there’s now “huge” institutional demand across different industry types and from private banking clients for Bitcoin.Meanwhile, central banks are racing to respond to widespread cashlessness by developing their own digital currencies before cryptocurrencies take over. Norges Bank Deputy Governor Ida Wolden Bache said last November that Norway has become the world’s most cashless country, with only 4% of all payments conducted with bank notes and coins. That’s raised questions about how payments should be conducted in the future.But Norway isn’t one of the front-runners when it comes to developing central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Instead, Sweden and China are the world leaders among major economies, as policy makers team up with technology experts to figure out how best to design something that central banks can control.Norges Bank is due to publish a report on its CBDC project in April. Wolden Bache said earlier this month the goal is that users “must be able to pay efficiently and securely in” Norwegian kroner. According to her slide presentation, a Norwegian CBDC “will not change private sector credit intermediation.”As for Bitcoin, which some central bankers have compared to the tulip bubble of the 17th century, Olsen said, “I don’t think at the end of the day it will be a threat to central banks. Although some people talk about that.”“Digital currencies more generally are the new wine, in many respects,” he said. But now, “central banks are entering the scene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-dubbed-far-too-costly-in-norway-as-cashlessness-rules-101616479492763.html

Health minister Matt Hancock said the government's original plan to review international travel in April and possibly permit it from May 17 still stood but the travel fines were included in legislation in case that would not be possible.The news sent shares in travel stocks such as easyJet , British Airway-owner, Jet2 and TUI down between 3 and 4% in early trade on Tuesday.In the UK, foreign holidays are currently banned."The earliest date by which we will allow for international travel...is the 17th May. That has not changed," Hancock told Sky News.The question of whether people can travel abroad without specific reasons such as work or education will still be addressed by the government's travel review which is due to report on April 12, said Hancock.But hopes that the government will give the green light to summer getaways from 17th May have faded in recent days due to warnings over rising Covid-19 infection levels in Europe.Europe's airlines and travel sector are now bracing for a second lost summer. Having already racked up billions in debt to survive a year of travel restrictions, they are facing further strain and some may need fresh funds.Hancock said it was too early to say what the government would decide on holidays."The reason for that is that we are seeing this third wave rising in some parts of Europe and we're also seeing new variants and it is very important that we protect the progress that we've been able to make here in the UK," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-to-introduce-fines-on-those-attempting-to-travel-abroad-before-endjune-101616487105490.html
23-03-2021||World||China stocks fall as western sanctions over Xinjiang weigh on sentiment||Chinese stocks fell on Tuesday as western sanctions against China reduced risk appetite and lingering worries over policy tightening continued to weigh on the market.The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 1%, to 5,009.25 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.9% to 3,411.51 points.The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and Beijing hit back immediately with broad punitive measures against the EU."The sanctions hurt risk appetite, in particular among foreign investors, who sold shares via the Stock Connect," said Jin Jing, an analyst with Caitong Securities."Persistent worries of policy tightening at home also continued to weigh on high flying sectors and stocks with lofty valuations as investors turned cautious," he said.China's monetary policy needs to focus on supporting economic growth in a targeted way while also reducing financial risks, the central bank head said on Saturday.Foreign investors on Tuesday sold a net 5.1 billion yuan ($783.51 million) worth of A-shares via the Stock Connect linking mainland and Hong Kong, according to Refinitiv data.Leading the declines, the CSI300 materials index and the CSI300 new energy index slumped 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively.China's blue-chip index has fallen more than 15% from an all-time high hit on Feb. 18, led by consumer, healthcare and new energy firms, as investors worry Beijing's conservative economic growth target for this year could give it more room to rein in bubbles in its financial markets.Analysts also said pressure was mounting for mutual funds to sell stocks to deal with increasing redemptions, as a correction continued in the stock market.Enthusiasm about mutual funds has decreased after the Lunar New Year holiday, while there is evident redemption pressure for funds that heavily invest in consumer and health care stocks, CITIC Securities said in a report on March 22, noting the issuance of new mutual funds remained sluggish in March.($1 = 6.5092 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-stocks-fall-as-western-sanctions-over-xinjiang-weigh-on-sentiment-101616485799181.html
23-03-2021||World||Sinovac says its vaccine is safe for children as young as 3||Sinovac said its Covid-19 vaccine is safe in children ages 3-17, based on preliminary data, and it has submitted the data to Chinese drug regulators.More than 70 million shots of Sinovac’s vaccine have been given worldwide, including in China.China has approved its use in adults but it has not yet been used in children, because their immune systems may respond differently to the vaccine.Early and mid-stage clinical trials with over 550 subjects showed the vaccine would induce an immune response, Gang Zeng, the medical director at Sinovac, said at a news conference.Two recipients developed high fevers in response to the vaccine, one a 3-year-old and the other a 6-year-old. The rest of the trial subjects experienced mild symptoms, Zeng said.“Showing that the vaccine is safe and would elicit potentially useful immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is very welcomed,” said Eng Eong Ooi, a professor at the Duke NUS Medical school in Singapore who is co-leading the development of a separate Covid-19 vaccine. However, he said the data presented publicly by the company was not enough to give a conclusive answer on the findings.Children are far less likely to be seriously ill with Covid-19, but they are still at risk and can spread the virus. And while vaccination campaigns worldwide have focused on adults, children will need to be immunized to end the pandemic.The Pfizer vaccine is cleared for use starting at age 16 and is being studied in ages 12-16. Moderna has been studying its vaccine in children aged 12 and older and last week announced a new study testing its use in children younger than 12.State-owned Sinopharm, who has two Covid-19 vaccines, is also investigating the effectiveness of its vaccines in children. The company said in January it had submitted clinical data to regulators, though it was unclear if it was for one or both vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-says-its-vaccine-is-safe-for-children-as-young-as-3-101616484419718.html
23-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca may have provided outdated vaccine data, US agency says||AstraZeneca Plc may have released outdated information about its Covid-19 vaccine trial, giving an “incomplete” view of the efficacy of the shot, said the leading US agency on infectious diseases.The Data and Safety Monitoring Board, charged with ensuring the safety and accuracy of the trial, has “expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,” said the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in a statement early Tuesday.Read more: AstraZeneca vaccine found 79% effective in US trials: Key points“We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible,” said the statement from the group headed by Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official.The disclosure comes as a setback to AstraZeneca, who earlier Monday said its vaccine was found 79% effective in preventing Covid-19 in a U.S. clinical trial of more than 30,000 volunteers.It’s preparing to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use in the US; the shot has already been cleared in the U.K. and many other nations around the world.AstraZeneca’s vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was once seen as a frontrunner to protect the world against Covid-19 but has been beset by a series of complications.Read more: Explained: Why have some countries suspended use of AstraZeneca vaccine?An error in dosing regimens during trials last year caused confusion over its efficacy, and it’s now at the center of a supply showdown with the European Union just days after concerns about blood clots prompted a dozen member states to suspend immunizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-may-have-provided-outdated-vaccine-data-us-agency-says-101616478206710.html
23-03-2021||World||Russia seeking to gain as Biden mulls over US' role in Syrian war||The Biden administration is mulling over America’s role in Syria’s ongoing conflict as the U.S. tries to break away from Middle East wars, but Vladimir Putin’s top diplomat already has been busy on the ground, trying to win support for a Syria approach that could establish Russia as a broker of security and power in the region.The new U.S. administration has yet to say how it plans to handle Syria, which is now fragmented among a half-dozen militaries — including U.S. troops — owing to a war that has killed and has displaced millions. The conflict includes al-Qaida affiliates, Islamic State forces and other jihadist groups eager to use Syria as a base.Russia and Iran have intervened to prevent the collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has wielded chemical attacks, barrel bombs and starvation to crush what had started out as a peaceful uprising. The conflict just entered its 11th year.Dealing with Syria's war will test the Biden administration's determination to focus on Asia and not the Middle East. If the United States diminishes its presence, Russia and other hostile U.S. rivals are poised to step in and boost their regional stature and resources.Hence Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's Middle East tour this month.Lavrov stood by as the foreign minister of a Gulf state generally friendly to Washington, the United Arab Emirates, delivered a message in line with Moscow's position: U.S. sanctions on Syria's Russia-supported regime were blocking international efforts to rebuild Syria. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said it is time to welcome Syria back into the fold of Arab nations.In other words, Russia's message is “the Syria war is over, Assad has won, Assad will be in power as long as he is breathing oxygen," said Frederic Hof, who served as a U.S. Syria adviser and envoy in the Obama administration.Hof said there was an unstated part of the message: Russia plans to be on hand as “Syria is built from the ashes,” benefiting from any international reconstruction resources coming in, and positioning itself as the broker to manage the security threats that Syria poses to the region.Hof and James F. Jeffrey, a career diplomat under Republican and Democratic administrations who served as President Donald Trump’s Syria envoy, argue for the United States to remain a significant presence in the country, citing Russia's ambitions.“If this is the security future of the Middle East, we’re all in trouble,” Jeffrey warns. “That’s what Putin and Lavrov are pushing.”The Biden administration is reviewing whether it should consider Syria as one of America's most important national security problems.It's shown no sign yet of doing so. Notably, where President Joe Biden has spelt out some other Middle East problems as priorities — including Yemen’s war and Iran’s nuclear program, for which Biden appointed envoys — he and his officials have said and done little publicly on Syria.In Congress, Syria is at the heart of a congressional debate over whether to reduce or end the authorities given to presidents to conduct military strikes in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.It was the Syrian war that sparked that debate when President Barack Obama first considered military strikes there, said Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Congress has sidelined itself in some of the most important decisions that a country can take.”One of Biden’s few public mentions of Syria since taking office came last week when he listed it among international problems that the U.N. Security Council should do more on.Marking the 10th anniversary of the start of the Syrian conflict last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement with European counterparts emphasized the need for humanitarian aid for Syrian civilians and accountability for the Assad regime.U.S. troops are helping protect an opposition enclave in northeast Syria, in an area that includes oil and natural gas. During Biden's campaign last year, Blinken framed the military role as a “point of leverage” in negotiations over the international handling of Syria, rather than an ongoing force.Spokespeople with the National Security Council and State Department declined to answer specific questions on Biden's Syria policy, including whether the administration sees the Syria conflict as a major national security threat or plans to appoint an envoy.Biden follows Obama and Trump in seeking to minimize the United States' military role in the Middle East and shift the focus of U.S. foreign policy to Asia, where China has been increasingly aggressive.But the Middle East's conflicts and the United States' own strategic schemes have a way of pulling Americans back. Biden last month became the sixth consecutive U.S. president to bomb a Middle East target, hitting an Iranian-allied militia in Syria that had attacked American and allied personnel in neighbouring Iraq.Some current and former U.S. diplomats for the Middle East have argued Syria is not a top security threat for the United States.Robert S. Ford, an Obama administration ambassador to Syria with years of diplomatic experience in the region, concluded in a Foreign Affairs article last year that Washington should move toward pulling its troops out of northeast Syria, arrange for Russia and others to deal with jihadist fighters, and put the United States' money toward helping the war's refugees.But Hof and Jeffrey, two others who dealt with Syria for past administrations, argue against withdrawal.“If I were an ISIS leader now trying desperately to organize an insurgency to come back” in Syria, “I would pray that that advice be taken,” Hof said. For the Islamic State group, “if you can have as your enemies the (Syrian) regime, the Iranians and the Russians, it doesn’t get any better than that.”A test of Biden administration intentions is looming, as Russia seeks to use its U.N. Security Council position to shut down a humanitarian aid route into part of Syria not under the control of the Russia-supported Syrian government, notes Mona Yacoubian, senior Syria adviser for the U.S. Institute for Peace think tank.Maintaining or bolstering the U.S. footprint in Syria will be important, Yacoubian said — not just as leverage in political negotiations, but also to shape the rules of the game for Russia's presence in the Middle East. And other immediate goals for the international community remain: making life “more manageable and less miserable for Syrians,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeking-to-gain-as-biden-mulls-over-us-role-in-syrian-war-101616482849138.html
23-03-2021||World||War of sanctions breaks out between China and EU over Xinjiang||China has hit back at the European Union with a broad set of retaliatory measures after Brussels united with the US, Britain and Canada to sanction Chinese officials on Monday for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, a northwestern province home to the Muslim Uighur community.It was the first coordinated western action against Beijing under new US President Joe Biden, and the first time in decades that the EU issued significant measures against China.The EU imposed sanctions on Monday on four Chinese officials, including a top security director, for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, with Britain and Canada following suit.Beijing’s response against the coordinated western move was quick.China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it had summoned the EU’s ambassador, Nicolas Chapuis, to make a “solemn protest” against sanctions the bloc imposed on Chinese officials in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).In a statement, the ministry said vice foreign minister Qin Gang told Chapuis that the EU should recognise the seriousness of its error and correct it to prevent further damage to ties with China.On Monday night, Beijing sanctioned 10 individuals, including EU lawmakers and four entities, for harming “China’s sovereignty and interests and maliciously spread lies and disinformation”.“It (the EU) must stop lecturing others on human rights and interfering in their internal affairs. It must end the hypocritical practice of double standards and stop going further down the wrong path. Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions,” the Chinese statement added.German politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European parliament’s delegation to China, was among the most high-profile figures to be hit.The targets of Chinese sanctions included the non-profit Alliance of Democracies Foundation, founded by former Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen.Also on the list was Adrian Zenz, a German scholar whose research has been cited by both diplomats and journalists when highlighting alleged abuses in Xinjiang.“The so-called sanctions based on lies are not acceptable,” Wang Yi, foreign minister and state councillor, said separately during a joint briefing with visiting Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.Human rights activists and the UN say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.Reports have levelled widespread allegations of sexual abuse, sterilisation and forced labour in the camps.China has denied all the accusations and has insisted the camps provide vocational training, which generates employment and is needed to fight religious extremism.“Xinjiang issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion at all, but about combating violence, terrorism and separatism. The series of measures Xinjiang has taken are not only in accordance with China’s laws but are also concrete steps and manifestations of China’s implementation of the international counterterrorism and de-radicalisation initiatives,” the Chinese foreign ministry had said earlier.Beijing has also said the inmates have been released from the camps.Access to the Xinjiang camps is strictly restricted, making it impossible to independently verify whether all the camps have closed.Western governments have brushed aside Beijing’s defence, calling it propaganda.“Amid growing international condemnation, (China) continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in statement ahead of meetings with EU and Nato ministers in Brussels this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/war-of-sanctions-breaks-out-between-china-and-eu-over-xinjiang-101616482374175.html

The two have not imposed sanctions themselves.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the multi-national measures were part of “intensive diplomacy” by the U.K., the United States, Canada and the 27-nation EU to force action amid mounting evidence of serious rights abuses against the Uyghur people.The sanctions will be imposed immediately and include travel bans and asset freezes against four officials, Raab said.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement the united response "sends a strong signal to those who violate or abuse international human rights, and we will take further actions in coordination with likeminded partners."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-new-zealand-welcome-sanctions-against-chinese-over-uighur-abuses-101616478742807.html

JICA already agreed to finance the first 1.2 gigawatt phase of the project that is scheduled for completion in 2024, but hasn’t decided if it will finance the expansion, which would double the facility’s capacity.“In spite of difficulties, my government decided to do a survey and research on unit 3 and 4,” Naoki Ito, the Japanese ambassador to Bangladesh, said Thursday during a webinar hosted by the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh, referring to the expansion. Changing climate policies have led the country to scrap dozens of plans for new coal plants, he said.Japan agreed in August to support expanding the Matarbari plant with three additional units planned in a second phase of construction, according to a Japanese government official, who asked not to be identified citing policy. However, Japan hasn’t yet formally committed to providing loans for the second phase, said the official.Institutions providing financing for coal-fired generation are under increasing pressure from investors to exit the sector amid fears that the facilities will become stranded assets that pose financial risk, as governments seek to decarbonize economies.JICA’s decision whether to finance the Matarbari expansion won’t impact its credit rating as long as it is tied to the Japanese government, said Atsushi Moriya, an analyst with Rating And Investment, which rates JICA AA . JICA is a government agency that provides overseas aid in developing countries.The expansion may prove awkward for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has pledged to make Japan carbon neutral by 2050. While the country has tightened conditions for participation in overseas coal projects, it has left the door open to new plants if recipient countries commit to long-term decarbonization and support only the highest-efficiency plants.Japan Bank for International Cooperation Governor Tadashi Maeda said earlier this month that the state-run lender has no immediate plans to finance any new coal-power projects. JBIC in December agreed to provide about $636 million worth of project financing for the Vung Ang 2 plant in central Vietnam.Japan’s commercial banks, including Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., have pledged to phase out coal power financing amid pressure from environmental groups and investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-eyes-overseas-coal-units-in-bangladesh-ignores-climate-pressure-101616479072142.html
23-03-2021||World||Bangladesh officials probe fire at Rohingya camp that killed several people||Bangladeshi officials began investigating the cause of a massive fire that left several dead at a Rohingya refugee camp, as officials sifted through the debris looking for more victims on Tuesday.The fire ripped through the Balukhali camp near the southeastern town of Cox's Bazar late on Monday, burning through hundreds of homes as people raced to recover their meagre possessions.Police have so far confirmed only two deaths after recovering the bodies. Rohingya witnesses, however, said several people had died in the blaze that has left tens of thousands with no shelter.Some witnesses said barbed wire fencing around the camp trapped many people, causing some of the casualties and leading international humanitarian agencies to call for its removal."The cause of the fire is still unknown," said Zakir Hossain Khan, a senior police official. "Authorities are investigating to determine the cause of the fire."Humanitarian organization Refugees International estimated 50,000 people had been displaced - in already crowded camps that house more than one million Rohingya refugees - and the extent of the damage may not be known for some time."Many children are missing, and some were unable to flee because of barbed wire set up in the camps," it said in a statement.John Quinley, of Fortify Rights, a rights organization working in the area, said he had heard similar reports, adding the fences had hampered the distribution of humanitarian aid and vital services at the camps in the past."The government must remove the fences and protect refugees," Quinley said in a statement. "There have now been a number of large fires in the camps including a large fire in January this year...The authorities must do a proper investigation into the cause of the fires."The vast majority of the people in the camps fled Myanmar in 2017 amid a military-led crackdown on the Rohingya that UN investigators said was executed with "genocidal intent", charges Myanmar denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-officials-probe-fire-at-rohingya-camp-that-killed-several-people-101616478682024.html
23-03-2021||World||Canada warns other countries of risk to their citizens who are in China||As international action against the Chinese government has started to coalesce around the detention and trials of two Canadian nationals jailed in China, Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau warned other nations that doing business with Beijing could result in their citizens getting detained there.On a day of quick developments that witnessed the trial in Beijing of a second Canadian man, Michael Kovrig, Canada joined the US and the UK in imposing sanctions on four top Chinese officials and an entity over human rights violations in Xinjiang province. Garneau told CBC, “My advice to all other countries in the world is - if you are doing business with China and you have citizens of your country in China, and you have disagreements with them, there is the possibility that your citizens could be detained.”In a statement issued earlier in the day by Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, Garneau said, “We are deeply troubled by the total lack of transparency surrounding these hearings and we continue to work towards an immediate end to their arbitrary detention.” While one of the detained Canadians, Michael Spavor, was tried in a Beijing court on Friday, Kovrig appeared before a judge on Monday. The two Canadians were arrested in December 2018. They were later charged with spying in China and passing on sensitive information to entities outside the country.It is widely believed that their arrest was politically motivated and came in retaliation after Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, was arrested and detained in Vancouver just days before on an extradition request from the US. Wanzhou was charged with fraud and conspiracy for trying to bypass US sanctions on Iran.Speaking at a press event in Trois-Rivières in Quebec province, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the “arbitrary detention” of the two Canadians was “unacceptable”.Both Trudeau and Garneau thanked diplomats from two dozen nations for standing in unity with Canada outside the courthouse, even as they were barred from entering the premises. “The eyes of the world are on these cases and proceedings and I want to thank our international partners for their continued support and solidarity,” Garneau said.In a separate statement following the imposition of sanctions on Chinese officials, Garneau said, “We remain deeply concerned by the egregious human rights violations that are taking place in Xinjiang at the hands of the Chinese state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-warns-other-countries-of-risk-to-their-citizens-who-are-in-china-101616476734044.html
23-03-2021||World||Israel elections: Opinion polls in favour of Netanyahu after vaccine success||Israelis began voting on Tuesday on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political survival in a fourth election in two years, with the veteran leader hoping his role in a rapid Covid-19 vaccine campaign will win him another term.Opinion polls show the race too close to call.On trial on corruption charges he denies, Netanyahu, 71, is Israel's longest-serving head of government. Since 2009, he has led the politically polarised nation where supporters hail him as "King Bibi" and opponents call him "crime minister".Opinion polls indicated an uptick for Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party in the campaign's final days, giving a prospective coalition of conservative and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties around 60 seats in the 120-member parliament.A possible, but more unlikely, alliance among right-wing, centrist and left-wing parties opposed to a Netanyahu-led government also fell short of a ruling majority in the legislature, but could also be within reach of power, the surveys showed.Polling stations opened at 7am (0500 GMT) and will close at 10pm (2000 GMT), when exit polls could point to voting trends, if not a clear winner. Yair Lapid, a former finance minister who heads the centrist Yesh Atid party, has emerged as Netanyahu's main challenger.No one party has ever gleaned enough votes for a parliamentary majority on its own in an Israeli election. Election night results may only be a starting point, with a final winner to be determined in backroom coalition talks.Critics have accused Netanyahu of seeking new elections out of self-interest, in hopes of securing enough support in parliament for possible legislation to quash the legal proceedings against him.Netanyahu has denied the allegation, or any personal involvement in prospective criminal immunity moves. But he has not ruled out the possibility that allies might pursue them.On the campaign trail, Netanyahu has highlighted his role in securing millions of vaccine doses from Pfizer Inc and turning Israel into what he dubbed a "vaccination nation".About half of Israelis have been inoculated at a pace that drew international praise for Netanyahu as well as calls for Israel to do more to ensure Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza receive vaccines.Israel's swift vaccine roll-out allowed it to reopen much of its economy before the election. Posting a video on Twitter of his visit to a Jerusalem hospital on Monday, Netanyahu wrote: "Today we are the first in the world to return to life and smile again."Netanyahu's current government, a power-sharing alliance with centrist Defence Minister Benny Gantz, collapsed in December, some seven months after it was established.Gantz's Blue and White party is forecast to win barely enough votes to get into parliament, after he angered many of his supporters by reneging on a promise not to serve under an indicted prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-elections-opinion-polls-in-favour-of-netanyahu-after-vaccine-success-101616476167988.html
23-03-2021||World||West sanctions China over Xinjiang abuses, Beijing hits back at EU||The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the first such coordinated Western action against Beijing under new US President Joe Biden.Beijing hit back immediately with punitive measures against the EU that appeared broader, including European lawmakers, diplomats, institutes and families, and banning their businesses from trading with China.Western governments are seeking to hold Beijing accountable for mass detentions of Muslim Uighurs in northwestern China, where the United States says China is committing genocide.China denies all accusations of abuse.The coordinated effort appeared to be early fruit in a concerted U.S. diplomatic push to confront China in league with allies, a core element of Biden's still evolving China policy.Senior US administration officials have said they are in daily contact with governments in Europe on China-related issues, something they call the "Europe roadshow.""Amid growing international condemnation, (China) continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in statement ahead of meetings with EU and NATO ministers in Brussels this week.Canada's foreign ministry said: "Mounting evidence points to systemic, state-led human rights violations by Chinese authorities."Activists and UN rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations. China says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.The European Union was the first to impose sanctions on Monday on four Chinese officials, including a top security director, and one entity, a decision later mirrored by Britain and Canada.Those also targeted by the United States were Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau and another senior official in the region, Wang Junzheng.The United States had already last year designated for sanctions the top official in Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, who was not targeted by the other Western allies on Monday, to avoid a larger diplomatic dispute, experts and diplomats said.The foreign ministers of Canada and Britain issued a joint statement with Blinken, saying the three were united in demanding that Beijing end its "repressive practices" in Xinjiang.Evidence of abuses was "overwhelming", including satellite imagery, eyewitness testimony, and the Chinese government's own documents, they said.Separately, the foreign ministers of Australia and New Zealand issued a statement expressing "grave concerns about the growing number of credible reports of severe human rights abuses against ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang" and welcoming the measures announced by Canada, the European Union, Britain and the United States.FIRST MAJOR EU SANCTIONS IN DECADESThe move by the US and its allies follows two days of talks between US and Chinese officials last week, which laid bare the tensions between the world's two largest economies.The EU accused Chen Mingguo of "arbitrary detentions and degrading treatment inflicted upon Uighurs and people from other Muslim ethnic minorities, as well as systematic violations of their freedom of religion or belief".Others hit with travel bans and asset freezes were: senior Chinese officials Wang Mingshan, the former deputy party secretary in Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Public Security Bureau.The EU has sought to avoid confrontation with Beijing and Monday's sanctions were the first significant measures since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, although Brussels targeted two computer hackers and a technology firm in 2020 as part of broader cyber sanctions.The steps were praised by the United States. "A united transatlantic response sends a strong signal to those who violate or abuse international human rights," Blinken said.While mainly symbolic, the EU sanctions mark a hardening towards China, which Brussels regarded as a benign trading partner but now views as a systematic abuser of rights and freedoms.Britain has repeatedly denounced torture, forced labour and sterilisations that it says are taking place on an "industrial scale" in Xinjiang and repeated its criticism of Beijing on Monday.'POINTLESS'Beijing's reprisal was swift.Retaliation included sanctions on European lawmakers, the EU's main foreign policy decision-making body known as the Political and Security Committee and two institutes.On Tuesday, China also summoned the EU ambassador, Nicolas Chapuis, to lodge a "solemn protest" and demand that the bloc correct its error to prevent further damage to relations."The so-called sanctions based on lies are not acceptable," Wang Yi, foreign minister and state councillor, said separately during a joint briefing with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.German politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation to China, was among the most high-profile figures to be hit. The non-profit Alliance of Democracies Foundation, founded by former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, was on the list, according to a statement by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Also included was Adrian Zenz, a German scholar whose research was cited by the State Department last year when highlighting alleged abuses in Xinjiang.The Netherlands summoned China's ambassador to The Hague after Beijing announced its measures on 10 Europeans, while the European Parliament, along with German, Dutch, Belgian and other foreign ministers, rejected the Chinese retaliation."These sanctions prove that China is sensitive to pressure," Dutch lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, who was put on China's sanctions list, said on Twitter. "Let this be an encouragement to all my European colleagues: Speak out!"Restricted from entering China or doing business with it, Beijing accused its targets of seriously harming the country's sovereignty over Xinjiang.All 27 EU governments agreed to the bloc's punitive measures, but Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, called them "harmful" and "pointless".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-sanctions-china-over-xinjiang-abuses-beijing-hits-back-at-eu-101616475295609.html
23-03-2021||World||Biden to talk up health insurance cost cuts in visit to Ohio||President Joe Biden will showcase health insurance cost cuts in a speech in Ohio Tuesday during what may be the best time for Democrats to talk up the Affordable Care Act since it became law.Biden's Covid-19 relief bill pumps up “Obamacare” premium subsidies to address longstanding problems of affordability, particularly for people with solid middle-class incomes. More taxpayer assistance means, in effect, that consumers who buy their own policies through HealthCare.gov will pay hundreds of dollars less out of their own pockets.“The ACA is over a decade old and this is literally the first time that Democrats have been successful at improving it,” said analyst Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. “Democrats have succeeded politically by selling the ACA's protections for preexisting conditions, but affordability has always been a challenge. And now Democrats have successfully improved the premium help available under the law.”Biden's speech Tuesday in Columbus, the capital of a political battleground state, is part of a mini-blitz by the White House. Newly minted Health Secretary Xavier Becerra will echo Biden's comments Tuesday in Carson City, Nevada, and join a Florida-themed Zoom event. Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff will pitch the relief bill in Omaha, Nebraska.The numbers show that the Biden administration does have a product that consumers may want to hear about.The Covid-19 legislation cuts premiums paid by a hypothetical 64-year-old making $58,000 from $1,075 a month to about $413, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. A 45-year-old making $19,300 would pay zero in premiums as compared with about $67 on average before the law. People who have even a brief spell of unemployment this year can get a standard plan for zero premium and reduced copays and deductibles.New and existing customers will be able to take advantage of the savings starting April 1 by going to HealthCare.gov. States that run their own health insurance markets will offer the same enhanced assistance, although timetables for implementation may vary.Biden has opened a special sign-up period for uninsured people to get coverage through HealthCare.gov through May 15, and the early response has been strong. By spreading the word about the higher subsidies, the White House is hoping to super-charge enrollment. But the 11 million people who already have private plans through the health law will also benefit.Republicans see Biden's sweeter subsidies as an example of Democratic overreach on the COVID-19 bill. Policy consultant Brian Blase, a former health care adviser in the Trump White House, expects most of the additional taxpayer assistance will merely substitute for what private households would have otherwise paid.Their complaints notwithstanding, Republicans may face a political dilemma. The higher health care subsidies are keyed to the pandemic and expire by the end of 2022. That will let Democrats set up election-year votes to make the new benefits permanent, or add even more.The COVID-19 bill follows Biden’s strategy of building on the Obama-era health law to move the U.S. toward coverage for all.Another provision offers a dozen or so holdout states led by Republicans a financial inducement to expand Medicaid to more low-income adults. So far there have been no takers.It’s unclear how big a dent the Biden legislation will make in the number of uninsured people, which has risen to an estimated 33 million or more.But it represents the biggest expansion of federal help for health insurance since the ACA's enactment. Obamacare not only survived President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to tear it down, it's now getting new life.Because health insurance is so complicated, consumers are going to have to do their homework to figure out if there’s something in the legislation for them. But people who qualify for higher tax credits won't lose out. If they don't claim the enhanced assistance immediately, they're still entitled to the money when they file their 2021 tax returns next year.Tuesday marks the 11th anniversary of then-President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act. Biden, who as vice president was at Obama's side at the signing ceremony, is scheduled to tour the James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute before his speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-talk-up-health-insurance-cost-cuts-in-visit-to-ohio-101616474552213.html

Officer Eric Tally responded to the scene -- was first on the scene -- and he was fatally shot," said police chief Maris Herold.Tally, 51, had been serving in the Boulder police department since 2010, police said. Herold added the King Soopers supermarket shooting is a complex investigation that will take no less than five days to complete.According to police officials cited by news agency Reuters, they had few immediate details of the shooting and no known motive for the violence, which unfolded at about 3pm at the grocery store in the Table Mesa area of Boulder, a city at the eastern foot of the Rockies about 28 miles (45km) northwest of the state capital of Denver.The person taken into custody, who was also injured in the violence, was believed to be the only individual who survived the bloodshed, commander Kerry Yamaguchi of the Boulder Police department was quoted as saying. No further details about the suspect were revealed.According to video footage cited by Reuters that was broadcast on local television, a shirtless, bearded man in boxer shorts was seen handcuffed and being taken out of the storeAccording to video footage cited by Reuters that was broadcast on local television, a shirtless, bearded man in boxer shorts was seen handcuffed and being taken out of the store, before being placed on a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance. The man in custody appeared to have a bloody leg and was limping as he walked, the agency reported.An eyewitness, Ryan Borowski, who was in the store when he heard at least eight gunshots and escaped, told CNN, "I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips." "It felt amazing that everybody was helping each other out and that our instincts were on the same page and we ran... I don't know why other people didn't, and I'm sorry that they froze. I wish that this just didn't happen," he said, according to AFP.Armoured vehicles, ambulances and armed personnel including FBI agents and SWAT teams were deployed to the scene. Later, shoppers who had been led safely out of the store sat wrapped in blankets, talking to emergency workers in the snow-covered parking area, AFP reported.This is the second shooting in the United States in a week after eight people, including six Asian women, were killed by a gunman at three locations in and around Atlanta last Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-supermarket-shooting-10-including-cop-dead-suspect-arrested-what-we-know-so-far-101616470077672.html
23-03-2021||World||In 'worrying sign', global Covid-19 deaths rise for first time in 6 weeks: WHO||A top World Health Organisation expert on the coronavirus pandemic said the weekly global count of deaths from Covid-19 is rising again, a "worrying sign" after about six weeks of decline.Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead on Covid-19 at the UN health agency, said on Monday that the growth followed a fifth straight week of confirmed cases increasing worldwide. She said the number of reported cases went up in four of the WHO's six regions, though there were significant variations within each region."In the last week, cases have increased by 8 per cent," Van Kerkhove told reporters. "In Europe, that is 12 per cent -- and that's driven by several countries."The increase is in part due to the spread of a variant that first emerged in Britain and is now circulating in many other places, including eastern Europe, she said.Southeast Asia registered a 49 per cent week-to-week jump in confirmed cases, while WHO's Western Pacific region reported a 29 per cent rise largely fuelled by the Philippines, Van Kerkhove said.The eastern Mediterranean region saw cases rise by 8 per cent, while the number of cases reported in the Americas and Africa declined."I do want to mention that it had been about six weeks where we were seeing decreases in deaths," said Van Kerkhove. "And in the last week, we've started to see a slight increase in deaths across the world, and this is to be expected if we are to see increasing cases. But this is also a worrying sign."WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan acknowledged an urge among the public in many places to emerge from pandemic restrictions.He insisted that any easing should coincide with measures such as strict case surveillance and high levels of vaccination, but said vaccines alone would not be enough."I'm afraid we're all trying to grasp at straws. We're trying to find the golden solution: So we just get enough vaccine and we push enough vaccine to people and that's going to take care of it," he said. "I'm sorry, it's not."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-worrying-sign-global-covid-19-deaths-rise-for-first-time-in-6-weeks-who-101616469418647.html
23-03-2021||World||Britain marks 1 year since start of first Covid lockdown||The UK is marking one year since the start of its first coronavirus lockdown, as the government reflects on the best and worst of its response to the pandemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will privately hold a minute’s silence Tuesday for more than 126,000 people who have died from Covid-19 in the UK, the fifth-biggest death toll in the world according to Bloomberg’s Covid-19 tracker.It comes as the country’s health service presses on with a vaccination program that has seen more than half of all adults receive their first dose of the vaccine, by far the fastest of all European countries.For Johnson’s government, the vaccine roll-out is a chance at redemption after a year punctured by indecision over imposing coronavirus restrictions and a faltering start to the UK’s test-and-trace system.“The last 12 months has taken a huge toll on us all, and I offer my sincere condolences to those who have lost loved ones,” Johnson said in an emailed statement. “Today, the anniversary of the first lockdown, is an opportunity to reflect on the past year -- one of the most difficult in our country’s history.”Praising the “great spirit shown by our nation”, he said everyone had played their part including those who had home-schooled their children and stayed at home to prevent the spread of the virus.Third WaveCoronavirus cases in the UK fell fast following a peak in infections that threatened to overwhelm hospitals over the winter, but there are now signs the pandemic is shrinking more slowly.The reproductive rate of the virus, known as the R rate, increased slightly last week to between 0.6 and 0.9. The rate represents the average number of people that each positive case goes on to infect: anything above 1 means the virus is spreading.As Covid-19 infections begin to soar once again in a number of European countries, Johnson warned on Monday that the U.K. would feel the effects of this “third wave” in “due course.”“When a wave hits our friends, I’m afraid it washes up on our shores as well,” he said in a pooled TV interview.An imminent influx of fresh cases could spell trouble for the government’s “road map” of unlocking restrictions, starting with allowing up to six people -- or two households -- to gather outside from next Monday.Members of Parliament are set to vote on renewing the Coronavirus Act, which was brought in last year to enshrine the first lockdown, on Thursday. But Johnson will face a rebellion from some of his own Conservative colleagues on extending restrictions that they believe cause serious harm to people’s wellbeing and livelihoods.Dr. Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Public Health England, said in a statement: “On this day of reflection many of us will be thinking about those loved ones we have sadly lost this past year.“This virus has left no one untouched, and it has been the most challenging time both personally and professionally that many of us have ever faced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-marks-1-year-since-start-of-first-covid-lockdown-101616468192338.html

Rui Xu, a Westwood Democrat, said the man confronted him and, using an expletive, questioned why he was wearing a face mask. Xu told the Associated Press that the patron also questioned if he was carrying the virus."That's a pretty specific dog whistle at Asian Americans from the last year," Xu told the AP. "Most of the anti-Asian American rhetoric that has happened has had some form of that message."Many members of the Asian American community see the shootings at three Georgia massage parlours and spas that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent, as a reminder of harassment and violence that have been occurring against Asian Americans since Covid-19 entered the country.Moments after the confrontation, Xu said he heard the patron searching for him in the bar, yelling that he was going to "kick his ass."In a post shared over 200 times, Xu said he visited the Russell sports bar after featuring as a guest on a PBS television show based in nearby Bunker Hill. Waitresses apologised to him after the incident and a patron bought him a drink, Xu said. He said people at the bar told him the patron was from out of state."Everybody at the bar who's actually from Russell was amazing and kind and I had a good time," Xu said, adding that he doesn't think where the incident happened is important.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threatened-at-bar-questioned-if-i-was-carrying-the-covid-19-says-asian-american-lawmaker-101616463706912.html
23-03-2021||World||World Meteorological Day 2021: History, theme and significance of the day||World Meteorological Day is observed every year on March 23 to highlight the importance of the role that people and their behaviour play in protecting Earth’s atmosphere. The day also commemorates the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which is an intergovernmental body, on March 23, 1950. According to WMO’s website, the day “showcases the essential contribution of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services to the safety and wellbeing of society.”World Meteorological Day historyThe day is celebrated to mark the establishment of WMO, which has 193 member countries and territories. The organisation originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), the idea of which is rooted in the Vienna International Meteorological Congress 1873. WMO was then established by the ratification of the WMO convention in 1950 after which the organisation became a specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) in 1951. The headquarters of WMO are located in Geneva, Switzerland.World Meteorological Day 2021 themeThe theme of World Meteorological Day 2021 is “The Ocean, Our Climate and Weather.” According to WMO’s website, the theme has been chosen to reflect the organisation’s focus on “connecting the ocean, climate and weather within the Earth System.” The theme has also been chosen as this year marks the starting year of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, which focuses on gathering support for ocean science and understanding the role that ocean science plays in sustainable development.“WMO, as the United Nations specialized agency for climate, weather and water, strives to support understanding the inextricable link between ocean, climate and weather. This helps us understand the world in which we live, including the impacts of climate change, and to help Members to strengthen their ability to keep lives and property safe – reducing the risk of disaster – and to maintain viable economies,” WMO’s website added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-meteorological-day-history-theme-and-significance-of-the-day-101616467536898.html
23-03-2021||World||Germany extends coronavirus lockdown till mid-April as cases rise||Germany extended its lockdown measures by another month and imposed several new restrictions, including largely shutting down public life over Easter, in an effort to drive down the rate of coronavirus infections.Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the measures early Tuesday after a lengthy video call with the country's 16 state governors, nearly three weeks after the two sides last agreed on a plan paving the way to relax some rules.Since then, infections have increased steadily as the more contagious variant first detected in Britain has become dominant. The restrictions previously set to run through March 28 will now remain in place until April 18.Regions were the weekly number of new infections exceeds 100 per 100,000 residents on three consecutive days will face tougher rules, as agreed at the previous meeting."Unfortunately, we will have to make use of this emergency brake,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin.The weekly infection rate per 100,000 people stood at 107 nationwide on Monday, up from the mid-60s three weeks ago.Officials agreed to largely shut down public life from April 1-3, adding a public holiday and shutting down most stores for the period. Public gatherings will be banned from April 1-5, to encourage people to stay at home.Amid concern over the rise in Germans traveling abroad on holidays, authorities also agreed on a blanket requirement for air travelers to be tested for COVID-19 before boarding a flight to Germany.Drawing up legally watertight rules has proved a headache at times. A court in Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, said Monday it struck down rules requiring people to get appointments to visit shops. It said they violated a requirement that businesses get equal treatment.The state government promptly reinstated the rules, tightening them for some businesses — such as bookshops and garden centers — that were previously exempt.According to Tuesday's agreement, authorities will aim to offer free tests to all students and teachers in German schools, many of which have only recently reopened after months of remote teaching.Merkel said Germany, which had comparatively low deaths during the first phase of the pandemic last spring, has seen "successes but also of setbacks.”The country's vaccination campaign has lagged far behind expectations, with only about 9% of the population receiving at least a first shot and 4% receiving both doses by Sunday.“We don't want our health system to be overloaded,” Merkel said, noting that the new variant has caused severe illness also in younger people who are infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-extends-coronavirus-lockdown-till-mid-april-as-cases-rise-101616466895083.html

He was 65.“After a battle with post-Covid related symptoms, including severe tinnitus, Kent Taylor took his own life,” according to the statement. “Kent battled and fought hard like the former track champion that he was, but the suffering that greatly intensified in recent days became unbearable.”Taylor founded the restaurant chain in 1993 and most recently was its chief executive officer and chairman. During the pandemic, he donated his entire compensation to support the company’s front-line workers, and recently committed to fund a clinical study to help members of the military who also suffer from tinnitus, according to the statement.Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ears even when there’s no external sound. The American Tinnitus Association said the chronic condition is exacerbated by increased stress and anxiety, which are at unprecedented levels due to the pandemic.The Louisville, Kentucky, based company named its president, Jerry Morgan, as the new CEO on Friday.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior US senator from Kentucky, was among several public figures who paid tribute to Taylor, saying he’d built the company “with creativity, grit and a lot of bold risks.””From the cooks to the executives, Kent deeply cared about his team,” McConnell said. ”When the pandemic threw everything into uncertainty last year, there was no question what Kent would do.”Texas Roadhouse shares have tripled since its March low last year, outperforming the gain in the S&P 500 Index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-roadhouse-founder-kent-taylor-dies-by-suicide-after-covid19-101616463496453.html
23-03-2021||World||Police officer among 10 dead in shooting at Colorado grocery store: Cops||A shooting at a Colorado supermarket killed 10 people Monday, including a police officer, and a suspect was in custody, authorities said.Boulder police Chief Maris Herold announced the death toll at a news conference Monday night, fighting back tears.The suspect was getting medical treatment and there was no further threat to the public, authorities said. Officers had escorted a shirtless man with blood running down his leg out of the store in handcuffs but authorities would not say if he was the suspect.The officer who was killed was Eric Talley, 51, who had been with Boulder police since 2010, Herold said.Victims' families were still being notified so their names weren't released, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said.“This is a tragedy and a nightmare for Boulder County, and in response, we have cooperation and assistance from local, state and federal authorities,” Dougherty said.Yamaguchi said police were still investigating and didn't have details on a motive for the shooting at the King Soopers store in Boulder, which is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver and home to the University of Colorado.Dean Schiller told The Associated Press that he had just left the supermarket when he heard gunshots and saw three people lying face down, two in the parking lot and one near the doorway. He said he “couldn’t tell if they were breathing."Video posted on YouTube showed one person on the floor inside the store and two more outside on the ground. What sounds like two gunshots are also heard at the beginning of the video.Law enforcement vehicles and officers massed outside the store, including SWAT teams, and at least three helicopters landed on the roof. Some windows at the front of the store were broken.At one point, authorities said over a loudspeaker that the building was surrounded and that “you need to surrender."Sarah Moonshadow told the Denver Post that two shots rang out just after she and her son, Nicolas Edwards, finished buying strawberries. She said she told her son to get down and then “we just ran.”Once they got outside, she said they saw a body in the parking lot. Edwards said police were speeding into the lot and pulled up next to the body.“I knew we couldn’t do anything for the guy,” he said. “We had to go.”James Bentz told the Post that he was in the meat section when he heard what he thought was a misfire, then a series of pops.“I was then at the front of a stampede,” he said.Bentz said he jumped off a loading dock out back to escape and that younger people were helping older people off of it.One person was taken from the shooting scene to Foothills Hospital in Boulder, said Rich Sheehan, spokesman for Boulder Community Health, which operates the hospital.Colorado Gov. Jared Polis tweeted a statement that his “heart is breaking as we watch this unspeakable event unfold in our Boulder community."Police had told people to shelter in place amid a report of an “armed, dangerous individual” about 3 miles (5 kilometers) away from the grocery store but said at the news conference later that it wasn't related to the shooting.The FBI said it’s helping in the investigation at the request of police.White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting.In a statement, the King Soopers chain offered “thoughts, prayers and support to our associates, customers, and the first responders who so bravely responded to this tragic situation. We will continue to cooperate with local law enforcement and our store will remain closed during the police investigation.”Kevin Daly, owner of Under the Sun Eatery and Pizzeria Restaurant a block or so from the supermarket, said he was in his shop when he saw police cars arriving and shoppers running from the grocery store. He said he took in several people to keep them warm, and others boarded a bus provided by Boulder police and were taken away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-officer-among-several-dead-in-shooting-at-colorado-grocery-store-cops-101616462948029.html

The charity has been raising money to support African families who were financially impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.According to Valuables, 95 per cent of the proceeds from the sale price go to the tweet's original creator while 5 per cent go to the platform.Dorsey tweeted the Bitcoin receipt on Monday afternoon, and said the funds were sent to the charity."Incredible - huge thanks @jack and @sinaEstavi - looking forward to getting this $ into recipients' hands soon," Give Directly tweeted following Dorsey's announcement.NFTs have recently swept the online collecting world. A digital artwork by artist Beeple sold for USD 69.4 million in an online auction by a British auction house earlier this month, with an NFT as a guarantee of its authenticity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-sells-nft-of-first-tweet-for-2-9-million-101616460831263.html
23-03-2021||World||On Covid-19 lockdown anniversary, Boris Johnson hails Britain's 'great spirit'||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday praised the "great spirit" shown by Britain in tackling Covid-19, marking a year since the first lockdown by saying everyone's efforts had allowed the country to start "on the cautious road" to easing restrictions.With Britain suffering one of the highest death tolls from the coronavirus, Johnson has come under fire for moving too slowly last year to tackle the first and second waves of the pandemic, with some accusing him of prioritising the economy over health.But since then, his government has overseen a successful vaccine rollout, reaching more than half of the adult population, and a cautious approach to easing the latest lockdown, prompting a recovery for him in opinion polls."Today, the anniversary of the first lockdown, is an opportunity to reflect on the past year – one of the most difficult in our country's history," Johnson said in a statement."We should also remember the great spirit shown by our nation over this past year. ... It's because of every person in this country that lives have been saved, our NHS (National Health Service) was protected, and we have started on our cautious road to easing restrictions once and for all."On March 23 last year, Johnson ordered the first lockdown to try to stem the spread of the coronavirus, telling Britain that people should "stay at home", part of a slogan on saving lives that has become a common refrain since then.Last month, he unveiled a roadmap to ease England's lockdown, starting with the reopening of schools two weeks ago and ending on June 21 at the earliest when most of the restrictions will be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-covid-19-lockdown-anniversary-boris-johnson-hails-britain-s-great-spirit-101616460568200.html
23-03-2021||World||'Willing to work hand in hand': China boosts North Korea, Russia ties after US Talks||China is looking to boost ties with North Korea and Russia following a contentious meeting with US officials in Alaska last week.“We are willing to work hand in hand with North Korean comrades to maintain, consolidate and develop China-North Korean relations,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency, citing verbal messages delivered on behalf of Chinese President Xi Jinping.The messages come after senior US diplomats visited Japan and South Korea before the meeting with their Chinese peers, as Washington seeks to shore up its alliances in Asia. US President Joe Biden has said he wants to work with “like-minded countries” to forge a common approach to China.Beijing may also be taking stock of its own allies, with a visit from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov this week.In an interview with media outlets including China Global Television Network, Xi called for cooperation between Russia and China in response to hegemony pursued by some Western countries led by the U.S. Lavrov also promoted settlement of deals in currencies that can replace the U.S. dollar and help reduce risks posed by sanctions.Xi reiterated that China is willing to work with North Korea and other related parties to preserve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, according to Xinhua. The remarks were delivered by Song Tao, a senior Chinese diplomat, and Ri Ryong Nam, North Korea’s new ambassador to China, during a meeting on Monday.In Seoul last week before meeting Chinese officials, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Biden’s approach toward North Korea was still under review and stressed China’s “clear self-interest” in getting its neighbor and Cold War ally back to the table.China is North Korea’s biggest benefactor, for years providing a lifeline that helped keep its neighbor’s struggling economy afloat. Beijing is also a key player for managing the effectiveness of the global sanctions regime put in place to punish Kim Jong Un for his test of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.Kim sent a verbal message to Xi as part of their strategic communication, the official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday. Kim “stressed the need to strengthen the unity and cooperation between the two parties and two countries to cope with the hostile forces’ all-round challenges and obstructive moves,” KCNA said, in reference to what Pyongyang sees as the threat posed by the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/willing-to-work-hand-in-hand-china-boosts-north-korea-russia-ties-after-us-talks-101616460181394.html
23-03-2021||World||Joe Biden starts big infrastructure bet with US far behind China||President Joe Biden is betting that a multitrillion-dollar economic plan centered around infrastructure spending will do more than bolster an American economy hammered by the coronavirus pandemic: It will ensure his country’s competitiveness against China for decades to come.“If we don’t get moving, they’re going to eat our lunch,” Biden told lawmakers in a pitch for his proposal shortly after his call last month with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “We just have to step up.”Biden’s advisers will present him this week with a detailed proposal for a plan whose cost could touch $3 trillion, according to three people familiar with the deliberations. Infrastructure and climate change have long been described as key efforts in the pending program, and the new details show the administration is eyeing some $400 billion in so-called green spending, according to one of the people.Even if he gets all he asks for, catching up to China on infrastructure won’t be easy.While US officials have been promising an approaching “infrastructure week” since the early days of the Trump administration, China has been plowing ahead for years. In February, Xi’s government set out a 15-year plan for the country’s transportation network. It pledges to extend China’s rail network from 146,300 kilometers (91,000 miles) in 2020 to about 200,000 kilometers by 2035 -- enough to circle the equator more than five times.The plan also calls for adding 162 new civilian airports, after Beijing’s new $11 billion international airport opened last year.In contrast, the US has built just one major airport -- Denver international -- since the mid-1990s. And on rail, even a bipartisan effort to build the long-sought “Gateway” rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey -- part of the busiest rail line in the US -- has foundered in recent years.China’s infrastructure efforts aren’t limited to China. Since Xi introducing the so-called Belt and Road initiative in 2013, the World Bank estimated China has built or pledged to construct $575 billion in energy plants, railways, roads, ports and other projects across the globe from Sri Lanka to Greece. Morgan Stanley in 2018 said total spending on the effort could reach $1.3 trillion by 2027.Biden is hoping to begin leveling the playing field. If he can win support for his plan in a deeply divided Congress, there’s certainly no shortage of projects to work on.The U.S. got an early start on all its infrastructure, but much of it is now aging or decrepit. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers 2021 Infrastructure Report Card, 43% of U.S. public roadways are in poor or mediocre condition, and 42% of the nation’s 617,000 bridges are at least 50 years old. About 7.5% of them are considered structurally deficient.“The United States is entering what could be a decades-long competition in which economic and technological power will matter just as much, if not more, than military might,” Jonathan Hillman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last month. “Starting this race with decaying infrastructure is like lining up for a marathon with a broken ankle.”The engineering report doesn’t go into another challenge that may have a defining imprint on competitiveness between the U.S. and China: technology infrastructure.The US is still mired in domestic political debates about how to get broadband technology rolled out across the nation. More than a third of Americans in rural areas still lack high-speed access, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Money to help close that gap is expected to be part of any new U.S. proposal.Rail FailuresDespite Biden’s impulse to push for big spending, the track record of recent presidents suggest he’s likely to fall short.Donald Trump, a real estate developer who was touted as a potential “builder president” upon his arrival in Washington, proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan -- funded mostly by private investment -- that never won approval.President Barack Obama vowed to bet big on high-speed rail as a tool to help the U.S. emerge from the 2008 financial crisis. He spoke frequently in his first term about developing a rail network that could grow to rival the interstate highway system and included $8 billion in his 2009 economic stimulus package for high-speed rail lines. But Republican governors in states like Ohio, Wisconsin and Florida rejected the money, and a decade later a line in California that most of the rejected money was funneled to is still only in its early stages.“Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,” Obama said in 2011 when reflecting on his struggles to harness infrastructure projects to jump-start the economy.China’s ExampleMeanwhile, China has had access to cheaper labor, engineering prowess and experience in massive infrastructure projects, both at home and abroad. It also had the benefit of building much of its infrastructure from scratch over the past few decades as its economy boomed, with little fiscal scrutiny and fewer protections for workers, the environment or property rights.The government has long relied on big infrastructure spending to boost the domestic economy and, more recently, to generate international support through investing or providing aid overseas.Read more: China Bets $600 Billion on Infrastructure to Revive GrowthThat spending helped insulate China’s economy from the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, and again limited the decline in growth after the coronavirus pandemic hit last year. However, the reliance on building roads, railways and airports to support growth also cause a spike in debt, with some of that money funneled into unnecessary infrastructure and uneconomic boondoggle developments.The World Bank estimated in 2019 that only one-sixth of China’s high-speed rail lines made enough money to cover their operating costs and service the construction debts. That problem is likely to increase with the plan to build even more, as the newer lines will be mostly in poorer and less densely-populated parts of the country where there’s less demand.Xi also faces a set of financial and demographic challenges that his government will struggle to address as the population ages and the country’s previous “one child” policy means there aren’t as many workers to replace retirees.“In the coming years, the country will be traveling a demographic downslope with an increasingly heavy debt burden and tough prospects for improving the productivity of its workers,” said Ryan Hass, a former China director on the US National Security Council and author of “Stronger: Adapting America’s China Strategy in an Age of Competitive Interdependence.”That may help give Biden an opening to fend off Beijing’s bid to dominate the 21st century.“If the United States makes progress in fixing some of its own problems, including its infrastructure deficit, it will remain highly competitive against any challenger, including China,” Hass said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-starts-big-infrastructure-bet-with-us-far-behind-china-101616459663478.html

Turkey's defence ministry said it asked Russia to secure an immediate halt to the attacks.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the recent wave of attacks in northwest Syria, which have killed and injured dozens of civilians, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said on Monday.The UN chief reiterated his call for a nationwide ceasefire, citing the aerial attacks near the border as well as artillery strikes on a hospital in western Aleppo Governorate on March 21, reports of shelling of a residential neighbourhood in Aleppo city causing civilian casualties, and airstrikes close to densely populated areas with camps for displaced people, Haq said.Mark Cutts, UN deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, called the attacks "extremely worrying" because they endangered the lives of the area's most vulnerable population.The US condemned the attacks and called for a nationwide ceasefire. In a statement on Monday, it said the strikes near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey had put access to much-needed assistance at risk.The area along the border with Turkey in rebel-held northwestern Syria had been considered one of the safest spots in the conflict-stricken region, and had attracted aid groups who located their offices and warehouses there.The rebel-held enclave divided between Idlib and Aleppo provinces is home to more than 2.7 million displaced people, mostly living in camps and temporary shelters, many having escaped repeated rounds of military offensives and fighting."Many of the camps are in that area, about a million people in camps around that area. They are highly vulnerable when airstrikes and shelling happen," Cutts told The Associated Press."It is also the area where many of the humanitarian organisations have offices and warehouses. They put their warehouses and offices there thinking that was the safest part of Idlib. So when that starts coming under attack that is extremely worrying."Turkey and Russia support rival parties in Syria's 10-year conflict. The countries reached a ceasefire deal last March that stopped a Russian-backed government offensive on Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in war-torn Syria.Opposition activists claimed that Russian warplanes carried out the attacks near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey late Sunday, hours after government artillery shells hit a major hospital in Atareb, another rebel-controlled town. Six patients, including a 10-year-old child, were killed. The medical staff was wounded, forcing the facility to shut its doors.The Bab al-Hawa border crossing is the main point from which international aid is brought to rebel-held parts of northwest Syria.The crossing "remains the only UN-authorised humanitarian border crossing in Syria and remains the most efficient and effective way to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance" every month to residents of the area, US State Department spokesman Ned Price said.Cutts called the attack on the hospital "really horrific", adding that the same facility came under attack years before, forcing it to go underground to continue to operate.Idlib-based journalist Salwa Abdul-Rahman said one of the strikes hit an area near the town of Sarmada, setting afire trucks used by aid workers to distribute assistance."The targeted locations were civilian with no military presence," she said.One person was killed in the strikes, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, and the opposition's Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets.The civil defense said the strikes also targeted a cement factory.An AP video from the area showed about a dozen trucks on fire as civil defence members sprayed them with water.Turkey's defence ministry blamed the Syrian government forces for the attack, saying it left several people wounded.Cutts said the year-old ceasefire has held in some parts but not everywhere, saying that shelling in some areas has happened every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airstrikes-on-northwest-syria-near-turkey-border-area-worrying-says-un-official-101616459596223.html
23-03-2021||World||These 'virus hunters' hope to stop the next pandemic by catching bats||Researchers wearing headlamps and protective suits race to untangle the claws and wings of bats caught up in a big net after dark in the Philippine province of Laguna.The tiny animals are carefully placed in cloth bags to be taken away, measured and swabbed, with details logged and saliva and faecal matter collected for analysis before they are returned to the wild.The researchers call themselves the "virus hunters", tasked with catching thousands of bats to develop a simulation model they hope will help the world avoid a pandemic similar to Covid-19, which has killed nearly 2.8 million people.(Open https://reut.rs/2OYdIHh in an external browser to see a picture story on the Philippine bat "virus hunters".)The Japanese-funded model will be developed over the next three years by the University of the Philippines Los Banos, which hopes the bats will help in predicting the dynamics of a coronavirus by analysing factors such as climate, temperature and ease of spread, to humans included."What we're trying to look into are other strains of coronavirus that have the potential to jump to humans," said ecologist Phillip Alviola, the leader of the group, who has studied bat viruses for more than a decade."If we know the virus itself and we know where it came from, we know how to isolate that virus geographically."Beyond work in the laboratory, the research requires lengthy field trips, involving traipsing for hours through thick rainforest and precarious night hikes on mountains covered in rocks, tree roots, mud and moss.The group also targets bat roosts in buildings, setting up mist nets before dusk to catch bats and extract samples by the light of torches.Each bat is held steady by the head as researchers insert tiny swabs into their mouths and record wingspans with plastic rulers, to try and see which of the more than 1,300 species and 20 families of bats are most susceptible to infections and why.DEVASTATING IMPACTResearchers wear protective suits, masks and gloves when in contact with the bats, as a precaution against catching viruses."It's really scary these days," said Edison Cosico, who is assisting Alviola. "You never know if the bat is already a carrier."What we're after is finding out if there are any more viruses from bats that can be transmitted to humans. We'll never know if the next one is just like COVID."The bulk of those caught are horseshoe bats known to harbour coronaviruses, including the closest known relative of the novel coronavirus.Horseshoe bats figure in two of the scenarios of World Health Organization experts investigating the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.Host species, such as bats, usually display no symptoms of the pathogens, although they can be devastating if transmitted to humans or other animals.Deadly viruses to have originated from bats include Ebola and other coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).Humans' exposure and closer interaction with wildlife meant the risk of disease transmission was now higher than ever, said bat ecologist Kirk Taray."By having baseline data on the nature and occurrence of the potentially zoonotic virus in bats, we can somehow predict possible outbreaks."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-virus-hunters-hope-to-stop-the-next-pandemic-by-catching-bats-101616458313363.html

The last meeting of the permanent Indus commission was held in Lahore in August 2018.Last month, the Indian and Pakistani militaries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, raising hopes for further improvements in bilateral ties. The decision to adhere to the truce on the volatile LoC was the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two countries.An eight-member delegation of Pakistan’s Commission on Indus Waters will leave for New Delhi on Monday for a two-day meeting of the Permanent Commission on Indus Waters to discuss with their Indian counterparts Pakistan’s objections to the design of Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydroelectric plants/projects and other issues.The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. The last meeting took place in August 2018 in Lahore. Officials said the gap between the two meetings was caused by the coronavirus pandemic. After the 2018 meeting, a Pakistani delegation was invited by India to inspect the sites of the hydroelectric projects being constructed by India on Pakistani rivers.Recent comments by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa about improving ties with India have also helped clear the environment, though India has said the onus is on Pakistan for creating an atmosphere conducive to a meaningful dialogue.During the meeting of the Indus commission, the Pakistani side is also expected to seek information on new projects planned by India on western rivers, and flood data arrangements for the flood season.The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, which was brokered by the World Bank, is one of the most durable agreements between India and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-delegation-on-indus-water-in-india-to-hold-talks-101616453429111.html

Hopes of a less hardline response from the US government has encouraged some migrants to make the journey north.US officials are struggling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said last month it was opening the temporary facility in Donna to provide processing capacity for the heavily trafficked Rio Grande Valley sector while a permanent center in McAllen was being renovated. It said at the time that the Donna facility was expected to provide ample areas for eating and sleeping.In one photo, people of all ages, including children, are shown sitting on the floor. With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, all appear to be wearing masks but they are crowded close together.In others, rows of people are seen lying down next to each other on mats and covered in emergency blankets.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for physical distancing during the pandemic is at least 6 ft to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.The CBP did not immediately reply to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inside-border-facility-in-texas-migrants-crowd-together-new-photos-show-101616442888552.html

But they have stymied most efforts by outsiders to decide for themselves.Officials barred nonprofit lawyers who conduct oversight from entering a Border Patrol tent where thousands of children and teenagers are detained. And federal agencies have refused or ignored dozens of requests from the media for access to detention sites. Such access was granted several times by the administration of President Donald Trump, whose restrictive immigration approach Biden vowed to reverse.The new president faces growing criticism for the apparent secrecy at the border, including from fellow Democrats.Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Monday “the administration has a commitment to transparency to make sure that the news media gets the chance to report on every aspect of what’s happening at the border.”White House press secretary Jen Psaki added that the White House was working with homeland security officials and the Health and Human Services Department to “finalize details” and that she hoped to have an update in the “coming days.”Axios on Monday first published a series of photos taken inside the largest Border Patrol detention center, a sprawling tent facility in the South Texas city of Donna. The photos were released by Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat from the border city of Laredo.Cuellar said he released the photos in part because the administration has refused media access to the Donna tent. He said he also wanted to draw attention to the extreme challenges that border agents face in watching so many children, sometimes for a week or longer despite the Border Patrol's three-day limit on detaining minors.“We ought to take care of those kids like they’re our own kids,” Cuellar said.The White House has prided itself on its methodical rollout of policy during its first 50-plus days but West Wing aides privately acknowledge they were caught off guard by the surge of migrants at the border and the resulting media furor.Republican lawmakers largely sat out the debate over administration’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill. While none of them voted for the package, their opposition was muted and they instead focused on culture war issues, like the debate over racial stereotypes in some Dr. Seuss books, rather than a bill that was broadly popular with GOP voters.But the GOP has grabbed on to the border situation with both hands, reviving the issue that was key to propelling Trump to the top of the Republican field in 2016. In 2018, the Trump administration detained hundreds of children in many of the same facilities being used now after separating them from their parents. The following year, hundreds of families and children detained at one West Texas border station went days without adequate food, water, or soap.Biden has kept in place a Trump-era public health order and expelled thousands of immigrant adults and families, but he declined to expel immigrant children without a parent after a federal appeals court in January cleared the way for him to do so. He also moved to speed up the reunification of hundreds of separated immigrant families.“What Trump did was horrible,” Cuellar said. “These pictures show you that even under our best intentions, and the Biden administration has the best intentions, it’s still very difficult.”Cuellar said the White House needs to work more with Mexico and Central America to prevent people from leaving their home countries. The White House said Monday that key officials would go this week to Mexico and Guatemala.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who visited a facility in El Paso, Texas, last week, told NPR, “We want to make sure that the press has access to hold the administration accountable.”The Associated Press has requested access to border facilities for more than a month. Reporters first asked Health and Human Services on Feb. 4 to allow entry into a surge facility re-opened at Carrizo Springs, Texas, holding hundreds of teenagers. And they have asked Homeland Security officials for access at least seven times to Border Patrol facilities, with no response. The AP has also petitioned Psaki to open border facilities.Border agencies under Trump allowed limited media tours of both Homeland Security and Health and Human Services facilities. Several of those visits revealed troubling conditions inside, including the detention of large numbers of children as young as 5 separated from their parents.Under Biden, the agencies also have denied full access to nonprofit lawyers who conduct oversight of facilities where children are detained. Those oversight visits occur under a federal court settlement.When lawyers this month visited the Border Patrol tent at Donna, where thousands of children are now detained, agents refused to let them inside and the Justice Department said they were not entitled to gain access. The lawyers were forced to interview children outside the tent. The Justice Department declined to comment.The administration is rushing to open more space to get roughly 5,000 children out of Border Patrol detention and into Health and Human Services facilities that are better suited for youth. It has also tried to expedite the releases of children in HHS custody to parents and other sponsors in the US. But border agents continue to apprehend far more children daily than HHS is releasing, even though more than 40% of youths in the system have a parent or legal guardian who could take them.Meanwhile, the administration is seeing its emergency facilities for immigrant children approach capacity almost as quickly as it can open them. The downtown Dallas convention center has 1,500 teenagers less than a week after opening and is expected to take in 500 more teens Monday, according to HHS. Its current capacity is 2,300 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immigrant-kids-sleeping-under-foil-blanket-highlight-biden-s-border-secrecy-101616443209403.html
