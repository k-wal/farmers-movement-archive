Chinese judicial organs handle cases independently in accordance with the law and fully guarantee the lawful rights of the individuals concerned,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said when asked to comment on the case.“China always handles relevant matters including consular notification in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Consular Agreement between China and Canada as well as Chinese laws and regulations,” he said.Earlier this week, China’s Xinhua news agency cited unidentified Chinese authorities as saying Kovrig violated Chinese laws by acting as a spy and stealing state secrets with the help of Spavor, linking the two cases.“Kovrig was accused of using an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig,” a state media report said.Canada’s foreign minister, Marc Garneau, on Wednesday said, “The arbitrary detention of Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor is a top priority for the government of Canada and we continue to work tirelessly to secure their immediate release.”“We believe these detentions are arbitrary, and remain deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding these proceedings,” Garneau said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-wraps-up-canadian-s-espionage-trial-in-two-hours-101616177551535.html

19-03-2021||World||Europe becomes first region to surpass 1 million Covid-19 deaths: Report||Coronavirus-related deaths in the European region surpassed 1 million on Friday as vaccination efforts attempt to keep up with new variants causing a third wave of infections that could once again overwhelm hospitals.Since the pandemic began, at least 37,221,978 infections and 1,000,062 deaths were reported in the European region, according to a Reuters tallyThe region, which includes 51 countries, has about 35.5% of all coronavirus deaths and 30.5% of all cases in the world. The region includes Russia, the United Kingdom, the 27 members of the European Union and other countries. The European region has administered about 12 vaccine shots for every 100 people, behind the United States which has administered about 34 doses per 100 people, according to figures from Our World in Data. Israel leads the world in vaccination efforts with about 110 shots given for every 100 individuals. Some vaccines require two doses.With the number of EU Covid-19 related deaths above 550,000 and less than a tenth of the population inoculated, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the situation was worsening. "We see the crest of a third wave forming in member states, and we know that we need to accelerate the vaccination rates."On Wednesday, the European Union threatened to ban exports of Covid-19 vaccines to Britain to safeguard scarce doses for its own citizens.The number of infections in Europe have started picking up, with France recently seeing its biggest one-day jump in cases since November. The region is currently reporting a million new cases about every six days.As Germany plans to lift the lockdown and revive its economy, an expert at the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Tuesday that the number of infections is rising exponentially, with the country entering a third wave of the pandemic.As the European Union looks to meet its summer target of inoculating 70% of adults, at least 13 countries in the bloc have suspended or delayed using AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after reports of blood coagulation in people who have received the shot.Countries in eastern Europe, including Russia, remain the worst-affected based on the total number of cases and deaths.Russia has the highest total number of Covid infections, with over 4.4 million or nearly 12% of all the cases in the region. The country has one of the highest Covid-19 fatality rates in the world on a per capita basis, with about 153 deaths per 100,0000 residents, behind the United States with 164 deaths for every 100,000 people.While the official death toll in Russia stands at 94,267, at least 221,534 have perished due to the disease, according to a Reuters calculation which includes deaths reported by the country’s Rosstat statistics agency.Italy became the third country in Europe to exceed more than 100,000 deaths last week. Prime Minister Mario Draghi warned that the situation would worsen again with a jump in hospitalizations.The World Health Organization appealed to the governments not to pause vaccination campaigns, while the European Medicines Agency has said that the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than the number seen in the general population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-becomes-first-region-to-surpass-1-million-covid-19-deaths-report-101616173303712.html
19-03-2021||World||Georgia spa shooting victims ID'd as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris head to Atlanta||The names of four additional victims in the Atlanta-area massage businesses shootings have been released, hours before President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris arrive in Atlanta to meet with Asian American community leaders.The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office said Friday that the four victims at two Atlanta businesses are Soon C. Park, 74; Hyun J. Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong A. Yue, 63. Family members identified Grant by her maiden name, Hyun Jung Kim.The medical examiner performed autopsies on all four victims Wednesday, saying all but Suncha Kim died Tuesday from gunshots to the head. She died from a gunshot to the chest.Three of the women died at the Gold Spa in Atlanta, while the fourth woman died across the street at Aromatherapy Spa. The medical examiner didn’t immediately say which woman died at Aromatherapy.A 21-year-old white man, Robert Aaron Long, is charged with murder in Tuesday’s slayings. He’s also accused of killing four people and wounding a fifth person at Youngs Asian Massage Parlor near Woodstock, in Atlanta’s northwestern suburbs.Cherokee County authorities earlier identified the dead there as Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Youngs.Police continue to investigate the deadly shootings, with Deputy Atlanta Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. saying Thursday that “nothing is off the table” in his department's inquiry, including whether the slayings were a hate crime.The Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office said it also was investigating whether the killings were hate crimes.Georgia lawmakers last year passed a hate crimes law that allows additional penalties to be imposed for certain offenses when motivated by a victim’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender or disability. A hate crime is not a standalone crime under the law, but it can be used to add time to a sentence once someone is convicted of another crime.Investigators believe Long had previously visited two of the Atlanta massage parlors where four of the women were killed, Hampton said.Long told police that the attacks were not racially motivated. He claimed to have a sex addiction, and authorities said he apparently lashed out at what he saw as sources of temptation.Crabapple First Baptist Church, where Long was an active member, issued a statement Friday saying it was seeking to remove Long from membership, saying “we can no longer affirm that he is truly a regenerate believer in Jesus Christ.”The church said its teaching does not condone violence against Asian Americans or women and it's improper to view women as somehow responsible for male sexual urges.“Each person is responsible for his or her own sin,” the church said. “In this case, the shooter is solely responsible for his heinous actions, not the victims who were targeted.”Long’s statements spurred outrage and widespread skepticism in the Asian American community, which has increasingly been targeted for violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Jay Baker also drew criticism for saying Long had “a really bad day” and “this is what he did.”Sheriff Frank Reynolds released a statement Thursday acknowledging that some of Baker’s comments stirred “much debate and anger” and said the agency regrets any “heartache” caused by his words. Baker was replaced Thursday as spokesman for the investigation.Long's lawyer, J. Daran Burns, issued a statement Thursday offering condolences to the victims’ families and saying he is working on Long’s behalf “to investigate the facts and circumstances” surrounding the slayings.Long waived his right to an initial hearing in Cherokee County Magistrate Court.Biden and Harris had already been scheduled to travel to Atlanta to tout the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill, but the trip took on new meaning after the shootings. The visit also comes amid an intense debate over voting rights in Georgia.Biden and Harris, the first vice president of Asian descent, will instead meet with Asian American leaders to discuss threats against the community, meet with other local leaders and visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for an update on the pandemic.Also Thursday, Biden directed that flags be flown at half-staff through sunset Monday in honor of the dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-spa-shooting-victims-id-d-as-joe-biden-kamala-harris-head-to-atlanta-101616172424517.html

Most countries view the settlements as illegal under international law.Israel disputes this, citing security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinian-killed-by-israeli-troops-during-stone-throwing-clashes-report-101616171468905.html
19-03-2021||World||WHO gives nod to AstraZeneca vaccine and its 'tremendous potential'||The World Health Organization's vaccine safety panel said on Friday that available data from AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot do not point to any overall increase in clotting conditions but it would continue to monitor for any adverse effects."The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine (including Covishield) continues to have a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world," the WHO's global advisory committee on vaccine safety said in a statement.Covishield refers to AstraZeneca vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India.The WHO panel of 12 independent experts, who met virtually on Tuesday and on Thursday, reviewed safety data from Europe, the United Kingdom, India, and WHO's global database."While very rare and unique thromboembolic events in combination with thrombocytopenia, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), have also been reported following vaccination with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Europe, it is not certain that they have been caused by vaccination," it said.Europe was pushing to get its vaccination drive back on track on Friday after European and British regulators had also said the benefits of AstraZeneca's shot outweighed risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-panel-gives-nod-to-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-has-tremendous-potential-101616170685798.html

19-03-2021||World||US charges 4 Proud Boys members with conspiring to impede Congress on January 6||A federal grand jury has charged four members of the far-right Proud Boys with conspiring to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory, according to a new superseding indictment unsealed on Friday.The indictment alleges that Ethan Nordean of Washington, Joseph Biggs of Florida, Zachary Rehl of Pennsylvania and Charles Donohoe of North Carolina conspired to encourage members of the group to attend the Stop the Steal protest in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6.It also says they worked to obtain paramilitary equipment used for the attack on the US Capitol, dismantled metal barriers set up to protect the building, and communicated using handheld radios and encrypted messaging applications.All four defendants are the leaders of Proud Boys chapters in their respective states, the indictment says.The indictment also alleges that they made their intentions clear as far back as November, with Biggs declaring in a social media post on Nov. 5, threatening war if the election was stolen from then-President Donald Trump, who lost the vote.Later that month, on Nov. 27, Nordean declared: "We tried playing nice and by the rules, now you will deal with the monster you created."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-4-proud-boys-members-with-conspiring-to-impede-congress-on-january-6-101616168469587.html
19-03-2021||World||India, Australia to hold key trilateral meetings in April, Indo-Pacific on agenda||Members of the Quad are moving forward with their agenda for ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific by working with other like-minded countries, with India and Australia set to hold two key trilateral ministerial meetings in New Delhi next month. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and Australian foreign minister Marise Payne will hold separate meetings with their French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian and Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi on the margins of the annual Raisina Dialogue during April 13-15, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. These meetings are expected to focus on issues such as maritime security and collaborating on shared challenges across the region, the people said. France is seen as a natural fit for working with the Quad as it has 1.5 million citizens on island territories within the Indo-Pacific, and 93% its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of more than 11 million sq km is also within the region. Work on arranging the India-Australia-Indonesia trilateral has been on for more than six months but the meeting was held up because of Jakarta’s sensitivities, one of the people cited above said. The French foreign minister is among the speakers at Raisina Dialogue and the Indonesian foreign minister too is expected to attend the event, a second person said. The trilateral meetings will follow close on the heels of the La Pérouse exercise in the Bay of Bengal during April 4-7, which will see the French Navy joining the navies of India, Australia, Japan and the US – the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad. India will deploy frontline warships and P-8I maritime patrol aircraft for what is being dubbed as a “Quad-plus France” manoeuvre, and the five countries will showcase their naval strength and commitment to freedom of navigation by practising complex drills. At the same time, work has begun on implementing the Quad Vaccine Partnership, which was seen as the most significant outcome of the first virtual Quad leaders’ summit on March 12 and envisages the production of one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 for developing countries. The people said the Quad members are keen on production of vaccines beginning at Indian facilities as early as the second quarter of 2021 though several issues are still being addressed by the four countries. Under the partnership, vaccines developed by the US will be made in India with funding from the US and Japan, while Australia will provide “last mile” delivery support with focus on Southeast Asia. “A lot depends on India’s manufacturing capacity, given the demands on Indian manufacturers to fulfil both the demands of the domestic inoculation programme and commercial supplies and grants for foreign countries,” the first person cited above said. “There could be issues such as intellectual property rights but they can be addressed by the four countries working together,” the person added. In a media briefing after the Quad Summit, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had said a “bridging arrangement” will be needed for manufacturing US-developed vaccines in India, including trials, tests and authorisation for doses to be certified as fit for export. This issue is being looked at by the Quad vaccine experts group, one of three working groups formed during the summit. It is believed the four members of Quad are keen on progress on vaccines before the leaders hold their first in-person meeting. Efforts are currently on to schedule this meeting on the margins of the G7 Summit to be hosted by the UK in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the G7 Summit. Australia was chosen for logistics support for vaccine delivery as it has already created an extensive network with an existing commitment of $407 million for regional vaccine access and health security to Pacific Island countries. Australia will contribute an additional $77 million for providing vaccines and delivery support in Southeast Asia. The other crucial working group formed during the Quad summit – the critical and emerging technology working group – will focus on collaboration on issues such as 5G, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and cyber-security. This will include both setting of standards and ensuring such cutting edge technologies aren’t misused by state actors, the people said. “We’ve seen how such technologies can be misused during the US presidential elections and the effort will be to prevent such activities,” the first person cited above said. The issue of rare earth metals too figured at the Quad Summit, and Australia, which has the world’s sixth largest reserves of these materials, is working closely with India and US to address China’s dominance in supplying these critical elements to makers of everything from smartphones to high-performance motors and batteries for electric vehicles. Rare earths are critical for India’s plans to become a leader in electric vehicles and Australia will soon conduct a demand-supply assessment for India, after having completed a similar exercise for the US, the people said. Though the joint statement issued after the Quad Summit made no direct reference to China, the people acknowledged that the impact of China’s assertive actions in the area ranging from the East and South China Seas to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) figured prominently in the deliberations by the four leaders. US President Joe Biden set the tone for these discussions with his unusually candid observations on China, the people added. Immediately after the Quad Summit, another person familiar with the deliberations had said that the four leaders discussed India’s military standoff with China along the LAC, and the three other members had a “sympathetic view” towards New Delhi on the issue. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the eventual outcome of the ongoing meeting of senior US-China officials in Alaska could have an impact on the workings of the Quad. “Quad’s future, which seemed bright after the summit, will partly depend on eventual dynamics between the US and China. It is still early days and the first session of the meeting in Alaska didn’t go well. The outcome is awaited,” he said. “Within Asean, privately the governments are reportedly happy with the Quad’s vaccine initiative as there is a deficit in access to vaccines and a trust deficit where Chinese vaccines are concerned. So they are interested in the vaccine partnership, but there are also some critics and dissenters, who are looking negatively at the vaccine initiative,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-australia-to-hold-key-trilateral-meetings-in-april-indo-pacific-on-agenda-101616169025654.html
19-03-2021||World||Switzerland postpones plan to lift Covid-19 curbs||Switzerland has postponed plans to relax its COVID-19 restrictions, the government said on Friday, citing increasing coronavirus cases and insufficient progress on vaccinations.Switzerland had planned to allow outdoor events like football matches and concerts with up to 150 people from Monday as well as allowing restaurants to open terraces to outdoor diners, but instead opted for a more cautious approach as neighbouring France and Germany also rein in reopening."The risk of an uncontrolled increase in the number of cases is currently too great for further openings," the government said on Friday. "In addition, too few people have yet been vaccinated to prevent a sharp rise in hospitalizations."The number of coronavirus cases in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein rose by 1,750 on Thursday, well above the seven-day average of 1,285 cases.Currently, infections are expected to double every three to four weeks, the government said, warning new variants of COVID-19 make up to 80% of the new cases."We've known for a while that they aren't merely more infectious, but also more dangerous," Health Minister Alain Berset said at a press conference. "This is not the moment we'd hoped for."The government did relax restrictions on indoor meetings for families and friends, up to 10 people from five previously, ahead of Easter.Torn between public fatigue and warnings from public health experts about reopening too quickly, the government has forged a middle path that is often less strict than neighbouring countries' approaches.It has unveiled a 1 billion Swiss franc ($1.07 billion) plan to offer free coronavirus tests for all residents, while grappling with shortages of vaccines it needs for its goal to inoculate all who wish by summer.Shops, museums, and libraries reopened this month and sporting and cultural activities for youngsters resumed. Schools and many ski lifts are open, but restaurants and cultural venues remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-postpones-plan-to-lift-covid-19-curbs-101616168264387.html

The vaccine was approved for emergency use in India in January and Zimbabwe cleared it early this month."Conditional permission has been granted for emergency use authorisation," Nepal's Department of Drug Administration said in a statement.Wedged between India and China, the Himalayan country has already received more than 2.3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India, including 1 million doses as a gift.China has also promised 800,000 doses of its own vaccine but the time for the delivery of the Chinese shots is unknown.The latest approval comes as authorities in Nepal said they were suspending their vaccination campaign because of a lack of supply.Jageshwar Gautam, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Population, said more than 1.6 million people had received their first shots under the inoculation drive begun in January."We do not have enough vaccine shots to begin our next phase of vaccination of people above 55 years of age," Gautam told Reuters."The campaign will be suspended until we get more supply."Nepal has reported 275,750 cases and 3,016 deaths so far, according to government data.Bharat Biotech says it has received interest in COVAXIN from 40 countries. It has sought or is in the process of seeking emergency approvals in Brazil, the Philippines and Thailand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-becomes-3rd-country-to-give-emergency-nod-to-covaxin-101616168087407.html
19-03-2021||World||US CDC changes 6-foot rule for schools, allowing desks to be closer||The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed its social distancing guidelines for schools Friday, saying students can now sit 3 feet apart in classrooms.The revised Covid-19 recommendations represent a turn away from the 6-foot standard that has forced some schools to remove desks, stagger scheduling and take other steps to keep children away from one another.Three feet “gives school districts greater flexibility to have more students in for a prolonged period of time,” said Kevin Quinn, director of maintenance and facilities at Mundelein High School in suburban Chicago.In recent months, schools in some states have been disregarding the CDC guidelines, using 3 feet as their standard. Studies of what happened in some of them helped sway the agency, said Greta Massetti, who leads the CDC's community interventions task force.While there is evidence of improved mental health and other benefits from in-person schooling, “we don't really have the evidence that 6 feet is required in order to maintain low spread,” she said.Also, younger children are less likely to get seriously ill from the coronavirus and don't seem to spread it as much as adults do, and "that allows us that confidence that that 3 feet of physical distance is safe,” Massetti said.The new guidance:— Removes recommendations for plastic shields or other barriers between desks. “We don't have a lot of evidence of their effectiveness” in preventing transmission, Massetti said.— Advises at least 3 feet of space between desks in elementary schools, even in towns and cities where community spread is high, so long as students and teachers wear masks and take other precautions.— Says spacing can also be 3 feet in middle and high schools, so long as there's not a high level of spread in the community. If there is, spacing should be at least 6 feet.The CDC said 6 feet of distance should still be maintained in common areas, such as school lobbies, and when masks can't be worn, such as when eating.Also, students should continue to be spaced 6 feet apart in situations where there are a lot of people talking, cheering or singing, all of which can spread droplets containing the coronavirus. That includes chorus practice, assemblies and sports events.The CDC said teachers and other adults should stay 6 feet from one another and from students.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the revised recommendations are an "evidence-based roadmap to help schools reopen safely, and remain open, for in-person instruction.”“Safe in-person instruction gives our kids access to critical social and mental health services that prepare them for the future, in addition to the education they need to succeed," she said in a statement.Last year, the CDC advised that one way for schools to operate safely was by keeping children 6 feet apart, the same standard applied to workplaces and other settings.In contrast, the World Health Organization suggested 1 meter — a little over 3 feet — was sufficient in schools. The American Academy of Pediatrics says to desks should be spaced 3 feet apart and “ideally” 6 feet.The CDC guidance was problematic for many schools that traditionally had 25, 30 or more children per classroom in closely grouped desks. Some schools adopted complicated, hybrid scheduling, that might, for example, have half a class come to school on some days and the other half on other days.The Ridley School District in suburban Philadelphia took steps like that to follow the 6-foot guideline after the CDC emphasized it last summer. But neighboring communities went with 3 feet, “and we're not seeing the data really reflect a different spread rate,” said Lee Ann Wentzel, the district's superintendent.The district had already decided to shift to 3-foot distancing starting next month and invite all students to attend five days a week. But Wentzel said she was glad to hear of the change in CDC guidance because it will be easier to explain and defend the district's decision.A recent study in Massachusetts looked at infections of students and staff members in schools that used the 3-foot standard and those that used the 6-foot one. It found no significant difference in infection rates.Massetti said other research has also been influential, including two studies the CDC released Friday.One was a study in Utah that found low coronavirus transmission rates among students who did a good job wearing masks and whose desks were only 3 feet apart. The other study, done in Missouri, pointed to a similar conclusion, Massetti said.The guidance change comes at a time when new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus are increasingly spreading. That means a continued emphasis on mask wearing and other such measurs, Massetti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-changes-6-foot-rule-for-schools-allowing-desks-to-be-closer-101616165983691.html
19-03-2021||World||Happiness Report: World shows resilience in face of Covid-19||The coronavirus brought a year of fear and anxiety, loneliness and lockdown, and illness and death, but an annual report on happiness around the world released Friday suggests the pandemic has not crushed people's spirits.The editors of the 2021 World Happiness Report found that while emotions changed as the pandemic set in, longer-term satisfaction with life was less affected.“What we have found is that when people take the long view, they’ve shown a lot of resilience in this past year,” Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, one of the report's co-author, said from New York.The annual report, produced by the U.N Sustainable Development Solutions Network, ranks 149 countries based on gross domestic product per person, healthy life expectancy and the opinions of residents. Surveys ask respondents to indicate on a 1-10 scale how much social support they feel they have if something goes wrong, their freedom to make their own life choices, their sense of how corrupt their society is and how generous they are.Due to the pandemic, the surveys were done in slightly fewer than 100 countries for this year's World Happiness Report, the ninth one compiled since the project started. Index rankings for the other nations was based on estimates from past data.The results from both methods had European countries occupying nine of the top 10 spots on the list of the word's happiest places, with New Zealand rounding out the group. The top 10 countries are Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Austria.It was the fourth consecutive year that Finland came out on top. The United States, which was at No. 13 five years ago, slipped from 18th to 19th place. On a shortened list ranking only those countries surveyed, the U.S. placed 14th.“We find year after year that life satisfaction is reported to be happiest in the social democracies of northern Europe,” Sachs said. “People feel secure in those countries, so trust is high. The government is seen to be credible and honest, and trust in each other is high.”Finland’s comparative success in curbing Covid-19 may have contributed to the enduring trust the country's people have in their government. The country took rapid and extensive measures to stop the spread of the virus and has one of Europe's lowest Covid-19 mortality rates.“In Finland as well, of course, people have been suffering,” Anu Partanen, author of “The Nordic Theory of Everything" said on Friday in Helsinki. “But again in Finland and the Nordic countries, people are really lucky because society still supports a system buffering these sorts of shocks.”Overall, the index showed little change in happiness levels compared to last years' report, which was based on information from before the pandemic.“We asked two kinds of questions. One is about the life in general, life evaluation, we call it. How is your life going? The other is about mood, emotions, stress, anxiety. What we have found is that when people take the the long view, they’ve shown a lot of resilience in this past year," Sachs said. “Of course, we’re still in the middle of a deep crisis. But the responses about long-term life evaluation did not change decisively, though the disruption in our lives was so profound.”Issues that affect the well-being of people living in the United States include racial tensions and growing income inequality between the richest and poorest residents, happiness experts say.“As for why the U.S. ranks much lower than other similarly or even less wealthy countries, the answer is straightforward,” said Carol Graham, an expert at The Brookings Institution who was not involved in the report. “The U.S. has larger gaps in happiness rankings between the rich and the poor than do most other wealthy countries.”Report co-author Sonja Lyubormirsky, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, noted that American culture prizes signs of wealth such as big houses and multiple cars more so than other countries, “and material things don’t make us as happy.”Conversely, people's perception that their country was handling the pandemic well contributed to an overall rise in well-being, Columbia’s Sachs said. Several Asian countries fared better than they had in last years' rankings; China moved to 84th place from 94th last year."This has been a difficult period. People are looking past it when they look for the long term. But there are also many people that are suffering in the short run,” he said.Finnish philosopher Esa Saarinen, who was not involved in the report, thinks the Finnish character itself might help explain why the country keeps leading the index.“I think Finns are pretty kind of content on some level at being just what we are,” he said. “We don’t really have to be more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/happiness-report-world-shows-resilience-in-face-of-covid19-101616165892572.html

He flew on the space shuttle Columbia in 1986 and currently serves on the Nasa Advisory Council.Nelson, who served three terms in the Senate, would take control of NASA as it seeks to return humans to the moon for the first time since the 1970s and expands its reliance on a commercial space industry.Biden has agreed to continue a program, known as Artemis, that began under former President Donald Trump and aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2024, intended as a prelude to an even more ambitious human Mars landing in the future.Nelson would succeed Jim Bridenstine, appointed by Trump, as Nasa administrator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-picks-ex-us-senator-bill-nelson-as-nasa-chief-white-house-101616165305564.html
19-03-2021||World||'We need time': Scandinavian caution keeps AstraZeneca shots on hold||Denmark, Sweden and Norway said on Friday they needed more time to decide whether to use AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine even though the EU drug watchdog said the benefits outweighed the risks, prompting several countries to resume its use."We need time to get to the bottom of this," Soren Brostrom, head of the Danish Health Authority, told reporters on Friday.Several European countries last week suspended use of the vaccine following reports of rare instances of blood clots in some people who had been vaccinated.On Friday nearly a dozen of them resumed inoculations on the EMA's recommendation."This does not change the fact that, on the basis of a precautionary principle, we are continuing our suspension, because we need to understand this better, so that we can say with certainty that we recommend this vaccine," Brostrom said.Health authorities in all three Scandinavian countries said they would decide on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine next week.Norway has so far reported five cases in which recipients of the vaccine were later admitted to hospital with a combination of blood clots, bleedings and low platelets, one of whom has died.A sixth person, who also got the vaccine, has died from brain a haemorrhage in combination with a low count of platelets."These cases are rare, but very serious. We can not rule out that these cases may be linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine," the Norwegian Medicines Agency said.Sweden is also looking into isolated cases of blood clots and coagulatory issues among people who took the vaccine, including two deaths, though authorities have said any possible link to the inoculations remains uncertain."We know already that we have quite a few people that have begun to be hesitant about the vaccine," Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, the architect of Sweden's no-lockdown pandemic strategy, told public service broadcaster SVT."That means it is hugely important that we are able to issue clear communications about how and why we continue to use (the AstraZeneca vaccine)."Both Sweden and Norway have seen a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Denmark has seen numbers fall and is gradually reopening society.AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-need-time-scandinavian-caution-keeps-astrazeneca-shots-on-hold-101616162404654.html

The attack, which happened at 6:05 a.m. Saudi time, did not result in injuries or deaths, and did not disrupt the supply of oil or oil derivatives, the energy ministry said.The Houthis said earlier in the day that they had hit a facility belonging to Aramco in Riyadh, without specifying the targets they said were hit."Our armed forces carried out at dawn today an operation... with six drones which targeted the Aramco company in the capital of the Saudi enemy, Riyadh," said Yahya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman.Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment but said it would do so "at the earliest opportunity".The Iran-aligned Houthis have stepped up attacks into Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, in recent weeks.Sarea said operations against Saudi Arabia will continue and escalate as long as Saudi "aggression" against Yemen continues.The Saudi energy ministry said this and other attacks had targeted the security and stability of the world's energy supply, not just Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition which intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against Houthi forces, which ousted the internationally-recognised Yemeni government from power in Sanaa in late 2014.Riyadh says it intercepts most of the drones and missiles which the Houthis say they launch at airports, air bases and energy infrastructure, but some do inflict damage.On March 7, the coalition said a barrage of drones and missiles had been intercepted en route to targets including an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, the site of a refinery and the world's biggest offshore oil-loading facility. A residential compound in Dhahran used by Saudi Aramco was also targeted.Sarea warned "foreign companies and citizens" to avoid military sites and key infrastructure.In renewed diplomatic efforts to end the war, the United Nations and United States have urged the Houthis, who are also pressing an offensive against the government-held city of Marib in Yemen, to turn to negotiations rather then military escalation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drone-strike-on-riyadh-oil-refinery-claimed-by-houthis-sparks-fire-saudi-arabia-101616162390584.html
19-03-2021||World||UN rights chief: Justice at stake in trial over Floyd death||The UN human rights chief said Friday that the US trial over the killing of George Floyd presents a “crucial, defining opportunity for justice” that has been denied to countless other families, urging efforts to address the root causes of racial discrimination.Michelle Bachelet highlighted the case during a Human Rights Council session focusing on systematic discrimination against people of African descent, saying she met last week with family members of such people killed by law enforcement officials.Her office declined to specify who they were, citing confidentiality agreements.Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the May 25 death of Floyd, a Black man, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for about nine minutes.“Ten months after the killing of George Floyd set off new waves of outrage and demands for change across the world, a key trial related to his killing is now beginning,” Bachelet said.“But this crucial, defining opportunity for justice is denied to countless other families."“So many cases involving deaths of people of African descent never make it to court, and the pain of so many families goes unacknowledged or even denied,” she said.During her meetings last week, relatives of victims told her of the ongoing trauma faced by the loss of a child or sibling "so suddenly and violently,” Bachelet said.She cited their struggles with police and judicial authorities to achieve justice.Bachelet said police brutality and racial discrimination continue against people of African descent, despite heightened visibility about the issues.“To end racial injustice in law enforcement, we cannot simply see the tip of the iceberg, we must face the mass below the surface," she said.“We must address the legacies of enslavement, the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans, and its context of colonialism.”Bachelet said she plans to issue a report to the 47-member-state council in June to recommend “an agenda for transformative change to dismantle systemic racism and police brutality against Africans and people of African descent” and help victims.Lisa Peterson, an US acting assistant Secretary of State, delivered a statement to the council on behalf of 150 states, saying that fighting racism and racial discrimination means “acknowledging and addressing the legacy of past transgressions” that often turn up in “systemic racism.”“A great deal more needs to be done,” she said. “Many of our own countries suffer from historical inequalities that, decades and even centuries later, still cast long shadows over the present day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-justice-at-stake-in-trial-over-floyd-death-101616163149894.html
19-03-2021||World||Boris Johnson to get ‘safe and effective’ Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to protect against Covid-19 on Friday, even as many European countries who had paused its use amid some blood clot fears began resuming the jabs.The European and UK regulators said they had conducted a “thorough” scientific review of all the available data and concluded that the available evidence does not suggest that blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism) are caused by the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and produced by AstraZeneca, which is also being manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India.The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), however, does advice that anyone with a persistent headache beyond four days after receiving their vaccine should seek medical advice.“Our thorough and careful review, alongside the critical assessment of leading, independent scientists, shows that there is no evidence that that blood clots in veins is occurring more than would be expected in the absence of vaccination, for either vaccine,” said Dr June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive.“You should therefore continue to get your jab when it is your turn. While we continue to investigate these cases, as a precautionary measure we would advise anyone with a headache that lasts for more than four days after vaccination, or bruising beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, to seek medical attention,” she said.The MHRA’s investigation found a “very small number of reports” of an extremely rare form of blood clot in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis, or CSVT) occurring together with lowered platelets soon after vaccination. This type of blood clot can occur naturally in people who have not been vaccinated, as well as in those suffering from Covid-19.Therefore, the health experts say that given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these CSVT events among the 11 million people vaccinated, and as a link to the vaccine is unproven, the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, continue to outweigh the risks of potential side effects.“However, please remember that mild flu-like symptoms remain one of the most common side effects of any Covid-19 vaccine, including headache, chills and fever.These generally appear within a few hours and resolve within a day or two, but not everyone gets them. We will continue to robustly monitor all the data we have on this extremely rare possible side effect,” added Raine.Meanwhile, during a Downing Street briefing on Thursday evening, Boris Johnson repeated his previous assertions that both vaccines currently being administered by the National Health Service (NHS) are “safe and effective”.“So the Oxford jab is safe; and the Pfizer jab is safe – the thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid – which is why it’s so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes,” he said.“And as it happens, I’m getting mine. And the centre where I’m getting jabbed is currently using the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for those receiving their first dose, and that is the one I’ll be having,” said the 56-year-old, who qualifies for a jab after the NHS expanded its rollout to all adults aged over-50.The UK PM also sought to allay fears around the supply of vaccines, which has been attributed to a delay in the delivery of 5 million doses from the Serum Institute of India, a company he praised for its “herculean job” of manufacturing vaccines in large quantities.Johnson said: “We’ve always said that in a vaccination programme of this pace and this scale, some interruptions in supply are inevitable and it is true that in the short term we are receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago.“That is because of a delay in a shipment from the Serum Institute, who are doing a herculean job in producing vaccines in such large quantities – and because of a batch that we currently have in the UK that needs to be retested – as part of our rigorous safety programmes. So as a result we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March. But that is still more than we received in February.”He reiterated that the supply speed would not affect the timetable set for all adults to receive their anti-Covid jabs by end-July or for the lockdown to be eased in phases over the next few months.“There is no change to the next steps of the roadmap,” he said.Meanwhile, latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest infection levels have continued to decrease across England and Wales but have "levelled off" in Northern Ireland and increased in Scotland. An estimated one in 335 people in the UK had Covid-19 in the week to March 13, according to the figures.On Thursday, the UK recorded 6,303 new coronavirus cases and 95 deaths, taking its death toll from the deadly virus to 125,926.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-get-safe-and-effective-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-101616162234049.html
19-03-2021||World||India ranks 139 out of 149 countries in World Happiness Report | Here's list of 20 happiest nations||India has been ranked 139, out of 149 countries evaluated, in the World Happiness Report 2021, which has been collated slightly differently due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The annual report, released by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, measures subjective well-being by relying on three main indicators: life evaluations, positive emotions, and negative emotions.To measure life evaluations, the Gallup World Poll, which remains the principal source of data for the report, asked people to evaluate their current life using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life for them as a 10 and worst possible as a 0. According to the report, life evaluations provide the most informative measure for international comparisons because they capture the quality of life “in a more complete and stable way than emotional reports based on daily experiences.”Positive emotions have been captured in the report by asking respondents whether they smiled or laughed a lot the previous day. An affirmative response is coded as a 1 while a negative response is coded as 0 and the average response is calculated for each person, with values ranging from 0 and 1. On the other hand, negative emotions are measured by asking them whether they experienced specific negative emotions a lot on the same day.“Negative affect, for each person, is given by the average of their yes or no answers about three emotions: worry, sadness, and anger. National averages are created in the same way as for positive affect,” the report reads.Read | India downgraded from ‘free’ to ‘partly free’ in democracy reportFinland was able to defend its title of the world’s happiest country as the overall rankings, according to the report, “remained very similar to last year.” The other countries that scored high on the rankings include Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, and the Netherlands. The United States has been ranked 19, five spots behind Canada, while people in Afghanistan remained the least happy.In the World Happiness Report 2020, India was ranked 144 out of 156 countries surveyed. But this year’s rankings exclude countries where the survey was not carried out or where the sample sizes were smaller, compared to the three-year averages usually used.

And, should a world leader violate a rule, what type of enforcement action is appropriate," the statement said."We're also in the process of consulting with a range of human rights experts, civil society organizations, and academics worldwide whose feedback will be reflected in forthcoming revisions to the policy framework."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-review-platform-rules-for-world-leaders-asks-users-to-weigh-in-101616160933101.html
19-03-2021||World||Fiery start to US-China talks shows acrimony is here to stay||The first face-to-face meeting between the US and China since President Joe Biden took office was bound to be confrontational. The question now is whether the two sides can find a way cooperate after unloading so many grievances in public.Top diplomats from the world’s two largest economies criticized each other over everything from trade to human rights in a high-stakes first encounter Thursday in an Alaskan ballroom. US Secretary of State Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Beijing of undermining global stability, while his counterpart, Yang Jiechi, said the US wasn’t “qualified to speak to China from a position of strength.”The barbs on both sides appeared intended for domestic consumption, with Biden seeking to show his supporters that he’s tough on China and President Xi Jinping needing to satisfy his own increasingly nationalistic population. Still, the unusually acrimonious exchange showed the world just how hard it will be to repair a relationship that deteriorated rapidly under Donald Trump.“It’s not surprising for the Alaska meeting to start with a strong smell of gunpowder,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University. “It is obvious that a new equation for China-US relations is emerging. That is conflict, competition and cooperation.”The diplomatic blow-up tamped down investor sentiment in China, contributing to a slide of about 3% in China’s CSI 300. Regional shares were already under pressure following an overnight tumble on Wall Street.The delegations are due to meet for a final time on Friday morning after two rounds of closed-door talks following their initial exchange. While it was unclear whether the private discussions were more productive, a senior US administration official said the talks were “substantive, serious and direct” and went beyond the allotted time.“Perhaps it will give the Biden administration a little bit of leeway to start actually talking about issues, to start trying to come to some common understanding with the Chinese,” said William Zarit, a senior counselor at the Cohen Group and ex-US minister for commercial affairs in Beijing. “Most of these things are really to show strength in domestic politics here in the US”Both sides have highlighted numerous areas where they need closer cooperation, including climate change and pandemic relief. Biden administration officials have also expressed openness to relax some visa restrictions on Chinese nationals put in place under Trump, but not his tariffs and sanctions as demanded by China.Before the meeting, officials in Beijing had raised the possibility of a virtual summit between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping to coincide with Earth Day next month if the talks went well. But there had been unease among some in the Biden administration about meeting the Chinese side so soon, and the early response was that it may have been a miscalculation, according to one person familiar.The meeting laid bare a battle between two world views shaking global institutions and disrupting industries from semiconductors to social media. With an economy set to overtake the US’ within a decade and an increasingly modern military, China has decided to draw a line against what it sees as foreign interference. The US, meanwhile, has decided it must contain Beijing’s growing global influence.Show of StrengthTrump’s decision to run against China in last year’s election campaign, as Xi rounded up dissidents at home and the coronavirus surged around the world, accelerated the process. Biden administration officials in Anchorage, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, faced pressure to overcome skepticism that their plan to rebuild the US’s alliance network could be more effective than Trump’s “America First” policies.The US delegation was hoping to show strength by hosting the meeting on American soil after a week of meetings showcasing their Asia-Pacific alliances, including a budding partnership with India. While in Asia, Blinken signaled Biden would keep up the pressure on Beijing, accusing China of “coercion and aggression” and tightening sanctions against lawmakers responsible for crackdowns in Hong Kong.But the Chinese officials -- emboldened by the country’s rapid recovery from the world’s first coronavirus outbreak and the domestic turmoil in the US-- had similar plans. Yang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had for weeks warned Washington that they wouldn’t tolerate any foreign power crossing “red lines” like Taiwan and Hong Kong.The pair unloaded China’s most critical talking points on the US, citing the killing of Black Americans and the Black Lives Matter movement as evidence of US hypocrisy. The comments were lapped up on China’s heavily censored social media, with posts citing Yang accumulating hundreds of thousands of likes in a matter of hours.Shi Yinhong, director of Renmin University’s Center on American Studies in Beijing, said both sides appeared to be hardening their positions on fundamental issues. While there might be some scope for collaboration on issues such as Iran, North Korea or Myanmar, he said, it was “quite, quite limited.”“It’s probable that after this Anchorage diplomat summit, Sino-American relations may deteriorate further,” Shi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fiery-start-to-us-china-talks-shows-acrimony-is-here-to-stay-101616160050776.html

However, with governments reintroducing stricter border control and travel restrictions due to new Covid-19 variants making it harder for crew to transfer to and from ships," the bodies said in a statement.So far, only 55 countries and two associate members of the IMO have declared seafarers as key workers and more work must be done to ensure crew do not once again become collateral damage in the pandemic, the statement said.In December 2020, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) found that governments have failed to protect seafarers’ rights as set out in international law under the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, the statement said adding the UN agency called on states to recognise seafarers as key workers “without delay”.Concerns about prioritisation for vaccination for seafarers must also be addressed, the statement said.Vaccine passports being considered by some states pose a potential barrier to crew change as seafarers from developing nations are unlikely to have an opportunity to receive vaccines until July at the earliest, it added.“The crew change crisis is not resolved but has reached a situation where it has been more manageable. However, there is great concern over the increased travel restrictions being imposed by governments in response to new variants. Seafarers must be designated as keyworkers. The crisis is still ongoing, and we will not let up our efforts. Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers,” said Guy Platten, Secretary-General ICS.Stephen Cotton, ITF General Secretary said: “The stark reality is that only a few handfuls of countries have treated seafarers with the respect they deserve by designating them real key worker status. Unless government’s move from the protectionist positions that they’ve been in for over 12 months now, and allow seafarers genuine free movement and prioritization for vaccinations sadly the situation could easily spiral out of control yet again.”ICS is one of the principal international trade associations for merchant shipowners and operators, representing all sectors and trades and over 80 per cent of the world merchant fleet.The ITF is a global union federation of nearly 700 transport workers trade unions representing 20 million workers, 216 of which represent over 650,000 seafarers spread across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maritime-bodies-say-over-2-lakh-seafarers-impacted-globally-by-covid-19-restrictions-101616158881920.html
19-03-2021||World||Taliban expect US withdrawal from Afghanistan, vow to restore Islamic rule||The Taliban warned Washington on Friday against defying a May 1 deadline for the withdrawal of American and NATO troops from Afghanistan, promising a “reaction," which could mean increased attacks by the insurgent group.The Taliban issued their warning at a press conference in Moscow, the day after meeting with senior Afghan government negotiators and international observers to try to jumpstart a stalled peace process to end Afghanistan's decades of war.President Joe Biden's administration says it is reviewing an agreement the Taliban signed with the Trump administration. Biden told ABC in an interview Wednesday that the May 1 deadline “could happen, but it is tough,” adding that if the deadline is extended it won’t be by “a lot longer.”“They should go,” Suhail Shaheen, a member of the Taliban negotiation team, told reporters, warning that staying beyond May 1 would breach the deal. “After that, it will be a kind of violation of the agreement. That violation would not be from our side. . . Their violation will have a reaction.”He did not elaborate on what form the “reaction” would take, but in keeping with the agreement they signed in February 2020, the Taliban have not attacked US or NATO forces, even as unclaimed bombings and targeted killings have spiked in recent months.“We hope that this will not happen, that they withdraw and we focus on the settlement, peaceful settlement of the Afghan issue, in order to bring about a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire at the end of reaching a political roadmap (for) Afghanistan,” Shaheen said.He also reaffirmed that the Taliban were firm on their demand for an Islamic government. Shaheen didn't elaborate on what an Islamic government would look like or whether it would mean a return to their repressive rules that denied girls education, barred women from working, and imposed harsh punishments.Shaheen did not say whether the Taliban would accept elections, but he emphasized that the government of President Ashraf Ghani would not fit their definition of an Islamic government.In previous statements, the Taliban have said their vision of an Islamic government would allow girls to attend school, and women to work or be in public life. But in every conversation, they emphasized the need to follow Islamic injunctions without specifying what that would mean.They have said they would not accept a woman as president, and while women could be judges they could not take the job of the Chief Justice.But even without the Taliban in government in Afghanistan, The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security Afghanistan said Afghanistan was one of the worst places in the world to be a woman in 2020.Only one woman attended Thursday's talks in Moscow, and in the two decades since the Taliban were ousted, successive governments in Kabul have been unable to ratify a law outlawing violence against women.Meanwhile, the Taliban refused to promise they would not launch a spring offensive despite calls from the United States, Russia and China.“I started Jihad (holy war) to remove foreign forces from my country and establish an Islamic government and Jihad will continue until we reach that goal through a political agreement,” said Khairullah Khairkhwa, a member of the negotiating team, who was one of five Taliban freed from U.S. prison on Guantanamo Bay in 2013 in exchange for the release of a captured U.S. soldier.Washington has been at war in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks masterminded by al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden who was based in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The invasion toppled the Taliban regime but the 20-year-war has made Afghanistan America’s longest conflict.The Taliban, who during their rule imposed a harsh brand of Islam, now control about half of the country. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that the insurgents could make even more gains without US and NATO troops on the ground.The Moscow conference was attended by US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, Abdullah Abdullah, head of Afghanistan’s National Reconciliation Council, and Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who led a 10-member delegation. Representatives of Pakistan, Iran, India and China also participated.In a statement issued after the talks, Russia, the US, China and Pakistan called on the warring parties to reduce the level of violence in the country — and specifically urged the Taliban not to pursue a spring offensive.The joint statement emphasized that the four countries do not support the restoration of an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan similar to the Taliban's past rule.Shaheen emphasized that the Taliban would stick to the goal of building an Islamic state. He argued that the Afghans themselves should determine their government order without outside meddling.

19-03-2021||World||Germany gripped by ‘third wave’ as EU tackles vaccination woes||Germany’s health minister warned that the country is in the grip of a “third wave” of rising coronavirus cases as Europe tries to get its stalled vaccination program back on track.“The numbers are rising, the share of mutations is large and there are some fairly challenging weeks ahead of us,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday at a news conference in Berlin, adding that there isn’t enough vaccine supply in Europe at the moment to halt the surge.Germany and other European Union countries are trying to reset their inoculation campaigns after a chaotic week of suspensions, health scares and export-ban threats. Countries across the bloc on Friday resumed using AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine after temporarily suspending it to investigate a possible blood-clot issue. But while the European Medicines Agency has cleared the shot for use, worries among citizens may linger.Further muddying the waters, France’s public-health agency on Friday recommended that the Astra vaccine should only be given to people aged 55 and older, as cases of clotting occurred mostly with people younger than that. The government in Paris said it would follow the agency’s advice.The stubbornly high infection rate in Germany -- mirroring the situation across the continent from France to Italy and the Czech Republic -- raises the prospect that lockdown restrictions in Europe’s largest economy may be prolonged into next month or even sharpened, and a cautious reopening announced at the start of the month delayed.Germany’s coronavirus cases rose by the most in two months in the 24 hours through Friday morning, days before Chancellor Angela Merkel hosts talks to decide on the next steps in the country’s strategy to contain the virus.The seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people continued to climb, rising to 95.6, the highest in more than a month and close to the threshold at which Merkel and regional officials agreed to reimpose restrictions.Under the guidelines, curbs should be reinstated if the local incidence rate rises above 100 for three consecutive days, although several cities and regions have chosen to disregard the so-called “emergency brake.”It will take “some weeks” for people most at risk to be fully inoculated, even if promised deliveries arrive on schedule, and only then can there be a discussion about lifting restrictions, Spahn warned.Merkel and regional leaders are due to hold their next round of talks on Monday. Remaining lockdown restrictions -- including the closing of non-essential stores, hotels, restaurants and gyms, as well as cultural venues -- are due to expire on March 28.Karl Lauterbach, a lawmaker for the ruling Social Democrats who is a trained epidemiologist, said the recent rise in cases makes stricter curbs inevitable. “It doesn’t make any sense to wait,” Lauterbach said at the news conference alongside Spahn.He urged Germans to avoid travel over the Easter vacation, saying it would inevitably “fire the third wave” and make it much harder to get the virus under control.An increasing number of Germans would support a tightening of the lockdown, an opinion poll published Thursday suggested. Among 1,207 people surveyed by infratest dimap for ARD, 32% said the current curbs are not stringent enough, 12 percentage points more than at the start of this month. The share that said they think the restrictions are adequate fell to 38% from 47%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-gripped-by-third-wave-as-eu-tackles-vaccination-woes-101616157956229.html
19-03-2021||World||Myanmar junta chokes information flow as anti-coup protests intensify||Two more journalists were detained in Myanmar on Friday, part of the junta’s intensifying efforts to choke off information about resistance to last month’s coup.Mizzima News reported that one of its former reporters, Than Htike Aung, and Aung Thura, a journalist from the BBC’s Burmese-language service, were detained by men who appeared to be plainclothes security agents outside a court in the capital of Naypyitaw. The journalists were there to cover legal proceedings against Win Htein, a detained senior official from the National League for Democracy, the party that ran the country before the takeover.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. In the face of persistent strikes and protests against the takeover, the junta has responded with an increasingly violent crackdown and efforts to severely limit information reaching the outside world. Security forces have fired on crowds, killing hundreds, internet access has been severely restricted, private newspapers have been barred from publishing, and protesters, journalists and politicians have been arrested in large numbers.About 40 journalists have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup, with roughly half still in detention, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press.A statement from the BBC said it is “extremely concerned” that Aung Thura had been taken away by unidentified men.“The BBC takes the safety of all its staff in Myanmar very seriously and we are doing everything we can to find Aung Thura,” the organization said, adding that he was an accredited journalist with many years of reporting experience. It called on the authorities “to help locate him and confirm that he is safe.”The reporters were taken into custody a day after Kyi Toe, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy, was arrested, according to a Facebook post by Phyo Zeya Thaw, a party official.Kyi Toe had been a major source of information in the early days following the Feb. 1 coup, after the ousted civilian government's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior officials were detained. The takeover came the same day that newly elected lawmakers were supposed to take take their seats in Parliament.Amid a crackdown on the press, no privately owned newspapers were published this past week for the first time in eight years, following bans and voluntary suspensions. The military government also has banned at least five local news organizations from disseminating information on any platform, but its orders were mostly ignored.Restrictions on the internet have also been in place since shortly after the coup, including a blockage of mobile internet access. Broadband Wi-Fi service remains available, though spotty.Despite a crackdown that has killed more than 200 demonstrators so far, protesters were back in the streets Friday morning in several cities and towns. Some rallies proceeded without violence, but in Aungban town in eastern Shan state, online Tachileik News Agency reported that at least seven people were injured when security forces sought to break up their march using tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition.Eleven News, a major media group in Myanmar, reported on Twitter that seven people had been killed in Aungban, but that death toll could not immediately be confirmed, though photos of at least one of the victims were posted on social media.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported that as of Thursday, it had verified 224 killings linked to the coup’s aftermath, more than half of them in Yangon, the biggest city. It said 2,258 people have been arrested or charged, with 1,938 still detained or evading arrest.Despite the violence, Myanmar's neighbors have so far been tentative in their response. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo issued a strong statements on Friday, urging a halt to violence and asking other regional leaders to hold a summit on the crisis.“Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately to avoid more victims. The safety and welfare of the people must be a top priority,” Widodo said in a televised address. “Indonesia also urges dialogue and reconciliation to be carried out immediately to restore democracy, peace and stability in Myanmar."Widodo, the leader of Southeast Asia’s largest economy, said that he will immediately speak with Brunei, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to set up a meeting of leaders of its 10 member countries.Widodo’s move came after ASEAN foreign ministers held a March 2 meeting at which they reached no consensus on the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-chokes-information-flow-as-anti-coup-protests-intensify-101616157857143.html
19-03-2021||World||China rebukes LinkedIn for failing to control political content: Report||It seems Microsoft's professional networking site LinkedIn is in hot water in China as the country's internet regulator has rebuked the executive of the company this month for failing to control political content, The New York Times reported.LinkedIn has been the lone major American social network allowed to operate in China. The Microsoft-owned service for professionals censors the posts made by its millions of Chinese users.But it is not clear what material got the company into trouble. The regulator said it had found objectionable posts circulating in the period around an annual meeting of China's lawmakers, The New York Times reported citing people, who have been briefed on the matter.As a punishment, the people said, officials are requiring LinkedIn to perform a self-evaluation and offer a report to the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator.The service was also forced to suspend new sign-ups of users inside China for 30 days, one of the people added, though that period could change depending on the administration's judgment.The Cyberspace Administration of China did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.Last week, Microsoft's professional networking site LinkedIn said it is pausing new member registrations in China as the company works to ensure it remains in compliance with local law.China is known to heavily regulate and censor domestic internet usage and actively block any websites or links that are seen as going against the narrative of the communist party.The country has the world's most sophisticated censorship system known as the 'Great Firewall'. The Chinese government controls the media through techniques including blocking IP addresses, DNS attacks and filtering specific URLs and keywords within URLs, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).According to an SCMP article in November, over the years, the number of websites blocked in China has ballooned to 10,000.The blacklist includes social networks like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp; news outlets like Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times; and popular collaboration tools such as Dropbox and Google Drive (or anything else on Google).In 2016, Freedom House ranked China last for the second consecutive year out of 65 countries that represent 88 per cent of the world's internet users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rebukes-linkedin-for-failing-to-control-political-content-report-101616156957865.html
19-03-2021||World||Medical workers conflicted by France's lockdown that isn't||When nurse Anaelle Aeschliman started her 12-hour night shift caring for unconscious patients with COVID-19, the French prime minister was announcing new restrictions to combat the resurgent coronavirus epidemic in Paris.She was not impressed. The 26-year-old had been hoping for a full nationwide lockdown to slow the streams of gravely ill patients filling ICUs like hers, in the west of Paris.Instead, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced a mishmash of measures — including closures of nonessential shops — that are mostly limited to Paris and northern France and don't oblige people to spend most of the day indoors. Announced Thursday night, they take effect on Friday night, when Aeschliman will be back in the ICU, for another 12-hour shift."Locking down region by region isn’t enough. I think it’s a sanitary suicide,” she said Friday morning, as she went home for a shower and some sleep after working through the night.“I admit I was a bit disappointed that we aren’t being locked down nationwide," she said. "When you look at the numbers, they’re unsustainable, and it is going to become ever-harder as the virus continues to circulate.”In March 2020, when France first locked down with some of the toughest restrictions in Europe, the government exhorted people to stay home. This time, it is, in effect, urging them to go out and get some fresh air.People in the Paris region and in the north of the country covered by the new rules can walk as long as they like in a day, within a 10-kilometer (six-mile) radius of their homes and carrying a paper authorizing the stroll. Schools will remain open.The new measures affect about 21 million people in the country of 67 million. At the same time, however, a change in the nationwide curfew will give citizens an extra hour of freedom. It will start at 7 p.m. instead of the previous 6 p.m., and run until 6 a.m. Restaurants, bars, cinemas, gyms, museums, theaters and concert halls have been shut for almost five months.For Pierre Squara, the doctor in charge Friday at the ICU unit of the Ambroise Paré private hospital where Aeschliman also works, encouraging people to leave their Paris apartments makes sense, especially with spring around the corner.“Now that good weather is coming and people will be able to go outside, it will disperse the virus a bit more,” he said. "It is better to be outside than to be four people in an apartment of 25 square meters. Because Paris apartments are small.”Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said the government had sought to draw conclusions from better scientific knowledge of the virus and from France’s two previous lockdowns in spring and autumn.“Everything we can do outside, we need to do it outside,” he told RTL radio.Attal urged people to limit social interactions, keep wearing masks outdoors and limit gatherings to six people maximum.As the measures apply for at least four weeks and travel between regions will be forbidden without a compelling reason, many people were rushing on Friday to Paris train stations to leave for other less-affected regions.French authorities also announced that the country is resuming shots with the vaccine made by AstraZeneca on Friday. Castex was to be vaccinated in the afternoon, aiming to show “confidence” in the product.France on Thursday reported about 35,000 new confirmed infections in 24 hours nationwide, numbers that have steadily increased in recent weeks. The variant first identified in the UK accounts for most infections, and around 250 people are dying each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-workers-conflicted-by-france-s-lockdown-that-isnt-101616155462092.html
19-03-2021||World||US states throw open vaccine eligibility before May 1 goal||A dozen US states are expanding access to Covid vaccinations earlier than planned for every adult, accelerating the biggest such campaign in the country’s history and making long strides toward President Joe Biden’s May 1 deadline for eligibility.Biden set the timeline last week, and since then officials have announced strategies to beat his deadline in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Nevada, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois and Utah. Others plan to move ahead with certain groups earlier than expected, such as Wisconsin, which will make more than a million people with underlying conditions eligible for vaccinations next week.The US has suffered from the pandemic more than other developed countries, with almost 539,000 dead after a disjointed response under former President Donald Trump. But the nation amassed a huge trove of vaccines that the current administration is pushing out as fast as possible.Biden has set goals for the campaign that so far have been easily met. He said the US on Friday will clinch his goal of administering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots in the first 100 days of his presidency, reaching the mark six weeks ahead of time. The state measures mean the nation likely will hit his May 1 mark. Biden has said the country could be almost back to normal by the July 4 holiday.Betsy Chilton, 29, of Sioux City, Iowa said she’s looking forward to getting the vaccine now that eligibility will be expanded.“Being a young, relatively healthy person, I’m definitely last in line, which is totally OK,” she said. “But we all have people that we care about that are elderly or in some way at risk. I want to be able to be around my grandparents and not be worried.”The federal government has promised states an increased vaccine supply in coming weeks. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said on Twitter that supply allowed for a “quicker schedule than originally planned.”The pace of vaccination has increased dramatically over the past two months, jumping from an average of about 800,000 doses a day in mid-January to 2.5 million doses a day this week, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. On Thursday, Americans were up to 2.7 million shots.The gains aren’t yet equitable. The inoculation campaign has reached a little more than 20% of the country, but not a single state has protected that share of its Black or Hispanic populations, according to a Bloomberg demographic analysis.And opening eligibility doesn’t necessarily mean administration is going efficiently, said Ajay Sethi, an associate professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. In some cases, states are reaching the limits of vaccine acceptance.For those still waiting to get it, he said, just knowing they’re eligible can make an emotional difference. “Sometimes people feel better standing in line than not having any line at all,” Sethi said Thursday. “Once a few states do it, other states decide to do it as well, especially if leaders are finding that they don’t want to hit the wall, they want to keep the momentum, they might as well open up the eligibility criteria.”Flood ForecastIn Iowa, which took a laissez-faire stance on pandemic safety rules, all adults will be eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19 during the week of April 5, Governor Kim Reynolds said this week.But she cautioned that the projections could change. “Right now, if we’re able to ramp up in a manner they’re projecting and we’re ready to go, it’ll be good news for Iowans,” she said.Large expansions of supply and eligibility will test states’ abilities to deliver shots. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had previously complained of vaccine shortages, called it a “logistical nightmare” on a briefing call Wednesday.“The Biden administration did a great job of securing more vaccines, but the allocation to the state increases dramatically in a very short period of time,” he said. “So we’re going to have to do millions and millions of doses.”That’s leaving aside stagnation of demand. In Mississippi, which expanded access to all adults on Tuesday, officials at a news conference pushed the hesitant to get shots. They acknowledged that not everyone in priority groups had been fully vaccinated.“We still have a long way to go,” said Paul Byers, state epidemiologist at the Mississippi Department of Health. “But our vaccine allocations are increasing. I think the time is right for us to continue to open it up and utilize that vaccine moving forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-throw-open-vaccine-eligibility-before-may-1-goal-101616154687503.html
19-03-2021||World||Finland defends title as world’s happiest nation in 4th straight win||Finland defended its title as the world’s happiest country through a year marked by the pandemic, with people’s trust in each other and their government proving a key factor.It’s the fourth straight trophy for the Nordic country in the World Happiness Report 2021 published on Friday by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.As the pandemic turned 2020 on its head, the report provided two rankings: the usual one based on the average of three years of surveys taken in 2018-2020 by Gallup, and another focused on 2020 alone to help understand the outbreak’s effect on subjective well-being -- and how factors contributing to well-being affected pandemic outcomes.Trust was the key factor linking happiness and successful Covid-19 strategies, where societies with higher confidence in public institutions and greater income equality were the more successful in fighting the virus.Finland has so far weathered the pandemic better than most countries, avoiding lockdowns that reduced life satisfaction across the globe. Hospitals haven’t been overwhelmed and it’s managed to keep deaths below 150 per 1 million people, compared with the global average of about 980. Denmark, which came in second, has also weathered the pandemic relatively well.The U.S. dropped one place to number 19, five spots behind Canada and three below developing country Costa Rica, while people in Afghanistan remained the least happy.The two ranking methods used this time show that changes in the overall scores were modest, “reflecting both the global nature of the pandemic and a widely shared resilience in the face of it.”For example, the top 10 in the two methods used shared nine nations: Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and Austria.“We must aim for well-being rather than mere wealth, which will be fleeting indeed if we don’t do a much better job of addressing the challenges of sustainable development,” said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. “The pandemic reminds us of our global environmental threats, the urgent need to cooperate, and the difficulties of achieving cooperation in each country and globally. We need urgently to learn from Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-defends-title-as-world-s-happiest-nation-in-4th-straight-win-101616155225117.html
19-03-2021||World||Hospitals in Syria's capital full with coronavirus patients||Intensive care units in public hospitals in the Syrian capital Damascus have reached full capacity due to a sharp rise of coronavirus infections, leading doctors to transfer patients to hospitals in other provinces, the health ministry said late Thursday.The announcement was a rare public acknowledgment of the severity of the outbreak in Syria, which has been ravaged by a decade of conflict that had major effects on the medical sector.Syria has reported a rise in infections in recent weeks that included President Bashar Assad and his wife Asma who are currently recovering, according to the president's office.Syria reported 149 new cases on Thursday, raising the total of registered infections in the country to 16,925, including 1,130 deaths since the first case was reported in March last year.The number is believed to be much higher as most Syrians cannot afford to have a PCR test. Syria is in a deep economic crisis, as the war has left more than 80 per cent of the population below the poverty level.A test at a private hospital or clinic costs 126,500 Syrians pounds — about USD 28 at the black market rate — at a time when most monthly incomes in Syria are less than USD 100.The head of the emergency department at the health ministry, Toufic Hasaba, told state news agency SANA that intensive care units in Damascus' four state-run hospitals are full and those in need were taken to hospitals in other provinces earlier this week.Hasaba urged people to take precautionary measures including wearing masks, social distancing and sanitization.The health ministry said that coronavirus cases have shot up over the past two weeks, but did not give a reason.The pandemic, which has severely tested even developed countries, has been a major challenge for Syria's health care sector, already depleted by years of conflict that killed more than half a million and displaced half the country's pre-war population of 23 million.Syria began a vaccination campaign earlier this month, but no details have been given about the process. The health minister said the government procured the vaccines from a friendly country, which he declined to name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitals-in-syria-s-capital-full-with-coronavirus-patients-101616153900682.html
19-03-2021||World||Tesla cars banned by China's military on concerns about cameras||Tesla Inc. cars have been banned from Chinese military complexes and housing compounds because of concerns about sensitive data being collected by cameras built into the vehicles.The order, issued by the military, advises Tesla owners to park their cars outside of military property, according to people familiar with the directive who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The ban, relayed to residents of military housing this week, was triggered by concerns that the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data via the cars’ in-built cameras in a way the Chinese government can’t see or control, one of the people said.Images of what was purported to be a notice about the ban were also circulating on Chinese social media. Multi-direction cameras and ultrasonic sensors in Tesla cars may “expose locations” and the vehicles are being barred from military residences to ensure the safety of confidential military information, the notice said.A representative for Tesla in China declined to comment on the military’s move. China’s Defense Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a fax sent after after business hours.Tesla, like many other automakers including General Motors Co., uses several small cameras, mainly located on the outside of the vehicle, to help guide parking, autopilot and self-driving functions. Most Tesla models also have an interior camera mounted above the rear view mirror that can be used to detect whether a driver is looking at the road, looking down at their lap, wearing sunglasses, or looking at something else entirely.Internal CameraThe California-based company -- which produces Model 3s and Model Y SUV crossovers at a Gigafactory near Shanghai -- hasn’t shied away from that fact, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeting in April 2019 that the internal camera is there “for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft and people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet.”“In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video,” Musk explained.Since then, Tesla has started using cars’ internal cameras to monitor what it calls FSD (full self driving) beta testers, or Tesla owners who have volunteered to test out the company’s driver-assist capabilities.Earlier this month, Musk tweeted that the company’s FSD beta trial had been expanded to around 2,000 owners but Tesla had also “revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road.” Musk said the next significant release of FSD beta would be in April.Concern over this program contributed to the ban by the military, one of the people said.None of the in-car cameras in Teslas sold in China are turned on or part of the FSD beta trial, the Tesla representative said. Tesla’s privacy policies comply with national laws and local regulations in China, they said.China ApologyChina, the world’s biggest market for EVs, is key to Musk’s global growth ambitions. The carmaker received significant support from the state to build the factory near Shanghai, its first outside of the U.S., and Musk’s strategy has been one of deference to the government, in contrast to his more combative approach in the U.S.Recently, though, the tone seems to have shifted. Tesla was called in by Chinese regulators over quality and safety issues with its cars, including battery fires and abnormal acceleration. The automaker was also forced into issuing a public apology to China’s state grid in early February after a video purportedly showed staff blaming an overload in the national electricity network for damage to a customer’s vehicle.This isn’t the first time Tesla has found itself at the center of controversy over the use of cameras. Last week, a group of hackers said they breached a trove of security-camera data collected by Silicon Valley startup Verkada Inc., gaining access to many different types of footage, including some from inside a Tesla warehouse in Shanghai.The hackers said they obtained access to 222 cameras in Tesla factories and warehouses and that the data breach was carried out to show the pervasiveness of video surveillance and the ease with which systems could be broken into. Tesla China told Bloomberg it was one of its suppliers that had been hacked, and that data from the Chinese Gigafactory is stored in secure local servers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-cars-banned-by-china-s-military-on-concerns-about-cameras-101616154099516.html
19-03-2021||World||Joe Biden says US to hit 100 million Coovid-19 vaccinations goal on Friday||With the US closing in on President Joe Biden's goal of injecting 100 million coronavirus vaccinations weeks ahead of his target date, the White House said the nation is now in position to help supply neighbors Canada and Mexico with millions of lifesaving shots.The Biden administration on Thursday revealed the outlines of a plan to “loan” a limited number of vaccines to Canada and Mexico as the president announced the U.S. is on the cusp of meeting his 100-day injection goal “way ahead of schedule.”“ I’m proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met our goal," Biden said. He promised to unveil a new vaccination target next week, as the U.S. is on pace to have enough of the three currently authorized vaccines to cover the entire adult population just 10 weeks from now.Ahead of Biden's remarks, the White House said it was finalizing plans to send a combined 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to Mexico and Canada in its first export of shots. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the details of the “loan" were still being worked out, but 2.5 million doses would go to Mexico and 1.5 million would be sent to Canada.“Our first priority remains vaccinating the U.S. population,” Psaki said. But she added that “ensuring our neighbors can contain the virus is a mission critical step, is mission critical to ending the pandemic.”The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been authorized for use in the U.S. but has been by the World Health Organization. Tens of millions of doses have been stockpiled in the U.S., waiting for emergency use authorization, and that has sparked an international outcry that lifesaving vaccine is being withheld when it could be used elsewhere. The White House said just 7 million of the AstraZeneca doses are ready for shipment.The initial run of doses manufactured in the U.S. are owned by the federal government under the terms of agreements reached with drugmakers, and the Biden administration has faced calls from allies across the globe to release the AstraZeneca shots for immediate use. Biden has also fielded direct requests from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to buy vaccines produced in the United States.Global public health advocates say wealthy nations like the U.S. need to do far more to help stem the spread of the pandemic. The World Health Organization on Thursday issued a report that fewer than 7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Africa thus far. That's the equivalent of what the U.S. administers in a matter of days.Biden did move to have the U.S. contribute financially to the United Nations- and World Health Organization-backed COVAX alliance, which will share vaccine with more than 90 lower- and middle-income nations, but the U.S. has yet to commit to sharing any doses.From his first days in office, Biden has set clear — and achievable — metrics for U.S. success, whether they be vaccinations or school reopenings, as part of an apparent strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration's sometimes-fanciful rhetoric on the virus.The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the U.S. had even one authorized vaccine for COVID-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.By the time Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the U.S. had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Biden's goal was not ambitious enough. He quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.Now the U.S. is injecting an average of about 2.2 million doses each day — and the pace is likely to dramatically rise later this month in conjunction with an expected surge in supply of the vaccines.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, injections of 96 million doses have been reported to the agency since Biden’s inauguration, but those reports lag the actual date of administration. Vaccination trend lines pointed to Biden breaking the 100 million mark on Thursday, with the numbers likely to be confirmed by the CDC as soon as Friday.The president has moved to speed up deliveries of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, as well as to expand the number of places to get shots and people who can administer them, with a focus on increasing the nation's capacity to inject doses as supply constraints lift.The risk in setting too rosy expectations is that an administration might become defined by its failure to meet them, such as in May 2020, when President Donald Trump said the nation had “prevailed” over the virus.At the time, the country had seen about 80,000 deaths from the virus. This week, the U.S. death toll topped 538,000.

19-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Germany warns of 'exponential' virus spread||Coronavirus cases in Germany are rising at a "very clearly exponential rate", a top public health institute said Friday, as the EU's biggest country debated tightening a shutdown.The vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, Lars Schaade, told reporters that highly contagious virus variants were getting the upper hand, wiping out progress seen last month in containing the pandemic."It is very possible that we will have a similar situation over Easter to the one we had before Christmas, with very high case numbers, many severe cases and deaths, and hospitals that are overwhelmed".The RKI on Friday reported 17,482 new infections in the previous 24 hours and 226 deaths in Germany, with the seven-day incidence rate soaring to 96 per 100,000 people despite a months-long shutdown of large swathes of public life.German leaders agreed earlier this month to impose new restrictions in regions where the seven-day incidence rate surpassed 100.The country's second city of Hamburg said it would pull the "emergency brake" from Saturday after exceeding the 100-mark three days in a row. Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, also crossed the benchmark on Friday."We are in the third wave of the pandemic, the numbers are rising, the percentage of virus mutations is high," Health Minister Jens Spahn told the news conference.Spahn, who this week faced growing calls to resign amid frustration with the government's pandemic management, called on Germans to refrain from spring break travel to help curb infections.The grim news came as Germany resumed administering AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jabs after the European regulator EMA assessed it was "safe and effective" to use.'Short, sharp' restrictionsAmid a widely criticised sluggish vaccination campaign, Germany decided on Monday, along with most EU governments, to suspend the use of the vaccine for the EMA to examine a handful of cases of cerebral vein thrombosis that emerged.Doctors will now have to inform patients about the possible blood clotting risk before giving them the jabs.Critics had complained that the decision to halt the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine over the last days only served to fuel mistrust over the jabs and further delay Germany's inoculation programme.By Thursday, only 3.8 per cent of the German population was reported fully immunised.Spahn said the resumption of the AstraZeneca vaccinations combined with expected new arrivals of jabs from other manufacturers in April should speed up the German campaign.But he admitted that "an honest analysis of the situation shows that there aren't enough vaccines in Europe to stop the third wave with vaccination alone".He said it would take several weeks before even those in the highest risk groups were fully inoculated and warned that the country should brace for an extension of current restrictions.German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet with the country's 16 state leaders on Monday to set new shutdown rules based on the latest pandemic developments.Karl Lauterbach, a public health expert from the Social Democrats, junior partners in the government, said there was, for now, no alternative to keeping restaurants, most shops and entertainment venues closed."You can look at it any way you want, we have to go back to lockdown," he said, calling for "short, sharp" restrictions. "The sooner we react, the shorter the lockdown will need to be."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-germany-warns-of-exponential-virus-spread-101616152950093.html
19-03-2021||World||Twitter's 'Birdwatch' crowd experiment courts familiar challenges||In January, just weeks after Twitter Inc permanently banned former President Donald Trump following the storming of the US Capitol, the social media company started asking US users to help identify and fact-check misleading tweets in a new pilot program.But Birdwatch, which has about 2,000 participants and is currently cordoned off in its own section of the site, is already facing many of the same challenges as Twitter itself -discerning facts from partisan opinion and dealing with the potential for harassment or people trying to manipulate the system."There's a lot to do to get there, to the point where we're comfortable putting these things on tweets," Keith Coleman, Twitter's vice president of product, told Reuters."Birdwatchers" can flag misleading tweets and annotate them with "notes" to give more information, which other participants can rate as helpful.Under pressure to clean up its site, Twitter started labeling misleading tweets for the first time last year, a move that intensified debates about the role major social media platforms play in public discourse. It also fueled allegations from Republican lawmakers that tech companies are censoring conservatives.In asking users to contribute their own checks, Twitter will have to balance curating Birdwatch to make it useful without losing the legitimacy it wanted from relying on its community.Public Birdwatch data shows notes ranging from balanced fact-checks to partisan criticism. For example, some marked the baseless claim of widespread voter fraud in November's US presidential election "not misleading." Many simply gave opinions - a tweet from SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk should "go to Mars. And stay there" - while others added notes to opinions.People are "fact-checking things that professional fact checkers never would," said Alex Mahadevan, a reporter with the Poynter Institute's MediaWise project, who analyzed Birdwatch's data.Coleman said the Twitter team's next move would be updating the rating algorithm that determines which notes to highlight to make sure Birdwatchers with different views agree the information is helpful."It's totally fine that there's a mixture of quality on the input; what will matter is the quality of the output," he said.Wisdom of CrowdsCrowd-sourced knowledge and community moderation are not new models: they underpin platforms like social network Reddit Inc, and Facebook Inc also runs a "community review" program in which users are paid to identify suspect content for vetting by professional fact-checkers. Thomson Reuters Corp-owned Reuters is one of Facebook's paid third-party fact-checkers.One of the most prominent examples of a crowd-based approach is Wikipedia, where volunteers write and edit millions of articles.Katherine Maher, CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia, said in an interview that the community's mission to build an encyclopedia - making it what she called a "purpose platform" rather than "an expression platform" - defines how contributors behave and that Twitter, which has a more diffuse purpose, could be more difficult to wrangle.Borrowing methods from how Wikipedia promotes and rewards credible contributions could help, Maher said. Public editors on Wikipedia are granted greater controls by other users, based on their work.Twitter's Coleman said the company was working on how to build reputational scores for Birdwatchers, based on whether a range of people find their contributions helpful.Maher also said Twitter would need to develop standards and their enforcement for Birdwatch and decide how people could appeal annotation. It needs to solve the issue, she said, of "Who watches the watchers?"BirdwatchersTravis Whitfill, a healthcare researcher and biopharma venture capitalist in Dallas, Texas, said he joined the Birdwatch program as a way to correct medical and Covid-19 misinformation.Wesley Miller, a 47-year-old research analyst, joined the pilot after briefly quitting Twitter last year in protest at the company's lack of action against Trump.Jeffery Johnson, a 19-year-old conservative college freshman in Bentonville, Arkansas, said he joined partly as a joke but liked the idea of users rather than Twitter deciding on the truth.Researchers said it was hard to tell if the program would attract mission-driven volunteers, zealots with agendas or bad actors in the future if it rolls out more broadly.To help guide Birdwatch's development, Twitter said it is creating an advisory council of outside experts with backgrounds ranging from crowdsourcing to political science.The company has also acknowledged it will have to work out how to prevent its unpaid Birdwatchers from being harassed for their notes.Coleman said it was considering options like removing people's Twitter handles from their annotations and working out whether there would be extra rules for Birdwatch content. Contributors also will be allowed to use pseudonym accounts to protect their identities."We don't know what will happen and whether people will feel safe," said Coleman. "It's really critical they do."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitters-birdwatch-crowd-experiment-courts-familiar-challenges-101616152180536.html

19-03-2021||World||Covid-19 transmission on flight from New Delhi, in hotel corridor, finds New Zealand study||The transmission of coronavirus occurred on an international flight, in a hotel corridor, and then to household contacts despite the efforts taken by authorities to isolate and quarantine patients, New Zealand researchers have found. In a study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, the researchers identified a multibranched chain of transmission of coronavirus among nine patients, including a probable case of aerosol transmission without direct person-to-person contact.A cohort of 149 repatriated New Zealand citizens or permanent residents, without any pre-departure testing, travelled from New Delhi to Christchurch on August 26, 2020, on a Boeing 747 chartered flight via Nadi, Fiji, the researchers reported. While several passengers remained in Fiji, others arrived in Christchurch and were put under managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days.Out of all the passengers who arrived in Christchurch on the chartered flight, eight showed positive results for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Three of the case-patients were shown to be genomically linked and have been denoted in the study as case-patients A, B, and C. During the first flight from New Delhi to Nadi, with around 35% occupancy, as per the study, all passengers were evenly spaced throughout the aircraft and case-patients A, B, and C sat within two rows of each other.Patients A and B tested positive for Covid-19 on August 30, and patient C experienced symptoms on September 6 and tested positive on September 8. The researchers noted that the timing of patient C experiencing symptoms was consistent with transmission by patient A or B during the flight from India to New Zealand.“Case-patients A or B might have been infected during or before the flight from a common source...the passengers in question did not travel together and did not know each other,” they wrote, highlighting that infection prevention measures were followed by the flight crew and passengers were required to wear facemasks for the duration of the flight.The researchers then found evidence of transmission in the MIQ facility, which was a repurposed commercial hotel and each room with its own bathroom and no balconies. Patient C tested positive on day 12 of the mandatory quarantine period and was relocated to the isolation section of the facility.Before patient C’s relocation, an adult and infant child, both of whom had returned from India on the same flight, were quarantined in the adjacent room. The adult and the child completed their 14-day quarantine and tested negative for Covid-19 twice. However, the duo, denoted in the study as case-patients D and E, later showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 while in the community.“We consider that these 2 case-patients were infected while in MIQ,” the researcher said.According to the study, the researchers reviewed closed-circuit television footages between the arrival of patients C, D, and E and the transfer of patient C to the isolation section. The researchers said that there were no instances where the 3 persons were outside of their rooms at the same time.However, during the routine testing within the doorway of hotel rooms on day 12, there was a 50-second window between closing the door to the room of case-patient C and opening the door to the room of case-patients D and E, said the researchers.“Therefore, we hypothesized that suspended aerosol particles were the probable mode of transmission in this instance, and that the enclosed and unventilated space in the hotel corridor probably facilitated this event,” they added.After the mandatory quarantine and repeated negative results for Covid-19, some of the travellers were flown to Auckland on a chartered flight and met household contacts. Two of those contacts, with no recent history of travel outside New Zealand, became infected. The researchers said that they found a genomic link between coronavirus isolated from all nine case-patients.“These findings reinforce the need for rigorous border control processes for countries pursuing Covid-19 elimination, as well as real-time integration of genomic and epidemiologic data to inform outbreak investigations,” they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-transmission-on-flight-from-new-delhi-in-hotel-corridor-study-101616150033499.html
19-03-2021||World||Myanmar security forces kill 9 protesters as Indonesia calls for end to violence||Myanmar security forces shot dead nine opponents of a Feb. 1 coup on Friday, a funeral services provider and media said, as Indonesia urged an end to the violence and the restoration of democracy, in an unusually blunt call from a neighbour.Military and police have used increasingly violent tactics to suppress demonstrations by supporters of detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, but that has not put off the protesters, with crowds turning out again in several towns.Security forces opened fire in a confrontation in the central town of Aungban as they tried to clear a protesters' barricade, media and a witness reported."Security forces came to remove barriers but the people resisted and they fired shots," the witness, who declined to be identified, said by telephone.An official with Aungban's funerary service, who declined to be identified, told Reuters eight people were killed, seven on the spot and one wounded person who died after being taken to hospital in the nearby town of Kalaw.The spokesman for the junta was not immediately available for comment but has previously said security forces have used force only when necessary. Critics have derided that explanation.One protester was killed in the northeastern town of Loikaw, the Myanmar Now news portal said, and there was some shooting in the main city of Yangon, but no word on casualties.Demonstrators were also out in the second city of Mandalay, the central towns of Myingyan and Katha, and Myawaddy in the east, witnesses and media reported.The total number killed in weeks of unrest has risen to at least 233, according to the latest report and a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.'NO MORE VICTIMS'Western countries have condemned the coup and called for an end to the violence and for Suu Kyi's release. Asian neighbours, led by Indonesia, have offered to help find a solution but a March 3 regional meeting failed to make headway.The 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has long held to the principle of not commenting on each other's internal affairs, but there are growing signs the Myanmar crisis is forcing a reassessment of that.In some of the strongest comments from a regional leader on the crackdown, Indonesian President Joko Widodo called for democracy to be restored and for the violence to stop."Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately so that there are no more victims," Jokowi, as he is known, said in a virtual address."The safety and welfare of the people must be the top priority. Indonesia also urges dialogue, that reconciliation is carried out immediately to restore democracy, to restore peace and to restore stability."Myanmar's coup leader, General Min Aung Hlaing, took part in a video conference with regional defence chiefs on Thursday, his first international engagement since seizing power, state television showed.At the meeting, the head of Indonesia's armed forces, Hadi Tjahjanto, expressed concern over the Myanmar situation, the Indonesian military said on its website. Indonesia's army ruled for years but eventually completely withdrew from politics.Singapore has also spoken out against the coup and the killing of protesters and its military chief, Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, said on Facebook he had expressed his "grave concern" at the meeting and urged Myanmar to avoid lethal force.REPORTERS DETAINEDIn Geneva, UN human rights experts denounced forced evictions, arbitrary detentions and the killings of protesters. They said foreign governments should consider pursuing those responsible for crimes against humanity.Ousted lawmakers were exploring whether the International Criminal Court can investigate crimes against humanity since the coup, Myanmar's U.N. envoy, who publicly broke with the junta, said in New York.Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi, 75, is being detained at an undisclosed location and faces accusations of bribery and other crimes that could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.The army has defended its takeover, saying its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election swept by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date.Information within Myanmar is becoming increasingly difficult to verify after authorities have restricted the internet services that protesters use to organise and report.The UN human rights office said this week about 37 journalists had been arrested and two more were detained in the capital, Naypyitaw, on Friday while covering a hearing for an arrested member of Suu Kyi's party, said the Mizzima news portal, the employer of one of them.The other detained reporter was Aung Thura of the British Broadcasting Corp (BBC), it said. The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-kill-9-protesters-as-indonesia-calls-for-end-to-violence-101616149046839.html
19-03-2021||World||Meet Indian-born blockchain entrepreneur Vignesh Sundaresan, the mystery buyer of $69 mn digital artwork||An Indian-born blockchain entrepreneur has revealed himself as the mystery buyer who paid a record $69.3 million for a digital artwork last week, describing his purchase as a shot fired for racial equality.Programmer Vignesh Sundaresan, who is based in Singapore, said in a blog post Thursday that he had purchased the most expensive digital artwork ever sold to "show Indians and people of color that they too could be patrons" of the arts.Around 22 million viewers tuned in to Christies.com on March 11 for the final moments of a bidding process that saw Sundaresan -- under the pseudonym Metakovan -- win the rights to digital artist Beeple's "Everydays: The First 5000 Days".Bidding for the virtual collage of 5,000 images -- the first purely digital NFT-based artwork ever sold by a major auction house -- had started at $100 before the price skyrocketed.An NFT, or a non-fungible token, uses the same blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies to turn anything from art to sports trading cards into virtual collector's items that cannot be duplicated.They have recently taken the art world by storm with many seeing them as an opportunity to monetise digital art of all kinds.These strings of virtual code offer wealthy collectors the bragging rights to ultimate ownership, even if the work can be endlessly shared and viewed online.Investors meanwhile see digital art as a new commodity to be traded."When you think of high-valued NFTs, this one is going to be pretty hard to beat," Sundaresan said anonymously via Christie's, shortly after winning the bid.In the detailed blog post Thursday, he credited his rise from an engineering student with "no money" to a millionaire serial entrepreneur to his discovery of cryptocurrencies in 2013."This is the crown jewel, the most valuable piece of art for this generation," Sundaresan said of the piece, that now ranks third among the most valuable artworks ever sold by a living artist, following works by Jeff Koons and David Hockney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meet-indian-born-blockchain-entrepreneur-vignesh-sundaresan-the-mystery-buyer-of-69-mn-digital-artwork-101616149238351.html
19-03-2021||World||Atlanta shooting: Biden, Harris to meet Asian-American leaders on Georgia visit||President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were planning to promote the newly enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package when they visited Georgia on Friday, but a deadly shooting rampage in the state has changed their plans.A 21-year-old man has been charged with murdering eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three spas in and around Atlanta on Tuesday, rattling Asian Americans already grappling with a rise in hate crimes directed at them since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Biden and Harris will meet community leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community to hear concerns about the killings and discuss a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Thursday.Investigators said the suspect, an Atlanta-area resident who is white, suggested that sexual frustration led him to commit violence. Numerous political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by rising anti-Asian sentiment.Biden has also directed White House officials Cedric Richmond and Susan Rice to engage with the community, Psaki said, and supports recent legislation calling for an expanded Justice Department review of COVID-19-related hate crimes.Given recent events, "the president and the vice president felt it was important to change the trip a little bit and offer their support and condemn the violence," a White House official said.Biden ordered the U.S. flag flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of Tuesday's shootings.The Democratic president kicked off the "Help is Here" campaign on Monday to promote his promise of "shots in arms and money in pockets," after signing the COVID-19 relief bill into law last week, which includes $1,400 stimulus payments to most Americans. Biden has visited Pennsylvania and Harris has been to Nevada and Colorado to tout the benefits of the relief package.Biden and Harris on Friday will also visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to receive an update on the pandemic.They plan to meet as well with Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, whose get-out-the vote efforts are widely credited with helping Biden carry the state last November and Democrats win two U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia this year that gave them control of the chamber.A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House of Representatives this month would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches.Republicans across the country are using former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity."Voting rights is something that is on the minds of everyone on that trip," the White House official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-shooting-biden-harris-to-meet-asian-american-leaders-on-georgia-visit-101616148459203.html
19-03-2021||World||Germany resumes AstraZeneca vaccinations days after clot scare||Germany resumed vaccinations with the coronavirus vaccine made by AstraZeneca on Friday, following a recommendation by European regulators that the benefits of the shot outweigh the risks.The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that the vaccine is safe but it can’t rule out a link to a small number of rare blood clots reported on the continent, and patients should be told to look out for any warning signs.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The move paved the way for more than a dozen European countries, which had suspended use of the shot over the past week, to begin using it again.Authorities in Berlin said two large vaccination centers that offer the AstraZeneca shot to people in the German capital will reopen Friday, and people whose appointments were canceled this week will be able to get the vaccine over the weekend without making a new one.“We’ve got a lot of room as far as vaccinations with AstraZeneca are concerned,” Berlin’s top health official, Dilek Kalayci, told public broadcaster rbb.The suspension of the AstraZeneca shot further slowed Germany’s already sluggish vaccine campaign this week. So far, about 10 million doses have been administered in the country, with 8.4% of the population receiving at least one shot and 3.7% getting both doses.Germany’s disease control agency reported 17,482 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 overnight, and 226 deaths.Lars Schaade, the deputy head of the center, the Robert Koch Institute, said the rate of infections is “now clearly exponential.”Officials have warned that the country could face a return to stricter lockdown measures by Easter.“The rising case numbers could mean that we won't be able to undertake further opening steps in the coming weeks,” said Health Minister Jens Spahn. “On the contrary, we may have to take steps backward.”His comments were a clear message to some state governors who have resisted pulling the “emergency brake” agreed two weeks ago with Chancellor Angela Merkel to reimpose fresh restrictions in regions where the number of new weekly cases rises above 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. The nationwide average stood at 95.6 on Friday.Meanwhile, researchers in Germany say they may have found an effective way to treat the rare cerebral vein blood clots seen in a small number of cases after vaccination. Andreas Greinacher, the head of the department for transfusion medicine at the University of Greifswald, said his team’s research is being submitted to the journal The Lancet for peer review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-resumes-astrazeneca-vaccinations-resume-days-after-clot-scare-101616148109984.html
19-03-2021||World||China says 'strong smell of gunpowder' sensed in US talks||China said Friday a “strong smell of gunpowder and drama” resulted from talks with top American diplomats in Alaska, continuing the contentious tone of the first face-to-face meetings under the Biden administration.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, speaking in Beijing, said American officials at the Alaska meetings had provoked Chinese officials into making a “solemn response” after U.S. officials made “groundless attacks” against Chinese foreign and domestic policies.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi took aim at each other’s country’s policies on Thursday in their meeting in Anchorage.Zhao accused the U.S. side of overrunning the agreed time for opening remarks, prompting the sharp response from the Chinese delegation. The meetings, set to continue Friday, come amid disputes over trade, technology, human rights and China’s territorial claims to Taiwan and islands in the South China and East China seas. China has also strongly objected to U.S. calls for greater transparency about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, the first cases of which were recorded in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.“It was the U.S. side that ... provoked the dispute in the first place, so the two sides had a strong smell of gunpowder and drama from the beginning in the opening remarks. It was not the original intention of the Chinese side," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.At the Alaska meeting, Blinken affirmed U.S. solidarity with its allies in pushing back against China’s increasing efforts to spread its authoritarian mode of government through political and economic pressure. Yang responded with a list of Chinese complaints, accusing Washington of hypocrisy for criticizing Beijing on human rights and other issues at a time when the United States itself has been roiled by domestic discontent.Blinken said China’s actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability, and thus the U.S. was obligated to raise them publicly. Yang responded by accusing the U.S. of failing to deal with its own human rights problems and took issue with what he said was “condescension” from Blinken, Sullivan and other U.S. officials.The State Department also accused the Chinese delegation of exceeding the time limit for opening statements and suggested it seemed "intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-strong-smell-of-gunpowder-sensed-in-us-talks-101616148264023.html
19-03-2021||World||Indonesia to resume use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after reviewing blood clot concerns||Indonesia's Food and Drug agency (BPOM) said on Friday it has approved the usage of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after reviewing reports the vaccine had caused blood clots among some recipients in Europe.In a statement, the agency said that even though vaccination could lead to "adverse events" following immunisation, "the risk of death from Covid-19 is much higher.""The benefits of giving the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine outweigh the risks," the agency said.BPOM did caution against the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people with a low blood platelet count, known as thrombocytopenia, and blood clotting disorders.Indonesia had previously delayed administering the AstraZeneca vaccine following the blood clot reports, saying it was awaiting the results of a review by the World Health Organization (WHO).The European Medicines Agency said this week there were no indication the events were caused by the vaccination, a view echoed by the WHO. AstraZeneca also said its review had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.Indonesia has been grappling with one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia – with 1,437,283 cases and 38,915 deaths.The Southeast Asian nation kicked off its vaccine programme this January, after receiving its first shipment of the CoronaVac vaccine produced by China's Sinovac Biotech.Indonesia received 1.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via the COVAX vaccine-alliance scheme this month and is set to receive some 10 million more in the next two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-to-resume-use-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-after-reviewing-blood-clot-concerns-101616145249288.html
19-03-2021||World||EU resets vaccine effort after chaos that may undermine trust||Europe’s efforts to speed up its Covid-19 vaccination campaign now face the hurdle of damage to public trust after a chaotic week of vaccine suspensions, health scares and export-ban threats.Countries across the European Union, including Germany, France and Spain, are resuming using AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine after temporarily suspending it to investigate a possible blood-clot issue. But while the European Medicines Agency has cleared the shot for use, worries among citizens may linger.Leaders, aware of the hit to confidence, are getting their own jabs to show it’s safe, with French Prime Minister Jean Castex taking his on Friday. Public confidence is crucial for the EU, which is trying to get a grip on a vaccine drive that’s lagging the US and the UK and potentially delaying an economic recovery. The rising pace of cases and a renewed four-week lockdown in parts of France underscore the urgency of the threat.The UK is also working to prevent any damage to its inoculation campaign. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was treated for Covid last year, will get vaccinated, and has said it will “certainly” be the Astra shot.Europe can ill afford uncertainty about vaccine efficacy. The continent’s Covid-19 infection rate has increased for the past three weeks, to an average of 381 per 100,000 people, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The EU is trying to look ahead to the second quarter, when deliveries of vaccines are expected to pick up rapidy. The bloc has approved four shots for use.“You can see that the political environment is getting a bit jittery, very nervous about making progress,’ said Maria Demertzis, deputy director at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. “I don’t think that will have a lasting effect. Within a month, we are going to see an acceleration of vaccination strategies in the EU and by then, things will calm down a little bit.”In Italy, before the formal suspension, initial reports of fatalities of inoculated people had an immediate fallout. One immunization center in the small town of Villorba in the northern Veneto region said people stopped turning up for appointments.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Health Minister Jens Spahn will hold talks with regional leaders later on Friday as they try to speed the country’s sluggish vaccination drive. Spahn said Thursday that the EMA decision “confirms the safety and reliability of the AstraZeneca vaccine.”“I have great confidence that the goal to vaccinate 70% of the adult population before the end of the summer will be reached,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Spanish newspaper El Mundo in an interview published Friday.The EU drug regulator’s announcement capped a tumultuous few days that featured an agonizing back-and-forth over vaccine safety. But while the EMA cleared the shot, it said it couldn’t entirely rule out a link with some rare blood-clotting cases.The EMA’s caveat on the clotting issue could prolong uncertainty that has surrounded the AstraZeneca since the trial phase, when a dosing mistake and different intervals between the two shots created confusion.In Scandinavia, the EMA assurances weren’t enough to persuade national authorities to immediately resume vaccinations. Sweden, Denmark and Norway are keeping suspensions in place pending national reviews.On Thursday, the agency’s executive director, Emer Cooke, sought to dispel lingering doubts, highlighting the bigger threat from the virus.“This pandemic is costing lives,” she said. “We have vaccines that are safe and effective, that can help prevent death and hospitalization. We need to use those vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-resets-vaccine-effort-after-chaos-that-may-undermine-trust-101616144551340.html

19-03-2021||World||Indonesian President calls for ASEAN meeting to discuss Myanmar crisis||Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Friday called for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders to discuss the crisis in Myanmar.In a speech broadcast from the presidential palace in Bogor, West Java, the President said he would soon hold talks with Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah as chair of the ASEAN to discuss the possibility of holding a high-level meeting on the crisis, reported The Strait Times.He urged for democracy, peace, and stability to be restored and violence to be stopped immediately.Indonesia urged for "dialogue and reconciliation to be carried out immediately to restore democracy, to restore peace and to restore stability in Myanmar".Jokowi also expressed his condolences to the victims and their families following the military crackdown against protesters following the Feb 1 coup."On behalf of myself and all Indonesian people, I would like to express my deepest condolences and sympathy to the victims and families of victims as a result of the use of violence in Myanmar," he said."Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately so that there are no more victims," he added. "The safety and welfare of the people must be the top priority."Earlier, ASEAN Foreign Ministers had held an informal online meeting on March 2 to urge the Myanmar military to desist from violence and respect the will of the Myanmar people.The meeting came after the shuttle diplomacy of Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, who has said that ASEAN was ready to facilitate dialogue when required.Wunna Maung Lwin, the top envoy appointed by Myanmar's military regime after the coup, was present at the meeting, reported The Strait Times.Unlike the United States and other Western countries, ASEAN has refrained from condemning the coup in its member state Myanmar owing to a consensus as a key principle in its operations.On February 1, Myanmar's military overthrew the government and declared a year-long state of emergency hours before the newly-elected parliament was due to convene. State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, along with other top officials accused of election fraud, have been placed under house arrest. The coup triggered mass protests across the country.Meanwhile, the total number killed in weeks of unrest has risen to at least 224, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said, noting another death in the commercial hub of Yangon and two in the cities of Monywa and Bago on Thursday, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-president-calls-for-asean-meeting-to-discuss-myanmar-crisis-101616141899814.html
19-03-2021||World||Major challenge for Putin as Russia looks to resolve water crisis in Crimea||A water emergency in Crimea is absorbing billions of taxpayer rubles as Russia tries to patch up an impossible problem stemming from the peninsula’s annexation in 2014. President Vladimir Putin’s Black Sea gem looks increasingly like a millstone.Ukraine dammed the North Crimean Canal seven years ago, cutting off the source of nearly 90% of the region’s fresh water and setting it back to the pre-1960s, when much was arid steppe. Add a severe drought and sizzling temperatures last year, plus years of underinvestment in pipes and drilling, and fields are dry. In the capital Simferopol and elsewhere, water has been rationed.Tiny Crimea gave Putin a boost, when, following protests that overthrew Kyiv’s Russia-friendly government, he seized a territory that belonged to Moscow for centuries but had been part of an independent Ukraine since 1991. The annexation of the territory that’s equal to less than 0.2% of Russia’s total helped lift Putin’s national popularity to record levels in the year or so that followed. That bump has since faded.Today locals, who were made ambitious promises in 2014, are struggling with the fallout from a wide-ranging nationalization drive that's not always served their interests, a poorly handled, muffled coronavirus crisis — and dry taps. Sanctions-inflated prices, high even after a $3.7 billion bridge over the Kerch Strait linked the territory to Russia, have meanwhile eaten away at pension and salary increases. Opinion polls are hard to come by, but anecdotal evidence reveals building frustration.The need to pour even more cash into Crimea means Russians elsewhere may lose out. They’re already suffering in an economy slowed by Western sanctions incurred over that move and other misdeeds, and bearing the brunt of the Kremlin’s decision to focus on stability over growth, limiting pandemic income support. The crisis of 2020, perhaps as much as 2014-2015, has hurt households first and foremost.Crimea cost 1.5 trillion rubles to support in the first five years of occupation, equivalent to roughly two years of Russia’s education budget, according to one former central bank official — more than $20 billion at today’s exchange rate. This year, subsidies, grants and subventions alone will add up to around $1.4 billion. And the price tag is set to rise.Water isn’t the only struggle, but it’s been the toughest to resolve, especially since winning the return of Crimea remains a priority for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Last month, the Simferopol reservoir was 7% full. Without water from the Dnieper River, Crimea’s arable land has shrunk, from 130,000 hectares in 2013 — already a fraction of Soviet-era levels — to 14,000 in 2017. Thirsty crops like rice have shriveled.It wasn't until last year that officials were spurred into significant action on water, with a 48 billion-ruble plan that includes pipe repair to end wastage, well drilling and, crucially, desalination — expensive for crops, but a solace for residents. Government officials said at a Kremlin meeting on Thursday that the problem will be solved.That’s a challenge. Even if there’s more rain this year, it’s long-term access to cheap water that is vital. That could easily be achieved by reopening the canal — an option Kyiv rules out. Barring that, the idea of a self-sufficient Crimea is a distant one, however many Chinese tourism delegations are welcomed in the hope of drumming up new sources of cash.Water disputes are nothing new between neighbors and near-neighbors, from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sparring over the Rogun dam to the Nile and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, or the Mekong, in Southeast Asia. In Crimea, it touches the very heart of Russia’s balancing act, between geopolitical ambition, national pride, rising discontent — and the costly reality of sanctions holding back development in the territory to the point where the Kremlin wants to offer some big-spending investors anonymity.If it isn’t patched up soon, this crisis risks coming to a head at an important time for Putin. He needs a solid win in September’s Duma state assembly and regional elections — the last before 2024, when his current term ends. Russians still overwhelmingly support the annexation of Crimea. It’s less clear that will continue as the resulting costs rise, national growth stagnates and the pandemic endures, potentially prompting other regions to demand their share of spending.The Kremlin faces a difficult pass. After unprecedented street protests over the jailing of critic Alexey Navalny, it’s cranked up efforts to silence naysayers, with social media clampdowns and the mass arrest last weekend of municipal deputies.Could rising political pressure and sheer thirst combine to spark a Russian incursion into Ukraine? Such a move could mean access to the dammed canal, while delivering a timely nationalist boost. But that seems improbable. It would raise questions over plans for the eastern Donbas separatist region, where conflict simmers. And Ukraine is useful bogeyman to explain away the failure to develop Crimea, Maximilian Hess, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, points out — an easier discussion than under-investment and allegations of kleptocracy.Water interests on both sides could even shape helpful, if informal, bargains, Hess adds. One possibility would be for Russia to provide guarantees around disputed access to the Sea of Azov, through which Ukraine exports steel, coal and more. In 2018, Russia seized a group of Ukrainian ships and blocked off the Kerch Strait.The reality is there’s no prospect of an imminent solution. Parched Crimea, where even Russia’s banks fear to tread, is a reminder that the price of international isolation means costly life support and stagnation for all involved.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

19-03-2021||World||Lloyd Austin on mission to deepen India-US ties, urged to raise Russia deal||Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was urged by a senior U.S senator to convey Washington's opposition to India's proposed purchase of Russian air defence systems as he headed to New Delhi on Friday for talks aimed at deepening security ties.Austin is making the first visit by a top member of the Biden administration to Delhi as part of efforts to forge a alliance of countries seeking to push back against China's assertiveness in the region.The leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan - countries together known as the Quad - held a first summit last week pledging to work together for a free and open Indo-Pacific and to cooperate on maritime and cyber security in the face of challenges from China.On Thursday, the deeply strained relations between the United States and China were on rare public display when their top diplomats levelled sharp rebukes of each others' policies in the first high-level, in-person talks of the Biden administration in Alaska.India drew closer to the United States following its own tensions with China on their disputed Himalayan border, where deadly clashes erupted last year. Washington has helped New Delhi, leasing surveillance drones and supplying cold-weather gear for Indian troops.During Austin's visit, the two sides will be discussing India's plan to purchase armed drones from the United States as well as a large order for over 150 combat jets for the air force and the navy to help narrow the gap with China, people with knowledge of the matter said.One thorny issue expected to come up is India's planned purchase of Russian S-400 air defence systems which under U.S. law can attract sanctions. Washington has imposed sanctions on Turkey for buying that equipment.The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, urged Austin to make clear to India officials the Biden administration's opposition to deal.“If India chooses to go forward with its purchase of the S-400, that act will clearly constitute a significant, and therefore sanctionable, transaction with the Russian defense sector under Section 231 of CAATSA," Menendez said in a letter to Austin, referring to the law called Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act."It will also limit India’s ability to work with the U.S. on development and procurement of sensitive military technology. I expect you to make all of these challenges clear in conversations with your Indian counterparts," he said.U.S. firms Boeing and Lockheed are front runners for the multi-billion dollar combat jet deals. An Indian government official said no deals were likely to be announced during the visit and that the talks would cover regional and international security issues."The U.S. and India are close security partners, we expect to have wide ranging discussion with the U.S. side on how to further defence cooperation," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lloyd-austin-on-mission-to-deepen-india-us-ties-urged-to-raise-russia-deal-101616138416675.html

The Kanbawza Tai news portal said on Facebook six people had been killed.Police in the main city of Yangon forced people to clear protesters' barricades, residents said, while demonstrators were also out in the second city of Mandalay, the central towns of Myingyan and Katha, and the eastern town of Myawaddy, witnesses and media reported.The total number killed in weeks of unrest has risen to at least 224, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said earlier.A junta spokesman has said security forces have used force only when necessary but critics have derided that explanation.Myanmar's UN envoy, who publicly broke with the junta, said a committee of ousted lawmakers was looking at ways people can be held accountable for violence following the coup."The ICC is one of them," Kyaw Moe Tun told an event in New York. "We are not a state party to the ICC, but we need to ... explore the ways and means to bring the case to the ICC."In Geneva, United Nations human rights experts denounced forced evictions, arbitrary detentions and the killings of pro-democracy protesters. They said foreign governments should consider pursuing those responsible for crimes against humanity.Hundreds have fled towns and cities since the coup and are sheltering in areas controlled by ethnic minority militias on the Thai border, an official from one group said.People have also crossed the western border into India.INDONESIA ARMY CHIEF CONCERNEDNobel peace laureate Suu Kyi, 75, is hugely popular for her decades-long campaign for democracy.She is being detained at an undisclosed location while facing accusations of bribery and other crimes which could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.Western countries have condemned the coup and called for an end to the violence and for Suu Kyi's release. Asian neighbours have offered to help find a solution, but Myanmar's military has shown no sign of seeking reconciliation.Coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing took part in a video conference with other Southeast Asian defence chiefs on Thursday, his first international engagement since seizing power, state television showed.During the meeting, the head of Indonesia's armed forces, Hadi Tjahjanto, expressed concern over the situation in Myanmar, the Indonesian military said on its website. Indonesia's army ruled for years but later completely withdrew from politics.Indonesia had led diplomatic efforts in Southeast Asia to resolve the crisis but a March 3 regional meeting it helped coordinate failed to make headway.A Myanmar military spokesman did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.EU SANCTIONSThe European Union is due to place sanctions on individual military figures on Monday and then target businesses they run in what would be its most significant response since the coup.The EU's expected sanctions follow a US decision last month to target the military and its business interests. Britain last month froze the assets and placed travel bans on three generals.The army has defended its takeover, saying its accusations of fraud in a November 8 election swept by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date.Information within Myanmar is becoming increasingly difficult to verify after authorities have restricted the internet services that protesters use to organise and post reports and pictures.About 37 journalists have been arrested, including 19 who remain in detention, the UN human rights office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ousted-myanmar-lawmakers-eye-icc-probe-as-another-protester-killed-101616136567154.html

We know that it is in that kind of situation that the virus prospers," he added.According to new guidelines, people will be encouraged to work from home and will be allowed to go outdoors to walk or exercise only after having an 'approval certificate'. They also cannot go further than 10 km from their home. The night time curfew - currently in effect from 6 pm - will be extended to 7 pm when the new measures are implemented, reported CNN.Schools and universities will remain open. Essential businesses will remain open - and these will now include book shops and music shops.Earlier, Castex on Tuesday said that the country has entered 'a kind of third wave' of Covid-19 infections, amid a surge of cases as numerous variants of the virus has affected the nation."The pandemic is playing overtime. We are in what looks like a form of third wave ... characterized by the variants," Castex had said, addressing the parliamentarians.France has so far recorded a total of 4,241,959 infections and 91,833 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University (JHU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-go-into-month-long-lockdown-from-march-19-amid-covid-19-surge-101616131864858.html

The UK government firmly believes that freedom of speech and the right for peaceful protest are vital to any democracy but we also accept that if a protest crosses the line into illegality, security forces in a democracy have the right to enforce law and order," UK Minister of State for Asia Nigel Adams said during a debate in Parliament complex on the issue of peaceful protests and press freedoms in India.On January 26, violence broke out during the farmer tractor rally on the occasion of Republic Day.Protestors broke barricades to enter Delhi and indulged in vandalism across several parts of the national capital during their tractor rally organised to protest against the Centre's three new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-us-senators-say-farm-laws-internal-indian-policy-urges-biden-govt-to-engage-with-pm-modi-on-farmers-protest-101616130194234.html
19-03-2021||World||Outed by online campaign, children of Myanmar junta 'hounded' abroad||Protesting alone outside an Australian hospital where the son of Myanmar’s attorney general works as a doctor, Burmese electrical engineer Susu San is determined to let the military junta know their children will be hounded wherever they go.The 33-year-old woman was hard to miss as she stood in the hospital car park, dressed in a pink track suit, one hand raised in a three-fingered salute of resistance, the other clutching a placard calling for the junta to release Myanmar's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi."They think they are untouchable," said Susu San, having traveled 1,500 km (930 miles) from the northern tip of Queensland to the workplace of one of the "junta children" at a hospital in the small city of Mackay.“This is a way to empower our people by saying that no one can escape from lawlessness and brutality."Since the coup, some protesters have launched an online campaign to denounce family members and associates of the junta in Myanmar and beyond - and spotlight those living comfortably in democratic nations far from the bloody chaos at home.Organisers say it is a non-violent way to put pressure on the junta to reverse the coup and return Myanmar to democracy.“The military understands one language. That is pressure,” said Tun Aung Shwe, a member of the Burmese community in Australia who was among a group that has gone to Canberra to urge the government to sanction people affiliated with the junta."Social punishment is effective as it shakes up the junta, getting them to rethink what they are doing.”Repeated calls to the military and government seeking comment were unanswered.Aside from shaming friends, associates and kin of the junta on social media, activists have also created a website, called socialpunishment.com, information from which has been widely shared on Facebook.The website features more than 120 profiles of people who are accused of failing to speak out against a coup that has halted 10 years of democratic reform and brought bloody suppression.It ranks them on a "traitor" scale from elite to low, and there are photographs of the profiled person, details of their associations, and whereabouts on the globe, making it easy for Burmese in those countries to track them down.As of 2016, there were nearly 33,000 people from Myanmar living in Australia alone.Susu San said her target at the Mackay Base Hospital was 28-year-old doctor Min Ye Myat Phone Khine.According to the website, his mother is the junta's attorney general, Thida Oo, whose office is now crafting legal cases against Suu Kyi. She had served as a permanent secretary in the attorney general's office during the civilian government, and her acceptance of a role in the junta was seen as a deep betrayal by Suu Kyi's supporters.Neither have responded to requests from Reuters for comment, but two days after Susu San's protest Min Ye Myat Phone Khine posted messages for the first time on his Facebook page since the coup, declaring support for the pro-democracy movement."I have come out of the shadow of my parents to walk my own path," he wrote on March 8, "I will stand boldly with the people because I am only one citizen seeking to achieve a true and fair democracy."ETHICAL DOUBTSStill, the campaign against the children of the junta has raised questions among some participants over the ethics of shaming people online because of the actions of their parents.Anger over mass arrests and killings during anti-coup protests outweighed those qualms, campaigners said. An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, said security forces have killed more than 224 people so far. Reuters could not independently confirm this number.Susu San grappled with the ethical complexities of targeting “junta children”, as she calls them, but ultimately decided in her mind that it was ‘fair’, given the number of Burmese being gunned down in the street.Min Ye Myat Phone Khine's earlier failure to speak out against the coup on his social media accounts persuaded Susu San that he was fair game.Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on two children of Myanmar’s military leader Min Aung Hlaing and six companies they control. Britain has sanctioned more than half a dozen generals, banning entry and freezing assets, while Canada said it would take action against nine military officials.The junta has not responded to the imposition of these sanctions, but had said earlier that it had expected sanctions and was not worried by them.In Australia, some in the Myanmar community are campaigning for the government to sanction children of members of the junta by freezing their assets or revoking their visas. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has still to respond to a request from Reuters for comment.Some people targeted in Australia have had their personal information, phone numbers, places of work, and suburbs where they live, published online.The campaign to shame the junta is an extension of wider campaign to boycott military run companies, and isolate individuals who back the coup.This broader campaign, which was inspired by the protest movement, has four pillars: "Don't sell anything to them", "Don't buy anything from them", "Don't associate with them" and "We will never forget."Amara Thiha, a Myanmar fellow at the U.S.-based Stimson Center think-tank, warned that there were signs that going after individuals online could prove counterproductive.He noted a hardening of the language and threats used by soldiers and their supporters on social media as they came under greater pressure. 'PUNISH ME, NOT MY DAUGHTER'Bryan Tun, the son of Myanmar’s commerce minister, Pwint San, is also working as a doctor in Australia. Though not listed on the website, Tun said he has been abused on social media even though he is a longtime supporter of Suu Kyi’s party, posts messages of support for the protest movement and disagrees with his father politically."I have been socially punishing him since this thing happened. I have been openly protesting against him," said Tun, 28, a doctor at Redland Hospital in Queensland.Reuters could not reach Pwint San for comment.Despite his experience, Tun said he still believed the online campaign was a valid act of resistance."I think that is one of the very few weapons that people have," he told Reuters. "They [the military] are killing people on the streets with guns."But some targets of the online campaign feel victimised.One of the first to be attacked online was Nan Lin Lae Oo, a student the social punishment campaign identified as the daughter of Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swar Lin.Dubbed a “murderer’s daughter”, pictures of her were plastered around the Toyo University campus in Tokyo, where she is studying. Activists have urged the university to expel her.Reuters was unable to contact either the general or his daughter for comment. The Myanmar military has not answered calls.A Toyo University spokesman, Masakazu Saito, said the university was now consulting with police, but declined to comment further, citing concerns for the student's safety.The police declined to comment.Some parents have made impassioned pleas on social media, like the wife of a retired senior military officer, Htin Zaw Win, whose daughter was identified, by the "Civil Disobedience Movement Naming & Shaming" on its Facebook page, as a student at Yangon's University of Medicine 1.“You can do any kind of social punishment to me, the mother," Khin Khin Aye Cho wrote on Facebook. "If it will satisfy you to beat both parents to death, then I will accept anytime and I will sacrifice my blood for my daughter."Please allow my daughter, the daughter of retired military family, Ayebhone Pyaecho's life to grow.Reuters was unable to contact any of the family. They have refrained from social media since that post.(Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in Tokyo and Reuters staff.

Sobrato, the board chairman.O'Brien gave the service at Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, one of the most prominent Catholic churches in Washington, in January for Biden, who is the nation's second Catholic president, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, their families and elected officials before the inauguration ceremony at the U.S. Capitol.The priest has known Biden's family for about 15 years, according to the university. O’Brien was then serving at Georgetown University, another Jesuit college. O'Brien has been president of Santa Clara University since July 2019.Sobrato's statement, posted Monday to the university's website, did not specify the allegations against O'Brien but said the trustees “support those who came forward to share their accounts.”Sobrato said that while O'Brien is on leave, the priest will be cooperating with the independent investigation, with conclusions to be shared with the Santa Clara University Board of Trustees. O'Brien didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.O’Brien joined the Society of Jesus in 1996, according to the university, and was ordained to the priesthood in 2006.Located in Silicon Valley, the Jesuit institution has an annual undergraduate enrollment of roughly 5,500 students. It has a million-dollar endowment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/priest-who-presided-over-inaugural-mass-for-biden-faces-probe-in-california-101616130806869.html
19-03-2021||World||Britain to slow Covid-19 vaccine rollout due to delay in supplies from India||Britain will have to slow its Covid-19 vaccine rollout next month due to a supply crunch caused by a delay in a shipment of millions of AstraZeneca shots from India and the need to test the stability of an additional 1.7 million doses.Supply constraints are the biggest threat to Britain's vaccine rollout - currently the swiftest among the world's major economies - and health officials warned that the programme would face a significant reduction in supplies from March 29."It is true that in the short term we're receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago," Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference, saying this was because of a delay in a shipment from India's Serum Institute and because a batch in the UK needed to be retested."As a result, we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March, but that is still more than we received in February, and the supply we do have will still enable us to hit the targets we have set," he said.Earlier, health minister Matt Hancock had said that while Britain was currently in the middle of some "bumper weeks of supply", a batch of 1.7 million vaccine doses had been delayed as it had to be retested for stability. He didn't specify the manufacturer.Britain is using vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, with 10 million doses of the 100 million ordered from AstraZeneca coming from the Serum Institute.A spokesman for the Serum Institute said it had delivered 5 million doses to Britain a few weeks ago, adding it would "try to supply more later, based on the current situation and requirement for the government immunisation programme in India".Serum Institute Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla was quoted by the Daily Telegraph newspaper as saying that supplies were dependent on how many doses the Indian government allowed to go to the United Kingdom.But, with Britain already at loggerheads with the European Union over vaccine exports, Johnson struck a conciliatory tone, saying he did not think India had blocked any deliveries and wanted to work with Europe too.Pressed on whether the Indian government had stopped exports of vaccine to Britain, Johnson said: "No, no, there is a delay as there often is, caused for various technical reasons, but we hope to continue to work very closely with the Serum Institute, and indeed with partners around the world including on the European continent."Israel is the leader in vaccinating its population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Chile and then the United Kingdom - and investors are watching closely to see which economies could recover first.More than half of all adults in England have had their first Covid-19 vaccine. For the United Kingdom as a whole, just under half of adults have had their first dose.VACCINE ROWWhile Britain tries to secure more vaccines, it is also facing growing anger from the European Union, which on Wednesday threatened to slap a ban on vaccine exports to Britain.Hancock said that European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen should respect contract law and that Britain expected to get the deliveries it had ordered."There are very significant consequences to breaking contract law," Hancock said.Britain imports Pfizer's vaccine from Europe, but despite the spat, Johnson said people should not be anxious about supplies from the EU."These vaccines are a multinational effort and they are produced as the result of international cooperation and we in the UK will continue to view it in that spirit," he said.Pfizer and AstraZeneca said on Wednesday their delivery schedules had not been affected. An AstraZeneca spokesman said on Wednesday that the "UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption".Britain's medicines regulator said there had been five cases of a rare type of blood clot in the brain among 11 million people given AstraZeneca's vaccine but said that it found the benefits of the shot far outweighed any possible risks.England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said anecdotal reports suggested that some people had not turned up to vaccination appointments after the shot was suspended in some European countries, but record numbers were still being vaccinated.Hancock denied rumours that the delays would mean no adults would get a first dose of the vaccine in April, but said it was important to make sure there was enough vaccine to give people a second dose within 12 weeks of their first.He also said that Britain was on target to offer everyone over 50 a first shot by mid-April, and a shot to all adults by the end of July. He added that a roadmap for lifting lockdown restrictions in England was unaffected.Earlier, housing minister Robert Jenrick said that supplies would pick up again in May, and Moderna Inc has said it is expecting first deliveries of its vaccine to Britain to start in April.Hancock said Britain expected doses of Moderna's vaccine to arrive "in the coming weeks".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-slow-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-due-to-delay-in-supplies-from-india-101616128881535.html
19-03-2021||World||President Biden urged to rescind Trump-era ban on H-1B, other foreign work visas||Five powerful Democratic senators on Thursday urged President Joe Biden to rescind his predecessor Donald Trump’s ban on some non-immigrant visas, including the H-1B visa which is popular among Indian IT professionals, saying this creates uncertainties for US employers, their foreign-born professional workers and their families.In June 2020, Trump instituted Proclamation 10052, halting the processing of non-immigrant H-1B, L-1, H-2B, and J-1 visas, based on the alleged potential risk to the labour market.Although Proclamation 10052 is set to expire on March 31, 2021, businesses have indicated that inaction will further harm their businesses and economic recovery.The senators said that because the visas that Proclamation 10052 halted either target low-unemployment professions or require that the visa holder does not displace an American worker, businesses that rely on foreign workers have struggled to fill jobs despite increased unemployment.Reports have suggested that jobs in fields such as information technology -- which H-1B visa holders would have filled -- have remained open or were moved overseas, said senators Michael Bennet, Jeanne Shaheen, Angus King, Cory Booker, and Bob Menendez.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.“The continuation of this ban creates delays and uncertainties for US employers, their foreign-born professional workers, and their families,” wrote the senators in a letter to President Biden.“Rather than attracting talented individuals to the United States, allowing these bans to remain in effect makes the immigration system harder to navigate and drives foreign talent to other countries,” they wrote.Additionally, many businesses in seasonal communities that Proclamation 10052 has affected rely on foreign workers to meet the demand of the high-visitation summer months.Failing to revoke the visa ban immediately threatens both workers and employers in these communities who cannot adequately and safely prepare for the surge season, they said.“Every day these visa bans remain in place undermines our collective vision for a new, more prosperous and welcoming nation. We urge you to follow through on your promise to rescind Proclamation 10052 without delay, resume timely processing of nonimmigrant visas, and direct US Embassies and Consulates to open up visa appointments for nonimmigrant visas as soon as possible,” the senators wrote.Despite the increased unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), businesses that rely on foreign workers struggled to fill jobs as the nonimmigrant categories affected by PP10052 either target low-unemployment professions (e.g., H-1B and L-1 visas) or require that the nonimmigrant will not displace an American worker (e.g., H-2B, J-1), the senators wrote.The H-2B programme allows US employers or agents “to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs.”“Several of these categories (H-2B and J-1 Summer Work Travel and Camp Counselor) by regulation are seasonal and heavily used during the summer months when seasonal communities across the country welcome an influx of visitors.The J-1 visa is an exchange visitor visa for individuals approved to participate in work-and-study-based exchange visitor programmes in the United States.The L-1 Visa is reserved for managerial or executive professionals transferring to the US from within the same company, or a subsidiary of it."Failing to revoke the Proclamation immediately places these programmes at risk because both workers and employers cannot adequately prepare for the surge season,” they wrote.Looking ahead to long-term economic recovery, the deficit of foreign workers to fill available American tech jobs will worsen through any further lack of access to foreign talent, they said.“Reports also suggest that many jobs in fields such as information technology that would have been filled by H-1B nonimmigrants have remained open or were moved permanently overseas."Moreover, these same businesses have also noted that Proclamation 10052, coupled with defunct executive orders, has kept U.S. citizens and permanent residents separated from their parents, adult children, and siblings,” the senators wrote.“We believe that it’s possible to continue processing these visas while also preventing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. This specific Proclamation is not premised on the safety and welfare of American citizens,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-urged-to-rescind-trump-era-ban-on-h-1b-other-foreign-work-visas-101616129059265.html

"This case has been assessed by Health Canada and determined not to be related to the vaccine."Earlier, the European Union said the vaccine was "safe and effective" and British regulators said its use should continue, after reports of rare blood clots prompted over a dozen countries to suspend the use of the vaccine.Germany, France and other European nations have since announced plans to resume using the vaccine.Health Canada also said it had assessed available data on the events and had determined the shot was not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots.The country is using AstraZeneca doses made at the Serum Institute of India. It has received 500,000 doses and expects to get 1.5 million more by May.

19-03-2021||World||Biden admin urged to raise China's aggressive behaviour in its neighbourhood including India, Taiwan||On the eve of the crucial US-China meeting in Alaska, a group of 20 influential lawmakers urged President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to lend support for Taiwan, raise the issue of its aggressive acts in South China Sea and against its neighbours, including India."While the United States is focused on encouraging multilateralism in the South China Sea, China continuously undermines these efforts, engages in malign and aggressive activity in the Indo-Pacific region, and commits egregious human rights atrocities. China shamelessly demonstrates a blatant disregard for human rights and a lack of respect for international diplomacy," wrote the lawmakers led by Congresswoman Ashley Hinson on Thursday.“It commits horrific genocide against its own Uyghur population, attacks Hong Kong’s democracy, engages in unwarranted combat at the India-China Line of Actual Control, and incessantly increases the militarization of the Taiwan Strait. Clearly, the CCP is not aligned with American interests or values,” they wrote.“As we work to strengthen diplomatic and economic relations in the region, China abuses its economic power through coercive trade policies that aim to force vulnerable countries to alter their trade relationships with the US. These unfair practices directly hurt US farmers and producers, as China treats them as pawns in its quest for global influence," said the lawmakers in their letter addressed jointly to Biden, Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.The lawmakers said it is imperative that the Biden administration stands up to China’s attempts to dismantle democracy and reaffirm that US support for Taiwan is non-negotiable.“Taiwan has become one of our strongest allies over the past forty years; the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances demonstrate the unwavering, bipartisan support of this important relationship. Taiwan has proven its commitment to the United States time after time, most recently by removing barriers to trade to create an important market for US agriculture producers and communicating its desire to engage in security issues in the South China Sea,” they wrote.The lawmakers commended Biden and the leaders of Japan, Australia, and India on their quadrilateral cooperation, particularly as it relates to their joint effort to combat the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.“We respectfully suggest you welcome the important perspective of allies in the Indo-Pacific region, such as Taiwan, while you continue these discussions. Taiwan, which provided the US with direct support through personal protective equipment donations at the beginning of the pandemic, would be a valuable voice at the international table,” the lawmakers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-urged-to-raise-china-s-aggressive-behaviour-in-its-neighbourhood-including-india-taiwan-101616121350606.html
19-03-2021||World||China to open first trial of Canadians held on 'spy' charges for over 2 years||China was expected to open the first trial Friday for one of two Canadians who have been held for more than two years in apparent retaliation for Canada’s arrest of a senior Chinese telecom executive.Canada said its consular officials were not given permission to attend the proceedings despite several requests. They have been notified that a court hearing for Michael Spavor would be held Friday, and one for Michael Kovrig would follow on Monday.China has not publicly confirmed the court dates, and calls to the court in Dandong, the northeastern city where Spavor was charged, went unanswered.Sidewalks were roped off with police tape and journalists were kept at a distance as police cars and vans with lights flashing entered the the court complex, located beside the Yalu River that divides China from North Korea.The Canadian Embassy's Deputy Chief of Mission Jim Nickel knocked on a door to the court seeking entry but was refused. He was told the trial would begin at 10 a.m. but was given no word on how long it would last or when a verdict would be announced.Another 10 diplomats from eight countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, stood on the street opposite the courthouse in a show of support.International and bilateral treaties required that China provide Canadian diplomats access to the trial, but the court said Chinese law regarding trials on state security charges overrode such obligations, Nickel said.“The official notification received from Chinese authorities indicated that these trials are closed to both the public and the media," Canada Global Affairs spokesperson Christelle Chartrand said on Thursday.Spavor and Kovrig were detained in December 2018, days after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested at the request of the U.S. at the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia. The U.S. is seeking her extradition to face fraud charges related to her company’s dealings with Iran.The two Canadians have been held ever since, while Meng has been released on bail. They were charged in June 2020 with spying under China’s national security laws.Spavor, an entrepreneur with North Korea-related business, was charged with spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets. Kovrig, an analyst and former diplomat, was charged with spying for state secrets and intelligence in collaboration with Spavor.Prosecutors have not released details of the charges and trial proceedings in national security cases are generally held behind closed doors. The state-owned Global Times newspaper said Kovrig was accused of having used an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig.In Vancouver on Thursday, Meng’s lawyers told an extradition hearing Canadian officials abused their power when they conspired with the U.S. to arrest her. Defense lawyer Tony Paisana said Canadian Border Services Agency officers took Meng’s phones, obtained their passwords, then handed to them to Canadian police so the data could be shared with the FBI.Paisana said Meng was never told during questioning that she faced an arrest warrant in the U.S. and would have immediately asked for a lawyer if so informed. British Columbia Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes suggested border officers would have questioned Meng more rigorously if their exam was actually a covert criminal investigation, as her lawyers said.China has demanded Meng’s immediate and unconditional release, saying the U.S. engineered her detention as part of a drive to contain China’s growing rise. Canadian authorities say Kovrig and Spavor were arbitrarily arrested to put pressure on Ottawa and say they should be released without charge.China has also restricted various Canadian exports, including canola oil seed, and handed death sentences to another four Canadians convicted of drug smuggling.Outside the courthouse, Nickel said Canada still held hope that Spavor and Kovrig could be released through joint efforts with the U.S., whose Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan are currently holding their first face-to-face talks with China's top diplomats in Anchorage, Alaska.“So we're hopeful that, in some measure, this trial may too lead to their immediate release," Nickel said.___Associated Press writers Rob Gillies in Toronto and Jim Morris in Vancouver, British Columbia contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-open-first-trial-of-canadians-held-on-spy-charges-for-over-2-years-101616121620514.html
19-03-2021||World||'I am not a virus:' Asian-American lawmakers reject bigotry||Asian-American lawmakers on Thursday described harrowing discrimination -- including a congresswoman's personal experience in historic abuse by the government -- as they testified about the national tragedy of racism highlighted by this week's Atlanta murders.A congressional hearing turned personal as Democrats vented about how former president Donald Trump and others have demonized Asians as responsible for the coronavirus, with one warning that such language has put a "bull's eye" on the backs of Asian Americans and Pacific islanders."I have a responsibility and a moral obligation to speak out about the normalizing of attacks on the AAPI community," said congresswoman Doris Matsui, a 76-year-old Californian.During World War II, the US government forcibly relocated Matsui's Japanese-American parents and grandparents to an internment camp in Poston, Arizona."They lived in appalling conditions, surrounded by a barbed wire fence, armed guards on towers, incarcerated solely because of their ancestry."Matsui was born in the very camp where her family was held."Our government, and many of its leaders, advanced the myth that the Japanese-American community was inherently the enemy," she said. "Americans across the country believed it, acceded to institutionalized racism, and acted on it."- 'Please stop' -The testimony by congresswomen Matsui, Grace Meng and Judy Chu, and Senator Tammy Duckworth, came after six women of Asian descent were murdered Tuesday in Georgia.Experts say anti-Asian violence has risen substantially nationwide since the pandemic took hold one year ago.Trump famously called Covid-19 the "China virus," congressional Republicans regurgitated the rhetoric, and attacks on Asian-Americans apparently spiked."Our community is bleeding. We are in pain, and for the last year we've been screaming out for help," Meng, a 45-year-old New Yorker of Taiwanese descent, told the House judiciary subcommittee on civil rights.The panel heard how Asian Americans have been verbally harassed, slapped, spat on, and stabbed.When House Republican Chip Roy warned that the hearing was an attempt at "policing" free speech, he drew rebukes."I am not a virus," congressman Ted Lieu, who was born in Taiwan and served in the US Air Force, reminded Roy."Whatever political points you think you're scoring by using ethnic identifiers in describing this virus, you're harming Americans who happen to be of Asian descent," he added."So please stop doing that."Anti-Asian attacks continue. Nearly 3,800 have been reported since last year, the group Stop AAPI Hate says.Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at University of Minnesota, said Asian Americans have been "terrorized," and the ongoing abuse marks "a systemic national tragedy" that won't just disappear after the pandemic."We have heard in the past 24 hours many describe the anti-Asian discrimination and violence as un-American," she said."Unfortunately, it is very American."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-am-not-a-virus-asian-american-lawmakers-reject-bigotry-101616120796526.html

Beard stopped short of calling that person a suspect but said he wanted to reassure people they weren't looking for anybody else in connection to the attack.“A double homicide is a tragedy and there are going to be family members out there who are grieving,” Beard told reporters.He said police were called to the house in the suburb of Epsom at about 11:30 am and found three people in critical condition.Beard said medics provided first aid to two of the injured but both of them — a man and a woman — died at the scene. He said the third critically injured person was taken to a hospital and was undergoing surgery Friday afternoon.Beard said the four people appeared to know each other. He said the investigation was still in its early stages and he couldn't yet offer a detailed account of what happened or any possible motive for the killings.Epsom lawmaker David Seymour said he was shocked and saddened by the deaths.

19-03-2021||World||Top American, Chinese diplomats clash at start of 1st talks of Biden presidency||The United States and China leveled sharp rebukes of each others' policies in the first high-level, in-person talks of the Biden administration on Thursday, with deeply strained relations of the two global rivals on rare public display during the meeting's opening session in Alaska.The United States, which quickly accused China of "grandstanding" and violating the meeting's protocol, had been looking for a change in behavior from China, itself having expressed earlier this year a hope to reset sour relations.On the eve of the talks, Beijing had presaged what would be a contentious meeting, with its ambassador to Washington saying the United States was full of illusions if it thinks China will compromise.Sparring in a highly unusual extended back-and-forth in front of cameras, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan opened their meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi in Anchorage, fresh off of Blinken's visits to allies Japan and South Korea."We will ... discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies," Blinken said in blunt public remarks."Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability," he said.Yang responded with a 15-minute speech in Chinese while the U.S. side awaited translation, lashing out about what he said was the United States' struggling democracy, poor treatment of minorities, and criticizing its foreign and trade policies."The United States uses its military force and financial hegemony to carry out long arm jurisdiction and suppress other countries," Yang said."It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China," he added."Let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength," Yang said."...the U.S. side was not even qualified to say such things, even 20 years or 30 years back, because this is not the way to deal with the Chinese people..."PROTOCOLApparently taken aback by Yang's remarks, Blinken held journalists in the room so he could respond.Sullivan said the United States did not seek conflict with China, but would stand up for its principles and friends. He touted this year's Mars rover landing success, and said the United States' promise was in its ability constantly to reinvent itself.What is typically a few minutes of opening remarks in front of journalists for such high-level meetings lasted for more than an hour, and the two delegations tussled about when media would be ushered out of the room.Following the exchange, a senior U.S. administration official said China had immediately "violated" agreed-to protocol, which was two minutes of opening statements by each of the principals."The Chinese delegation ... seems to have arrived intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance," the official told reporters in Alaska.The United States would continue with its meeting as planned, the official said, adding that "exaggerated diplomatic presentations often are aimed at a domestic audience."Before taking office, U.S. President Joe Biden had been attacked by Republicans who feared his administration would take too soft an approach with China. But in recent weeks, top Republicans have given the president a gentle nod for revitalizing relations with U.S. allies in order to confront China, a shift from former President Donald Trump's go-it-alone "America First" strategy.While much of Biden's China policy is still being formulated, including how to handle the tariffs on Chinese goods implemented under Trump, his administration has so far placed a stronger emphasis on democratic values and allegations of human rights abuses by China.Michael McCaul, the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Yang's conduct showed China had no plans to change its ways."Their belligerence and false accusations should serve as a wake-up call to the Biden administration about exactly who they are dealing with," he said.'PRETTY TOUGH' CONVERSATIONSWashington says Blinken's Asia tour before the meeting with Chinese officials, as well as U.S. outreach to Europe, India and other partners, shows how the United States has strengthened its hand to confront China since Biden took office in January.But the two sides appear primed to agree on very little at the talks, which were expected to run into the Anchorage evening and continue on Friday.Even the status of the meeting has become a sticking point, with China insisting it is a "strategic dialogue", harkening back to bilateral mechanisms of years past. The U.S. side has explicitly rejected that, calling it a one-off session.On the eve of the talks, the United States issued a flurry of actions directed at China, including a move to begin revoking Chinese telecoms licenses, subpoenas to multiple Chinese information technology companies over national security concerns, and updated sanctions on China over a rollback of democracy in Hong Kong."We're expecting much of these conversations will be pretty, pretty tough," a senior U.S. administration official told reporters in Alaska before the meeting began.Yang questioned Blinken on Thursday about whether the sanctions were announced ahead of the meeting on purpose."Well, I think we thought too well of the United States, we thought that the U.S. side would follow the necessary diplomatic protocols," he said.China, however, indicated this week that it is set to begin trials of two Canadians detained in December 2018 on spying charges soon after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of telecoms equipment company Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. warrant.Meng awaits the outcome of a case that could see her extradited to the United States, but China's foreign ministry rejected assertions that the timing of the trials was linked to the Anchorage talks.Washington has said it is willing to work with China when it is in the interests of the United States and has cited climate change policy and the coronavirus pandemic as examples. Blinken said Washington hoped to see China uses its influence with North Korea to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.The largest group representing exiled Uighurs wrote to Blinken urging him to demand that Beijing close its internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where U.N. experts say more than 1 million members of the ethnic group and other Muslim minorities have been held.Blinken had pledged to raise the issue, his State Department having upheld a Trump administration determination that Beijing was perpetrating genocide in Xinjiang, something China vehemently denies.Yang said China firmly opposed U.S. interference in its internal affairs. The United States should handle its own affairs and China its own, he said.Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the tough statements from both sides in the run-up to the meeting had created a potential risk that it would devolve into an exchange of accusations and demands."Neither side benefits from this meeting being judged a total failure," Glaser said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-american-chinese-diplomats-clash-at-start-of-1st-talks-of-biden-presidency-101616118453587.html

SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and supplies to the moon on a single mission, claims the agency."The SLS is the most powerful rocket NASA has ever built, and during today’s test the core stage of the rocket generated more than 1.6 million pounds of thrust within seven seconds. The SLS is an incredible feat of engineering and the only rocket capable of powering America’s next-generation missions that will place the first woman and the next man on the Moon,” said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk.“Today’s successful hot fire test of the core stage for the SLS is an important milestone in NASA’s goal to return humans to the lunar surface – and beyond," he added.The previous and the first hot fire test of the SLS core stage was conducted on January 16 which ended earlier than planned. The longer duration test provided the agency with a wealth of information on a variety of operational conditions, including moving the four engines in specific patterns, powering them up to 109 per cent, throttling down and back up as they will during the flight.Also Read | Georgia shooting: Cops search for motive as Asian Americans decry attacksThe core stage of the SLS rocket has a complex network of flight software and avionics systems to help fly, track and steer the rocket during launch and flight. The two propellant tanks in the core stage hold over 700,000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to fuel the engines.Industry partners like Boeing, the prime contractor for the core stage, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, the prime contractor for the RS-25 engines, are also involved in the mission.The SLS rocket is one of the backbones of Nasa for deep space exploration.

The four victims in Atlanta and two of the dead in Cherokee County were women of Asian descent."Nothing is off the table for our investigation," Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton said at a news conference in response to a question about whether police were looking at the killings as possible hate crimes."We had four Asian females that were killed, and so we are looking at everything to make sure that we discover and determine what the motive of our homicides was," he said.Investigators have determined that Long had previously frequented both spas in Atlanta where he is accused of opening fire with a 9mm gun he purchased earlier in the day.Investigators said Long, a 21-year-old Atlanta-area resident who is white, suggested to them that sexual frustration led him to commit violence. Numerous political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by rising anti-Asian sentiment since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.President Joe Biden ordered the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of Tuesday's rampage. He and Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Atlanta on Friday to offer support to the Asian-American community.In Washington, U.S. lawmakers, professors and actor Daniel Dae Kim said the Asian-American community was reeling from a year of heightened anti-Asian attacks and discrimination."Our community is bleeding, we are in pain and for the last year we've been screaming out for help," Democratic Representative Grace Meng, who is of Taiwanese descent, told a House of Representatives subcommittee on Thursday.The Georgia killings have prompted police departments to step up patrols and visibility in Asian-American communities around the country, including New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco.The incidence of hate crimes against Asian Americans rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.Civil rights advocates have connected the rise in incidents to the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China. Some Americans, including Republican former President Donald Trump, started calling the coronavirus the "China virus," "the China plague" and even the "kung flu."Hampton said Long patronized both establishments attacked in Atlanta, the Gold Spa beauty salon and an aromatherapy spa across the street, but it was not clear whether he "specifically targeted" any of the victims at those two businesses.Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department said on Wednesday that Long had confessed to the shootings and indicated he had a sex addiction and "wanted to eliminate" the temptation the establishments represented to him.A former roommate who spent several months living with Long in a halfway house for recovering addicts told Reuters Long had been treated for sex addiction, was "deeply religious" and would become "very emotionally distraught that he frequented" spas for "explicitly sexual activity."Long was headed for Florida when he was apprehended, perhaps to carry out further shootings, authorities said.Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace issued a statement on Thursday saying "much work on the investigation and prosecution remains ahead" and vowing to "prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law."Long had been scheduled to make his initial court appearance in Cherokee County on Thursday, but the hearing was canceled after he waived his right to the proceeding, according to a statement from his lawyer.The attorney, Daran Burns, said his firm had been appointed to represent Long by the county's Office of Indigent Defense, and that Burns met with his client at the county jail on Wednesday.Burns made no mention of Long's guilt or innocence, but said his firm "will conduct a thorough investigation on our client's behalf."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-shooting-cops-search-for-motive-as-asian-americans-decry-attacks-101616118960056.html

19-03-2021||World||Atlanta shooting: Asian American churches plan acts beyond prayer for healing||Asian American Christian leaders said Thursday their congregations are saddened and outraged after a white gunman killed eight people — most of them women of Asian descent — at three Atlanta-area massage parlors. And they're calling for action beyond prayers.Asian Americans were already rattled by a wave of racist attacks amid the spread of the coronavirus pandemic across the United States. While the motive behind Tuesday's rampage remains under investigation, some see it as a wake-up call to stand up against a rise in violence against the community.The lead pastor at Korean Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, located a few miles from two of the spas that were targeted, said he will ask congregants during his Sunday sermon to “not just pray, not just worry," because "it’s time for us to act.”“I’m going to urge people with love and peace that we need to step up and address this issue, so that ... our next generation should not be involved in tragic ... violence,” the Rev. Byeong Han said. “That’s what Christians need to do.”South Korea’s Foreign Ministry says diplomats in Atlanta have confirmed with police that four of the dead were women of Korean descent, and are working to determine their nationality.Jane Yoon, a congregant at Korean Central Presbyterian and a 17-year-old high school junior in nearby Marietta, said she increasingly worries for her family, which is of Korean descent, and was shocked by the killings.“I was definitely very outraged," she said. "I was in shock at first of the news and just also how close it is to my community.”It also hit home on a very personal level: Last week, she said, she was in a car accident and another driver punched her in the face and body before she was able to call 911. Yoon said the woman, who was arrested, did not make any racist comments during the assault, but she couldn't help but think about rising attacks against Asian Americans.Following that incident, she has been getting spiritual guidance and counseling from the congregation.Also Read: Georgia massage parlour shootings leave 8 dead, 1 suspect captured at AcworthIn the Atlanta suburb of Roswell, the Rev. Jong Kim of Grace Korean Presbyterian Church said he found a glimmer of hope in the wake of the killings after a woman reached out to donate $100 to his church “to express her feelings of sorrow to the Asian community.”Kim spoke to several other Korean pastors in the area Thursday, and they now plan to join the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, through which they hope to have discussions about issues of race and ethnicity and provide funeral service assistance for the victims' families.The Atlanta chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice has said that while details of the shooting are still emerging, “the broader context cannot be ignored.” The attacks, it said, “happened under the trauma of increasing violence against Asian Americans nationwide, fueled by white supremacy and systemic racism.”Ripples from the killings have been felt well beyond Atlanta.In Chicago, Garden City Covenant Church invited Asian Americans “in need of a community who understands your pain” to join an online meeting in which they could “share, listen, lament and pray” together.“There were a lot of tears, and there were a lot of questions, and for many I think there is a sense also of helplessness,” said Gabriel J. Catanus, the lead pastor, who is Filipino American. The church’s diverse congregation includes about 60 percent Filipino Americans, he said, along with worshippers from Latino and other communities.“It’s an important Biblical practice, and Christian practice, to come before God honestly and to pour one’s own heart out before God,” he said. “God can handle even the rage and the devastation that comes out of us at times.”Catanus said he was glad to see that people are now “more awakened” to the experiences of Asian Americans. But he said much works remains to be done in faith communities and called on religious leaders to denounce anti-Asian racism from their pulpits.“In the Christian community and in our Christian institutions, specifically, we need to confess that we have in many ways failed to lead and to teach our people,” he said. “Our discipleship has failed in many ways to address these very powerful forces that have led to violence and death.”Kevin Park, an associate pastor at Korean Central Presbyterian Church, said not only Asian Americans but the whole country needs to speak out against the violence, racism and “more subtle marginalization” that have been suffered for generations.“There’s opportunities among faith communities that we need to stand up together and reach out to communities that are hurting, not only Asian American communities but other communities of color,” he said.“And I think there needs to be kind of this movement toward solidarity. ... We’re all in this together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-american-churches-plan-acts-beyond-prayer-for-healing-101616118015597.html

A source close to the royal family revealed to People Magazine that Prince William is looking out for his wife, and growing more protective of her after this accusation."William is very protective of Kate and can get very angry. For Meghan to name Kate in a negative light is worse than being attacked himself," the source close to Prince William told People magazine.Meghan's controversial statements were also followed by an explanation that Kate apologised to her after the incident."And I don't say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding, and she was upset about something. But she owned it, and she apologized and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing," the Duchess of Sussex said during the tell-all interview.After the interview, the royals and the staff members were filled with "anger", disclosed the source.Making further revelations, the insider also told that the Duke of Cambridge is feeling "fiercely protective over his wife" and "he's unhappy with Markle's mention of Middleton".However, after mentioning Kate, the duo refused to name further royal family members regarding a discussion that took place between Harry and other members about the 'concerns' over the Prince's then-unborn son Archie's skin tone.Meghan had also revealed that she was denied help when she felt suicidal, among many other bombshell revelations.Meghan and Harry's CBS special with Oprah marked the couple's first joint interview since their royal exit, which was recently made permanent. In the interview, the duo discussed the reasons behind their decision to step back from their royal duties, which they had first announced in January 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-very-protective-of-kate-after-meghan-harry-s-interview-101616113270945.html

With the death of one person, the death toll reached 3,015.So far, more than two million people have been tested in the country.There are 1,000 active cases in the country, the ministry said, adding that 271,610 people have so far recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-nepal-to-resume-cross-border-transportation-with-india-101616112567894.html
19-03-2021||World||US to push more 'aggressive' messaging effort to deter migrants||The U.S. government will be "more aggressive" in telling migrants not to come to the United States, a top U.S. official said on Thursday, after earlier warnings failed to stem the flow of thousands of Central Americans to the U.S.-Mexico border."The message isn't, 'Don't come now,' it's, 'Don't come in this way, ever,'" Roberta Jacobson, the White House's southern border coordinator, told Reuters in an interview. "The way to come to the United States is through legal pathways."The Biden administration is wrestling with a growing humanitarian crisis at the southern U.S. border, where an uptick in the number of migrants fleeing violence, natural disasters and economic hardship in Central America is testing President Joe Biden's commitment to a more humane immigration policy.Biden's promise to end former President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies has been complicated by a recent spike in the number of migrants crossing the border illegally. U.S. officials are struggling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in jail-like border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.The Biden administration's message to would-be migrants has become stricter in recent days amid intense criticism from opposition Republicans that Biden's relaxation of some of Trump's policies has encouraged people to come to the United States.Biden officials initially said migrants should not come to the United States now, but that they could come later. In an interview with ABC on Tuesday, Biden took a firmer stance, telling migrants "don't come" and that they would soon be able to "apply for asylum in place."Jacobson echoed that tougher tone on Thursday, stressing that the policy of the United States was to expel migrants trying to cross the border illegally, with the exception of unaccompanied children. But she acknowledged that as a U.S. official her warnings might be lost amid the deception of people smugglers who are telling migrants the border is open.She said the United States would step up its messaging effort, using social media, radio and non-governmental organizations in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to urge migrants not to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border."We're going to be more aggressive, more agile about getting our message out, we're going to try and combat the smugglers' messages and make sure that people understand the truth," she said.A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said that effort was underway and included radio outreach in Guatemalan indigenous languages.U.S. border authorities caught roughly 100,000 migrants at the border with Mexico in February, the highest monthly total since mid-2019. Roughly 4,500 children were being held in border facilities as of Thursday, an administration official said during a call with reporters, a slight increase from Sunday.While Biden officials have said migrant families will be "expelled" to Mexico or their home countries under a Trump-era health order known as Title 42, more than half of the 19,000 family members caught at the border in February were not expelled, with many released into the United States.Jacobson said the expulsions were limited last month by a lack of capacity in Mexico to receive them."Those numbers are going to change, frankly, from week to week, but the policy is that families will be expelled," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-push-more-aggressive-messaging-effort-to-deter-migrants-101616112277594.html
19-03-2021||World||Biden says US to hit 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations goal this week||With the U.S. closing in on President Joe Biden's goal of injecting 100 million coronavirus vaccinations weeks ahead of his target date, the White House announced Thursday the nation is now in position to help supply neighbors Canada and Mexico with millions of lifesaving shots.The Biden administration revealed the outlines of a plan to “loan” a limited number of vaccines to Canada and Mexico as the president announced the U.S. is on the cusp of meeting his 100-day injection goal “way ahead of schedule.”“ I’m proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met our goal," Biden said. He promised to unveil a new vaccination target next week, as the U.S. is on pace to have enough of the three currently authorized vaccines to cover the entire adult population just 10 weeks from now.Ahead of Biden's remarks, the White House said it was finalizing plans to send a combined 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to Mexico and Canada in its first export of shots. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the details of the “loan" were still being worked out, but 2.5 million doses would go to Mexico and 1.5 million would be sent to Canada.“Our first priority remains vaccinating the U.S. population,” Psaki said. But she added that “ensuring our neighbors can contain the virus is a mission critical step, is mission critical to ending the pandemic.”The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been authorized for use in the U.S. but has been by the World Health Organization. Tens of millions of doses have been stockpiled in the U.S., waiting for emergency use authorization, and that has sparked an international outcry that lifesaving vaccine is being withheld when it could be used elsewhere. The White House said just 7 million of the AstraZeneca doses are ready for shipment.The initial run of doses manufactured in the U.S. are owned by the federal government under the terms of agreements reached with drugmakers, and the Biden administration has faced calls from allies across the globe to release the AstraZeneca shots for immediate use. Biden has also fielded direct requests from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to buy vaccines produced in the United States.Global public health advocates say wealthy nations like the U.S. need to do far more to help stem the spread of the pandemic. The World Health Organization on Thursday issued a report that fewer than 7 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Africa thus far. That's the equivalent of what the U.S. administers in a matter of days.Biden did move to have the U.S. contribute financially to the United Nations- and World Health Organization-backed COVAX alliance, which will share vaccine with more than 90 lower- and middle-income nations, but the U.S. has yet to commit to sharing any doses.From his first days in office, Biden has set clear — and achievable — metrics for U.S. success, whether they be vaccinations or school reopenings, as part of an apparent strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration's sometimes-fanciful rhetoric on the virus.The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the U.S. had even one authorized vaccine for Covid-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.By the time Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the U.S. had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Biden's goal was not ambitious enough. He quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.Now the U.S. is injecting an average of about 2.2 million doses each day — and the pace is likely to dramatically rise later this month in conjunction with an expected surge in supply of the vaccines.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, injections of 96 million doses have been reported to the agency since Biden’s inauguration, but those reports lag the actual date of administration. Vaccination trend lines pointed to Biden breaking the 100 million mark on Thursday, with the numbers likely to be confirmed by the CDC as soon as Friday.The president has moved to speed up deliveries of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, as well as to expand the number of places to get shots and people who can administer them, with a focus on increasing the nation's capacity to inject doses as supply constraints lift.The risk in setting too rosy expectations is that an administration might become defined by its failure to meet them, such as in May 2020, when President Donald Trump said the nation had “prevailed” over the virus.At the time, the country had seen about 80,000 deaths from the virus. This week, the U.S. death toll topped 538,000. Trump’s lax approach and lack of credibility also contributed to poor adherence to public safety rules among the American public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-us-to-hit-100-million-covid-19-vaccinations-goal-this-week-101616111490210.html

19-03-2021||World||US, China spar with rare harsh public rebukes in first in-person talks of Biden administration||The United States and China leveled sharp rebukes of each others' policies in the first high-level, in-person talks of the Biden administration on Thursday, with deeply strained relations of the two global rivals on rare public display during the meeting's opening session in Alaska.The United States is looking for China to change its behavior if it wants to reset sour relations, but Beijing has said Washington is full of illusions if it thinks it will compromise.Sparring in an unusually extended back-and-forth in front of cameras, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan opened their meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi in Anchorage, fresh off of Blinken's visits to allies Japan and South Korea."We will ... discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies," Blinken said in unusually blunt public remarks at the top of the first meeting."Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability," he said.Yang responded with a 15-minute speech in Chinese while the U.S. side awaited translation, lashing out about what he said was the United States' struggling democracy and poor treatment of minorities."The United States uses its military force and financial hegemony to carry out long arm jurisdiction and suppress other countries," Yang said."It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China," he added.Apparently taken aback by Yang's remarks, Blinken held journalists in the room so he could respond.Sullivan said the United States did not seek conflict with China, but would stand up for principles and friends. He touted the United States' recent Mars rover landing success, and said the country's success was its ability constantly reinvent itself.Washington says the Asia tour before the meeting with Chinese officials, as well as outreach to Europe, India and other partners, shows how the United States has strengthened its hand to confront China since President Joe Biden took office in January.But the two sides appear primed to agree on very little at the talks, which were expected to run into the Anchorage evening and continue on Friday.Even the status of the meeting has become a sticking point, with China insisting it is a "strategic dialogue", harkening back to bilateral mechanisms of years past. The U.S. side has explicitly rejected that, calling it a one-off session.On the eve of the talks, the United States issued a flurry of actions directed at China, including a move to begin revoking Chinese telecoms licenses, subpoenas to multiple Chinese information technology companies over national security concerns, and updated sanctions on China over a rollback of democracy in Hong Kong."We're expecting much of these conversations will be pretty, pretty tough," a senior U.S. administration official told reporters in Alaska before the meeting began.Washington has said it is willing to work with China when it is in the interests of the United States and has cited the fight against climate change and the coronavirus pandemic as examples. On Thursday, Blinken said Washington hoped to see China uses its influence with North Korea to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.China has indicated it is set to begin trials of two Canadians detained in December 2018 on spying charges soon after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of telecoms equipment company Huawei Technologies on a U.S. warrant.China's foreign ministry said the timing of the trials had nothing to do with the Anchorage talks.Beijing has called for a reset to ties, now at their lowest in decades.The largest group representing exiled Uighurs has written to Blinken urging him to demand that Beijing close its internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where U.N. experts say that more than 1 million members of the ethnic group and other Muslim minorities have been held.Blinken had pledged to raise the issue, his State Department having upheld a Trump administration determination that Beijing was perpetrating genocide in Xinjiang, something China vehemently denies.Yang said Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan were all inseparable parts of Chinese territory and China firmly opposed U.S. interference in its internal affairs. The United States should handle its own affairs and China its own, he said."The way we see the relationship with the United States is as President Xi Jinping has said, that is we hope to see no confrontation, no conflict, mutual respect and win-win cooperation with the United States."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-spar-with-rare-harsh-public-rebukes-in-first-in-person-talks-of-biden-administration-101616110323349.html
