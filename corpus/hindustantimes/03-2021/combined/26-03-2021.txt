She had a scheduled visit to Japan at that time and conveyed through her interlocutors that Bangladesh Parliament Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury would represent Dhaka at the event.As PM Modi landed in Dhaka on Friday to begin a two-day visit to remember ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation of Bangladesh, and celebrate the golden jubilee of the 1971 liberation war, India’s ties with Bangladesh has gone way beyond symbolism. It is part of an integrated vision of PM Modi for the development of eastern India, particularly the North-East with the help and support of Bangladesh.A special visit begins with a special gesture. PM Sheikh Hasina welcomes PM @narendramodi at Dhaka airport. pic.twitter.com/5zyKWpIepvWhat started with a historical 2015 Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) to settle legacy issues with Bangladesh has developed into a close partnership with India making it a priority to supply Covid-19 vaccine to Dhaka under the “Vaccine Maitri” initiative. PM Modi has made it clear to all that Bangladesh, like Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar, occupy a special place in Indian diplomacy and all help should be extended to them for mutual growth and security. Since 2014, the bilateral relationship with Dhaka has achieved the following milestones:1. Land Boundary Agreement2. Restoration of pre-1965 rail links with India. Five out of six have been completed.3. Reviving the protocol on inland water and trade transit.4. Agreement on the use of Chittagong and Mongla ports for trade and transit.5. Building of the Maitree Bridge on the Feni river.6. Agreement to export power including building a transmission line from Berhampur in India to Bheramara in Bangladesh7. Supply of diesel to Bangladesh from Numaligarh refinery.While Bangladesh is the key to connectivity to north-eastern India, it also fits into the calculus of trans- Asian highways that will link India to Vietnam by road and could become an economic engine for growth in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.The development and growth of India’s eastern flank will not only contribute to its GDP with tourism holding a vast potential in North-East but also politically stabilise the region with the Bharatiya Janata Party is a major political force on the eastern front.The development of ties with immediate neighbours is also a priority with PM Modi, now that legacy issues like Article 370 and 35 A have been resolved and Kashmir is no longer the permanent stick for adversaries to beat India. When PM Modi becomes the first foreign leader to visit the Bangabandhu mausoleum at Tungipara tomorrow, he will be taking the next steps to cement ties with Dhaka under Sheikh Hasina’s leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indiabangladesh-ties-are-not-mere-symbolism-it-is-growth-and-connectivity-101616731407583.html

A woman law student had made the allegation against him in 2019 but disowned them last year. The Lucknow-based court also acquitted the law student and her colleagues of all charges of trying to extort money from the former minister. “The court has discharged Swami Chinmayanand from all charges,” said Om Singh, the lawyer who was representing Chinmayanand in court. Chinmayanand is president of the managing committee of the Swami Shukdevanand Post-Graduate College in Shahjahanpur in western UP. The woman law student was studying in this college and working in its library, drawing a salary. She had disowned her accusations before the court through her lawyer, on October 13, 2020. The law student told the court that she had levelled such allegations under pressure of anti-social elements. The sexual harassment case came to light in August 2019 when the woman went missing from Shahjahanpur. Later, she released videos alleging rape and sexual harassment by the former minister. The state government formed a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate the matter on Supreme Court orders. The SIT lodged an FIR against the former minister under Section 376-C of the IPC. It also booked the law student for extortion. Chinmayanand and the law student were arrested in September 2019. In February 2020, the Allahabad high court granted bail to Chinmayanand. The woman, too, secured bail. During the trial, 33 witnesses recorded their statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chinmayanand-acquitted-in-sexual-harassment-case-101616782830185.html
26-03-2021||Noida||Wave Megacity Centre files for bankruptcy||Noida: The fate of hundreds of homebuyers, who invested in the projects of Wave Megacity Centre Private Limited, hangs in the balance as the debt-ridden realty firm has moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking corporate insolvency proceedings against itself. Wave Megacity Centre had launched residential and commercial projects in Noida’s sectors 25A and 32 in 2011-12 with an assurance of giving the possession from 2014 onwards. However, the company is yet to deliver units in residential towers, though it has delivered some shops in its Sector 32 project. Plagued by financial crisis for several years, the company’s condition worsened this year when the Noida authority cancelled the land allotment in February for alleged failure to clear dues to the tune of ₹2,700 crore. In its petition filed on Friday, the realty firm has asked NCLT to initiate the insolvency proceedings “due to failure of... corporate debtor (Wave Megacity Centre) to pay dues of the Noida authority for an amount of ₹1,222.64 crore”. The company said it does not have “adequate cash flow to meet its obligation to the customers and financial lenders”. The Noida authority had allotted 618,952 square metres (sqm) of land in sectors 25A and 32 for a mixed land use project to the company in March 2011. But, amid the slowdown in the real estate sector, the firm had returned 454,131.62 sqm land to the authority. On March 10 this year, the Noida authority had taken possession of 108,421.13 sqm of land (in Sector 32) of the Wave Megacity Centre after the developer allegedly failed to pay the land cost dues. In its petition, the realty firm called the action an unlawful and arbitrary decision taken by the Noida authority to seek insolvency proceedings. Rajiv Gupta, managing director for Wave Infratech, said, “We cannot comment as the matter is sub-judice. We are working for the best interest of the buyers.” As per the process now, NCLT may appoint an interim resolution professional who will take control of the Wave Megacity Centre and begin corporate insolvency proceedings. The Noida authority may also get an opportunity to put forth the issue of their financial dues before NCLT.When asked, Noida authority’s chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari said, “We are not aware of Wave Megacity Centre filing an application before NCLT. We cancelled the land allotment and sealed the land as per rules.”The group has partially developed a residential project ‘Amore’ that has about 1,500 housing units, a 43-storey commercial tower and some shops in Sector 32.  Buyers are worried a lot after getting news about the realty firm’s case before NCLT. “My father, after retirement, invested ₹1 crore to buy a 3-BHK home in Amore in 2012 with the assurance of getting possession of the house in 2016. My father died in 2020 without getting to move from a rented apartment into his own house. The latest development is a setback for us because we are paying rent and loan instalments for the last eight years,” said Anshuman Jain, a buyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/wave-megacity-centre-files-for-bankruptcy-101616781870122.html

Animal activists, however, said about 20 animals died in the last 24 hours, while dozens allegedly died in the past few days and were buried in a nearby field of a bovine shelter run by the authority, with the help of JCB machines. The issue came to light on Thursday after videos of starving and dead cattle went viral on social media. Soon after, activists and members of animal welfare organisations rushed to the spot along with fodder and medical help. “Upon our visit, we found the cattle starving to death, with no records on purchase of food, treatment records, death records, etc. We got to know that about seven cattle had died the same day while a few dead bovines were lying around. The veterinary doctors had no resources to treat more than a dozen cattle on the verge of death. We are filing a formal complaint and the officials responsible must be held accountable,” said Gauri Maulekhi, an animal activist and co-trustee of People for Animal (PFA).Officials of authority, however, denied the allegations stating that only six bovines had died due to injury or for eating polythene. The video making the rounds were old showing some of the injured bovines which were recently brought to the shelter, said the officials. “There are a total of 1,916 cattle living in our shed. We have no dearth of food or medical supplies and there are veterinary doctors to take care of the cattle. The videos which are circulating now are old and are the ones that were recorded when we brought some injured and starving bovines from an NGO’s shed. These are the cattle which are discarded by the owners and the authority is taking good care of them,” said Narendra Bhushan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority. He added the six animals which died were buried without post mortem as their death was “not suspicious”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/six-bovines-dead-at-greater-noida-shelter-activists-allege-number-higher-101616781810170.html

The bodies have been sent for an autopsy.The incident came to light when the police were informed about the two bodies.“It seems a relative had gone to the house where he found them both dead. The house was not locked from the inside but prima facie, there doesn’t seem to be any evidence of foul play,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.A police team from Phase 2 police station was rushed to the spot. Chander said it seems as if the mother allegedly poisoned the daughter and then took her own life.“Our forensic team has sealed the area and they are working to identify what was used for the poison. The autopsy reports will ascertain the cause and time of death,” said the DCP.Police said that the husband, who works with a private company in Sector 80, was at work when the incident took place.

26-03-2021||Noida||Noida: Two of gang duping people on pretext of MBBS admissions nabbed||Noida: Two persons were arrested by the Noida police on Thursday night for allegedly duping people on the pretext of helping them with MBBS admissions in various universities. Fake letters and visiting cards were recovered from them, said the police.According to police officials, the matter had come to light nearly a month back, following which two suspects had been nabbed. On March 19, they were taken in police remand for eight days, during which the arrested suspects allegedly revealed the whole operation.“There are 11 people involved in the case. Based on information obtained from the duo in remand, we nabbed two more people from near the Sector 59 metro station on Thursday,” said assistant commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajneesh Verma.The suspects arrested Thursday were identified as Sunil Singh and Raj Vikram Singh, from Mahoba district. Police said that Sunil was allegedly a 50% share holder in the entire operation while Raj allegedly often pretended to be an assistant professor in order to dupe victims by taking them on campus tours. They were allegedly running an institution by the name of Guidance club, assuring admission to medical colleges for lower ranked candidates, said officers, adding that another centre was allegedly being run from Sector 63.“As many as 14 complainants have come forward from different states such as Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, etc. The gang took amounts to the tune of ₹60 lakh to help with MBBS admissions. Sunil has invested extensively in the construction of a house using this money. We are working on recovering more money from the suspects and their accomplices while their bank accounts are also being frozen,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.Police officials said that the alleged operation had been going on from Sector 62 for the past six-seven months. However, the criminal history of the suspects goes back to 2008. They said Sunil has gone to jail for a chit fund scam, ATM cloning operations and another MBBS admission scam from Ghaziabad in 2018.Gang members would allegedly also impersonate lower level staff of colleges and universities to earn the trust of their victims, said the police. A search is on for their accomplices.Police recovered 134 visiting cards, letter heads of multiple educational institutions, three stethoscopes, clothes, TVs, computers, DVR and 31 stamps of government medical colleges. The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.Noida police has also urged the public to follow set regulations for admissions and to avoid getting trapped by such criminals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-two-of-gang-duping-people-on-pretext-of-mbbs-admissions-nabbed-101616780730599.html

In continuation to the NGT order, the irrigation department in August had proposed to create six wetlands at different sites of the drain that cuts Noida into two parts and finally merges with the Yamuna at Sector 168.“We have already made a detailed project report for creation of wetlands to clean Kondli drain. We have also hired a private agency and awarded the work too. Once we receive the funds from the Noida authority, we will start the work immediately,” said VK Pandey, assistant engineer of UP irrigation department.It is likely that the work on the development of a wetland along the drain will start in the next week, the officials said.The irrigation department will first create one wetland, and the work on other wetlands will begin when the authority releases more funds (out of a total ₹6.5 crore approved for the entire project), said the officials.“As a pilot project, we have decided to develop the first wetland at this drain near Sector 50 to clean waste water,” said Pandey.Residents have been demanding that the drain should be cleaned as it causes pollution in many residential areas that include sectors 11, 12, 22, 23, 23, 33, 34, 35, 50, 51, 77, 78, 137 and 168, among others. The legal battle to clean the Kondli drain was initiated by Noida resident and environment activist Abhisht Gupta in NGT in November 2018. “If the water of this drain is cleaned, it will benefit ecology of Noida,” said Gupta, a resident of Sector 137. The 40-year-old and 20km long Kondli drain originates from Kondli village in Delhi and enters Noida (via Ghaziabad) near Hari Darshan police post in Sector 11. After travelling through Noida for about 17km, through sectors 11, 12, 22, 50, and 92, it empties into the Yamuna near Chak Mangrola in Sector 168.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/worn-on-wetland-to-clean-kondli-drain-to-begin-next-week-101616780729959.html

Of 11 expelled criminals, three were involved in crimes against women, two in illegal mining and one in extortion, senior police officials said. The GB Nagar commissioner of police, Alok Singh, said it appeared that these 11 criminals are either the members of some gang or kingpins of such gangs. “On the basis of different evidences against them, they have been found habitually committing a criminal offence or attempting to commit it. Due to their repeated involvement in heinous crimes, they have been expelled from the territories of GB Nagar district, as per the provisions under various sections of the Uttar Pradesh Control of Goondas Act, 1970, which is meant for establishing peace and security in society,” he said. The district police chief further said that most of these 11 criminals were involved in cases of sexual violence, illegal mining, smuggling of narcotic substances and extortion. “Despite their repeated involvement in criminal activities, no witness could turn up for any statement against these persons fearing for their own lives or properties,” Singh said.

According to figures of the Co-Win portal, the district’s vaccination coverage stood at 102.12% on March 25, while Ghaziabad achieved 71.86% coverage and managed to get eleventh spot in the state.The UP government has rolled out targets to 75 districts for the third phase of vaccination (for senior citizens and people above 45 years having comorbid conditions). The GB Nagar got a target to vaccinate 65,048 beneficiaries while Ghaziabad was given a target for vaccination of 93,480 for March. The portal figures for March 25 revealed that GB Nagar vaccinated 66,426 people, whereas Ghaziabad inoculated 67,179 beneficiaries. “We have achieved 100% of the target given for March, and we will continue with vaccination for this category in April and May as well. During the vaccination campaign, we roped in 45 private and 51 government health-care facilities. Once we receive further guidelines for the next vaccination round from April 1, we will decide about the additional health-care facilities,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer of GB Nagar. As the Centre on March 23 decided to expand the vaccination coverage for people above 45 years from April 1, the officials said that GB Nagar having population of about two millions will have about 5-6 lakh beneficiaries who would be benefitted under the drive starting April 1.  The UP government had earlier set a target of vaccinating 373,920 beneficiaries to Ghaziabad and 260,792 to GB Nagar under the category of senior citizens and people having comorbid conditions.

Each of the 30 centres will be given a daily target to vaccinate 100-150 beneficiaries. We have already received special approval for four non-empanelled private hospitals for taking up vaccination,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.

26-03-2021||Noida||Surinder Koli spared in 13th Nithari case||Ghaziabad: Surinder Koli, the prime suspect in Noida’s Nithari killing cases, was acquitted by a Ghaziabad court in the thirteenth case, in which he was charged for destruction of evidence, abduction, attempted rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl. This is the first case in which Koli has been acquitted, while in the rest of the 12 cases he was awarded the death penalty by the trial court in Ghaziabad. The killings which came to light in 2006 relate to Nithari village of Noida where several women and children disappeared and skeletal remains, skulls, bones and other material were found from near the Sector 31 house of Koli’s employer Moninder Singh Pandher, a businessman. It was alleged that Koli lured the victims and would later attempt rape before murdering his victims brutally, during which he also dismembered body parts and even cooked them to eat.In the thirteenth case, a minor girl who left her house in Nithari on April 19, 2006, did not return thereafter. After a lot of search by her parents, a missing person complaint was lodged on April 27, 2006. On December 29 the same year, the police discovered skeletal remains and other items belonging to several of the Nithari victims from the backside gallery of Pandher’s house. Koli, Pandher’s domestic help, later allegedly confessed before the police that he lured the girl inside his employer’s house and murdered her after attempting rape. After the initial investigation in cases by the Uttar Pradesh police, the CBI took over the investigation on January 11, 2007 and filed 16 charge sheets in as many cases and charge sheeted Koli in all the cases for murder along with other Indian Penal Code sections. Since February 13, 2009, when the first Nithari case was decided at Ghaziabad, Koli was awarded death penalties in 12 cases but got his first acquittal in the thirteenth case decided on Friday. “The court acquitted Koli during the hearing on Friday and more details will be known when we get a copy of the order,” said JP Sharma, special public prosecutor of CBI. During the hearing on Friday, the Ghaziabad court observed in its order that although Koli was awarded death penalties in other Nithari cases, the present was “different” as there was no “sufficient evidence” on record.“There were no skulls, skeletal remains or bones of the victim girl found from the recoveries made on instance of Surinder Koli, after their DNA test and skull superimposition tests were conducted,” the court said in its order on Friday. The court also stated that in the charge sheet, it was stated that Koli, on January 13, 2007, recovered a cloth allegedly worn by the victim girl.The court order said that no witnesses, including her father, made statements that the recovered cloth matched with the clothes worn by the victim on the day of the incident. The prosecution during the course of trial produced 33 witnesses to prove their case and relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and scientific evidence. “The prosecution which brought the case was not able to prove it and the chain of circumstantial evidence was not completed. The prosecution could not prove that any of the biological remains recovered were linked to the victim girl. So, this does not prove the circumstance that Koli attempted rape or murdered the victim and later threw the body in the backside gallery,” the court added in the order. Koli has been lodged in Dasna jail since December 2006 and represents his cases himself in the trial court at Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/surinder-koli-spared-in-13th-nithari-case-101616780549841.html

Traffic officials said the carriageway was opened around 6pm on Friday after which normal traffic was restored.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at UP Gate since November 28, 2020 to press for their demand of repeal of the three central farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). The commuters on DME on Friday used the Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border and also the Hindon canal road to move to Delhi. “There were massive traffic jams and snarls during peak hours as the farmers closed down the operational carriageway of the DME. I initially drove to Kaushambi but there was a massive jam there as well. So I returned to the canal road to reach my office,” said Kuldeep Saxena, a resident of Indirapuram.“In the evening, there were snarls but the expressway was operational around 6.45pm when I returned to Ghaziabad from Delhi,” he added. The residents of Kaushambi have raised concerns at the growing traffic issues since the blockade of the DME last year.“As a result of the occupation of the DME, thousands of vehicles pass through our locality and it has disturbed the lives of our residents. There is so much traffic on our internal roads that even senior citizens find it difficult to cross to the other side. It is time the authorities intervene and get the issue sorted out. There is daily peak hour chaos in Kaushambi,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi apartments’ residents’ welfare association. Farmers staged a 12-hour long sit-in during which they played drums and celebrated Holi at the expressway. They blocked the operational carriageway, and in the afternoon they threatened to block the road indefinitely demanding the release of Yudhvir Singh, the national general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), by the Gujarat police.A video was circulated by the BKU over social media in which Singh was seen holding a press conference in Gujarat when he was taken away by the police. “He was holding a press conference in Ahmedabad, Gujarat when the police arrived and took him away. Thereafter at UP Gate, we decided that the carriageway will be blocked indefinitely till he is released. However, by evening, the police in Ahmedabad released him and at UP Gate we released the expressway around 6pm,” said Dharmendra Malik, BKU’s media in-charge. Police officials of the Chandkheda police station in Ahmedabad could not be contacted despite repeated attempts on the numbers provided by the Ahmedabad city control room. The farmers during the bandh call on Friday also tried to block traffic on the Delhi-Meerut Road. “They held a symbolic protest and later handed a memorandum of their demands. The traffic was not stuck at Duhai and the protestors left after submitting the memorandum. The DME carriageway was also restored in the evening by the protesters at UP Gate,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), Ghaziabad, said that normal vehicular movement was restored at the expressway by 6pm on Friday and that the usual diversions will continue. The Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway has been blocked by the farmers as they have been camping there since December 3 last year. As a result, thousands of commuters continue to move through Kaushambi and the Hindon canal road to go to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/commuters-face-traffic-snarls-as-farmers-block-delhi-to-ghaziabad-side-of-dme-for-12-hours-during-bharat-bandh-call-101616780369862.html

26-03-2021||Ranchi||Ranchi logs 10% Covid-19 positivity rate||State capital Ranchi reported an alarmingly high Covid-19 positivity rate at nearly 10% on Thursday in comparison to the state’s positivity rate of 2.41%, according to the state health department’s bulletin. Positivity rate is the percentage of people who test positive for the virus out of those undergoing the test. Besides, the state, after a gap of more than four months, detected over 250 cases in a single day on Thursday, when it reported 278 cases after testing 11,534 samples, registering a positivity rate of 2.41%.However, Ranchi alone reported 170 cases after testing 1,704 samples taking the district’s positivity rate to 9.97%.Ranchi has so far reported 34,247 Covid-19 cases, including 33,420 recoveries, 574 active cases and 253 deaths. With an average positivity rate of 6.47%, these cases were discovered after testing a total of 529,194 samples.Experts say the ripples of the “second wave” was now being felt in the state, especially in Ranchi.“Districts with high urban population will always have high positivity rate due to overcrowding and high frequency of interstate movement of people. That is why the average positivity rate of Ranchi remained high throughout the pandemic’s year. Same is the case with East Singhbhum with its headquarters in Jamshedpur,” said Dr Dewesh Kumar, assistant professor of department of preventive and social medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi.He added, “We can say that the ripples of what is happening in Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab and some other states is now being felt in Jharkhand. The rise in number of Covid-19 cases in these states is due to mutant virus but the same is yet to be ascertained in Jharkhand.”Dr Kumar, however, clarified that the spread of the infection will be high if there was a new variant of virus, but it will not bring about changes in terms of severity.He said, “The state is going to witness an increasing trend in growth of cases for almost a month from now. It is, therefore, important for everyone to strictly follow all preventive measures.”According to the health department’s latest weekly report, Jharkhand registered a jump of over 71% in detection of cases in between March 15-21 in comparison to the previous week during March 8-14.While 369 cases were discovered during March 8-14, 633 new cases were found in between March 15-21.Considering the steep rise in cases, the department has alerted all districts to ramp up testing and strictly implement preventive protocols. Besides, orders have been passed to spruce up bed facilities in hospitals.Following the recent state Covid-19 task force committee’s decision, Ranchi district administration has clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure during the upcoming festival of Holi. It has also put a ban on religious processions, political and social rallies and other events involving huge assembly of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ranchi-logs-10-covid-19-positivity-rate-101616776289438.html
26-03-2021||Ranchi||Soren approves proposal to drop Pathalgadi cases||Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Friday gave his nod to the proposal of the state home department to withdraw criminal cases related to Pathalgadi during the previous BJP government, besides those in connection with protests against the proposed amendments in Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act and Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act. In its first decision after taking over the reins of the state on December 29, 2019, the Hemant Soren cabinet had decided to withdraw all cases related to Pathalgadi. Officials said 23 cases were filed across different police stations, majorly in Khunti and Saraikela-Kharsawan districts,. A statement from the chief minister’s office said, “A three-member committee was formed in the districts. The committee was chaired by the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police and public prosecutor were other members. Committees from Khunti, Saraikela-Kharsawan, Chaibasa, Dumka and Sahebganj sent their reports, based on which the government has decided to withdraw these cases,” the statement said. Pathalgadi is a traditional form of erecting rock inscriptions by tribals earmarking their village boundaries and in memory of their loved ones. However, the practise courted controversy under the previous Raghubar Das government. The then government had filed cases against Pathalgadi activists under different sections of the Indian Penal Code, including for sedition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/soren-approves-proposal-to-drop-pathalgadi-cases-101616776169399.html
26-03-2021||Patna||Land mutation set to get faster from April 1 in Bihar||Mutation of land, which means transfer of ownership of land in official records, is set to get easier and faster from April 1, when registry offices will be linked to circle offices.At present, while deeds of sale or purchase of land are registered at registry offices, the mutation is carried out at circle offices. The new system can be only used by property owners who have jamabandi documents (number allotted to raiyats in tenants’ ledger for paying rent against land holdings) in the initial phase. The jamabandi receipt is a document wherein names of persons mentioned as paying the rent are presumed to be owners of the particular land plot and having possession. “Land holders selling a plot would be asked to fill a form at the registry office after registration of any sale deed of land. The mutation process would be initiated soon after. The process of mutation would be much easier and faster after interlinking of registry and circle offices,” said Ram Surat Kumar, minister for revenue land reforms. At present, those having purchased land from its owner have to apply separately at circle offices (CO) for mutation and submit related papers of registry of land. Complaints about mutation applications pending for months and years and harassment in submission of related papers are common.The minister also said the circle officers would now have to cite a valid reason for rejecting any application of mutation at their offices so that they do not act in an arbitrary manner in disposing of the mutation related applications. “This has come into effect at all CO offices from today. All the COs have been give necessary directives,” said the minister. However, there are apprehensions that the new system of accelerating mutation is fraught with the risk of slip-ups. “It is good the mutation process is being made faster by linking registry and CO offices. But despite jamabandi as a supportive document for ownership of a plot of land for mutation purposes, there could be pending civil suits on the same land. Besides, possession of land is another aspect. So, it is necessary that the verification process is done thoroughly before mutation is done. Corruption should be also checked in the entire process,” said Arvind Kumar , a lawyer based in Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/land-mutation-set-to-get-faster-from-april-1-in-bihar-101616776109390.html

The RJD and Left parties had given call for statewide shutdown in protest against the alleged assault on Opposition MLAs in the Bihar Assembly earlier this week.Despite heavy police deployment on major roads and national highways, protesters blocked several state highways and Mahatma Gandhi Setu, affecting vehicular traffic and causing logjams. There were reports of protests on railway tracks at many places, leading to disruption in rail services and affecting movement of more than 16 passenger/Express and goods trains. In Patna, hundreds of RJD supporters, including some minors, stormed the railway station and bus stand carrying sticks and party flags, but they were chased away by police personnel. Vehicles, both private and public, including city buses, stayed off the roads in the state capital. Though business establishments remained shut, schools, colleges and government offices functioned as normal.According to the state police headquarters, rail and road traffic was disrupted at Gaya, Jehanabad, Saharsa, Madhepura, Begusarai, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Nalanda, Muzaffarpur, Madhubni, Bhojpur, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura ,Nawada and Bhagalpur districts. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at railway stations, bus stations and taxi stands since morning. “There was no major untoward incident,” said Patna SSP Upendra Sharma. ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said the shutdown remained peaceful by and large. More than 500 RJD and CPI (ML) leaders and activists were taken into preventive custody across the state. Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said he didn’t himself participate in bandh due to death of his uncle. Talking with reporters, he said RJD has also given its support to the nationwide strike called by the farmers’ unions.“Speaker is our custodian. The police used baton charge and thrashed legislators in the Assembly premises only after the instruction of Nitish Kumar. The chief minister is likely to put pressure on Speaker, but RJD has faith in him,” Yadav said.On Thursday, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha has asked top administration and police officials to probe into manhandling of legislators in the Assembly and identify the police officers involved for suitable action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/shutdown-hits-rail-road-traffic-in-bihar-101616775629447.html
26-03-2021||Patna||Bihar effects minor hike in power tariff||The Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) Friday approved an average cumulative hike in power tariff by 0.63% over the existing rate for the financial year 2021-22. Effectively, it translates into 5 paise to 35 paise per unit hike in tariff for domestic urban consumers. However, those consuming more power stand to gain, with the commission reducing the per unit rate from ₹8.50 to ₹8.05 for those consuming more than 300 units in the existing category. The new rates, which exclude government subsidy, will be effective from April 1 and remain in force till March 31, 2022, or till the commission issues the next tariff order, said BERC chairman Shishir Sinha. The BERC abolished one slab — the 200-300 unit category — and restricted the domestic urban and rural tariff to three slabs, instead of existing four, the highest being 200 units and above. Those consuming up to 100 units will be charged ₹6.10 per unit against an existing rate of ₹6.05 per unit. Those consuming between 101 and 200 units will pay ₹6.95 per unit against an existing per unit rate of ₹6.85. The existing 201-300 unit slab, in which consumers pay ₹7.70 per unit, had been abolished and merged with the next slab of those consuming above 300 units, in which the regulator had reduced the per unit rate from existing ₹8.50 to ₹8.05. “This meant that those consuming between 200 and 300 units will pay more while those consuming above 300 units will pay less,” said Nanda Sharma, an independent power tariff analyst and a former employee of the BERC. “The discoms had proposed an increase in the tariff of 9.22% for 2021-22. However, keeping in view the revenue surplus and deficit situation in the aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) of 2021-22, the commission has decided to increase the tariff cumulatively by 0.63%. The commission has retained the existing fixed charge unchanged,” said Sinha. The commission has also allowed 3% rebate for prepaid smart meter consumers. It also created a new category for charging of electric vehicles in view of increasing number of electric vehicles in the state. Those charging electric vehicles at charging stations will be levied ₹7.15 per unit. Meanwhile, a senior officer of the Bihar State Power Holding Company said the state government would announce subsidy on power tariff to consumers soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-effects-minor-hike-in-power-tariff-101616774729283.html
26-03-2021||Chandigarh||FIR against ex-cricketer: CFSL report inconclusive, Haryana Police told HC||The Haryana Police told the Punjab and Haryana high court that the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh, report in the case of former cricketer Yuvraj Singh, who was booked for alleged casteist remarks by the Hansi police, remained ‘inconclusive’.In a report to the HC, the Haryana Police said that the CFSL could not form any opinion regarding authenticity of the video recording supplied by the complainant as the original video was not available. The original source of recording of the device could also not be supplied to the CFSL. Response was sought in a plea filed by the former cricketer in February seeking quashing of the FIR. The FIR was registered on February 14, eight months after the ex-cricketer apologised for the “unintentional remarks” made during an Instagram live video in April 2020 during lockdown. The FIR was registered on complaint of one Rajat Kalsan, of Hansi, under Sections 153-A (promoting enmity) and 153-B (assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Prevention and Atrocities Act, 1989. Police said the investigation is at its initial stage and the offence committed by the former cricketer are cognisable in nature and non-bailable. He did not join the probe and quashing of the FIR at this stage will cause grave prejudice to the investigating agency as the offence committed by the petitioner is an offence “committed against the state.”The HC, on February 25, has already asked the police to not to take any coercive action against the former cricketer. Now the case stands adjourned for April 28.“The remark was misunderstood and was widely shared on the social media, triggering outrage,” Yuvraj had told court, adding that the live session happened in April 2020 and in June, the video started circulating with allegations that he disrespected the Dalit community as he addressed two of his colleagues as “Bhangi”.“Even after an apology, an FIR was registered against him,” the plea stated, adding that all this was done in an attempt to harm his reputation even as he had addressed his colleagues in a “friendly manner”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fir-against-ex-cricketer-cfsl-report-inconclusive-haryana-police-told-hc-101616774189919.html

So far, police have arrested four men in the case – journalist Sanjeev Mahajan, realtor Manish Gupta, inspector Rajdeep Singh and Satpal Dagar, who is the brother of UT DSP Ram Gopal.All accused are facing charges of torturing and kidnapping 48-year-old Rahul Mehta, the only surviving heir of his family, to usurp his 338 square yards house in Sector 37 and sell it to Manish’s brother Saurabh in 2019. They are accused of holding the victim, who was facing health issues, captive in his house in April 2017, and forcibly transferring the property’s general power of attorney (GPA) in favour of Khalendra and Arvind. This authorised them to sell the property to Saurabh, while Gurpreet had acted as a witness at some point during the conspiracy.Bail pleas of two accused deferred till March 31The bail pleas of journalist Sanjeev Mahajan and co-accused Manish Gupta will come up for hearing on March 31. In his bail plea, Sanjeev has claimed that he was falsely implicated for exposing many wrongdoings of the government officials, politicians and hardcore criminals. Manish, too, has sought bail, claiming false implication only because he was the elder brother of Saurabh, who bought the property. The court has already dismissed Saurabh’s plea for anticipatory bail. He had claimed he was unaware of the dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-property-grab-case-police-announce-cash-reward-for-info-on-4-accused-101616773589819.html

26-03-2021||Pune||Bharat Bandh fails to evoke any response in Pune||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha sponsored Bharat Bandh on Friday failed to evoke any response in Pune and the rest of western Maharashtra. Most commercial establishments in the city were operating normally while public transport including rail and road remained unaffected by the bandh, for which Congress party extended support. Most traders and its apex body – Maharashtra traders association – stayed away from the bandh while farmer outfits such as Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana also did not take part in the strike. Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson said, “All our scheduled trains are running on time and there is no train roko or any kind of disturbance in our train operations across the division.” Similarly, most shops and traders from Laxmi road, Tilak road, Raviwar peth, Market yard and Tulshi baug in the city were open throughout the day. At Congress Bhavan, Congress workers led by state executive chief Basavraj Patil observed tone fast and submitted memorandum to Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh demanding repealing of three farm laws. “The three laws are being opposed by farmers and the Congress party has supported this demand. The purpose of participating in Friday’s Bharat bandh was to oppose these laws,” said Patil. “We had participated on behalf of the Rashtra Seva Dal in the national strike called by farmers union. The other organizations which were with us are Janata Dal Secular, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), All India Congress party, Pathari panchayat etc. We organized demonstrations under the bridge at Gadital Chowk in Hadapsar,” said Vilas Kirote, one of the senior members of Rashtra Seva Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bharat-bandh-fails-to-evoke-any-response-in-pune-101616770710257.html

Markets at Connaught Place, Karol Bagh, Kashmiri Gate, Chandni Chowk and Sadar remained open. Shops in Khan Market were also open.Chamber Of Trade and Industry (CTI) chairman Brijesh Goyal said there was no impact of the "Bharat Bandh" on the markets and industrial areas of the national capital."Everything remained open. The traders are in support of the farmers' demands but they have been accruing losses due to the coronavirus. We appeal to the government to resolve the issue as the industrial areas at Kundli, Manesar, Sonipat, Gurgaon etc. have been affected due to the protest," he said.A senior Delhi Police officer said the situation remained peaceful in the national capital and no untoward incident was reported.Farmers camping at the Ghazipur border blocked a carriageway of National Highway-9 from Delhi to Ghaziabad in the morning, but there was not much activity by the protesters in the city.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had to briefly close the entry and exit gates of the Tikri Border, Bahadurgarh City and Brigadier Hoshiar Singh stations, but after a few minutes, the stations were opened for passengers.A farmer leader claimed that there were protests at Mayapuri and some other areas, where people peacefully staged demonstrations.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the protesting unions, claimed that various farmer organisations, trade unions, student bodies, bar associations, political parties and representatives of state governments have supported the "Bharat Bandh" call.In a statement, the SKM said the farmers at the protest sites around the national capital blocked roads and railway tracks."Many other people's organisations, along with trade unions and other associations, protested in Delhi. At Mayapuri, Kalkaji and other places, concerned citizens organised symbolic protests," the statement said.On Thursday, the SKM had said the "Bharat Bandh" would also be observed in the national capital.It had appealed to people to make its nationwide shutdown successful."All shops, malls, markets and institutions will remain closed under the complete Bharat Bandh. All minor and big roads and trains will be blocked."All services will remain suspended except for ambulance and other essential services. The effect of the Bharat Bandh will be observed inside Delhi as well," the SKM had said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) on their crops.So far, there have been 11 rounds of talks between the protesting unions and the government, but the deadlock continues as both sides stick to their stands.In January, the government had offered to suspend the farm laws for 12-18 months, which was rejected by the farmer unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bharat-bandh-minimal-impact-in-delhi-metro-road-transport-unaffected-101616770194850.html

For the past few weeks, the garbage dump next to Star Bazaar on Baner-Pashan link road is growing in size right beside the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) board announcing it as reserved space for amenities. The Baner-Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust (BPLRWT) has been fighting for years to see it complete. “The Baner-Pashan link road has no amenity spaces of any kind and we have been fighting for one for the past five years. We have written several letters to the authorities but despite having a private builder ready to develop the amenity space, but the PMC did not do anything despite multiple reminders from BPLR,” said Ravindra Sinha, member of the Baner-Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust (BPLRWT). The plot of 1,500 square meters was to be developed as a garden but has now become a dumping ground. “Earlier, there was a sorting shed for the waste pickers nearby and it is now causing people to drop garbage onto the amenity space as it is empty,” said one of the residents from a nearby society, preferring to be anonymous. The Baner-Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust (BPLRWT) has been demanding that the sorting centre be shifted elsewhere, but now it is causing more problems with people using the empty plot as a dumping ground. “We have been writing to authorities, to corporators to build a park or a garden and the proposal is also with the PMC,but nothing has been done so far,” said Rajendra Chuttar, president of BPLRWT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/space-reserved-for-amenities-used-for-garbage-dumping-on-baner-pashan-link-road-101616769868881.html

But there is no such situation in the state," Pawar said.The ruling MVA coalition has the support of 165 MLAs and thus enjoys majority in the Assembly, he said.BJP leaders have demanded President's rule in the aftermath of the arrest of police officer Sachin Waze in connection with the recovery of explosives-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house and IPS officer Param Bir Singh's corruption allegations against state home minister Anil Deshmukh.On Kunte's report on phone tapping, Pawar said he is an upright and meritorious officer."He has submitted a report which is very clear and by reading it one can understand the facts," Pawar said.The transfers (allegedly facilitated through bribery) referred to in Shukla's letter to the then state DGP never took place, the deputy CM pointed out.On the death of ten patients at a Covid-19 hospital in Bhandup, Mumbai, Pawar said he had instructed officials to ensure such incidents do not take place again."We have already allocated funds to carry out fire safety audits of government hospitals," he said.On Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut's statement that NCP chief Sharad Pawar should lead the UPA alliance, Ajit said he does not speak on national issues."I can only speak on the issues which are state- related.

26-03-2021||Pune||‘Victor of Basantar’ Lt Gen Pinto passes away at 97||Pune Lieutenant General Walter Anthony Gustavo “WAG” Pinto, former General Officer in the Indian Army, breathed his last on the night March 25. He was 97. Gen Pinto last served as the 8th General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central Command. As Major General, he had led the 54th Infantry Division on the western front in the Indo-Paki War of 1971, for which he was awarded the prestigious Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM). His son Kevin said that the last rites would be held at AFMC mortuary on Sunday morning.He was born on July 1, 1924, at Poona, Bombay Presidency, to Alexander Pinto, who worked in the military accounts department and Helen Agnes Pinto. Alexander belonged to the Gustave Pinto branch of the Pintos of Santa Cruz, Goa, which was then part of Portuguese India. Pinto was the youngest of three children. His elder brother, Sydney Alexander, was an Indian Army officer who was commissioned in the Corps of Engineers as a Bombay Sapper. His elder sister, Phyllis Mary, served in the women’s Auxiliary Corps, India and later in Burma.Pinto completed his school education in Bengaluru, Pune and St Aloysius Senior Secondary School, Jabalpur from where he passed his senior Cambridge school leaving certificate with 4 Ds (distinctions). He attended college at Robertson College Jabalpur, where he joined D Company, 10th Nagpur Battalion, University Training Corps (UTC).After clearing the preliminary and final selection boards held at Jabalpur and Lucknow respectively, Gen Pinto joined the pre-cadet course at Datta College, Lahore in January 1943. In March 1943, he joined the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun for a six-month emergency commission training course. Pinto was commissioned into the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and had the distinction of being one of only four cadets who earned a commission in the infantry among the two hundred and more cadets committed into the armed forces at that time.Lt Gen BT Pandit (retd), Vir Chakra awardee who fought the 1971 Indo-Pak war under his leadership has fond memories of his raw courage, bravery and alertness to share. Lt Gen Pandit said, “Lt Gen Wag Pinto was a very special army commander the like of whom we may not see in a hurry. The battle of Basantar was one of the longest ground battles fought by the Indian Army under the dynamic and brave leadership of Lt Gen WAG Pinto — “The Victor of Basantar”. The Battle of Basantar was one of the biggest ground battles ever fought by the Indian Army.” “He had an impactful leadership. The fourteen days of fierce fighting, produced a mind boggling 196 gallantry awards for our soldiers and officers. This included 2 Param Vir Chakras (Late 2nd Lt Arun Khetrapal was one of them) and 9 Mahavir Chakras (Late Gen Vaidya of Operation Blue Star fame was one of them),” the war veteran said.“During the 1971 war, I was Lieutenant Colonel and Lt Gen WAG Pinto was my G-O-C as he was commanding 54 infantry Division. Under his command, we launched the offensive after December 3, crossed three strong minefields, defeated all enemy en route and from December 15 to December 17, a very decisive battle of Basantar was fought where we forced the enemy to react to our attack. By our move into the heartland, the enemy forced its reserves out which we destroyed completely in the battle which lasted for three days. This forced Pakistan to accept ceasefire. In this battle, sixty enemy tanks were destroyed,” Lt Gen Pandit said.Lauding his humble qualities, Lt Gen Pandit described the late General as a very aggressive person on the battlefield who was always with the troops ahead and not in the headquarters. “Under his leadership, the troops did extremely well. He lived a full life and was oriented till the end. He had a fine sense of humour and stood for the nation, the army and the people of the country,” he said. The late General had penned his war exploits in memoirs in a short, crisp book “Bash on Regardless”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/victor-of-basantar-lt-gen-pinto-passes-away-at-97-101616765068642.html

This is arrogance. We will intensify protests if the Modi government does not take note of the farmers' stir," Patole said.Noting that the Centre has stayed the implementation of the farm laws, Chavan said the Modi government should now frame new laws after holding a discussion with farmers."The new laws should be kept before the standing committee of the Parliament," he added.Jagtap claimed that, compared to India, petrol and diesel are cheaper in Pakistan and Nepal.

The hospital is situated on the top floor of the mall. An official told news agency PTI on Friday that the fire broke out around Thursday midnight.Fadnavis, while speaking to reporters after paying a visit to the hospital, alleged that corrupt practices in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) led to the tragedy and urged Bombay High Court to take suo moto cognisance of this matter, PTI reported. Pointing out that the Maharashtra government had given assurance in conducting safety audits of all hospitals in the state, he said, “Yet this incident occurred today.

Despite heavy police deployment on major roads and national-highways, the protesters blocked many routes including state-highways and the Mahatma Gandhi Setu in Bihar by burning tyres on the roads and halting vehicular traffic resulting in long snarls.Most people were clueless about why the Bandh had been called and which organization had announced it. The sudden shutdown threw lots of office goers, school children and businessmen into confusion. People were trying to confirm it through WhatsApp and SMS messages from friends and relatives.Huge processions were taken out in different areas of Bihar, with protesters raising slogans against Nitish Kumar’s government. They took to the streets forcing closure of shops and business establishments. There were reports of protests on rail tracks at many places, leading to more than 16 passenger/express and goods trains being blocked. Commuters had a harrowing time reaching their destinations as the protestors resorted to picketing and road blockades in different places in the state. In capital city Patna, hundreds of party supporters -- among whom children could also be seen-- stormed the railway station and bus stands carrying sticks and party flags, but they were chased away by police personnel. Vehicles - both private and public – even city buses in the state capital stayed off the roads. As business establishments pulled down shutters, schools, colleges and government offices functioned normally. According to the state police headquarters, rail and road traffic was halted at Gaya, Jehanabad, Saharsa, Madhepura, Begusarai, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Nalanda, Muzaffarpur, Madhubani, Bhojpur, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Nawada and Bhagalpur districts. The state government and police have made adequate arrangements to maintain law and order in the state. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at scores of railway stations, bus stations and taxi stand on Friday morning. “There were no major untoward incidents,” said Patna SSP Upendra Sharma adding that all preventive measures have been taken to maintain law and order during the bandh. ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said barring stray incidents and forceful closure of some shops in some cities, the bandh in the state remained peaceful. More than 500 RJD and CPI (ML) leaders and activists were taken into preventive custody from various other parts of the state. Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said he didn’t participate in the bandh due to the death of his uncle. Talking to reporters, Yadav said RJD has also given its support to the nationwide strike called by the farmers’ unions. Yadav further said that the bandh would include matters concerning unemployment and farmers’ issue.“The Speaker is our custodian. The police used batons and thrashed legislators in the assembly premises only after the instruction of Nitish Kumar. The chief minister is likely to put pressure on the Speaker but RJD has faith on him,” Yadav added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjds-bihar-bandh-hits-rail-road-traffic-commuters-stranded-as-vehicles-stay-off-roads-101616759729512.html
26-03-2021||Delhi||Planning for a sustainable Delhi||Can you walk down or cycle to the nearby market without any hassle in Delhi? Not really, even as it became possible last year after the Covid-19 lockdown norms were eased in June. There was a surge in cyclists cycling for kilometres amid relatively lesser congested roads. The situation is now back to how it was before the pandemic for cyclists and pedestrians. These are not the only problems that the rise in Delhi’s population has resulted in. Traffic congestion, lack of parking spaces, an increase in pollution levels, and encroachment of pedestrian spaces are among other urban challenges impacting people’s quality of life. Delhi ranked 13th in the Union housing and urban affairs’ Ease of Living index of 49 cities with a million-plus population. Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Indore ranked higher than Delhi.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is drafting a new Master Plan of Delhi (MPD-2041) for the city’s growth over the next two decades. Other policy decisions have also been touted as game-changers in making the city more liveable by ensuring sustainable development:Transit-oriented developmentMobility is among the problems Delhi faces with inadequate public transport leading to an increase in private vehicles. Delhi has over 10 million registered vehicles and roughly 6,75,000 more are registered annually. The transit-oriented development seeks to reduce the dependence on private vehicles. The plan notified in 2019 envisages mixed land-use development (residential, commercial and office complexes) within 500 metres of mass transit facilities such as Metro stations.Also Read | New NCT Bill will obstruct good work done by AAP govt: Manish SisodiaDDA has started work on the first such project at Karkardooma. It plans 12 transit nodes (Metro stations) which will be developed as per the policy in the first phase.AK Jain, a former planning commission with DDA, said, “Land pooling and TOD [transit-oriented development] are important policies to ensure sustainable development. It will meet the housing requirement. But the focus should be on promoting the use of public transport.”DDA recently proposed some modifications to the policy regarding parking spaces under the plan. They include a mandatory 5% of the parking area for bicycles and wheelchairs and at least 10% for charging points for electric vehicles.Restricted parking space near Metro stations and multilevel parkingAn increase in vehicles has resulted in parking problems in residential and commercial spaces with fights over them becoming common.DDA has approved a policy to reduce parking spaces coming up along Metro corridors or near multilevel parking lots by 10-30% to encourage people to use Metro, which has a network of 389km spread across Delhi and the National Capital Region. The move once notified is touted as one of the crucial measures to address the growing traffic congestion problem. The policy is expected to encourage the use of public transport and push for transit-oriented development.As per the new norms, for a property (except residential) within 500 metres of a Metro station, there will be a 30% reduction in the permissible parking space. For properties located over 500 metres and less than 800 metres from a Metro station, there will be a 15% deduction. For properties coming up within a kilometre radius of a multi-level parking lot, 10% of the permissible parking space will be deducted.Also Read | Supreme Court orders status quo on water supply to DelhiCurrently, a new commercial complex within 500 metres of a Metro station has to provide three equivalent car parking spaces for every 100 squares of built-up area.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, the executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said after the entire Metro network is built in Delhi, nearly 70% of the city will be in transit-oriented development zones. “It is a good move that provision of metro and multilevel parking is being incorporated in calculating the parking space in development around it. But the provision should be applied to housing as well.”Enhancing walkabilityWith pavements encroached upon, there is little space for pedestrians. As per a DDA report, nearly 34% of all daily personal trips in Delhi are “walk only”. Despite efforts to remove encroachment and to redevelop road infrastructure, Delhi is far from being pedestrian-friendly. In a push to make the city pedestrian-friendly, a walkability policy was approved in August 2019. The policy focuses on the integration of walkability into various policies and projects, using technology for preparing walking tours, providing barrier-free pathways, pelican crossings near schools and major pedestrian crossings and multi-utility zones to accommodate street vendors and other public activities.Key features of the policy include time-bound implementation of area-specific walk plans, a centralised city-wide monitoring system, a mobile application to give information about walking and a Walk Delhi Coordination and Monitoring Committee.The DDA has selected 22 locations such as Nehru Place where the plan will be implemented.Development control norms for unauthorised coloniesThe unauthorised colonies have been outside the planning ambit and deprived of basic civil amenities. The unregulated development there has been a major concern of planners and civic agencies. Efforts have been made to regularise close to 1,800-odd unauthorised colonies, but they have not yielded results. In 2019, the Centre decided to confer ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi. For this, the Parliament passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Act.A year later, the DDA approved regulations to ensure planned development in these colonies, which till now have been out of the purview of the Master Plan of Delhi-2021.A DDA official said the development control norms for unauthorised colonies are part of the 2019 law. “...For the first time, detailed norms have been prepared for unauthorised colonies. Now that they are getting the legal tag. There is a need to have norms for planned development/redevelopment in these areas.”The new norms have provision for amalgamation of plots, creation of social infrastructure and redevelopment of colonies.Shamsher Singh, a former chief municipal town planner, said for any planned development in these colonies, redevelopment is the only option. “But these norms are more builder-oriented as it will be difficult for RWAs [Resident Welfare Associations] or individuals to comply.”Land pooling to meet housing requirementThe lack of affordable housing in Delhi is one of the reasons for the mushrooming of unauthorised colonies. To meet the demand for affordable housing, DDA prepared the land pooling policy. The policy was notified in 2015 but the work for its implementation started in 2018. It will be implemented in 95 urbanised villages and seeks to provide close to 1.7 million dwelling units. Under the policy, 40% of the pooled land will be earmarked for essential services and civic infrastructure like parks.Developers will get 60% of the total pooled land of which 53% will be residential, 5% commercial and 2% for public and semi-public facilities. DDA and other service providers will get 40% of the land for developing civic infrastructure. Over 6,500 hectares of land has been pooled so far under the policy. DDA officials said they are working on developing three model sectors in Bawana, Pooth Khurd and Sultanpur Dabas villages over 180-210 hectares.Green area developmentWhile the Master Plan of Delhi-2021, which was notified in February 2007, has been amended several times to fix planning issues, rural areas have largely remained untouched. Till recently, no construction activity was allowed in villages located in the green belt on Delhi’s periphery. This led to rampant unauthorised construction in these 47 rural villages, especially on agricultural land.The DDA has prepared a new policy which for the first time allows planned development in these areas so that people living in these villages get access to better education, medical facilities and also an opportunity to earn their livelihood through development activities.Residents of these villages say that with an increase in the population, there is a need for a plan so that people can construct their houses and earn their livelihood.Bhupinder Bazad, president of Master Plan Committee of Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, said, “There are a lot of warehouses in these villages which are currently unauthorised. As the population of the village is increasing, residents need space to construct new houses and also look for opportunities to earn their livelihood. The policy is the need of the hour. While we need to protect the green lungs of the city, we also have to provide avenues to villagers to earn their livelihood.”No manufacturing units in new industrial areasThe Union housing and urban affairs ministry has broadened the definition of industries in the Master Plan 2021. As per a notification issued in October, information technology firms, media companies, knowledge parks, research and development centres, vocational training centres and even educational institutes will be allowed in new industrial areas. No manufacturing unit will be allowed in any new industrial area, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said while announcing the decision in November last year. He called the move a “historic and significant” step aimed at reducing pollution levels in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/planning-for-a-sustainable-delhi-101616758110482.html

26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Mixed response to farm union’s bandh call in BJP-ruled Himachal||The Bharat Bandh called by farmer unions against the Centre’s three farm laws evoked a mixed response in Himachal Pradesh. Shops and the commercial establishments remain open in the BJP-ruled state. The bandh was peaceful even as traffic was disrupted partially in the border areas of Nurpur in Kangra district due to the blockade by farmers in Pathankot district of neighbouring Punjab. Protesters, led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader Gurdyal Singh, held a dharna at Chakki Bridge, causing a traffic jam on the Jammu-Jalandhar highway. This led to disruption of traffic movement to Himachal Pradesh. Kisan Majdoor Sangharsh Samiti members held a protest at Panjehra in Nalagarh area of Solan district. The protesters led by samiti president Charanjit Singh Channi took out a tractor march. Local Congress MLA Lakhvinder Singh Rana along with his supporters participated in the march, raising slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre and the state. Farmer and trade unions held protests in Shimla, Kullu, Chamba and Hamirpur districts. Activists of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPIM), Himachal Kisan Sabha and Students’ Federation of India participated in the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mixed-response-to-farm-union-s-bandh-call-in-bjp-ruled-himachal-101616757148917.html
26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Bandh call stops rail passengers in their tracks across Punjab, Haryana||From job aspirants to migrant families, the 12-hour-long Bharat Bandh from 6am to 6pm on Friday put scores of commuters in hardship across Punjab and Haryana. Officials said members of farmer unions blocked rail tracks at 23 spots in the Ferozepur railway division alone, leaving scores of passengers stranded at stations of Bathinda and other districts of the state since morning. Also read: Rail, road traffic off track in Punjab’s Malwa on farmers’ bandh callMissing job interview to spending day at station One such passenger, Shesh Bhan of Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar, said he is set to miss his interview with a public sector undertaking in Uttar Pradesh because of the bandh call. He was among the passengers waiting at the Bathinda railway station platform on Friday. “I was to appear for the interview in Kanpur on Saturday but now there is no train for Delhi. There is no bus service plying either otherwise I could have boarded one and caught the connecting train from Delhi. The UP government should consider the case of youngsters like me compassionately. We have no choice but to wait because of the blockade by farmers,” he said. Ramesh Kumar, a small-time sweetmeat seller from Bikaner, said he has been waiting at the station for more than 12 hours by Friday noon for continuing his journey. “I reached Bathinda around midnight and was scheduled to board the train for Haryana’s Jakhal town this morning. I went to the local bus stand also only to be told that all government and private bus services are suspended for the day. I have no option but to wait till the rail service resumes in the evening,” he said. Holi plans with family go for toss Another passenger, Dinesh Singh from Faridkot, said his plans to be with his parents in Uttar Pradesh over Holi have been dashed due to the disruption of train services. “I came with my family and a colleague to Bathinda on Thursday night to board the train for our native place in Bareilly. Now there is a lot of uncertainty over the train schedule and we can’t go back to our home due to the road blockade and non-availability of buses,” he said. No train cancelled, only rescheduled Rajesh Agarwal, the Ferozepur divisional railway manager (DRM), said that 12 trains with passengers on board have been stopped at different places due to Friday’s protest. “No train has been cancelled in our division. Services will be resumed after the blockade is lifted and mandatory safety audit of tracks is completed. To avoid inconvenience to passengers planning to avail of the Holi special trains and those who need to visit Haridwar for post-funerary rituals, we are rescheduling train schedules,” said the DRM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bandh-call-stops-rail-passengers-in-their-tracks-across-punjab-haryana-101616755891097.html
26-03-2021||Pune||Slam dunk: Separating fact from fiction in the NBA||With the globalisation and expansion of the NBA, the game of basketball in the NBA is covered and consumed by more people than ever before. Media outlets, basketball personalities and the players are constantly producing content to make themselves more accessible to their fans across the globe. Fans have more access to the complete behind-the-scenes world and infrastructure surrounding the NBA, yet there are certainly intricacies to the NBA only seen thoroughly by those who experience the NBA daily. Below are a few myths that colloquially surround the NBA, as well as the realities, and perspective of a daily lens viewing the NBA. Myth: NBA All-Stars are the players who are most dedicated to improving at basketballWhile the above might seem to be a controversial statement, based on their success on court, watching the daily dedication of players on the fringes of the NBA might tell a different story. Undoubtedly, it is impossible to be an NBA All-Star without possessing a work ethic and passion for improving at basketball. However, as a minor league player in the G-League, or an overseas basketball player striving to break into the NBA, the fierce competition and razor-thin margins between a guaranteed NBA contract and not being able to earn a roster spot mean that often times these individuals have to maximise every ounce of their basketball talent to earn a chance in the NBA. Often, NBA All-Stars are players who possess a unique blend of talent, desire, physical advantages and those who may develop mental advantages over years of playing in the most competitive environments. To compensate for disadvantages in talent, physical size or athletic makeup, lesser players often have to work maximally and with extreme precision and focus just to keep their current roster spot in such a competitive league. This paradox is constantly observed in the perception of the dedication of different players throughout the NBA. Myth: NBA players who don’t get playing time in NBA games are not very good at basketballAs a player who isn’t playing a lot of NBA minutes, fans on the outside may often watch these players and wonder why they are on a team’s roster if they can’t contribute. Players don’t get to play in games for a myriad of reasons outside of purely talent-based reasons. Factors like injury status, long-term health, team lineup combinations and trade rumours can all impact the likelihood of a coach to insert a player into a game. Players in the NBA are all incredibly skilled at the game, and it is unfortunate that intangibles and uncontrollable factors occasionally come in the way of them displaying their skills in NBA games. Myth: NBA players do not “play hard”, or play good defenceAnother myth that is often touted is that NBA players do not play hard or good defence. This couldn’t be further from the truth. There are certainly nights where players do have lower energy from extreme exertion and the constant rigours of NBA travel and game schedules. However, the NBA does tilt its rules to favour offensive players, in addition to the extreme skill of modern-day offensive players, means that the rules do not provide a lot of advantages to a defensive player in the NBA. Hence, it may appear that players are not playing hard defence or trying to play defence well without fouling the opposition. Comparing these myths to the reality can give a fan of the NBA a deeper understanding and appreciation of just how competitive the NBA league is, and why players are monetarily, valued so highly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/slam-dunk-separating-fact-from-fiction-in-the-nba-101616755889391.html

26-03-2021||Other||CBI files case against YSR Congress MP in ₹234 cr bank fraud||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday registered a case against YSR Congress party parliamentarian Kanumuru Raghurama Krishnam Raju for allegedly duping a consortium of banks of ₹237.84 crore by producing forged documents between 2012 and 2017.The case was registered under Section 120 (b)(criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of documents), 468 (forgery of electronic record) and 471 (using forged documents for criminal purposes) of the Indian Penal Code, following a complaint lodged by State Bank of India, Chennai.Raju represents Narasapuram parliamentary constituency. He, however, turned rebel against the YSR Congress party which filed a petition before Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla last year, seeking his disqualification.Apart from Raju, his company Ind Barath Power Gencom Ltd and six other directors of the company were also booked in the case. The corporate office of the company is based in Hyderabad and the plant is located in Toothukudi, Tamil Nadu.According to the FIR, Raju and others had allegedly diverted funds, manipulated books of accounts to defraud the consortium of banks, comprising Axis Bank, SBI, Indian Overseas Bank, UCO Bank, Syndicate Bank, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and ILFS Financial Services Ltd.The fraud came to light during the forensic audit conducted by an audit firm at the request of the consortium of banks. The audit took into account the company’s transactions between May 25, 2012, and May 21, 2017, and the report was submitted on July 24, 2020. The FIR said Ind Barath Power Gencom Ltd, a power plant, was set by the MP and others at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu, with a capacity of 189 MW. The company commenced its commercial operations in January 2010 but was shut down in May 2017. The company’s account in the consortium of banks turned into a non-performing asset (NPA) on May 28, 2017.Reacting to the development, the YSRCP lawmaker said the FIR lodged against him by the CBI was fabricated without any facts. He, however, said he would fully cooperate with the CBI in the investigation and would come out clean in the case.Raju alleged that the case was registered under pressure from his own party leaders and demanded the CBI should also disclose the data of the telephone calls between the Andhra Pradesh chief minister’s office and SBI authorities in Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-files-case-against-ysr-congress-mp-in-rs-234-cr-bank-fraud-101616750549717.html
26-03-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena seeks action against police officers over phone tapping||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Friday demanded action against police officers allegedly involved in phone tapping, saying he is surprised that Rashmi Shukla continued to be the state police’s intelligence wing chief despite intercepting calls without permission. Raut said the government should have learnt a lesson and not depended too much on the administration to govern.Raut said his phone calls were allegedly tapped along with those of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, independent lawmakers, and journalists when they were in talks to form the Shiv Sena-led government in the state.“The government should decide [on action against the officers]. Why is there a need to demand over it? ... Whosoever was involved in the formation of the [Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress] government [in 2019], their phones were tapped,” Raut told reporters in Delhi. Also Read | Ex-intel chief misguided authorities: Chief secretary’s report to Maharashtra CMIn his report, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte blamed Shukla for intercepting calls under the guise of “public safety” and thus “misguided the authorities”.Raut referred to independent lawmaker and minister Rajendra Patil Yadravkar’s comments on Thursday that Shukla called her and asked him to back the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it sought to form the government in the state. He added it is not a revelation because everyone knew about phone tapping. “[Shukla] called independent legislators and of smaller parties asking them not to align with the [Uddhav] Thackeray government and go with the BJP. Threats and messages that their files are ready were given,” Raut said. Raut said the state government did not hold a grudge against such officers after coming to power and retained them. But he added Shukla retaining her post was surprising. “After the [Shiv Sena-led government] came to power, the woman officer was still on the same post for the next five-six months... The administration should not be trusted so much.”Raut said three to four officers were sympathetic towards the previous BJP government and should have been removed. “Pawar was also of the opinion that such officers should not be kept around. Had action been taken at that time, the leader of opposition [Devendra Fadnavis] would not have had the opportunity to come to Delhi with those documents.”Fadnavis on Tuesday accused the Maharashtra government of sitting on “incriminating evidence” Shukla provided on an alleged “money for transfer” scam in the police department as he met the Union home secretary in Delhi and demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe on Tuesday.HT on Wednesday reported the report names senior politicians, middlemen, and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking. The report is based on intercepted phone calls of six people.BJP leader Ashish Shelar alleged Kunte’s report was prepared to save a middleman involved in the alleged transfer scam as he is close to the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-seeks-action-gainst-police-officers-over-phone-tapping-101616750548500.html

Jarkiholi, who represents Yemkanmardi seat in the state assembly, will be pitted against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Mangala Suresh Angadi, the wife of late Union minister Suresh Angadi who has represented Belagavi in Lok Sabha for four consecutive terms from 2004.Suresh Angadi died on 23 September due to Covid-19 related complications necessitating the April 17 by-election in Belagavi, about 500 km from state capital Bengaluru.Satish Jarkiholi, one of the five Jarkiholi brothers, is known as a strategist and is credited to have played a key role in helping former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah win from the Badami assembly seat in Bagalkote district in 2018.The Congress decision to name Satish for the Lok Sabha bypoll comes at a time his brother, Ramesh Jarkiholi finds himself at the centre of a raging sex scandal in Karnataka that has pushed the BJP’s BS Yediyurappa-led governement into a corner. Ramesh Jarkiholi, who had to exit from the Yediyurappa’s council of ministers because of this controversy, was disqualified in 2019 when he switched over from the Congress to the BJP but was re-elected to the assembly in the December 2019 by-elections.The Basavakalyan seat in Bidar district fell vacant after the sitting Congress legislator, B Narayan Rao, died last year. His wife, Mallamma, has already been named the Congress candidate from this seat and will face-off with Sharanu Salagar of the BJP.Maski in Raichur fell vacant after its Congress legislator, Pratapgouda Patil defected to the BJP in 2019. Patil, one of the 17 legislators who engineered the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress government in 2019 by switching sides, is the BJP candidate for the bypoll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-names-satish-jarkiholi-for-belgaum-lok-saba-bypoll-101616748448240.html

26-03-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh-based company is ‘milking’ its way to success, women empowerment||Jaswanti Rajput is among the 22,000 women who scripted the success story of Balinee - a milk producer company where all milk suppliers are women. Balinee, in turn, is scripting a women’s empowerment story. Balinee means ‘a powerful woman’ - in this case, powerful women. Also, out of the nine-member board of directors of the company, seven, including the chairperson, are women milk suppliers. Forty-five-year-old Jaswanti’s story runs parallel with that of Balinee’s. In January 2019, when the company was incorporated, Jaswanti of Naya Kheda, Prithivipur in Babina of Jhansi district, became a member milk supplier. Since then, every morning and evening Jaswanti milks her milch cattle and walks to the nearby Balinee milk collection centre carrying her milk pails (containers) to sell milk. “I had one cow then, now with the regular earning from milk sale, I have bought a buffalo and a cow. I will soon buy one more cow,” says Jaswanti. Balinee’s chief executive officer (CEO) Dr OP Singh said, “We have paid ₹61 crore since inception to our women milk suppliers. And the company’s net profit is nearly ₹3 crore so far.” “Balinee means a powerful woman. That is what our company and brand name is,” he added.Singh said, “Balinee is the only all-woman milk producer company in the state and is headquartered in Jhansi.” The company was set up under the “dairy value chain development project” in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh and is financially supported by the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) and UP State Rural Livelihood Mission (UPSRLM) with the National Dairy Development Board Dairy Services as the technical support agency. “The company has the objective of safeguarding the interests of member suppliers (exclusively women) by providing them round-the-year access to the organised market in a fair and transparent manner, timely payment, capacity building and providing livestock support services to increase milk productivity etc,” said Singh. As of now, the company has 22,000 milk supplier members across 521 villages of five districts of Bundelkhand - Jhansi, Jalaun, Banda, Hamirpur and Chitrakoot. Its target is to have 36,000 members across 600 villages in all the seven Bundelkhand districts, including Lalitpur and Mahoba, by March 2022. “We are not far from our target now,” Umakanti Pal, 31, who is one of the directors of the company noted. Umakanti is a milk supplier and secretary of the Jai Ma Durgey Women Self-Help Group in her village of Banki, Hamirpur. “As an individual milk supplier, I have supplied over 2,000 litres of milk to Balinee so far and earned over ₹50,000. As one of the directors, I am engaged in meetings, decision-making, connecting more villages and women to the company. Such a company is a boon for the women of the region,” she said. Balinee, till December 2020, procured 105 lakh litres of milk from its women milk suppliers with a peak procurement of 85,000 litres per day. The company has 10 chilling plants in the region with a total capacity of 1.5 lakh litres per day. “Balinee supplies milk to Mother Dairy in Etawah. We send milk in our milk trucks,” said Singh. All women milk suppliers of the company also hold shares. “We have put in an efficient system of milk procurement at every procurement village. The milk is weighed, tested and the value calculated without manual intervention using data-processer-cum-milk collection unit. The real-time data is transferred using GPRS to a central server and the milk payment is transferred directly to the individual member’s bank account once in 10 days. In addition to the acknowledgement slip, the members also get SMS on their phones,” said Singh. The company also provides services for productivity improvement of milch cattle, quality nutrition, feed and breeding. It has so far done 6,000 artificial inseminations, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-based-company-is-milking-its-way-to-success-women-empowerment-101616745688396.html
26-03-2021||Mumbai||Journalist and writer Anil Dharker passes away at 74||Indian journalist and writer Anil Dharker died of a cardiac ailment at a Mumbai hospital on Friday morning. He was 74 years old. Dharker had been admitted for a scheduled bypass surgery. The founder and director of the Mumbai International Literary Festival and of Tata Literature Live!, Dharker had been battling cardiac issues for a few years. “Dharker was one of the pillars of the cultural legacy of Mumbai,” said cricket writer and commentator Ayaz Memon, a friend and former colleague who worked with Dharker at the city tabloid Mid-Day and later at The Independent, Mumbai. “He was a man of fine style and fine words and had a delectable style of writing.” Dharker was also a member of the National Centre for the Performing Arts theatre committee and a columnist for the NCPA’s monthly magazine, On Stage. “He was a delightful companion who always had so many stories to tell,” NCPA chairman Khushroo Santook said on Friday. “His greatest contribution is his profound writing on politics, philosophy and current affairs, which were liked by old and young alike.” A statement released by the Tata Lit Live! festival described Dharker as “the quintessential Renaissance Man, myriad-minded and deeply knowledgeable across genres; an engineer by training who shone in the Arts”. “I first worked with Anil in the 1990s, when he was editor of The Independent in Mumbai. He was the politest editor I’ve ever worked with – before and since,” said Shashi Baliga, executive director of Tata Lit Live! “He gave us all, old-timers and young entrants, absolute freedom to air our views, however far removed they were from his. And that is why Tata Literature Live! has reached the heights it has in ten wonderful years.” Online, writers took to Twitter to express their grief. Columnist Shobhaa De wrote: “Goodbye dearest Anil. An elegant mind, a stylish writer, and a loyal friend. You will be missed by all those whose lives you touched. RIP.” Journalist Meenal Baghel tweeted: “Terrible new about @anildharker. He has been a big influence in Mumbai journalism and was an unfailingly kind man.” Dharker had studied engineering in the UK but had always wanted to write. After returning to India, he first worked as a senior consultant at Pheroze Kandianavala & Associates, a leading architectural practice where he devised fire safety innovations for the city’s growing number of multi-storey buildings. His writing on cinema led to a role heading the Film Finance Corporation, before it became the National Film Development Corporation. Dharker is survived by his ex-wife, poet Imtiaz Dharker, their daughter Ayesha Dharker, and his partner, the editor and writer Amy Fernandes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/journalist-and-writer-anil-dharker-passes-away-at-74-101616742388181.html

KMSC activists laid a siege to the rail track near Valla village on the Amritsar-Delhi rail route. They staged a protest at Golden Gate, the main entrance to the holy city. Barring emergency services, no one was allowed to travel on roads. Contradicting the leaders’ announcement that pilgrims going to participate in Hola Mohalla at Sri Anandpur Sahib will not be restricted, the farmers stopped their vehicles too, causing inconvenience. A complete bandh was observed in neighbouring Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts. Farmers held demonstrations at chowks in Batala town, demanding the farm laws be repealed by the government. The bandh call affected normal life in Pathankot district, which is considered a stronghold of the BJP, which leads the NDA coalition at the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/complete-shutdown-brings-life-to-standstill-in-punjab-s-majha-region-101616742210708.html

26-03-2021||Other||CAG raps Bihar road development corp for avoidable interest payment of ₹37.75 cr||Even as the ambitious Ganga Path project, along the river Ganga from Digha to Deedarganj, is still in the construction stage having missed several deadlines in the last few years, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its audit report has now rapped the Bihar State Road Development Corporation (BSRDCL) for paying avoidable interest on loans without taking into account the “availability of funds” and “slow progress of work”. The project faces cost escalation due to several missed deadlines. In its report, the audit body has said that the BSDRCL made avoidable payment of interest of ₹37.75 crore by the unnecessary withdrawal of loan worth ₹193 crore from Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) in the period 2013-18 and later refunded the loan amount. The project has now got a new deadline of December 2022 with work of approach roads connecting various points at Ashok Rajpath still going on. The 23.50-kilometre-long road from Digfha to Deedarganj along the river, with an elevated portion for several kilometres, is aimed at easing traffic congestion on the Ashok Rajpath and provide better connectivity from West to East Patna. In its report on Public Sector Undertakings recently tabled in the state assembly, the CAG has said the project, which was given administrative approval in 2013 at a cost of ₹3,160 crore, was to be financed through the state government’s contribution of ₹1,160 crore and ₹2,000 crore from the HUDCO. The CAG added that scrutiny of records (March 2017) has revealed that construction work was given to a contractor at a total cost of ₹1,777.37 crore in August 2013 with the date of completion targeted for the road in September 2017. Due to technical problems and land-related issues, the pace of construction was very slow. The audit body has found the BSDRCL erring on the count that despite receiving funds to the tune of ₹836.20 crore as project fund (during 2013-18) from the state government, the company withdrew loan amounting to ₹193 crore from the HUDCO in two instalments. One instalment of a loan worth ₹125 crore was withdrawn in February 2014 despite having ₹20.22 crore as balance out of the funds received from the Bihar government. The second instalment of ₹68 crore was withdrawn in March 2015 despite a balance of ₹260 for the project. “Since there was no actual requirement of loan due to the slow progress of work, the company refunded the loan amount. Thus, due to inefficient financial management, the company unnecessarily withdrew interest-bearing loan worth ₹193 crore despite the availability of funds and incurred avoidable expenditure of ₹37.75 crore on interest payment from 2013-18,” the report said. The audit body also found no merit in the BSRDCL’s contention that the first and the second instalments of loans were availed to avoid automatic closure of the loan agreement and automatic curtailment of the loan agreement. “The reply is not acceptable. The company should have taken up the matter with HUDCO for non-withdrawal of instalment to avoid interest on the loan amount,” the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cag-raps-bihar-road-development-corp-for-avoidable-interest-payment-of-rs-37-75-cr-101616729546902.html
26-03-2021||Other||Goa CM’S pledge to start mining corporation evokes mixed response||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant’s surprise announcement - that the state would set up a state-run mining corporation - has set the cat among the pigeons in Goa’s mining sector that has long been the fief of a small group of mining companies who were beneficiaries of concessions from the erstwhile Portuguese government. While the chief minister didn’t elaborate on what role the corporation would play towards the resumption in the state, Sawant assured that the bill to set up the corporation would be introduced in the current session of the Goa Legislative Assembly and that the state was “100 per cent committed to restarting of mining in the state at the earliest.” The corporation route - in which Goa’s mining leases be handed over to a government-run corporation, thus dispensing with the need to conduct auctions - was one of the options before the state government which has had to contend with a stoppage in mining activity since March 2018 after the Supreme Court cancelled 88 mining lease renewals that were granted in 2015 ruling that the renewals were illegal. The Supreme Court in its order asked the Goa government to issue fresh mining leases and not renew existing ones if mining is to restart in Goa. However, the MMDR Act, as amended in 2015, now mandates auctions for grant of fresh leases to private players, something the government has been reluctant to do. Sawant’s announcement to set up a corporation is a fresh twist to the saga which began with the government first seeking a legislative cure, which meant asking the Central government to amend the Act to give retrospective validity to Goa’s leases, filing a review petition before the Supreme Court as well as more recently Sawant announcing that the state government would be going ahead with auction process for grant of fresh leases. However, mining companies in Goa believe that treating Goa’s mining leases as ‘dead’ would be prejudicial to their claims that they are eligible not just for renewals but also to their claims to perpetual concessions as granted by the Portuguese. The Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA), has in a terse statement cautiously welcomed Sawant’s latest announcement. “Resumption of mining operations in the state of Goa has always been the objective of the association and its members. Resumption of mining operations have to be as per prevailing laws and acts as well as in accordance with the matter before the Hon’ble Court,” the GMOEA said. Several mining-related cases in Goa are pending before the Supreme Court, most notably a plea challenging the Central government’s act converting Goa’s mining concessions granted by the Portuguese into leases under the Mines and Minerals Development Act (MMDA) is also pending currently before the Supreme Court as well as a plea to retrospectively grant a 50-year validity to Goa’s mining leases till 2037, which the mining companies have said they are eligible for. Any attempt to resume mining before adjudicating the pending cases would further obfuscate the ongoing saga, the miners have said, a claim which found support from the Central government which approached the Supreme Court, seeking early disposal of the cases.“Till the legal issues pertaining to the rights accruing to the mining concession holders under the Portuguese Colonial Mining Law, which were converted into mining leases by the Abolition Act, are not decided one way or the other, the title of the mines will not get clear and as a natural corollary the directions passed by this court (SC) would not get implemented in its letter and spirit,” the mines ministry said in an appeal before the Supreme Court. “Pending adjudication of the legal issues involved there will always remain an inherent legal uncertainty on the title rights of the mines if granted as per the directions passed by this Court as the original title of rights is still under litigation,” the ministry told the Supreme Court in its application.Meanwhile, the Goa Foundation has welcomed the move calling it a step in the right direction. “This is a welcome move. If installed with sincerity, it means the government of Goa has decided to get rid of the old system with its in-built weaknesses which have facilitated unaccounted and illegal mining,” director of Goa Foundation, Claude Alvares, said. “Though the setting up of a corporation is welcome, its management also needs to be completely professional. Hitherto, the Directorate of Mines and Geology has handled mining, but with poor business sense, and hardly any skills with the trade in minerals or their use. The new Corporation should not be run by bureaucrats or politicians,” Alvares said. “The very need to do illegal mining will come to a halt if the corporation holds on to all leases, hands out extraction contracts to capable persons under bidding schemes, takes charge of the output and e-auctions it professionally. Most of the wealth generated will accrue to the public exchequer. The best way to handle the revenue is to place it in the permanent fund, and distribute its investment gains to all citizens of Goa as a basic dividend, keeping the capital intact for coming generations,” he added.The Goa Mining People’s Front, a collective of workers’ unions, too, said they welcome the decision but cautioned against any premature jubilation. “We want work at the mines to start, it doesn’t matter how. But unless previous legal issues are resolved, attempts to restart mining will lead to more litigation,” Puti Gaonkar, president of the GMPF said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-cm-s-pledge-to-start-mining-corporation-evokes-mixed-response-101616727566240.html

Later on October 7, Ambala MLA Aseem Goel staged a symbolic protest outside the state assembly in Chandigarh against the delay in procurement, blaming state additional chief secretary (consumer affairs) PK Das for the same.Ambala (city) SDM Sachin Gupta said that the focus will be on cleaning the mandis before the season begins, along with proper facility of drinking water, food, toilet and electricity.Representatives of commission agents also pressed for timely lifting and transportation of the crop, among other issues, during the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wheat-procurement-ambala-admn-ups-manpower-for-smooth-operation-101616715266710.html

26-03-2021||Bangalore||Woman in Jarkiholi case seeks protection for kin||The woman in the video linked to the sexual harassment case against Karnataka BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi, raised doubts on Thursday over the credibility of the Special Investigation Team probing the case and sought protection for her family. Meanwhile, Jarkiholi has claimed that he has “shocking evidence” to expose the real culprit in the case, and will release it at the right time.In a video statement released on Thursday, the woman claimed she would appear before the SIT only when she is assured about her family’s safety. “I will appear before the SIT only after the safety of my parents is ensured. I will take care of all further procedures and also provide statements (once their safety is ensured).”Referring to the missing complaint lodged by her family, she said: “I don’t think that my parents have given the complaint out of their own will because they know I have done nothing.”“I had sent a video to SIT on March 12 addressing the Home Minister, seeking protection. But the video was made public 30 minutes after Jarkiholi filed a complaint (on March 13). This has raised doubts on whom the SIT is protecting,” she said.In the video, the woman has also requested Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah, state Congress president DK Shivakumar, senior Congress MLA and former Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar, along with women’s organisations, to provide security to her parents.The video has come a day after the budget session of the state legislature was adjourned sine die, five days ahead of the schedule of March 31, as the sexual harassment case rocked the proceedings.On March 12, the woman released a video seeking protection. “I don’t have any one supporting me. Ramesh Jarkiholi promised me a job. After all that is done, the video has been released now. I don’t know how it has happened. I request you to provide me with protection.”Reacting to the woman’s statement, state home minister Basavaraj Bommai said the SIT was doing an impartial probe and was ready to give protection to her and also her parents. “.. let whoever say whatever they want, we are doing an impartial probe, our officials have said they have inquired Ramesh Jarkiholi also, and are ready to take the woman’s statement,” Bommai told news agency PTI.Shivakumar said that the Congress party stands by what it said in the Assembly and urged the state government to ensure safety of the woman and her family.Meanwhile, Jarkiholi asked the media to take note of the conspiracy involved, while asserting that the woman was under pressure.“First, her video came out half-an-hour after I filed my complaint on March 13. Now, she says her video had been sent on March 12 itself... There’s politics behind this. I’m ready to face even if there are ten more CDs... Also, look at the planning...what was (her) voice then and what is it now,” he told news agency PTI.“We have readied evidence... I haven’t done anything wrong and I will 100 per cent succeed. With God’s blessings, I will come out of this...,” he added.Claiming that he had “shocking evidence”, he said: “I will release it when I have to..this evidence is against that great leader.. I haven’t revealed the name of the great leader because what if he is innocent and someone else was just using his name? Let’s wait, you will get to know,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/woman-in-jarkiholi-case-seeks-protection-for-kin-101616709241032.html

26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Holi sales dwindle in Chandigarh amid Covid restrictions||With Covid cases rising in the city and the administration banning the celebration of Holi in public government parks, Sukhna Lake and Sector 17 Plaza, shopkeepers selling Holi items have reported huge losses, as the festival will mostly be observed on a small scale this year.Bobby Gakkhar, who supplies items like water guns, balloons and colours, said, “Around 30% of the shopkeepers start to procure stock for Holi around a month before the festival. Big retailers spend about ₹1 to 2 lakh to get the latest water guns, which many did this year as well, as Covid numbers were low around February end. Now, even I haven’t sold even one packet of water balloons, which used to be a staple in previous years.”Gakhar said that shopkeepers are now willing to sell water guns without any mark-up in prices, as they still have no takers. “Something that would have sold for ₹300 last year, is now available for ₹120, but nobody is ready to buy. Shopkeepers are also in a dismal mood, and many of them won’t set up stalls in front of their shops like previous years, as the festive spirit is missing.”Even sweet shop owners remain cynical about Holi sales this year. Proprietor of Uttam Sweets, Balwinder Singh Uttam, said, “We will be preparing festive sweets, but since people won’t visit each other’s houses, the quantity that we prepare will be reduced almost by half.” Proprietor of Sindhi Sweets, Neeraj Bajaj added, “Sales will drop by 50% and we won’t prepare many gift boxes this time. We will make gujiya, since it has close ties with the festival. Apart from that, we will stock normal sweets like rasgullas.”President of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) Charanjiv Singh said, “This is a sad time for all and shopkeepers are suffering losses, but there isn’t much we can do. We hope that the number of cases decline soon.”Jail stocks up on gujiyaThe Central Jail has been working to produce gujiya for Holi, which is sold at the jail itself and their Srijan Store in Sector 22. Assistant inspector general (jails) Virat said, “We will sell organic colours, while advising the people to maintain protocol while playing holi. However, the emphasis is on preparing gujiya.

26-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro to increase checks to ensure Covid safety compliance, commute time may go up||Travel time for passengers in Delhi Metro is likely to witness a rise, with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation on Thursday announcing that they will intensify their drive to ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour inside the system in the wake of rising number of cases in the Capital. This effectively means that passengers may have to wait in queues to enter Metro stations.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) also said that entry will be strictly regulated as per Covid-19 physical distancing protocols, especially at major stations like Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba Road, Central Secretariat, Patel Chowk, ITO. The checks will be stepped up during morning and evening peak hours.“Due to the strict reinforcement of social distancing norms, passengers are advised to plan their journey in advance and allow for additional time of 20-30 minutes for their commute. If possible, off-peak hour travel may also be opted by those who have the flexibility to avoid overcrowding/long wait during peak hours,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said on Thursday.DMRC’s heightened safety protocols come two days after the Delhi government identified the Metro services to be among the five super-spreader zones that were contributing to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital. The city has been witnessing a steady increase of fresh cases, notching 1,515 cases on Thursday at a positivity rate of 1.69%.Metro authorities will also be increasing the number of flying squads for checking violations of physical distancing and mask protocols inside the trains. “Inside trains, the number of flying squads and the frequency of checking drives is being increased,” a Metro official said, adding that “offenders will be penalized on the spot.”Data shared by DMRC showed that while the monthly footfall since Metro operations resumed in September last year was the highest in February, the number of prosecutions for violation of Covid-19 safety norms was the lowest in the same month. While 7.16 crore commuters used the Metro in February, as compared to 1.48 crore in September 2020 (when Delhi Metro reopened), the number of violations detected decreased for the same period from 5,180 (in September last year) to 2,823.“The teams also counsel passengers regarding Covid protocols and penalise them if required under section 59 of Delhi Metro O&M Act, for creating nuisance, such as not wearing masks/maintaining social distancing during their travel inside trains. Regular announcements inside trains and station premises are also being made to create mass awareness,” Dayal said.Commuters have also been asked to maintain social distance, while entering or exiting stations. “While waiting in a queue, the passengers will be strictly required to wait on the marked social distancing circles/stripes. If it is found that the social distancing protocols are not being followed at stations, entry gates will be closed for passengers at those stations until social distancing can be ensured,” DMRC said.In order to ensure that there is no overcrowding outside Metro stations, DMRC said it will write to district officials to deploy staff who maintain physical distancing outside the stations. “There might be a spike in number of passengers waiting outside the stations for their turn to enter stations in line with social distancing norms,” it added.As per the existing Covid Safety Protocol, it is mandatory for all the passengers to enter the station after thermal screening, hand sanitization, bag sanitization, and with their faces properly covered with a mask. Social distancing in Metro premises is to be followed throughout their journey.Though, passengers are also required to sit in designated alternate seats and stand at spots with floor stickers inside the train, several commuters were seen flouting these norms during a spot check done by HT this week.Ritu Gupta, 20, an undergraduate student at Delhi University, who travels from Dwarka to GTB Nagar to attend her coaching classes, said, “People have become careless in terms of maintaining physical distancing inside the trains. With the rise in number of commuters, many sit on seats that are supposed to remain empty during the journey. This situation can be alarming for families with elderly people, who are yet to get vaccinated.”Other commuters pointed out the problem of crowding at Metro stations. “At peak hours at busier Metro stations, people rush inside the trains in groups. Though it is not bad as old times, being coming in close proximity to people who are not even wearing their masks properly increases the chance of infection,” said Mohit Sharma, 29, a marketing executive who travels from INA to his office in Gurgaon daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-to-increase-checks-to-ensure-covid-safety-compliance-commute-time-may-go-up-101616699281672.html

26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Sunil Jakhar ‘upstaged’ by Prashant Kishor, should resign as Punjab Cong chief immediately: Akali Dal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Thursday said Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar should submit his resignation immediately to the party’s de facto leader Rahul Gandhi as he had been “upstaged” by chief minister Amarinder Singh’s newly appointed adviser Prashant Kishor. “Since Kishor assumed Jakhar’s powers and functions by holding a meeting with 37 first-time party MLAs, the latter has become redundant and should put in his papers. Jakhar does not have any role to play in the party now as Kishore has been empowered to interact with legislators directly,” the former minister said. Amarinder may repose faith in PK (referring to Kishor), TK or GK but cannot escape the fact that he took a false oath in the name of the holy Gutka Sahib and Guru Gobind Singh, he said.“How can the CM run away from the fact that he got forms filled from the youth promising them government jobs? How can he deny that he promised unemployment allowance of ₹2,500 per month to youths and ‘ghar ghar naukari’ to them? He will have to tell as why he reneged on the promise to give ₹2,500 per month old age pension and why he had not given electricity at the rate of ₹5 to both the domestic and commercial consumers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sunil-jakhar-upstaged-by-prashant-kishor-should-resign-as-punjab-cong-chief-immediately-akali-dal-101616703985386.html
26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to start third phase of garbage collection from April 1||The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) will start the third phase of its door-to-door garbage collection drive from April 1 for the remaining sectors of the city.In December last year, the MC had taken up door-to-door garbage collection through its own vehicles in Sectors 1 to 30. In March this year, though it initially planned to cover the entire city, it could collect waste in only 12 southern sectors (31-38, 38 West, and 46-48).MC joint commissioner Sorabh Arora said, “We will be starting the third phase on April 1. The exact number of sectors where the drive would be carried out will be decided in a review meeting scheduled for Friday.”The MC had deployed its 93 garbage collection vehicles in Sectors 1 to 30, replacing the informal cart-based waste lifting system. Earlier, the civic body had also deployed 99 vehicles to collect waste in some villages and commercial areas of the city. In the second phase started in March, it deployed additional 70 vehicles for the process.MC medical officer Dr Amrit Warring said, “We are aiming to start garbage collection in all sectors from April 1. Thereafter, we will initiate the process in areas like Manimajra.”To ease the payment of garbage collection charges, the MC has introduced POS (point of sale) machines.Streamline process, say residents The MC is still struggling with teething problems, particularly in the 12 southern sectors, where garbage collection was initiated in March. In many sectors, waste is still being picked up by private players, while in other areas, residents complain about accessibility issues.“It is a mixed case in Sector 38 as some of its parts are being covered by MC collection vehicles, while in other pockets, the old waste collectors continue to pick up garbage in their carts, seemingly through some understanding with MC-deployed staff. We expect the system to be streamlined in the coming months,” said Major (retd) DP Singh, chief adviser, Sector 38 resident welfare association (RWA).The MC, which had assured collection of garbage from houses, as was being done by the cart-based collectors, has failed to achieve its mission in most areas. “Under the new system, though private collectors have been taken over by the MC, still garbage is not being collected from the upper floors. Residents who are away for work and old persons are facing great difficulty in ensuring daily handing over of garbage. Many a times, they are seen requesting their neighbours’ help,” said RS Kaura, president of Sector 32 RWA.Confusion over payment There is also confusion among residents as to whom to pay the garbage collection charges — MC or cart-based collectors.“The MC should immediately clarify that who will take the collection charges for the last three months. Cart-based collectors have picked up garbage in this period even in parts of northern sectors. They are now coming and demanding payment for their services. Moroever, the MC is yet to add collection charges for the last three months in the water bills as was stated earlier,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO).Under the new system, waste collectors are refusing to pick horticulture and C&D waste like broken plant earthen pots. “Earlier, residents had no difficulty in handing over such waste. We are facing issues as there is no alternative arrangement for the same,” said Kidar Nath Sharma, president, Sector 46 RWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-start-third-phase-of-garbage-collection-from-april-1-101616703866131.html

AAP is playing with the public sentiment. Such fudged data are used either in print media or in the electronic media to create a false impression,” he added.He said that such fake records were given wide publicity in their election campaign. “Putting advertisements and pasting handbills on the walls or by further circulating through their own IT cells on the social media, they raise the political prospects of their party and try to damage the interest of other political parties. Such an act is not only unethical, but is a criminal act,” Dhanda added. “We have submitted a complaint demanding strict criminal action and thorough probe behind this fictitious survey,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fudged-opinion-poll-sad-lodges-plaint-against-agency-kejriwal-bhagwant-101616703387603.html

We run a grocery store, and our goods get covered with fly ash daily. It also causes breathing troubles. Despite our raising the issue for a long time, no action has been taken by the authorities.”The residents stated that problems had increased after the MC discontinued the refuse-derived fuel (RDF) plant installed at the dumpsite in the first week of February after the A2Z company left the work.Naveen Kumar, a shopkeeper at Tibba road, said,” Foul smell is emanated from the waste dumped at the dumpsite. A large number of tippers move through the area to dump garbage at the main dumpsite. As they are improperly covered, the garbage from the tippers falls on the roads. Shopkeepers also face problems due to dust emission.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The MC is working to deal with the issue. Tenders for allotting three separate contracts, including those for dealing with door collection of waste, shifting waste from secondary points to the main dumpsite, and for disposing of waste at the main dumpsite, will be floated in the first week of April.”Likely to affect city’s ranking in Swachh SurvekshanThe failure of MC in dealing with the waste is also likely to hit the ranking of the city in the Swachh Survekshan 2021-22. The third-party inspections are going on under the survey. After the dismal performance in Swachh Survekshan 2020, wherein the city was ranked at the 34th position out of 47 cities with over 10 lakh population, the civic body had been working hard to improve its ranking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-bear-brunt-of-ludhiana-mc-s-failure-to-dispose-of-waste-101616703386664.html

One of the dealers was admitted to a hospital after he lost consciousness. They said the police gave them a clean chit in the case after sensing that the situation was turning serious and also offered to bear the medical expenses of the hospitalised dealer in case they did not file a complaint. One of them is Kali Prasad, 32, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, and had been living in Kakowal in Ludhiana. He said on March 23, some police personnel turned up at his shop on Noorwala Road in two vehicles to conduct a raid. “The cops said they were investigating a burglary case that took place at a multipurpose store and suspected that I had hid the stolen articles in my shop. I was not present at the shop at that time, but I asked them to check if they wanted,” he added. “The police rounded up my brother Kalideen, 28, and another scrap dealer Bipin Das, also from Noorwala Road, and took them to the police station. When I reached the police station around 7.30pm, the police took us inside and thrashed us badly,” he alleged. He further claimed that the police released them and asked them to visit again the next day. “When we reached the police station around 3pm, cops took my brother into custody. After some time, he fainted and threw up. He was rushed to a hospital. Later, on Wednesday night, the police told us that our names have not been included in the FIR and gave us a clean chit,” Kali Prasad added. However, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) (North) Gurbinder Singh refuted the allegations of torture. He said the police had called on three suspects for questioning. One of the suspects was drunk and collapsed immediately after entering the police station, he said, adding that he was then taken to the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scrap-dealers-allege-torture-by-ludhiana-police-acp-refutes-claims-101616703385260.html

However, sarpanches of Sangrur block announced not to pay the bills and said that they will stage protests across the district from March 27. On Thursday, they held a protest outside the office of Sangrur BDPO.“The panchayats have received grants from the central government for development projects under 14th Finance Commission. Though the bills were not paid for many years, the government ordered us to pay these which are in lakhs. We will not pay these bills and the grants will be used for development works in villages,” said Jasvir Singh Channa, Sangrur block chief of the panchayat union, whose wife Rajwinder Kaur is a sarpanch of Fatehgarh Channa.“We will not use these funds for the payment of pending electricity bills. The protest will be intensified across the state as sarpanches associated with the Congress party are also part of the agitation,” said Harbhajan Singh Duggan, whose wife Surinder Kaur is a sarpanch of Duggan village.Sangrur BDPO Lenin Garg said that he issued a letter to the panchayats of Sangrur block as per directions of higher authorities. “The sarpanch concerned is chairman of the water supply and sanitation committee who is responsible for the electricity bill payment.

26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Amid worries over new Covid strain, 60 +ve patients go untraceable in Bathinda||Amid high presence of the new UK strain, a more infectious variant of the virus, in positive patients across the state, the health authorities are facing it hard to trace infected patients who gave wrong phone numbers and incomplete addresses at the time of sampling. The untraceable Covid patients have set the alarm bells ringing for the health authorities as 326 of the 401 samples from across the state, collected between January 1 and March 10 and sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for genome sequencing, showed the presence of the new UK strain. Bathinda, which has the highest active number of Covid cases in the southern Punjab districts, also has a maximum of 60 untraceable positive patients where seven were added on Thursday. As per the official data, the district had only one untraceable case on February 28, which means the health department is unable to reach 59 such patients in the 25 days, who were tested positive for coronavirus. Health experts say such individuals are posing a “public health risk” in the absence of strict rules of identity confirmation. The health authorities of various districts have now started approaching the police to trace such patients to isolate them and contain virus spread. Bathinda civil surgeon TS Dhillon said the issue came to the notice of the health team recently as officials could not contact them after they were found to be positive. He said the department on Wednesday decided to relook into each such case. “This is a serious matter that patients furnish wrong contact details or remain inaccessible to the department for their health audit. It is crucial that individuals who tested positive are medically taken care of. The new stain of Covid is stated to be 70% more infectious and infected persons need isolation for larger public health interest,” he said. Sources said during a video conferencing on Tuesday, the civil surgeons apprised the department high-ups of the worrying situation that is emerging across the state. Dhillon said the department is considering asking for photo identity card details for more authenticated contact details of those who appear for testing. With 521 active cases (230 added in last three days), Bathinda is emerging as the hotbed of coronavirus cases in the south Malwa region. Ninety nine new cases were added on Thursday. Acknowledging a similar problem, Fazilka chief medical officer Kundan Kumar Pal said the civil and police administration has been given a list of four patients as there is a possible threat of infection spread from those withholding their real identities. Presently, the individuals are asked their address, phone numbers and Aadhar number at the time of sampling and no documentary proof is attached with the sample. “We faced a similar situation during the first wave of the pandemic outbreak in July-August last year too. The problem should be addressed strictly to curb the spread as even a single unidentified infected person could spread the disease to many,” said another health official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-worries-over-new-covid-strain-60-ve-patients-go-untraceable-in-bathinda-101616702365613.html
26-03-2021||Chandigarh||5 senior Punjab cops suspended for collusion with ex-sarpanch accused of running drug cartel||The Punjab government has suspended five senior police officers, including controversial inspector general (IG) Paramraj Singh Umranangal, for their alleged complicity with former Rano village (Ludhiana district) sarpanch Gurdeep Singh Rano who was arrested last year by the special task force (STF) for running a high-profile drug cartel. Umranangal is already facing suspension in the 2015 police firing cases. Two SP-rank officers and DSPs each suspended by the director general of police (DGP) in an order dated March 23 include Varinderjit Singh Thind, assistant commandant, 4th battalion, Pathankot; Faridkot SP (detective) Sewa Singh Malli; and DSPs Parminder Singh Bath and Karansher Singh. In November last year, the STF had recovered 5.39 kg heroin, illegal arms and luxury vehicles worth ₹3 crore from the accused Gurdeep Rano in a special operation and the probe into the matter had pointed towards the role of police officials and some influential politicians. Following investigation of the accused, the STF had prepared a detailed report about the complicity of the five cops with the ex-sarpanch who enjoyed a significant political clout in his area. This report was forwarded for action to the DGP on December 2. A senior STF official said the accused Rano revealed that he used to bear expenses of Umranangal for participating in sports events as chief guest when the latter was posted as DIG Ludhiana range. “The accused also claimed the officer also helped him to take illegal possession of 4 kanals of land behind Apollo Hospital in Ludhiana. He also gave details of Umranangal’s hotel stays and other expenses incurred on him,” the official added. Varinderjit Singh Thind, who remained Payal DSP during the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government, provided gunmen to Rano who was elected as sarpanch as an Akali nominee and enjoyed a lot of political clout, the official said. Thind often visited Rano’s house and had also invested ₹25 lakh in his liquor business at the time, the report says. Also, Sewa Singh Malhi helped Rano reach a compromise in a dispute over a liquor vend and the STF claims to have recovered diary from the ex-sarpanch with details of payments. “Parminder Singh Bath had also invested ₹8 lakh in Rano’s liquor business, the report says, adding Rano was yet to pay ₹1 lakh to the officer as his share in the profit. Also, Rano had lent money to some persons on the guarantee of DSP Karansher Singh,” the report says. The STF is probing whether the money used by Rano on the cops came from the drug business only, said the STF official, adding that they have already recorded the officials’ statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-senior-punjab-cops-suspended-for-collusion-with-ex-sarpanch-accused-of-running-drug-cartel-101616702246908.html
26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Mass resignations rock Punjabi University||An administrative crisis loomed over Punjabi University, Patiala, as 28 of its top officials, including the dean of academic affairs, the registrar and the heads of eight academic departments, resigned en masse on Thursday, expressing their dissatisfaction over the working of officiating vice-chancellor (V-C) Ravneet Kaur, a senior IAS officer.This comes barely two weeks after the state government came to the rescue of the beleaguered varsity by announcing a special financial grant of ₹90 crore. Others who resigned included the controller of examination; dean of colleges; dean of directorate of international students; additional dean (research); additional dean (alumni); additional dean of student welfare; director of women’s studies; and incharge of internal audit.The resignations were filed following consultations with the office-bearers of the Punjabi University Teachers’ Union (PUTA), which along with other non-teaching staff unions has been protesting against the alleged delay in promotions and other administrative issues. In the evening, officiating V-C Ravneet Kaur, who is additional chief secretary (forests) in the Punjab government, called an emergency meeting with dean (academic affairs) Amritpal Kaur, registrar Devinder Singh and the PUTA members in Chandigarh. “The meeting was scheduled for Friday to discuss demands of the protesting unions, but it was advanced by a day in the wake of the resignations by top varsity officials. The issue will be resolved at the earliest,” the officiating V-C said. PUTA secretary Avneet Pal Singh said the bureaucratic interference in the varsity’s affairs was damaging as no one is paying heed to the demands of the employees. “The officiating vice-chancellor is working in an autocratic manner. The files pertaining to promotion of 105 teachers have been put on hold for five months. Moreover, the top officials of the varsity are feeling suffocated and ignored due to which they resigned in one go,” he said. Ravneet Kaur was appointed the officiating V-C by the Punjab government after Prof BS Ghuman had resigned from the post in November last year. ‘Staff unions of hindering administrative working’Accusing the staff unions of hindering the administrative working of the university, Kaur said, “They have laid siege to the administrative offices and are preventing the important issues from being discussed. There is no reason of holding promotion cases as the approvals will be given after proper scrutiny of each case.” The extension cases were cleared in last syndicate meeting, while the promotion cases will be put up in the upcoming conference, she added. Illegal appointees on promotion list The varsity management is scrutinising each promotion case as the list has the names of those allegedly recruited in an illegal manner besides the ones seeking previous service benefits, it is learnt. An inquiry into the appointment of 62 assistant professors hired from 2009 to 2016 is already pending. The varsity had roped in the state vigilance bureau to probe the matter and sent all records related to the recruitment of teachers from 2009 to 2016 to the vigilance. In a complaint filed in 2017, it was alleged that these assistant professors were appointed by violating the University Grants Commission (UGC) norms related to National Eligibility Test (NET) and PhD. It was also alleged that wards and relatives of the then ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders were recruited on regular posts, ignoring the eligible candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mass-resignations-rock-punjabi-university-101616702246004.html

26-03-2021||Chandigarh||J&K Police opposes Mehbooba’s passport renewal citing ‘adverse report’||The Jammu and Kashmir Police has opposed giving passport to former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti citing “adverse report” against her, officials said on Thursday.A report has been submitted to the Jammu and Kashmir High Court which is hearing a petition filed by Mehbooba over the delay in clearing her passport application.Mehbooba had applied for a fresh passport in December last year after the previous one expired on May 31, but the application has not been cleared till date in the absence of a police verification report.The officials said that “an adverse report” has been filed against her by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), but refused to elaborate saying the matter would be taken up before the high court.Hearing the petition on March 23, additional solicitor general TM Shamsi, representing the Ministry of External Affairs and the Regional Passport office, sought a short adjournment after the counsel representing the Jammu and Kashmir CID informed Justice Ali Mohammed Magrey that the verification report on her passport application had been submitted on March 18.However, Shamsi informed the court that he had received a communication from the Passport Officer in Srinagar on March 22 and the contents “reveal that the verification of the petitioner is under process and as soon as verification process is completed, the requisite report will be submitted immediately for further course of action”.“Communication further reveals that CID verification report in respect of the petitioner is still awaited from the JK CID. Copy of communication so produced by Shamsi...is taken on record,” Justice Magrey said while posting the matter for further hearing on March 29.The counsel for Mehbooba had submitted that the stand taken by the Regional Passport Officer, Srinagar with reference to non-availability of report from the JK CID, has delayed issuance of passport in favour of the petitioner.In the petition, Mehbooba said her passport expired on May 31 last year and accordingly she applied for issuance of a fresh passport before the authorities concerned on December 11, 2020.Mehbooba’s counsel submitted that according to instructions issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, the passport of an individual is to be issued within 30 days but in the instant case, despite lapse of three months, passport has not been issued to the petitioner due to the pending police verification.The 61-year-old politician was put under preventive custody on August 5, 2019, the day the central government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and bifurcated the erstwhile state into union territories.She was released in October last year after the Union Territory administration revoked the charges under the Public Safety Act against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-police-opposes-mehbooba-s-passport-renewal-citing-adverse-report-101616701945187.html

26-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt starts process to form judicial panel||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray decided to conduct a probe into the allegations levelled by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh against home minister Anil Deshmukh, the state government began the process to form a judicial commission, which will be headed by a retired judge, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) insiders said. On Wednesday, in a meeting of senior ministers held at his residence, Thackeray decided to form a commission to probe Singh’s allegations that Deshmukh was asking police officers to collect money and he had set a target of ₹100 crore for Sachin Vaze, who is now the main accused in the Antilia bomb scare as well as businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death case. “We need concurrence of a retired judge who will probe the charges levelled against the home minister, which may take a few days,” said an MVA minister, requesting anonymity. The commission is likely to be formed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, which will give it powers to summon anyone for deposition, seek documents and conduct hearings. In an eight-page letter, Singh on March 20 accused Deshmukh of running a bribery ring. He brought up the charges through a letter three days after being transferred from his post of Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra, on March 17. The home minister has welcomed any move to initiate a probe into the charges against him. “I will welcome the move if the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) decides to initiate a probe in the allegations levelled against me by Param Bir Singh (former Mumbai police commissioner) as I only requested the chief minister for the same,” he said in a tweet on late Wednesday night. He also shared a letter written to the chief minister on March 21 in which he has requested for an investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-starts-process-to-form-judicial-panel-101616701405185.html

The temperature was 38.1°C on Wednesday. Thursday’s reading was 5.2 degrees above normal, as per the IMD.Officials warned that warm conditions will persist across most of the city till at least Saturday. The IMD has also issued a ‘yellow alert’ or heat wave warning for Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg districts. “Across the Konkan region, maximum temperature could go up even further before the weekend,” said an IMD official.The IMD’s regional meteorological centre in Mumbai defines a heat wave for the area when the maximum temperature remains at least 4.5 degrees above normal (with a recorded reading of at least 37°C). If both the IMD’s weather stations in Colaba and Mumbai simultaneously record such high temperatures for a period of 48 hours, a heat wave is declared.Though heatwaves are unlikely in Thane and Palghar districts, the weather will continue to remain hot and dry.IMD officials said the highest temperature observed in Mumbai during the month of March was 41.7°C in 1956. Since then, the city has recorded maximum temperature exceeding 40°C in March on five occasions in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/citys-max-temperature-stays-above-38-c-for-4th-day-101616701164494.html
26-03-2021||Mumbai||IIT-B researchers make robot for military ops||A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B), have designed an indigenous compact, spherical tele-operated robot that can be deployed for military purposes such as reconnaissance and search operations. A team of two professors and five research scholars — led by Leena Vachhani, associate professor from the department of Systems and Control Engineering at IIT-B — has developed a palm-sized bot that can roll in any direction with a speed of 20 centimetres per second. “The tele-operated robot may be deployed at hazardous, difficult and enemy-intruded areas and controlled from a safe region. The structure of the spherical robot has many advantages over conventional mobile vehicles or humanoids. The ball shape of a spherical robot enables rolling in any direction on planar surfaces. Sensors and other electronics are completely inside the shell, making it robust to collisions,” said Vachhani. The camera mounted inside the robot provides a real-time panoramic, 360-degree, visual feedback. The robot can be easily manoeuvred and controlled using real time visual feedback from the camera with an android application, said Abhishek Gupta, assistant professor from the Mechanical Engineering department, who was also a part of the team. The researchers have recently filed for a patent for the robot. “There is no risk of overturning and getting stuck in a collision-prone environment. It travels indoors from point to point autonomously. Outdoors, it uses GPS [global positioning systems] to navigate from point to point autonomously,’ said Vachhani, adding that application-specific sensors could be mounted on a need basis. The robot was built with funds from the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), allocated to IIT-B’s National Centre of Excellence in Technology for Internal Security (NCETIS), a joint initiative between IIT-B and MietY which has 20 projects under its belt. “The spherical robot is a low-cost surveillance system in comparison to other conventional surveillance systems available in the market. The product was improvised over time. We have been in touch with the National Security Guard for this robot. Rigorous testing is still pending as some work is yet to be completed. We are looking for industry to commercialise this product. Recently, during the Industry Day programme organised by NCETIS, we invited industry [members] to view our products. Some companies have shown interest,” Seema Periwal, senior programme manager for NCETIS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbresearchers-make-robot-for-military-ops-101616701106121.html

This is the second case in a week where BMC employees were assaulted by locals.​ BMC nurse Sony Amrut Gavli, 34, stated in her complaint that on Wednesday at 9am, when she was at the medical centre in Anand Nagar, Jogeshwari, she received a message on the WhatsApp group created by the Indian Council of Medical Research that a resident of Vikas Nagar had tested positive and that she should be contacted and taken to an isolation centre. “At the time, Dr Neelam Nishad and three nurses, including me, were present at the Anand Nagar centre,” said Gavli. At 11am, Gavli contacted the patient’s family about her report. “On the directions of Dr Nishad, we went to Vikas Nagar for polio vaccination of kids. We were carrying out a vaccination camp, which two women visited without wearing masks,” said Gavli, adding that one of the women from the Covid-19 patient’s family abused them and said that they lied about the patient’s report. When Gavli and the three other nurses –Rekha Chincholi, Rajni Shinde and Roopa Uppar – asked her to calm down, she assaulted them. “She abused us and a man who was with the accused threatened us of lodging a police complaint,” added Gavli. The medical team then approached Oshiwara police and registered a complaint against the patient, her kin and the unidentified man. “We have detained the women and are investigating the matter based on the complaint filed by the BMC employees,” said an officer from Oshiwara police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-staffers-abused-assaulted-by-covid-positive-woman-kin-101616701105063.html
26-03-2021||Other||Ex-intel chief misguided authorities: Chief secretary’s report to Maharashtra CM||Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte submitted a report on Thursday to brief chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on the matter of the alleged money for transfer scam in the state police that former state intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla had raised in an August 2020 report after intercepting phone calls of six people.Kunte’s report – HT has seen a copy of it – stated that Shukla intercepted the calls under the guise of “public safety” and thus “misguided the authorities”. It further stated that no transfers of police officials took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020 – the period in which the calls were intercepted, and thus no scam had occurred. “Rashmi Shukla had taken the permission under the guise of interception of the calls of a few people in the interest of public safety, but it appears that she misguided the authorities… In fact, the interception is done in case of the possibility of the threat to national security and anti-national activities under the India Telegram Act to avoid any such threats. The interception is not expected for the political differences, professional or family disputes. However, Shukla did use the permission for the purpose other than it meant for misleading the government and misusing the permission,” it stated.Shukla submitted a report to her senior, the then director general of police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, naming senior politicians, middlemen and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking. While the report did not state that any direct transfer of money to these politicians took place, it did refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians. HT has seen a copy of the report.Kunte’s note raised a doubt on whether the IPS officer, currently on central deputation with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), had leaked the report and contended that if that were the case then she would be liable for “strict action”. “The leak of the report has led to breach of privacy of the officers whose names have been mentioned in the report. It has also led to their defamation. The so-called deals for the transfers mentioned in the report and actual transfers done by the government differ. This proves that there was no question of any scam in the transfers,” the brief stated.The state intelligence department is likely to register a case against an unknown person over leak of secret documents, a senior official from the home department requesting anonymity said.Shukla did not respond to the phone calls and text messages. The cover letter of the report was circulated by Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis earlier this week, who alleged that Shukla had “sought proper permissions from then additional chief secretary (home) and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politicians”.Fadnavis further said that he had 6.3GB of data from the intercepted calls in a pen drive, which contained the voices of police officers and politicians closely related to the home minister and home department. He further demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the matter after submitting the report to the Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla.Following these allegations, Thackeray directed Kunte to submit a report on the issue, and the chief secretary submitted a five-page note on Thursday.Kunte’s brief stated that Shukla had not submitted any pen drive along with her report and prime facie it appeared that she leaked the report, which was top secret, to the Opposition. “The report submitted to the home department had no pen drive (which was displayed by leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis in a press conference on Tuesday) along with it. The report leaked in the media appears to be the office copy of it which was in possession of Shukla. This could lead to strict action against her,” the report stated. The brief further pointed out that Kunte confronted Shukla following the illegal interception.“Shukla then personally met me, home minister Anil Deshmukh, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and expressed her apology. She also cited family reasons, including her husband’s demise while requesting to not initiate any action against her. She also requested permission to withdraw the report, but since there were no such provisions, she was not given the permission. However, her request to not initiate the action was accepted on humanitarian grounds,” the report stated. Jaiswal forwarded the report to Kunte, who was the then additional chief secretary (Home), on August 26. “It is a serious matter and necessitates urgent action by the state government. It is recommended that this be brought to the notice of Hon. Chief Minister at the earliest and an immediate and comprehensive enquiry by State CID (Crime), Pune be ordered to identify concerned individuals and take necessary legal action. It is also advised that the secrecy of this report be ensured, in order to prevent unnecessary scrutiny, which may bring disrepute to the government,” Jaiswal wrote in the covering letter.Kunte’s report stated that he brought Shukla’s report to the CM’s notice, who in turn directed him (Kunte) to submit his opinion/remarks on it. On August 31, 2020, Kunte informed the CM: “It has been said that there was no concrete evidence (about money for transfers scam) except so called intersection and CDR analysis and therefore the CID enquiry (as suggested by the then DGP Subodh Kumar Jaiswal) would be undesirable.”Housing minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Jitendra Awhad on Thursday reiterated his allegations against Shukla saying she acted on behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While briefing the media at his official bungalow on Thursday, Awhad alleged that an independent MLA from Shirol (Kolhapur) Rajendra Patil Yadravkar who later joined the coalition MVA government in 2019, was put under surveillance purportedly by Shukla. “An officer of the rank of deputy superintendent of police was put to watch his movements constantly to put pressure on him. She [Shukla] even had asked Yadravkar over phone, “Will your loyalty be at stake if you have a cup of tea with me?” Awhad said.“The phones of many political leaders and ministers from the state government were under surveillance under the behest of Shukla. This is a serious violation of the existing laws including Official Secrets Act and strict action needs to be taken against her. The decision about the action will be taken by top leadership in the government,” he said.When asked why the state government did not take action against the officers after it learnt about the illegal interception of the calls, Awhad said that the government avoided action on humanitarian ground. “Shukla submitted an apology letter to home minister Anil Deshmukh and urged for the pardon. But after a few days, she requested chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh to withdraw the letter,” he said.Awhad said that Shukla’s report and the interception of the calls for it was part of the “conspiracy” against the state government. On Wednesday, the minister said that the report came up for discussion at the state cabinet meeting, and several ministers were “furious” about the report. Shukla’s report mentioned the names of politicians such as NCP chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Deshmukh, as they came up in the alleged conversations.The report did not state that the middlemen spoke to these leaders directly. It contended that one middleman is an assistant in the home minister’s office.In the summary to the report, Shukla wrote: “The aforesaid brokers were in close contacts and embroiled in these negotiations with several influential and the police officers ranging from inspectors to several high-ranking officers are in contact with such undesirable individuals. The information obtained and evidence collected is highly incriminating and gravely implicates a number of individuals engaged in this activity.”BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar said that chief secretary Sitaram Kunte has himself admitted to having given permission. “In his report he has said that he gave permission, but it was taken by misguiding him. This has proved the MVA government’s claim of having not given the permission for tapping the phones is false. The report talks about Shukla’s apology, but it has no proof. Secondly, why was Rashmi Shukla pardoned for such a serious illegal crime of tapping phones? Forgiving her is an offence committed by the home minister and home secretary. I am moving Lokayukta on Monday seeking action against both of them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exintel-chief-misguided-authorities-chief-secretary-s-report-to-maharashtra-cm-101616701045032.html

Singh, who approached HC on Supreme Court’s directions, has also sought the seizure of the CCTV footage of the minister’s home in his petition.His PIL has also called for the report, said to be submitted by ex-commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla to the state, and all the files related to it, to be placed before HC.Singh’s PIL, filed through advocate Akshay Bafana, has alleged that Deshmukh had bypassed him while he was the Mumbai Police commissioner and called suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to the minister’s residence and told him that he had a target of ₹100 crore to collect per month. The PIL further stated that a few days later, Deshmukh called assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Sanjay Patil of the social service branch and held discussions about hookah parlours in the city, and instructed officers of the force to conduct investigations into various crimes as per his whims. The PIL also claimed that Singh had written to the chief minister and other leaders, apprising them of Deshmukh’s meetings with the police officers and his interference in the functioning of the police force. However, instead of taking action against Deshmukh, Singh was transferred to home guards department on the basis of a March 17 order of the home department, the petition alleged. It further pointed to the unceremonious transfer of Shukla, after she reported Deshmukh’s interference in matters pertaining to postings and transfers in Maharashtra, to the director general of police (DGP), who in turn informed the additional chief secretary of the home department. In light of these submissions, the PIL sought an “urgent, independent, unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the various corrupt malpractices of Deshmukh” by CBI, among other pleas. Meanwhile, another PIL has been filed by an advocate, Ghanshyam Upadhyay, seeking a court-monitored probe by CBI or Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the alleged various malpractices by police officers including Singh, Vaze, Patil and deputy commissioner of police Bhujbal, as well as Deshmukh and other politicians for “extorting money” from nearly 1,750 bars and restaurants in the city. Both the petitions will come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/corrupt-practices-by-cops-politicos-must-be-probed-ex-mumbai-top-cop-s-plea-in-hc-101616700745466.html

Sule reportedly apprised Gandhi of the ongoing situation in Maharashtra.The meeting assumed significance as it was held in the backdrop of the controversies in the state involving state home minister Anil Deshmukh, after the Antilia explosive scare and allegations of extortion and corruption in the police force, came to light.“Thank you so much Hon. Mrs. Sonia Gandhi Ji for your valuable guidance. It’s always such pleasure interacting with you (sic),” Sule tweeted after the meet.Sule is the first leader from NCP to meet Gandhi amid the controversies that have led to a major beating to the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s image. On March 21, Congress leader Kamal Nath met Sharad Pawar in Delhi in view of the ongoing developments in the state. The meeting took place a day after the then Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh accused Deshmukh of assigning former cop Sachin Vaze, arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia case, a target to collect ₹100 crore each month from establishments, among other allegations.Deshmukh is also facing allegations of corruption in the postings of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. The allegations were levelled by the leader of Opposition and former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis, based on a report prepared by former intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla.NCP has already refuted all the allegations against Deshmukh. The MVA government has decided to form a judicial commission to probe into the accusation of extortions.

Amid a drop in the mass immunisation programme, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is starting double shifts till late night to increase the overall turnout.To give a boost to the vaccination programme, from Thursday, BMC started two vaccination centres where inoculation service will be available for 14 hours daily.“At the initial stage, we are starting the double shift at two hospitals including Rajawadi Hospital. Now, probable beneficiaries can get vaccinated between 7am and 9pm. With this extension, we are hopeful that we will record better turnout,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “Following this, we will extend the facility in other centres,” he added.With the plan to increase the daily inoculation target to 100,000, BMC has set up more than 100 vaccination centres. Despite this, the number of beneficiaries across three groups – healthcare workers, frontline workers and individuals above the age of 45 – has remained stagnant.For instance, 40,502 people were given shots at 65 centres on March 8. But an analysis of the data of the past six days shows the average turnout of beneficiaries has remained around 41,000 across over 100 vaccination centres. On March 18, 39,644 people got inoculated at 91 centres. The number surged to 42,740 at 92 centres on March 19, followed by 49,547 at 94 centres the next day. However, the turnout decreased to 42,420 at 100 centres the next day (March 21). On March 23, the number of centres increased to 103 but the number of beneficiaries dropped to 37,120. On Wednesday (March 24), almost 6.6% drop was recorded with 34,633 beneficiaries at 104 centres.BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal in a statement on Thursday said in the coming days, the civic body has resolved to vaccinate 100,000 people daily. Need for awarenessDoctors highlighted the need to increase awareness among people and answer to their doubts and queries about vaccines. “To win the battle against the second wave and mutation of the virus, we have to increase daily testing and vaccination. Just like Covid-19 testing, BMC will have to bring the facility of vaccination to people’s doorsteps. Door-to-door counselling is also necessary, especially in slums,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultant.BMC has joined hands with non-government organisations (NGOs) to facilitate the process. Sweta Mehra, a vaccinator at Dahisar jumbo centre, said a number people refuse to take the vaccine even after reaching the vaccination centre and leave. “They ask us questions about the vaccine’s efficiency rate, side effects and sustainability of antibodies in the body. Many Covid recovered patients are also avoiding getting the jab presuming they are safe from reinfection,” she said.Rupali Basu, a patient with chronic kidney disease who is on dialysis for two years, has not gotten the vaccination yet as she has doubts about its effect. “Along with kidney issues, I also have diabetes. So, I am quite speculative. I don’t want to develop any side effects because of my health,” she said.Shortage of vaccineThough Mumbai has enough vaccine doses, districts like Thane are facing shortages. All corporations managed to continue administering the booster doses, but some found it difficult to give the first dose to senior citizens. The situation has improved this week, but without continuous supply of doses, Thane may face a shortage soon.TMC had to administer Covaxin to all for one week due to the shortage. Those keen on getting Covishield had to wait. Since the start of this week, the city has been administering only Covishield vaccines. They are expecting additional doses of both Covishield and Covaxin soon. To adjust with the shortage of vaccines, the civic body has rescheduled the timings of vaccination centres. Of the 51 functional vaccination centres, only 18 are operating on all days while the remaining are working on alternate days. “Of the 120,000 who have been vaccinated, 9,817 are in the age group of 45 to 59 years. Around 59,892 beneficiaries are aged above 60 while and the rest are frontline workers and healthcare workers,” said TMC chief Dr Vipin Sharma. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has administered 120,000 vaccines while Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) administered 43,588 doses so far. KDMC was administering only second doses for two weeks. “Currently there are enough doses of both Covishield and Covaxin, but if we do not get additional vaccines, we shall be out of stock within four days,” said a senior official from KDMC. Meanwhile, the jumbo vaccination facility, opened by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on Saturday, saw shortage of vaccines with only five of the 16 booths operational.

26-03-2021||Delhi||Dreaded gangster flees police custody after dramatic shoot-out in busy Delhi hospital||Gunshots rang out at east Delhi’s Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital on Thursday noon when four policemen and a group of at least seven criminals exchanged nearly 20 shots, triggering panic in one of Delhi’s busiest hospitals, police said.A dreaded gangster escaped police custody, while one alleged criminal died and two others got injured in the dramatic shoot-out between the police and associates of the gangster who had come to rescue him. The policemen did not suffer any injury except some discomfort after the assailants threw chilli powder on their faces, the police said.Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar said the gang of assailants had come to rescue Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja, a close confidant of jailed gangster Jitender alias Gogi, who was brought to the hospital, escorted by five personnel of the Delhi Armed Police’s 3rd Battalion, from the Mandoli Jail, after the jail doctor referred him to GTB hospital’s surgery OPD for treatment of a stomach-related ailment.The police said Fajja was arrested along with Gogi and two others – Rohit Moi and Kapil alias Gaurav -- from an upscale residential colony in Gurugram, following an operation by a special cell team, on March 3 last year. Fajja is allegedly involved in several cases of murder, extortion and robbery.A senior police officer, requesting anonymity, said around 11am, five personnel of the 3rd Battalion left the jail with Fajja and reached the lock-up at the hospital for jail inmates around half an hour later through gate number 1 of the hospital. After making the prisoner’s visit entry in the logbook, the five personnel escorted Fajja on foot to the OPD surgery, which is nearly 300 metres from the lock-up. One of them was carrying a video camera and was recording the process, said a senior police officer from the battalion, who also asked not to be named.After the medical check-up, four personnel were escorting Fajja back to the lock-up while the fifth stayed back in the building to complete the paperwork. They had walked around 100 metres when the policeman who was capturing the video, spotted two to three men with firearms outside the hospital’s gas plant number-2 and raised the alarm, the officer said.“Another policeman quickly responded and took out his service pistol. However, the gun got locked while he was cocking it. Suddenly, one of the assailants overpowered him from behind while his accomplices threw chilli powder at the policemen,” the officer said.As the assailants opened fire, two policemen carrying an MP5 machine gun and a self-loading rifle, returned the fire. Two bullets hit one of the assailants, who had overpowered a policeman, and he was caught. He was later identified as Ankesh.Another assailant, identified as Ravi Jakshi, was also hit by two bullets in the chest. He ran towards the maternity and child block. However, after running around 200 metres, he collapsed and died on the road in front of Florence Nightingale College of Nursing on the hospital campus, the officer said.The police said the CCTV cameras of the hospital were defunct so they have not been able to get the video footage of the incident.The hospital authorities refused comment on the violence, saying it was a police matter.A second police officer said the assailants had come in a white Scorpio SUV and at least two motorcycles. The police said Fajja escaped with the assailants in the car.While escaping, two assailants pointed a gun at a biker and his pregnant wife at the hospital’s Gate number 7, pushed the couple, snatched their bike and sped away. They fired three rounds in the air to disperse the crowd that tried to overpower them, eyewitnesses as well as the police said.The bike owner from Uttar Pradesh, who had brought his pregnant wife for a routine medical check-up, fell on the ground after being pushed by the assailants. He informed the police about his bike’s snatching and the firing by the assailants. Two calls regarding the shoot-out were made by the police personnel involved in the gunfight.The shoot-out and a bleeding man running on the road triggered panic among the hospital staff, patients and their attendants.“For a couple of minutes, we were all in shock as nobody knew what was happening. Many people went inside the hospital building after hearing the gunshots. It was only after the policemen told us about the encounter that we understood the situation,” said a private security guard of the hospital.Another witness, Veerpal, who sells chhole-kulche outside gate number 7 said he was busy with his customers when two men came running from inside and pointed a pistol at the biker, who was with his wife.“The assailants pushed the couple away and snatched their bike. They fired three rounds in the air because of which people present at the gate panicked and ran for cover. The assailants fled on the bike, brandishing their guns,” said Veerpal.A third police officer said a case has been registered and teams have been formed to nab the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dreaded-gangster-flees-police-custody-after-dramatic-shoot-out-in-busy-delhi-hospital-101616699316787.html
26-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to increase Covid beds to 21,000 in hospitals, 50,000 in CCC-2||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to increase the number of hospital beds available to Covid-19 patients to 21,000 as it expects a further spike in cases over the next 15 days. The city has seen a 217% increase in the number of active cases of Covid-19 since March 1. With the number of cases of Covid-19 surging in the city since March, civic officials said they expect the number of cases to rise further as testing is being ramped up in an effort to break the chain of transmission. On Thursday, BMC commissioner IS Chahal issued a statement saying the civic body had the situation under control despite the spike. He further said that assuming the number of daily patients increases to 10,000 and 15% of them who would be symptomatic (needing14 days of hospitalisation), the requirement would be of approximately 21,000 beds. BMC is gearing up to ensure this infrastructure is in place. To this end, the civic body will increase hospital bed strength from 13,773 to 21,000. For mildly symptomatic patients, BMC plans to increase the number of beds in Covid care centres-2 (CCC-2) to 50,000. “We have categorised the beds into active, buffer and reserved. Initially, we would focus on improving the bed strength at Covid-19 jumbo centres. If the number of active patients increases further, we would activate the buffer beds. In the reserved category, if needed, we would reactivate the lodges, hostels, schools and establishments with oxygen facilities for moderate cases,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. Last July, when the pandemic curve was at its peak with a 69% recovery rate in the city, BMC had reserved 17,000 beds for severe and moderate cases. There were 23,810 beds in CCC-2 for mild cases. On Wednesday, a statement from the Central government confirmed that a new strain of Covid-19 has been detected in Maharashtra, which appears to have a higher rate of transmission while being less virulent than the original strain. Experts have said that further analysis is required to know whether the recent spike in Covid cases may be attributed to the new variant. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of the state’s Covid task force, said on Wednesday, “Though most patients are asymptomatic and don’t require admission, we need to be ready for the worst. We don’t know if the virus won’t get aggressive and if we don’t keep the beds prepared, we may face bed shortages in the coming months.” BMC has already held meetings with private hospitals, instructing them to increase their bed capacity. “Soon, we would increase beds by around 4,000,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, chief officer of Covid beds in private hospitals. At present, there are no plans to turn major hospitals into dedicated Covid hospitals as had been done last year. “We need beds for non-Covid patients also. So, until we run out of all beds, we don’t want to convert any major hospital,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-increase-covid-beds-to-21-000-in-hospitals-50-000-in-ccc2-101616699965113.html
26-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to stop sending reminder for second vaccine shot||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will stop sending reminders to beneficiaries about their second dose. The decision has been taken after the new guideline of the Central government that allows beneficiaries to take the second dose after four to eight weeks, for Covishield.Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, has two shots. So far, beneficiaries were taking the second jab with a gap of 28 days. After considering recommendations of scientists and researchers, the Centre on Monday advised states to administer the second dose of Covishield at an interval of four to eight weeks, instead of the earlier bracket of four to six weeks.“The recommendation has been revised to provide the second dose of Covishield at four-eight weeks of interval after the first dose, instead of earlier practiced interval of four-six weeks,” said the health ministry in a statement. However, the increased interval does not apply to Covaxin.With these new instructions, the civic body has decided to stop reminding beneficiaries about the date of their second jab. So far, ward war rooms used to call all beneficiaries before the date of their second shot to remind them.“It is up to the beneficiaries to decide when to take the second jab between four and eight weeks after the first shot. As it is voluntary, we can’t decide on the dates. So, now the beneficiaries have to take the second shot without any reminders from BMC,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The option for the reminder for the second dose has also been removed from Co-WIN application which used to send automated messages to beneficiaries about the date.“From April, states have been instructed to inoculate people above 45 years irrespective of comorbidities. And we are expecting the turnout to increase. So, it would be tough to manually maintain the date of their second jab as Co-WIN app has stopped producing it,” said Kakani.A study published in science journal The Lancet on February 19 found that Covishield’s efficacy is 55.1% when its two doses are administered less than six weeks apart, but 81.3% when administered 12 weeks apart.Doctors have advised beneficiaries to not avoid the second jab which acts as a booster.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said, “It has been seen in the study that the first shot is enough to give protection against the Covid-19 virus for almost three months. The second dose which acts as a booster may further strengthen the immunity for more days. So, people should not avoid the second shot which can help in strengthening immunity further.”Till March 25, 932,291 people had taken Covishield shots in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-stop-sending-reminder-for-second-vaccine-shot-101616699725026.html

Raut, however, dismissed speculations that Congress leaders are upset over his demand. “The Congress leadership is not upset over the demand that Pawar should head UPA. In fact, we get such suggestions from within the Congress that UPA should be strengthened. It can be [current UPA chief] Sonia Gandhi’s stand as well. Gandhi has led UPA resolutely for a long time. But she has been unwell and there are [political] developments happening in the country. At such a time, several regional parties have demanded that UPA should be headed by a person outside the Congress,” Sena’s chief spokesperson said in New Delhi. Replying to Raut’s demand, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said, “UPA constituents have decided who should head the alliance. I had asked the chief minister [Uddhav Thackeray] two days ago if he [Raut] is Pawar’s spokesperson. Our only advice is that they should not discuss things that are not related to them... Shiv Sena is not a member of UPA and one who isn’t a member, must not enter into this discussion. There is no question of being upset over it.” Raut also said that several regional parties who are not a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance or UPA should be taken under the aegis of UPA. “It is not the question of how many MPs (Members of Parliament) are backing Pawar saheb. Almost all [political] parties besides BJP have demanded that UPA should be reconstituted and there should be a change in the leadership. It is not just our demand,” he said. This is not the first occasion when Raut has called for the restructuring of UPA by making Pawar its head. In the past few months, Raut has spoken about it repeatedly. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant also said Shiv Sena does not have the right to make any such demands. “They should first formally enter UPA, which is a national level alliance and has fought against NDA for several years now. We have come together to form government here [in Maharashtra] under extraordinary circumstances—to preserve democracy and oppose BJP,” Sawant told TV channels. Meanwhile, NCP MP Supriya Sule met Gandhi, who is also the interim Congress president, in New Delhi on Thursday morning. There were speculations that the meeting was to discuss the Congress leadership’s unhappiness about the demand. However, Raut dismissed any such speculation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/raut-reiterates-demand-to-make-pawar-upa-chief-sena-can-t-discuss-matter-says-congress-101616699484901.html
26-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 5,505 new Covid-19 cases||While the city saw a record number of new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said the daily caseload could go up to 10,000 in the coming days because of increased testing. However, more than 80% of the cases remain asymptomatic and a complete lockdown is not expected as the city’s health infrastructure is prepared for the increased numbers, according to BMC. The civic body plans to ramp up the number of tests conducted daily to 60,000. On Thursday, the city recorded 5,505 new cases of Covid-19, which is the highest single-day spike since the onset of the pandemic. Thirteen deaths were also recorded, taking the city’s Covid death toll to 11,623. BMC has said the increased cases may be attributed partially to increased testing. Since Tuesday, Mumbai has conducted over 40,000 tests per day, compared to the previous count of 20,000 tests conducted daily. Since the onset of the pandemic, Mumbai has tested 38,41,369 samples and the city’s positivity rate is 9.75%. The recovery rate is 88.14% and mortality rate is 3.05%. Between 80-85% of the current Covid cases are asymptomatic. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal issued a statement on Thursday in which he said BMC would ensure the number of hospital beds for Covid patients increased from the current 13,773 to 21,000 beds in next 15 days. This would ensure the city’s health infrastructure is prepared for the number of detected cases increasing in proportion to the number of tests conducted. “Assuming that the number of positives in due course of time in Mumbai increases to 10,000 cases per day with assumption that approximately 15% of these would be symptomatic, and further assuming that every symptomatic patient will require a bed, the total number of beds required to handle 10,000 positive cases every day for a period of six to eight weeks will be around 21,000 beds,” Chahal said in his statement. Chahal reiterated that the Covid fatality rate is under control and the immunisation drive is continuing apace. “We have completed 1 million vaccinations and we resolve to vaccinate 100,000 citizens daily, in the coming days. The ultimate remedy for ending this pandemic is only vaccination,” said Chahal.BMC has ruled out a complete lockdown, but strict measures are being taken, like conducting tests on randomly-selected citizens in public places like beaches and shopping malls. Between Monday and Wednesday, 57,627 citizens were tested using rapid antigen kits and approximately five tested positive, said BMC officials. According to BMC’s dashboard, there has been a sharp rise in occupancy of Covid beds, but there is no reported shortage. Of the total 13,083 beds dedicated to Covid patients, around 5,310 were vacant as of March 24. Of the total 1,559 beds in intensive care units (ICUs), 538 are vacant and out 8,851 oxygen beds, 3,860 are vacant. Of the total 987 beds with ventilators, 281 are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-5-505-new-covid-19-cases-101616699425372.html
26-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi man poisons wife, her family with thallium||A day after the police arrested a resident of south Delhi’s Greater Kailash-1 for allegedly poisoning his wife and her family using thallium, a toxic chemical, a member of the woman’s family said they are exploring legal options to secure custody of the couple’s two children.The police had, on Wednesday, arrested Varun Arora, for lacing his in-laws’ dinner with thallium on January 31, killing his mother-in-law and sister-in-law, and leaving his wife comatose. The man’s father-in-law and the domestic help recovered after treatment.Police said Arora planned the poisonings after his wife aborted her pregnancy last year, and to exact revenge for “being humiliated”, because his construction business was not doing well.Arora has been booked for murder, attempt to murder along with charges under other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said the police received information from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on March 22 that a woman, Anita Devi Sharma, has died of thallium poisoning, after being treated for over a month.“We made efforts to trace the source of thallium administered to the woman and found that the woman’s older daughter Divya, married to Varun Arora, is also admitted in the ICU of the same hospital with thallium poisoning. She is on ventilator support,” the DCP said.Goel said investigations revealed that Divya’s younger sister Priyanka also died of thallium poisoning while undergoing treatment at BL Kapoor Hospital on February 15. “Anita’s husband Devender Mohan Sharma also showed symptoms of thallium poisoning. The maid working in the couple’s house had also been treated at RML Hospital for similar symptoms,” she said.One of Divya’s cousins, who asked not to be named, said she has been on ventilator support for 22 days and her condition is deteriorating. “We have already lost two family members. Divya’s condition is also critical. All we want right now is the custody of her children. They are with Varun’s mother, and if thallium has been found in his house, the kids are also not safe,” the woman said.Arora had visited the Sharma family in Inder Puri in January and cooked for them. He served the food to the entire family except his twins.“Arora was detained for questioning on Wednesday, and when confronted, admitted to have procured thallium and administered it to his mother-in-law Anita, wife Divya, father-in-law Devender Mohan and his sister-in-law Priyanka. He claimed he poisoned them to take revenge because they had allegedly been humiliating him repeatedly,” the officer said.Arora told the police that his wife had conceived after his father’s death last year. “He believed that his father was being reincarnated as his son. However, Divya developed complications and aborted the child on the advice of her parents and sister, against Arora’s wishes,” DCP Goel said.“He also said that his in-laws used to taunt him because his construction business was not doing good,” she said.She said the thallium was recovered from his Greater Kailash house. “We have also recovered his mobile phone that he had used to procure the thallium,” Goel said.Police are tracing the source from where Arora had procured the thallium.During interrogations, Arora is said to have revealed that he got the idea to use thallium from the internet. They also added that contrary to media reports, they had found no evidence to suggest he had been influenced by former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose agencies reportedly use thallium to poison rivals.“So far we have not found any evidence of him being inspired by Saddam Hussain,” Goel said.Recalling that Arora started ill-treating Divya after she got her first child aborted last year, the cousin said if Divya had not undergone an abortion, she would have risked her own life. The cousin also added that the two families also had a tiff because Arora’s construction business was not doing well and Divya’s family had been supporting him for a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-poisons-wife-her-family-with-thallium-101616697352650.html

Today, the city finds itself in the midst of a surging second wave. The city that recorded 12,467 active Covid-19 cases on an average through December 2020, recorded only 7,085 on January 1. Since then, the downward trend continued and on February 26, Bengaluru reported its lowest number of active cases at 3,754. However, between February 24 and March 24, the city has seen a 163% jump in the number of active cases.According to data from the health ministry, Bengaluru Urban (as the district is called) features among the 10 districts in the country with the highest number of active Covid-19 cases.Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said the second wave of the Covid-19 has begun in the state. “We are at the beginning of the second wave of coronavirus. The next three months are crucial for us. The technical advisory committee on coronavirus has given clear guidelines to the government stating that people will be in trouble if certain activities are not controlled. The new guidelines for the city are part of our efforts to control the spread of the virus,” he said.In December 2020, Bengaluru reported an average of 601 daily new Covid-19 cases. The number dropped to 338 in January and 241 in February. However, by March 24, the number was up to 601 once again. On Thursday, Bengaluru accounted for 1,623 of the new Covid-19 cases of the 2,523 reported from across the state, according to the state health department’s daily bulletin.. Meanwhile, the daily positivity rate rose to 2.32% with over 1.08 lakh samples being tested in the previous 24 hours.Dr V Ravi, senior professor and head of the department of Neurovirology at NIMHANS and member of the technical advisory committee on Covid-19 in Karnataka, said the government’s efforts to proactively trace contacts and get them tested had reduced in the past few months. He added that even though hospitals were better equipped to deal with the surge, the lack of efforts in the contact tracing has impacted the city adversely.A senior Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) official cited the lack of cooperation from the people as a big problem. “Compliance when it comes to wearing masks has reduced drastically. There was a time when people of Bengaluru were adhering to social distancing and wearing masks. We saw the results. But we are now attending large events and gathering in public places without precaution. There is only so much that the government can do,” the official said on the condition of anonymity..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-issues-new-curbs-as-2nd-wave-of-covid-surges-in-city-101616699124368.html

The minister said the decision was taken for Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) limits as the city continued to report the highest number of cases in the state. On Thursday, Bengaluru registered 1,623 fresh cases out of the total of 2,523 from across the state. “There is a spike in cases every day. It is increasingly found in passengers arriving in the city from other states. As of now, the requirement (of a test report) is for those coming from Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab and Chandigarh (to Bengaluru). But going forward, it is applicable to visitors from all states ,“ the minister said. However, only visitors from Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab and Chandigarh need negative Covid-19 RT-PCR test reports for travelling to other parts of Karnataka. Government officials said people without test reports will be tested, and asked to be in quarantine till the results are available. They also added that the requirement isn’t just for visitors but also Bengaluru and Karnataka residents who travel outside the state and then return. Stating that 60% of the cases in Bengaluru have a history of inter-state travel, Sudhakar said the government will revive the practice of stamping the hands of those who need to undergo home isolation. “Many young people who are supposed to undergo home isolation are freely walking around because they are asymptomatic 9and there is no way of knowing they need to be in quarantine). We need to curb this,” he said. The government has also decided to resume its Quarantine Watch application which was suspended after the state witnessed a drop in Covid cases, to monitor those undergoing home isolation. On Thursday, the State Disaster Management Board has directed the commissioner of BBMP, all deputy commissioners, and all authorities concerned to prevent public gatherings during upcoming festivals such as Holi and Good Friday.On Wednesday, the state government proposed imposing strict penalties on establishments such as hotels, departmental stores and organisers of public events or large gatherings who fail to enforce safety protocols. In a late night order, the government announced a fine of ₹5,000-10,000 on all establishments found violating safety protocols such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. “The owners of the establishment will be responsible for: a) ensuring compulsory wearing of masks and social distancing; b) enforcing restrictions on the number of persons to be allowed,” the order read.As a precautionary measure, the government has limited the number of wedding attendees to 500 in open spaces and 200 in closed areas; it has permitted a gathering of 50 to 100 people in birthday parties and funerals, depending on whether they are held in enclosed or open spaces; and it has restricted the number of attendees to 500 at religious and political events. There are currently 18,207 active coronavirus cases in Karnataka. As many as 12,471 people have succumbed to the virus while 978,478 patients have recovered. According to the Union health ministry, 3,044,524 (a little over three million) vaccine doses have been administered in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rtpcr-ve-report-now-must-to-enter-bluru-101616699064329.html

26-03-2021||Delhi||New NCT Bill will obstruct good work done by AAP govt: Manish Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre brought in the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to “counter the rising popularity of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal” and to obstruct the “good work” by his government in the Capital.The controversial bill, which effectively hands executive powers to the lieutenant-governor (L-G) from the city-state’s government and legislative assembly, cleared Parliament on Wednesday after the Rajya Sabha passed it with an 83-45 vote amid a walkout by Opposition parties. The Lok Sabha passed the bill on Monday.“The bill that was passed yesterday shows how the Modi government was feeling insecure because of the popularity of Arvind Kejriwal and of the work done by his government. Today, people are saying that Kejriwalji can be an alternative to Modiji... This bill has been brought in to stop Arvind Kejriwal’s rise,” Sisodia said at a press conference.The bill says that “government” in Delhi will now refer to the L-G in the context of all laws passed in the Capital, and that the opinion of the L-G will be mandatory before any executive action. It also bars the state assembly from forming any committees to examine the day-to-day administration of Delhi.Sisodia said the Delhi government was in touch with legal experts to decide on their course of action. Till then, he said, the AAP plans to attack the BJP “politically”.He told reporters that the BJP was indulging in negative politics and accused it of “theft and cheating” to take administrative control of a state where it had twice been defeated in the assembly elections.“The BJP has no model to counter the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) governance in Delhi. Despite the fact that they run the government at the Centre and in several states, they are afraid of the Kejriwal model because people are asking why BJP-ruled states can’t provide free water and cheaper electricity like Delhi,” he said.“Across India, the demand for Kejriwal’s model of governance is increasing, which can be seen in the recent panchayat and municipality elections in several BJP-ruled states in the country. Kejriwal has a vision of development, which is now posing a challenge to the BJP. For the last six years, they have tried many things. But Kejriwal is a fighter. He has always come back stronger. He will fight back,” he said.Sisodia was referring to the AAP’s performance in the Surat municipal polls in Gujarat, where it won 27 seats, and the party’s electoral gains in panchayat elections in Maharashtra, where it won 145 of the 300 seats it contested, and in Himachal Pradesh, where it came out on top in 36 of the 40 seats it fought.The BJP did not comment on Sisodia’s claims.Sisodia also accused the Centre of obstructing the government’s doorstep ration delivery scheme. The scheme was to be rolled out from Thursday was stalled after the Union food and public distribution ministry raised objections to Delhi government giving a new name, ‘Mukhyamantri ghar ghar ration yojana’, and amending the ways of delivery, which the ministry said was in violation of the provisions of the National Food Security Act (NFSA).After Parliament cleared the NCT Bill, Kejriwal on Wednesday said it was a “sad day for Indian democracy.”“RS passes GNCTD amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he tweeted.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta welcomed the passing of the BIll on Wednesday and said that it will help improve the administrative system in Delhi. “During last few years, the Kejriwal government, by bringing unconstitutional bills in Delhi assembly, has hurt the image of the national capital. Now, all Bills will be vetted before being tabled in the assembly,” Gupta said.Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said the Congress has been opposing the GNCTD bill even when Kejriwal did not raise the matter.“For almost 55 days ever since the amendments were first approved by the Union cabinet, Kejriwal did not utter a word on the matter until a few days ago. It was the Congress which repeatedly raised the issue. In all these years Kejriwal has become the B-Team of the BJP by even running a campaign during the recent elections that there should be Modi as PM and Kejriwal as CM in Delhi. Now, the AAP and Kejriwal might be regretting the choices they made, “ he said.PDT Achary, former secretary general of Lok Sabha said going by the Supreme Court judgement of 2018, the government can only mean the elected government. “The Bill does not only overturn the SC’s verdict but also defies the Constitution. It is now to be seen how this plays out in reality once it becomes a law after the gazette notification,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-nct-bill-will-obstruct-good-work-done-by-aap-govt-manish-sisodia-101616697374674.html
26-03-2021||Delhi||Supreme Court orders status quo on water supply to Delhi||Noting that the right to drinking water is a fundamental right, the Supreme Court on Thursday cut short any attempt by Punjab and Haryana governments and the central agency of Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) to curtail supply of water to Delhi on account of repair work of the Bhakra Nangal channel.Anticipating a water scarcity, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) had rushed to the Supreme Court to seek stay of any repair work undertaken by the BBMB in the months of April and May. “We have no problem with the repairs being carried out. But do not touch it in April when there is a peak demand of water in the city,” senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi submitted for DJB. The Nangal Hydel Channel supplies 232 million gallons of water a day to Delhi. Closure of the two gates supplying water to the Capital will lead to a 25 per cent shortage, said DJB’s petition filed through advocate Gautam Narayan.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde noted that the matter was “serious” and issued notice to Punjab, Haryana and BBMB seeking their responses within a day. “The respondents are directed to maintain status quo on supply of water to Delhi till tomorrow i.e. 26th March,” added the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.This is the second petition by DJB before the top court. Earlier, the Jal Board filed a petition accusing Haryana Government for releasing untreated water into Yamuna leading to high ammonia levels in water that posed a health hazard to denizens. The Haryana government had disputed this position and claimed that the problem was at Delhi’s end. On Thursday, the Delhi government again accused Haryana of supplying less water to Delhi. Senior advocate Vikas Singh who appeared for Delhi told the Court that the water level at Wazirabad barrage that supplies water to Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal water treatment plants had reduced by six feet. For Haryana, senior advocate Shyam Divan contradicted the statement and claimed that not a single drop was being withheld from Delhi. Singh urged the Court to consider sending a Court commissioner for an on-the-spot verification. The bench said, “Since it’s a matter of fundamental right to water we will not entertain any technical objections and if required we may appoint a commissioner to visit the spot.” Over the past few months, DJB had written six letters to Punjab, Haryana and BBMB citing postponement of repairs of the Hydel channel to the monsoon months of July-August but received no response. Top officers of DJB had even visited Punjab in this connection. The bench wished to know the nature of repairs being carried out. “If repair is integral to the water channel, we won’t stop them,” bench said. Singhvi assured that the repairs can be carried out later as well and requested for a stay till the matter is taken up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/supreme-court-orders-status-quo-on-water-supply-to-delhi-101616698825100.html

Dhiman was administered the Covid vaccine on January 16 and he took the second shot on February 15. The news of his testing positive triggered a debate over the efficacy of the vaccine. The PGI director said his wife had also been inoculated. “The vaccine is very effective in preventing hospitalisation as well as deaths; at the maximum it causes mild disease,” said the PGI director.“There is a possibility of people testing positive for Covid despite taking the vaccine shot, but the intensity of the virus would be lesser,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president, IMA (Lucknow).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpgi-director-wife-test-positive-for-covid-101616698704339.html

The policemen then falsely implicated and arrested ten people including the brother of the owner of the eatery and eight customers in an alleged encounter with them. The persons reportedly arrested by the police are presently lodged in the judicial custody, he said.The Commission has issued a notice to the DGP calling for a report in the matter within six weeks. A copy of the proceedings has also been sent to the Member Secretary, Uttar Pradesh State Legal Aid Services Authority to ensure free legal aid to the arrested people, if not provided, he said.Issuing the notice, the Commission observed that the contents of the media report, if true, raise serious issue of violation of Human Rights. The incident, apparently, is a classic example of failure of entire system of checks and balances. Hence, fair investigation is required to be conducted to know as to from where the policemen could manage to procure these items, Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nhrc-issues-notice-to-up-dgp-over-arrest-of-10-people-in-fake-case-in-etah-101616697864996.html
26-03-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 graph continues to soar: Capital adds 1,515 new infections||The Covid-19 surge in the Capital continued unabated on Thursday as Delhi recorded its highest single-day case spike of the year, adding 1,515 new infections — the most since December 16, as experts urged authorities to consider stepping up curbs to prevent infections from spiralling beyond control.The seven-day average of new cases, known as case trajectory, crossed the 1,000-mark for the first time in 91 days, with the city adding an average of 1,016 cases per day over the past week.The positivity rate also increased to 1.69%, even as the city ramped up testing. For six days now, the test positivity rate, which experts regard as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection, has remained over 1% since it dipped below that number in December last year. On Wednesday, numbers from which are reported a day later in Thursday’s bulletin, the city tested 89,836 samples for the infection. Of these, almost 65% samples were tested using the more accurate RT-PCR method. Just over 78,000 tests were conducted on average daily during the last seven days in comparison. Just over 71,000 tests were conducted the week before and over 65,000 tests the week before that. Experts called for immediate measures such as curtailing all “non-essential” activities and large gatherings to prevent a surge in cases as seen in states such as Maharashtra. “There is a need for some restrictions such as curtailing the number of people at weddings, restricting travel between states, closing non-essential services such as bars, restaurants, and cinemas. And these need to be brought in now before we see a surge like in Maharashtra. The case fatality rate in Delhi as well as the country has come down since last year because of the better understanding about the disease, however it still kills. It is a myth that this time around the virus is causing milder infections,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Four deaths on average were reported each day over the past seven days, up from two deaths that were reported the week before. Five deaths due to the viral infection were reported in Thursday’s bulletin. The case spike has bought with it a significant increase in hospitalisations as well. There were 1,094 people with the infection admitted to city hospitals as on Wednesday night, meaning one in five beds earmarked for Covid-19 are already occupied. A total of 5,740 beds in city hospitals are reserved for the treatment of the infection which has so far claimed 10,978 lives in the city.Other than restrictions on transport, experts have also recommended that travel for events such as the Kumbh Mela be restricted. “In cities where the cases are going up, restrictions have to be put in place. People have to be asked to avoid unnecessary travel and there have to be restrictions on the number of people allowed on modes of public transport,” said Dr Rajinder K Dhamija, professor of medicine and head of the department of neurology at Lady Hardinge Medical College. In addition to the traditional methods of controlling the infection, the experts have also called for increasing the pace of vaccination. “There is a need to enhance vaccination on a war footing. But, nobody seems to be worried about what is happening; I do not see a sense of urgency anywhere. In addition to the people over the age of 45 years and the healthcare and frontline workers, the government should also start vaccinating all the teachers and ancillary staff at schools and colleges so that they can be reopened,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore. However, the vaccination drive has failed to pick up pace in Delhi despite the government announcing that more vaccination centres will be opened up and they will remain open till 9 pm. Since the extended drive began on Monday, on average 34,027 jabs were administered each day. In comparison, 46,769 shots – both first and second dose – had been given on Saturday, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-graph-continues-to-soar-capital-adds-1-515-new-infections-101616697864285.html

The scheme was conceptualised in 1985-87 and taken over by the Congress government in 2005, to connect Dadupur head of Yamunanagar with Nalvi Feeder in Shahabad via Ambala. Its aim was to recharge groundwater level and put a dedicated irrigation facility in place for Kharif crops. In May 2016, the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered the award of compensation at ₹1.16 crore per acre. The BJP government, however, decided to de-notify the project in September 2017 and issued this notification in August 2018. Irrigation department data shows that the government acquired 830 acre of land post-2004. In the first circle of Yamunanagar, of 799 farmers, only six paid back the compensation of ₹3.5 lakh, 300 of 2,000 paid back ₹4.3 crore in the second circle (Saraswati and Shahabad together) of Kurukshetra. In the third circle of Ambala, 50 of 1,035 farmers got back ownership of land by paying ₹43.2 lakh.DON’T HAVE MONEY TO PAY BACK: FARMERSSeveral farmers HT spoke to in Yamunanagar and Ambala are unwilling to pay back the money. Rajpal from Subhri village of Ambala’s Barara said, “I have invested the money on my family and don’t have anything to pay back. We hope water will flow in the canal soon.” He is a member of the Dadupur-Nalvi Sangharsh Samiti that had protested for months at the Jagadhari grain market.Ramesh Sangwan, one of the owners of 3 acre in the scheme in village Adhoya in Ambala, said that he and his two brothers got their land back this year by returning the money.Soon after the project was cancelled, opposition leaders in the Congress and INLD had staged protests and farm unions had criticised the move. Congress MLA from Mullana Varun Chaudhary said the land government is giving back is unfit for farming.“When farmers asked for compensation, the government de-notified the scheme. This is an example of how the executive mocks at judiciary,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dadupurnalvi-canal-decommission-three-years-on-just-10-haryana-farmers-return-compensation-to-get-back-land-101616697745476.html

A dreaded gangster escaped police custody, while one alleged criminal died and two others got injured in the dramatic shoot-out between the police and associates of the gangster who had come to rescue him. The policemen did not suffer any injury except some discomfort after the assailants threw chilli powder on their faces, the police said. Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar said the gang of assailants had come to rescue Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja, a close confidant of jailed gangster Jitender alias Gogi, who was brought to the hospital, escorted by five personnel of the Delhi Armed Police’s 3rd Battalion, from the Mandoli Jail, after the jail doctor referred him to GTB hospital’s surgery OPD for treatment of a stomach-related ailment. The police said Fajja was arrested along with Gogi and two others – Rohit Moi and Kapil alias Gaurav -- from an upscale residential colony in Gurugram, following an operation by a special cell team, on March 3 last year. Fajja is allegedly involved in several cases of murder, extortion and robbery. A senior police officer, requesting anonymity, said around 11am, five personnel of the 3rd Battalion left the jail with Fajja and reached the lock-up at the hospital for jail inmates around half an hour later through gate number 1 of the hospital. After making the prisoner’s visit entry in the logbook, the five personnel escorted Fajja on foot to the OPD surgery, which is nearly 300 metres from the lock-up. One of them was carrying a video camera and was recording the process, said a senior police officer from the battalion, who also asked not to be named. After the medical check-up, four personnel were escorting Fajja back to the lock-up while the fifth stayed back in the building to complete the paperwork. They had walked around 100 metres when the policeman who was capturing the video, spotted two to three men with firearms outside the hospital’s gas plant number-2 and raised the alarm, the officer said. “Another policeman quickly responded and took out his service pistol. However, the gun got locked while he was cocking it. Suddenly, one of the assailants overpowered him from behind while his accomplices threw chilli powder at the policemen,” the officer said. As the assailants opened fire, two policemen carrying an MP5 machine gun and a self-loading rifle, returned the fire. Two bullets hit one of the assailants, who had overpowered a policeman, and he was caught. He was later identified as Ankesh. Another assailant, identified as Ravi Jakshi, was also hit by two bullets in the chest. He ran towards the maternity and child block. However, after running around 200 metres, he collapsed and died on the road in front of Florence Nightingale College of Nursing on the hospital campus, the officer said. The police said the CCTV cameras of the hospital were defunct so they have not been able to get the video footage of the incident. The hospital authorities refused comment on the violence, saying it was a police matter. A second police officer said the assailants had come in a white Scorpio SUV and at least two motorcycles. The police said Fajja escaped with the assailants in the car. While escaping, two assailants pointed a gun at a biker and his pregnant wife at the hospital’s Gate number 7, pushed the couple, snatched their bike and sped away. They fired three rounds in the air to disperse the crowd that tried to overpower them, eyewitnesses as well as the police said. The bike owner from Uttar Pradesh, who had brought his pregnant wife for a routine medical check-up, fell on the ground after being pushed by the assailants. He informed the police about his bike’s snatching and the firing by the assailants. Two calls regarding the shoot-out were made by the police personnel involved in the gunfight. The shoot-out and a bleeding man running on the road triggered panic among the hospital staff, patients and their attendants. “For a couple of minutes, we were all in shock as nobody knew what was happening. Many people went inside the hospital building after hearing the gunshots. It was only after the policemen told us about the encounter that we understood the situation,” said a private security guard of the hospital. Another witness, Veerpal, who sells chhole-kulche outside gate number 7 said he was busy with his customers when two men came running from inside and pointed a pistol at the biker, who was with his wife. “The assailants pushed the couple away and snatched their bike. They fired three rounds in the air because of which people present at the gate panicked and ran for cover. The assailants fled on the bike, brandishing their guns,” said Veerpal. A third police officer said a case has been registered and teams have been formed to nab the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dreaded-gangster-flees-police-custody-after-dramatic-shoot-out-in-busy-east-delhi-hospital-101616697625506.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde noted that the matter was “serious”, and sought responses from Punjab, Haryana and BBMB within a day. “The respondents are directed to maintain status quo on supply of water to Delhi till tomorrow i.e. 26th March,” added the bench, which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. Delhi receives at least 232 MGD (million gallons per day) of water through the channel, which helps meet nearly 25% of the city’s daily water requirement, estimated to be around 935 MGD.Anticipating a water scarcity, DJB rushed to the Supreme Court to seek a stay on repairs scheduled to be undertaken by BBMB in April and May. “We have no problem with the repairs being carried out. But do not touch it in April when there is a peak demand of water in the city,” senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi submitted for DJB. Over the past few months, DJB has written six letters to Punjab, Haryana and BBMB, citing postponement of repairs of the hydel channel to the monsoon months of July-August, but received no response, Singhvi. Top officers of DJB visited Punjab early this monthover this issue. The bench wanted to know the nature of repairs being carried out. “If repair is integral to the water channel, we won’t stop them,” the bench said. Singhvi assured the court that the repairs can be carried out later as well, and requested for a stay till the matter is taken up.This is the second petition by DJB before the top court concerning the supply of water to the Capital. In January, it filed a petition accusing the Haryana government of releasing untreated water into the Yamuna, leading to high ammonia levels in the water that posed a health hazard to residents of the national capital. The Haryana government claimed that the problem was at Delhi’s end. This second petition is still pending in the court and will be taken up on Friday along with the fresh petition filed by DJB.On Thursday, the Delhi government again accused Haryana of limiting water supply to Delhi. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for Delhi, told the court that the water level at Wazirabad barrage, which supplies water to the Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal water treatment plants, reduced by six feet. Singh did not specify the period over which the water level has declined. For Haryana, senior advocate Shyam Divan contradicted the statement and claimed that “not even a single drop was being withheld from Delhi”. Singh then urged the apex court to consider sending a court commissioner for spot verification. The bench said: “Since it’s a matter of fundamental right to water we will not entertain any technical objections and if required we may appoint a commissioner to visit the spot.” The Delhi government could not be reached for a comment.The spokesperson for BBMB rejected reports that water flow to Delhi will stop as hoax. He said that the board has given assurance to the Centre that the drinking water for Delhi will continue to flow from Nangal hydel channel. He said the normal water flow in the channel is 11,500 cusecs, which reduces to 8,000-9,000 cusecs during repair work. “Delhi Jal Board is supplied 500 cusecs of water daily from the channel.

26-03-2021||Delhi||Woman sub-inspector in shoot-out operation to nab two men on Delhi Police’s most wanted list||A shoot-out led by a crime branch team comprising a woman sub-inspector, in the early hours of Thursday on Bhairon Marg in central Delhi, ended in the arrest of two “most wanted” men, who carried a reward on their arrest, the police said later in the day. Sub-inspector Priyanka Sharma and assistant commissioner of police Pankaj Singh were allegedly fired upon by the two men, but their bulletproof vests saved them and they went on to arrest (alleged) gangster Rohit Choudhary and his accomplice, Parveen (single name only), the police said. Choudhary, 35, carried a cash reward of ₹3.5 lakh on his arrest, while Praveen carried a reward of ₹2 lakh.On Thursday, the photograph of Sharma, the only woman among 10 policemen, wearing a bulletproof vest was widely circulated on social media -- the novelty being that although Delhi Police has around 8,000 women personnel, it is rare for a woman officer to be involved in a shoot-out. Women personnel are mostly posted in the traffic wing, at police stations or with other units. A few women IPS officers are also heading districts as deputy commissioners or are leading teams in the crime branch. Police said 35-year-old Sharma had joined the Delhi Police in 2010. She was recruited as a constable, but she later cleared an exam and was appointed as sub-inspector. She started working with the crime branch in 2019 and has spent nearly three years with the unit.Retired Delhi Police officer Ashok Chand, who served the force for around 35 years and headed the special cell and crime branch, said in his knowledge, a woman officer has been part of a shoot-out for the first time. “Women have always assisted search parties and surveillance teams in such cases. However, for a shoot-out, this may be a first,” Chand said.Police said the two men were involved in multiple cases of murder, attempts to murder, kidnapping, extortion, illegal use of arms and assault. Last year, in October, Choudhary was also booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999, police said.Following their arrest, police have also recovered two SUVs -- a black Endeavour and a white Fortuner. Police said the Fortuner was a bulletproof vehicle. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Shibesh Singh said his teams had been keeping a watch on the movements of both Choudhary and Parveen for the past few months. “On Thursday, following a tipoff that the suspects would be coming near Bhairon Temple on Bhairon Marg, a trap was laid. Around 5am, a blue Toyota Glanza was spotted approaching the police barricade. The Glanza driver tried to break through the barricades and when our team tried to reach the car, the occupants opened fire at our team,” Singh said.While one bullet hit ACP Singh, another struck S-I Sharma. However, since both officers were kitted out in bulletproof vests, both escaped with minor injuries.The additional commissioner said his team returned the fire. Both occupants got out of the car and started fleeing when they were hit by a bullet each in their legs. “Both men were caught and we recovered two loaded semi-automatic pistols from them. They were taken to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for treatment and were arrested for attempt to murder and under other relevant sections,” the officer said.Singh said a total of six rounds were fired during the encounter, of which four were fired by the police team. During the search of their car, police also recovered several fake identity documents, mobile phones and internet dongles. The identity documents were used by the men to stay at different hotels and mobile phones and dongles were used for communicating with the other gang members, police said.Later on Thursday, a video was widely shared on social media in which two women, identifying themselves as wives of Choudhary and Parveen, claimed that their husbands had been picked up by the police a day before from Palwal, Haryana. The women purportedly said if anything happens to their spouses, the Delhi Police will be held responsible.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video or the claims made by the women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-sub-inspector-in-shoot-out-operation-to-nab-two-men-on-delhi-police-s-most-wanted-list-101616697564274.html
26-03-2021||Delhi||Reopening of IGI’s Terminal 1 delayed till May||The reopening of Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport’s Terminal 1 has been delayed again at a time when Covid cases are rising again in the country, officials aware of the development said on condition of anonymity. The terminal, which was to open on March 28, is now likely to be opened only in May, one of the officials cited above said, adding that the decision was taken as the Union ministry of civil aviation has only allowed 80% air traffic movement at airports, which can be handled by Terminals 2 and 3.Terminal 1 was shut on March 25 last year, two days after international flight operations were suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Two months later, when air operations in the country resumed on May 25, only Terminal 3 was opened. Terminal 2 eventually resumed functioning on October 1, while Terminal 1 continued to stay shut to facilitate ongoing expansion work.The Delhi airport operator, DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd), was planning to resume operations at Terminal 1 on Thursday as the government was expected to allow 100% air traffic movement. The reopening was first pushed to March 28, and has now been delayed further because the government is yet to take a call on when full-fledged flight movements will be permitted.“The airport operator was planning to open only a portion of the terminal, with the ongoing expansion work continuing in the remaining area. Around 200 flight movements were planned from Terminal 1 on resumption of operations, and we were expecting a daily passenger footfall of roughly 35,000 to 50,000. Two airlines — IndiGo and SpiceJet — were to shift their operations to the Terminal 1. The reopening of the terminal has now been postponed by about four to five weeks at least,” said an official who asked not to be named.He added that this will give the airport operator time to resume operations from a much wider area of Terminal 1, which will help enhance passenger experience when it does become functional again.A second official, who asked not to be named, said all the planning for the reopening was in place — airlines had scheduled their flight operations, and they have now been asked to inform flyers about the change.The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which secures the airport and conducts security checks at the Security Hold Area inside the terminal, had also planned its deployment.“We have not officially been told about the postponement. We were present at the terminal throughout, even when it was shut. As the reopening was planned, we had decided to strategically deploy our commandos inside the terminal at different points and on the periphery of the building, following a detailed survey. Whenever the airport operator decides to resume operations from Terminal 1, we will be ready to provide adequate security,” a senior CISF officer said, asking not to be named.Spice Jet and IndiGo declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/reopening-of-igi-s-terminal-1-delayed-till-may-101616697446061.html
26-03-2021||Delhi||Private schools’ body writes to DoE seeking permission to ‘hike’ fee||Days ahead of the start of the new academic session, an umbrella group of over 400 private schools in the national capital has asked the state education department to allow private institutions to increase their fee this new school year and to let them charge components other than tuition fee for all classes from April.In a letter, sent to director of education Udit Prakash on Wednesday, the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools said, “Schools are preparing a budget and their fee structure for the 2021-22 session. You are also aware of the critical financial position of schools on account of various factors. In fact, the private unaided schools in Delhi cannot survive unless the government permits the schools to hike their fee for the 2021-22 academic session and allow them to charge development fee and annual charges for the upcoming session.”The education directorate had on April 18 and August 28 last year ordered private schools in Delhi not to charge anything other than tuition fee in view of financial hardships caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and mandated that this component should be collected on a monthly basis, as against quarterly or annual payments.The DoE had also directed private schools to collect fees under other components, including annual and development charges , on a pro-rata basis from the day in-person classes resumed for students. Many private schools had started collecting these components from students of classes 9 to 12 after their in-person classes resume between January 18 and February 5. However, schools are not allowed to charge for these components for entry-level classes till Class 8 which have not resumed in-person lessons as yet.SK Bhattacharya, president of the association, said private institutions have found it difficult to pay teachers and other staff, and to manage expenses such as maintenance of buildings and transport.Officials at several private schools echoed these sentiments.The principal of a school in Shalimar Bagh said their expenses have increased “exponentially” due to the pandemic.“Our regular expenses such as property tax, EMIs, and insurance payments have not reduced. The expenses have, in fact, increased exponentially due to online classes, and the infrastructure changes made to ensure compliance with Covid appropriate behaviour. Schools won’t be able to start a new academic session without development and annual charges.”Officials said budget private schools had fared even worse.The principal of a low-cost school in Narela Mandi said, “We still don’t receive the fee from nearly half the parents. We have not been able to pay our staff regularly for the last nine or 10 months, and some teachers have left because of that. We recently had to sign undertakings to give assurance to our teachers that they will be paid all the pending amount once the situation improves.”Despite several calls and text messages, Prakash did not respond to requests for comment.A senior official at the directorate said on condition of anonymity, “Representatives of private schools had met the director earlier this month to discuss the issue. However, the DoE has not taken any decision in this regard as of now.”A state government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/private-schools-body-writes-to-doe-seeking-permission-to-hike-fee-in-new-academic-session-101616697444846.html

The announcement was made after Rai held a review meeting with officials from the environment department and Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Thursday.“On April 12 and 13, Delhi will hold a round table conference at the Secretariat. Environment experts and others will be called to the conference, so that we can formulate the next action plan…We will take suggestions of experts and different organisations working on pollution and then the Delhi government will discuss and develop an action plan,” Rai said.Last year, the Delhi government ran an anti-dust campaign in Delhi, used a bio-decomposer to stop stubble burning, held a ”red light on, car off” campaign, started a green war room at the Secretariat to monitor and coordinate efforts by different agencies to control air pollution, and also launched the Green Delhi app. The government said after the meeting, officials would engage in the formulation of the action plan based on the advice given by experts. Rai also called for monitoring of all pollution hot spots in Delhi and said agencies related to construction work should be aware of dust pollution norms.“Regular monitoring of all hot spots in Delhi should happen. I am ordering action on complaints that are coming to the green war room. The second important point was discussed on dust pollution. We took action in many places, especially last year. The public works department and the municipal corporations have also been instructed to spray water continuously on roads,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-plans-round-table-meeting-next-month-to-brainstorm-long-term-pollution-control-plan-101616697444195.html
26-03-2021||Other||Govt tells depts to not wait for end of financial year for project approvals||New Delhi: The Delhi government has asked its agencies to ensure their expenditure is evenly spread out throughout the year in order to end the practice of departments rushing to spend their allocated funds at the end of the financial year. The government has also warned departments that if expenditure proposals are not sent in a timely and uniform manner, they will be pushed to the next financial year. A senior official explained that the delayed expenditure proposals leads to several thousand crores of rupees of government money lying unused, and getting carried to the next year. And then the same cycle repeats year after year. An office memorandum was issued by the state finance department on March 17, and it is now being sent to all departments, companies and agencies. “Attention of all departments is invited to the need for ensuring that expenditure is evenly spread throughout the financial year. Rule 62(3) of GFR, 2017 stipulates in unambiguous terms that rush of expenditure, particularly in the closing months of the financial year, shall be regarded as a breach of financial propriety and shall be avoided,” read the order issued by special secretary (finance) Prince Dhawan. GFR, 2017 is the general financial rules issued by the Union finance ministry and rule 62(3) directs financial advisers of the ministries or departments to ensure adherence to the stipulated monthly expenditure plan and the guidelines issued by the budget division from time to time.Dhawan said the late filing of expenditure proposals leaves little time for the finance department for detailed scrutiny of the financial demands raised by departments.“Receipt of the proposals at the fag end of the financial year leaves little time for the examination of proposals. Besides, departments.agencies too do not have sufficient time to ensure proper utilisation of funds. Inevitably, the departments seek revalidation of expenditure sanctions; local bodies/grantee institutions seek permission to utilise unspent balances in the subsequent financial year in respect of sanctions accorded in the previous financial year,” the order stated. The finance department has set a deadline of March 25, after which, it said, all proposals will be accepted only in the next financial year, which starts from April 1. “To avoid this situation, all the departments are advised that expenditure proposals requiring the concurrence of the finance department should be submitted latest by March 25, 2021. Proposals received after the due date shall be considered only in the next financial year,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-tells-depts-to-not-wait-for-end-of-financial-year-for-project-approvals-101616697383662.html
26-03-2021||Other||New National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill will obstruct good work done by govt: Manish Sisodia||New Delhi: Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre brought in the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to “counter the rising popularity of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal” and to obstruct the “good work” by his government in the Capital. The controversial bill, which effectively hands executive powers to the lieutenant-governor (L-G) from the city-state’s government and legislative assembly, cleared Parliament on Wednesday after the Rajya Sabha passed it with an 83-45 vote amid a walkout by Opposition parties. The Lok Sabha passed the bill on Monday. “The bill that was passed yesterday shows how the Modi government was feeling insecure because of the popularity of Arvind Kejriwal and of the work done by his government. Today, people are saying that Kejriwalji can be an alternative to Modiji... This bill has been brought in to stop Arvind Kejriwal’s rise,” Sisodia said at a press conference. The bill says that “government” in Delhi will now refer to the L-G in the context of all laws passed in the Capital, and that the opinion of the L-G will be mandatory before any executive action. It also bars the state assembly from forming any committees to examine the day-to-day administration of Delhi.Sisodia said the Delhi government was in touch with legal experts to decide on their course of action. Till then, he said, the AAP plans to attack the BJP “politically”.He told reporters that the BJP was indulging in negative politics and accused it of “theft and cheating” to take administrative control of a state where it had twice been defeated in the assembly elections. “The BJP has no model to counter the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) governance in Delhi. Despite the fact that they run the government at the Centre and in several states, they are afraid of the Kejriwal model because people are asking why BJP-ruled states can’t provide free water and cheaper electricity like Delhi,” he said.“Across India, the demand for Kejriwal’s model of governance is increasing, which can be seen in the recent panchayat and municipality elections in several BJP-ruled states in the country. Kejriwal has a vision of development, which is now posing a challenge to the BJP. For the last six years, they have tried many things. But Kejriwal is a fighter. He has always come back stronger. He will fight back,” he said. Sisodia was referring to the AAP’s performance in the Surat municipal polls in Gujarat, where it won 27 seats, and the party’s electoral gains in panchayat elections in Maharashtra, where it won 145 of the 300 seats it contested, and in Himachal Pradesh, where it came out on top in 36 of the 40 seats it fought.The BJP did not comment on Sisodia’s claims.Sisodia also accused the Centre of obstructing the government’s doorstep ration delivery scheme. The scheme was to be rolled out from Thursday was stalled after the Union food and public distribution ministry raised objections to Delhi government giving a new name, ‘Mukhyamantri ghar ghar ration yojana’, and amending the ways of delivery, which the ministry said was in violation of the provisions of the National Food Security Act (NFSA). After Parliament cleared the NCT Bill, Kejriwal on Wednesday said it was a “sad day for Indian democracy.” “RS passes GNCTD amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he tweeted.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta welcomed the passing of the BIll on Wednesday and said that it will help improve the administrative system in Delhi. “During last few years, the Kejriwal government, by bringing unconstitutional bills in Delhi assembly, has hurt the image of the national capital. Now, all Bills will be vetted before being tabled in the assembly,” Gupta said.Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said the Congress has been opposing the GNCTD bill even when Kejriwal did not raise the matter. “For almost 55 days ever since the amendments were first approved by the Union cabinet, Kejriwal did not utter a word on the matter until a few days ago. It was the Congress which repeatedly raised the issue. In all these years Kejriwal has become the B-Team of the BJP by even running a campaign during the recent elections that there should be Modi as PM and Kejriwal as CM in Delhi. Now, the AAP and Kejriwal might be regretting the choices they made, “ he said. PDT Achary, former secretary general of Lok Sabha said going by the Supreme Court judgement of 2018, the government can only mean the elected government. “The Bill does not only overturn the SC’s verdict but also defies the Constitution. It is now to be seen how this plays out in reality once it becomes a law after the gazette notification,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-national-capital-territory-of-delhi-amendment-bill-will-obstruct-good-work-done-by-govt-manish-sisodia-101616697324179.html

Now, we are in no hurry as we have become habitual of hardships. The government must be clear, however, that our agitation will not end and we will make it the biggest Kisan Andolan of the world,” said Tikait addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat, his 10th in the state since January 26. Tikait hailed farmers for their unity and support saying that they had foiled the government’s bid to divide them on basis of state, religion and region. “The morcha is as united as it was on the first day of the agitation. All 40 leaders will continue taking decisions from the Singhu border,” he added. Cautioning farmers not to get misled by the government’s covid-19 restrictions, Tikait claimed it will try to end this agitation by imposing curfew and restrictions.“We will harvest our crops, but the agitation will also continue. The government must withdraw these laws and enact a law to guarantee the Minimum Support Price (MSP). We will not allow the government to suppress this agitation,” he added.TIKAIT’S FOCUS ON HARYANAWith Thursday’s mahapanchayat, Tikait continued his focus to mobilise support from Jat and Sikh dominated areas of Haryana. “Bade Tikait Sahab Kahte the jab Haryana andolan me khada ho jata hai to sarkare kamp jati hai aur ab Haryana ke saath Punjab, UP, Rajasthan bhi Khada hai is andolan ko koi daba nahi sakta (Elders in my family used to say that once an agitation get going in Haryana, government shiver with fear. Now, we also have other states for company. This movement cannot be suppressed,” he said, amid cheers from the crowd. “The government should understand that this is a farmers’ agitation and has nothing to do with state, religion or region,” he said. SEEKS SUPPORTS FROM LABOURERSUrging shopkeepers and labourers to join the protest, Tikait said the new laws had been enacted to give the entire foodgrain of the country to some corporate houses and they will have monopoly on prices. He slammed the union government for increasing the prices of fuel and LPG and privatisation of government departments and agencies.Haryana (BKU) president Gurnam Singh Charuni told the gathering that farmers across the country had united against these laws.

The body of the younger sister was found in a field while the elder sister’s body was found hanging from a tree on Tuesday. The owner of the brick kiln where the sisters worked was also arrested for aiding the accused by failing to report the incident to police.The police have booked the accused for murder under Section 302 and for criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Police are also trying to identify other relatives who helped the accused in committing the crime.“The two sisters were murdered by their family members who were upset with them for having affairs even after their marriages were fixed. Based on the evidence collected in the case, call recordings, mobile phone location, post-mortem report and confession of the accused, we have arrested Ram Pratap Sharma, 28, the elder brother of the sisters, Kamladevi Sharma, their mother, 50, and Ali Hasan who is the owner of the brick kiln where they worked,” said superintendent of police (SP), Pilibhit, Jai Prakash.The brother and the mother confessed to the police that they caught the sisters speaking to men on their phone on night of March 22. When they inquired about it, the two said something which enraged their brother. In a fit rage, Ram Pratap (the brother) and their mother tried to strangle the elder sister. When the younger sister opposed it, they caught and strangled her too.“While the younger daughter died at the spot, the elder one fell unconscious. The duo with help of a relative dumped the body of the younger girl at a distance from the house. The duo later hanged the elder girl at a different place to misguide police. She was unconscious at the time but died because of hanging,” said the SP.“The accused (Ram Pratap) informed the brick kiln owner about it and sought his help in disposing of the bodies but the latter did not agree to it. However, the brick kiln owner didn’t inform the police about it and neither did he reveal the truth when interrogated hours after the bodies were recovered,” the SP added.Earlier the post-mortem investigation had revealed that the younger girl died after being strangled while hanging led to the death of her elder sister. “The post-mortem investigation ruled out any possibility of injuries, torture or rape with the sisters,” the SP said,The post-mortem report prompted the police to focus their investigation on the suspected involvement of people close to the girls, including family members, in the crime. As per police sources, the suspicion grew after a police team recovered the same kind of rope at the house of the deceased which was used in hanging the elder sister.Initially, their family members did not name anyone in their complaint. On Wednesday, they alleged that the two sisters were raped and murdered by two men with whom they were in touch with.“The allegations made by the family were found to be false during the investigation. The mobile locations of the men accused by the girls’ family were not found near the place from where the bodies were recovered. In fact, the mobile location of their brother was traced to those places,” said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/death-of-two-pilibhit-sisters-mother-brother-among-three-held-for-honour-killing-101616694384003.html

We are looking into the weapons used in the attack,” the officer said. Investigators said the four men had visited Ambala for a court hearing in connection with a 2019 gang war with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang members at the Ambala jail, and were headed back to Chandigarh in the afternoon in their Hyundai Verna.On reaching the Ambala-Hisar highway, they had just halted at the Kalka Chowk to cross towards Baldev Nagar, when three men in a Maruti Suzuki Swift opened fire at them.Over 15 rounds were fired, killing Pradeep and Rahul, who were in the rear seat, and Ashwani and Gaurav, who was driving the sedan.Before onlookers could react, the assailants fled towards Patiala.All four were taken to the Civil Hospital in Ambala City, where doctors declared Pradeep and Rahul dead, while Gaurav, who received three bullet injuries and Ashwani, who got shot in the left shoulder, were referred to Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh. Gaurav, who is critical, was operated upon later in the day.The autopsy of the deceased will be conducted by a board of doctors at the Ambala hospital on Friday.“Ashwani is a resident of Manimajra, while the other three are from Mauli Jagran. Gaurav was their driver,” said inspector Ram Kumar, SHO, Ambala City.SSP Hamid Akhtar said four crime investigation teams were on the assailants’ trail. A case under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act has been registered. Clashed with Bishnoi gang in jail in 2019SSP Akhtar said the deceased were booked in 2019 for a violent spat between both the gangs inside the Ambala Central Jail.As per the FIR lodged on July 12, 2019, as many as 84 inmates were booked after around 45 inmates belonging to the Bishnoi gang pushed their way into Ambala jail’s central area by pushing the warders and climbing the walls to attack the inmates belonging to the Rana gang with bricks, stones and sticks.In retaliation, the Rana gang members had also attacked the rival gang members after climbing the walls. The brawl had also left many jail warders, police officials and senior officials injured. Later in July, Bhupi was shifted to Jhajjar jail.On Thursday, when the deceased reached Ambala for hearing in this case at the court of judicial magistrate first class Neelam Kumari, it was cancelled as some court staffers had recently tested positive for Covid-19.Deceased were facing assault casesBoth Pradeep and Rahul were facing two cases of Arms Act and assault registered at the Mauli Jagran police station in 2015 and 2018, respectively. They were also caught a number of times for gambling at Panchkula’s Rajiv Colony. Complainant also booked in drug casePolice said Ashwani, the complainant in the case, was also booked for assault and sexual harassment at the Manimajra police station in 2014. But, was acquitted later.

"We are already in discussion to keep a balance so that they can use locally but at the same time continue to provide other countries vaccines from the Serum Institute of India."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-health-agency-in-talks-with-india-about-covid-19-vaccine-export-who-chief-101616779530763.html
26-03-2021||World||Covid-19 virus may have escaped from Wuhan lab: Ex-CDC chief||A former top public health official who was part of the team that led the Trump administration’s response to Covid-19 has said he believes the deadly pathogen “escaped” from the Chinese virology lab in Wuhan.Robert R Redfield, who headed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Trump administration, made this explosive claim as a “point of view”, without citing any evidence, and also went on to say that he believes the virus transmitted to humans in September-October 2019, way before the first cases were detected in December that year.Redfield made these claims in an interview to CNN for a programme that airs later on Friday. “If I was to guess, this virus started transmitting somewhere in September, October in Wuhan,” Redfield said.“I am of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory, you know, (it) escaped,” Redfield went on to say, but acknowledged problems with that claim in the same breath.“Other people don’t believe that, that’s fine; science will eventually figure it out,” the former CDC chief went on to say, adding, “it’s not unusual for respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in a laboratory to infect a laboratory worker”. There have been reports that some lab workers at the Wuhan laboratory had fallen sick in the fall of 2019, but not clear from what.A team of experts appointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) from around the world is in final stages of preparing a report on its investigation into the origin of the pandemic.A Chinese member on this group, Feng Zijian, was part of a team of Chinese officials who briefed diplomats in Beijing on the WHO investigation in Beijing on Friday, Associated Press (AP) has reported and said the Chinese may have done this to get out their view on the report before it is released.This expert said that the WHO team looked at four ways the virus could have got out, according to AP: a bat carrying the pathogen infected a human; a bat infected an intermediate mammal that spread it to a human; shipments of cold or frozen food; and finally, a laboratory that researches viruses in Wuhan.The expert further said at the briefing for diplomats, according to AP, WHO experts favoured “one of the two animal routes or the cold chain was most likely how it was transmitted”. The lab-leak theory was viewed as extremely unlikely.The first cases of Covid-19 were reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which is home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. WHO had said in a report in March 2020 that a large proportion of the initial cases had a direct link to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan City, where seafood, wild, and farmed animal species were sold. WHO had found that many of the initial patients were stall owners, market employees, and/or regular visitors to the market.But many experts believe the virus came from the Wuhan lab. “I am a virologist; I have spent my life in virology. I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human,” Redfield said in the CNN interview. “And at that moment in time, the virus that came to the human became one of the most infectious viruses that we know and humanity, for human-to-human transmission.”Normally when a pathogen goes from animals to humans, he said, “It takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient in human-to-human transmission. I just don’t think this makes biological sense.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-virus-may-have-escaped-from-chinese-lab-ex-cdc-official-101616779890827.html
26-03-2021||World||US: Colorado shooting suspect passed background check in legal gun purchase||The suspect in the Colorado supermarket shootings bought a firearm at a local gun store after passing a background check, and he also had a second weapon with him that he didn’t use in the attack that killed 10 people this week, authorities and the gun store owner said Friday.Investigators are working to determine the motive for the shooting, but they don’t know yet why the suspect chose the store in Boulder or what led him to carry out the rampage, Police Chief Maris Herold said at a news conference.“Like the rest of the community, we too want to know why — why that King Soopers, why Boulder, why Monday," Herold said. “Unfortunately, at this time, we still don’t have those answers."Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the quick response by officers kept others inside the store out of danger, but he declined to say how many people were there.Investigators have an idea of how many shots were fired in the gunbattle between officers and the suspect, but aren't revealing it yet, Dougherty said. The officer who was the first on the scene was killed.“Their actions saved other civilians from being killed,” Dougherty said about the officers. “They charged into the store and immediately faced a very significant amount of gunfire from the shooter, who at first they were unable to locate.”More charges will be filed against the suspect, 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, in the coming weeks in connection with the shots fired at officers, Dougherty said.John Mark Eagleton, owner of Eagles Nest Armory in the Denver suburb of Arvada, said in a statement that his store was cooperating with authorities as they investigate. The suspect passed a background check conducted by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation before purchasing a gun, Eagleton said.Authorities previously said Alissa purchased an AR-15-style gun on March 16, six days before using it in the shooting. The other weapon the attacker had was a 9 mm handgun."We are absolutely shocked by what happened and our hearts are broken for the victims and families that are left behind. Ensuring every sale that occurs at our shop is lawful, has always been and will always remain the highest priority for our business,” Eagleton said in the statement.Alissa was convicted in 2018 of misdemeanour assault after he knocked a fellow high school student to the floor, climbed on top of him and punched him in the head several times, according to police documents. He was sentenced to probation and community service.Colorado has a universal background check law covering almost all gun sales, but misdemeanour convictions generally do not prevent people from purchasing weapons. If Alissa had been convicted of a felony, his gun purchase would have been prohibited under federal law.An arrest affidavit said Alissa bought a Ruger AR-556 pistol, which resembles an AR-15 rifle with a slightly shorter stock.Alissa, who lived in Arvada, was born in Syria in 1999, came to the U.S. as a toddler and later became a U.S. citizen, according to two law enforcement officials. He would need to be a citizen to buy a gun. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Dougherty, the district attorney, said Friday that the FBI and other agencies were looking into the background of Alissa and the victims and didn’t yet have information to share.The AR-15-style gun was recovered inside the supermarket and is believed to have been used in the attack, said a law enforcement official briefed on the shooting who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Alissa made his first court appearance Thursday, where his public defender asked for the mental health evaluation but provided no details about Alissa's mental health. He is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder over shots fired at a police officer who was not hurt.Alissa entered court in a wheelchair, presumably because of a gunshot wound to the leg he got in the gunbattle with police. He was last seen handcuffed and being led out of the supermarket by police Monday. He had removed all clothing except his shorts before being taken into custody, and his leg was bloody.A rifle, a green tactical vest and a handgun were recovered inside the store, according to the arrest affidavit.Alissa was treated at a hospital before police transferred him to jail. He has since been moved to a jail outside Boulder County due to safety concerns stemming from threats made against him, county sheriff's spokeswoman Carrie Haverfield said in a statement Friday.Alissa is jailed without bail and has not entered a plea, which will come later. His next court hearing will not be scheduled for two to three months to allow his attorneys to evaluate his mental state and evidence collected by investigators.Officer Eric Talley's funeral has been scheduled for Tuesday in the city of Lafayette. Talley, 51, who joined the Police Department in 2010, had seven children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-colorado-shooting-suspect-passed-background-check-in-legal-gun-purchase-101616779505071.html
26-03-2021||World||WHO urges countries to donate 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses 'immediately'||The WHO called Friday for the donation of 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to ensure that every country could start immunising within the first 100 days of 2021.The World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that a rush to secure vaccines had delayed deliveries that the Covax scheme for bringing jabs to poorer nations had been counting on.He urged countries that could do so to donate spare doses to the facility.Tedros had called for all countries in the world to begin vaccinating within the first 100 days of the year, but said that so far, 36 countries had still yet to receive a single dose.He told a press conference that 16 of those were scheduled to receive their first doses through Covax within the remaining 15 days.However, that left 20 countries that were going to miss out."Getting all countries started by day 100 is a solvable problem. Covax needs 10 million doses immediately as an urgent stop-gap measure so these 20 countries can start vaccinating their health workers and older people within the next two weeks," Tedros said."So today I'm asking countries with doses of vaccines that have WHO emergency use listing to donate as many doses as they can to help us meet that target."Ten million doses is not much and it is not nearly enough, but it is a start," he said.The Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme ensures that 92 of the poorest countries in the world can access vaccines, with the cost covered by donors.The scheme aims to distribute enough doses to vaccinate up to 27 percent of their populations by the end of the year.It was supposed to deliver some 238 million doses by the end of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-urges-countries-to-donate-10-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-immediately-101616778727854.html
26-03-2021||World||US needs new understanding with China or it risks conflict, says Kissinger||The United States will have to reach an understanding with China on a new global order to ensure stability or the world will face a dangerous period like the one which preceded World War One, veteran U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger said.Kissinger, now 97, influenced some of the most important turns of the 1970s while serving as secretary of state under Republican Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.Speaking at a Chatham House event in London via Zoom, Kissinger said the ultimate question was whether or not the United States and its Western allies could develop an understanding with China about a new global order."If we don't get to that point and if we don't get to an understanding with China on that point then we will be in a pre-World War One-type situation in Europe, in which there are perennial conflicts that get solved on an immediate basis but one of them gets out of control at some point," he said."It is infinitely more dangerous now than it was then," Kissinger said. He said the high-tech weaponry on both sides could lead to a very gave conflict.Amid worsening relations between China and the West on a range of issues from human rights and trade to Hong Kong, Taiwan has said China is bolstering its ability to attack and blockade the China-claimed island.Kissinger said the United States would likely find it difficult to negotiate with a rival like China that would soon be larger and more advanced in some areas.The other question, he said, was whether or not China would accept that new order.Kissinger praised China's skill at organising itself for technological advance under state control.But he said the West had to up its game."The West has to believe in itself," Kissinger said. "That is our domestic problem - it is not a Chinese problem."He added that China's economic might did not automatically mean that it will be superior in all aspects of technology this century.Kissinger negotiated on behalf of Nixon to open China to the West in 1971 without telling George H.W. Bush, who was then Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, about the talks.Asked about Brexit, Kissinger said he had refused to campaign against leaving the EU as he saw a role for an "autonomous" Britain as a bridge between the United States and the rest of Europe.

26-03-2021||World||'Yes or no?' US lawmakers fume over Big Tech's answers on misinformation||In their first appearance before Congress since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter were asked by US lawmakers whether their platforms bore some responsibility for the riot: "yes or no?"Social media has been widely blamed for amplifying calls to violence and spreading misinformation that contributed to the Jan. 6 attempt to violently overturn the election results.Only Twitter Inc CEO Jack Dorsey replied "yes" to the question, but said the "broader ecosystem" had to be taken into account. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google parent Alphabet Inc, said the company always feels a sense of responsibility but it was a complex question.Facebook Inc's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company was responsible for building "effective systems". He also said that the rioters and former President Donald Trump should be held accountable.Lawmakers widely slammed the platforms' approach to false or dangerous content. The three companies have taken steps to curb misinformation but researchers have shown it is still widely present on the platforms."We fled as a mob desecrated the Capitol, the House floor, and our democratic process," said Democratic Representative Mike Doyle, who asked the CEOs about their responsibility. "That attack, and the movement that motivated it, started and was nourished on your platforms," he added.The hearing was virtual but advocacy group SumOfUs erected cut-outs of the three CEOs dressed as Jan. 6 rioters on the National Mall near the Capitol. One showed Zuckerberg as the "QAnon Shaman," a shirtless rioter wearing horns.In the joint hearing, held by two subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, lawmakers also questioned the executives on the proliferation of Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation and raised concerns about the impact of social media on children - including asking questions about Facebook's plan to create a version of Instagram for kids."Your business model itself has become the problem and the time for self-regulation is over. It's time we legislate to hold you accountable," said Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, chair of the Energy and Commerce committee.Some lawmakers are calling for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability over user content, to be scrapped or rejigged. There are several pieces of legislation from Democrats to reform Section 230 that are doing the rounds in Congress, though progress has been slow. Several Republican lawmakers have also been pushing separately to scrap the law entirely.In written testimony released on Wednesday, Facebook argued that Section 230 should be redone to allow companies immunity from liability for what users put on their platforms only if they follow best practices for removing damaging material.Pichai and Dorsey said in the hearing they were open to some of the changes in Facebook's proposal. Pichai said there were some "good proposals." Dorsey endorsed some of the suggestions from Zuckerberg but said it would be difficult to distinguish between small and large services.Republicans on the panel also criticized the tech giants for what they see as efforts to stifle conservative voices.Trump was banned by Twitter over inciting violence around Jan. 6, while Facebook has asked its independent oversight board to rule on whether to bar him permanently. He is still suspended from YouTube.At one point in the hearing, Dorsey appeared to grow frustrated and tweeted "?" with a poll asking Twitter users to vote "yes" or "no." There were more than 40,000 votes cast in about 30 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yes-or-no-us-lawmakers-fume-over-big-tech-s-answers-on-misinformation-101616778375779.html
26-03-2021||World||Italian PM Draghi says some drug firms appear to have double-sold vaccines||Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi firmly backed new European Union restrictions on vaccine exports while taking a swipe at pharmaceutical companies that give the impression that they may have sold their products “two or three times.”As Italy prepares to slightly ease its latest lockdown, with a plan that includes reopening schools for children up to the age of 11 starting in early April, the premier told reporters in Rome that blocking selected vaccine exports outside the EU remains an option for the bloc.“The impression is that some companies -- I won’t name any names -- sold things two or three times,” Draghi said. He added that a total blockade on virus exports outside the union would “fuel political tension.”Speaking a day after Thursday’s virtual summit of EU leaders, the former head of the European Central Bank said individual export bans “must be considered, especially for companies which don’t respect contracts.”Export RestrictionsEU leaders have guardedly supported a plan to restrict vaccine exports after it emerged that the bloc has sent more shots to the rest of the world than it’s given its own citizens. The strong-arm tactics, however, risk leading to retaliatory measures that could jeopardize the supply of ingredients and equipment for vaccine plants in Europe.Draghi, whose country along with the EU blocked an AstraZeneca Plc vaccine shipment to Australia, is seeking to accelerate a national inoculation campaign, with lockdown measures weighing on an economy that shrank by almost 9% last year.“Right now the emphasis is all on export blocks but we won’t get out of this with blocks but with vaccine production,” Draghi said. “That’s the only thing that will get us out of the pandemic.”The premier rejected a call from Austria and several other countries to overhaul the way vaccines are shared. “Some countries decided to focus on AstraZeneca, maybe also because it cost less,” Draghi said. “The situation in Austria is not dramatic, they have a higher vaccination rate than we do.”Almost 10% of the Italian population has received at least one vaccine dose, compared with 26% in the US and 43% in the UK. Draghi said that in mid-April he’ll seek parliamentary approval to widen Italy’s budget deficit to allow further economic stimulus. The premier needs a new stimulus program within weeks to bankroll higher monthly lockdown costs of as much as 15 billion euros ($18 billion) and keep the economy afloat, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Draghi called for a new fiscal framework for the EU, pointing to the US as a model with a union of capital markets and a complete banking union. He stressed the need for a common European bond as a long-term objective.Italy plans to reach 80% vaccine coverage by the end of September, and Draghi has said the country will triple daily vaccinations to about 500,000 in mid-April, exceeding that pace in May-June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-draghi-says-some-drug-firms-appear-to-have-double-sold-vaccines-101616776607157.html
26-03-2021||World||Maritime traffic jam grows outside blocked Suez Canal, salvage effort continues||A maritime traffic jam grew to more than 200 vessels Friday outside the Suez Canal and some vessels began changing course as dredgers worked frantically to free a giant container ship that is stuck sideways in the waterway and disrupting global shipping.One salvage expert said freeing the cargo ship, the Ever Given, could take up to a week in the best-case scenario and warned of possible structural problems on the vessel as it remains wedged.The Suez Canal Authority said it welcomed international offers of help, including one from the United States, although it did not say what was offered.The Ever Given, owned by the Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, got wedged Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez.A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specializing in salvaging, is working with the canal authority. using tugboats and a specialized suction dredger that is trying to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the bow. Egyptian authorities have prohibited media access to the site.An attempt Friday to free it failed, said Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the technical manager of the Ever Given. Plans are in the works to pump water from interior spaces of the vessel, and two more tugs should arrive by Sunday, the company said.An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause, the company said. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, had previously said the ship had experienced a power blackout, but it did not elaborate.Bernhard Schulte said two canal pilots had been aboard the ship when it got stuck. Such an arrangement is customary, but the ship’s captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel, according to shipping experts.In addition to the over 200 vessels waiting near the canal, more than 100 ships were en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv.Apparently anticipating long delays, the owners of the stuck vessel diverted a sister ship, the Ever Greet, to head around Africa instead, according to satellite data.Others also are being diverted to avoid the canal. The liquid natural gas carrier Pan Americas changed course in the mid-Atlantic, now aiming south to go around the southern tip of Africa, according to satellite data from MarineTraffic.com.About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East.Freeing the Ever Given is “quite a challenge” and could take five days to a week, .Capt. Nick Sloane, a maritime salvage expert who led the high-profile effort to salvage the cruise ship Costa Concordia in 2012 told The Associated Press.The Ever Given’s location, size and a large amount of cargo make the operation more complex, Sloane said. The operation should focus initially on dredging the bank and seafloor around it to get it floating again, rather than unloading its cargo, which could take weeks.That’s because the clock is also ticking structurally for the vessel, he added.“The longer it takes, the worse the condition of the ship will become, because she’s slowly sagging,” said Sloane, vice president of the International Salvage Union. “So ships are designed to flex, but not to be kept at that position with a full load of cargo for weeks at a time. So it’s not an easy situation.”International companies are preparing for the effect that the canal’s blockage will have on supply chains that rely on precise deliveries of goods. Singapore’s Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung said the country’s port should expect disruptions.“Should that happen, some draw down on inventories will become necessary,” he said on Facebook.The backlog of vessels could stress European ports and the international supply of containers, already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, according to IHS Markit, a business research group. It said 49 container ships were scheduled to pass through the canal in the week since the Ever Given became lodged.The delay could also result in huge insurance claims by companies, according to Marcus Baker, global head of Marine & Cargo at the insurance broker Marsh, with a ship like the Ever Given usually covered at between $100 million to $200 million.Those trying to free the vessel want to avoid complications that could extend the canal closure, according to an Egyptian official at the canal authority. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to journalists.Satellite and photos distributed by the canal authority show Ever Given’s bow touching the eastern wall, while its stern appeared lodged against the western wall.The Ever Given was involved in an accident in northern Germany in 2019, when it ran into a small ferry moored on the Elbe River in Hamburg. No passengers were on the ferry at the time and there were no injuries, but it was seriously damaged.Hamburg prosecutors opened an investigation of the Ever Given’s captain and pilot on suspicion of endangering shipping traffic, but shelved it in 2020 for lack of evidence, spokeswoman Liddy Oechtering told The Associated Press.Oechtering also could not say what the investigation had determined the cause of the crash was, but officials at the time suggested that strong winds may have blown the slow-moving cargo ship into the ferry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maritime-traffic-jam-grows-outside-blocked-suez-canal-salvage-effort-continues-101616773290906.html
26-03-2021||World||Covid-19 originated from Wuhan lab, says former CDC chief||A former top US health official says he thinks the coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, and began spreading as early as September 2019.Robert Redfield, who led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, told CNN in a clip aired Friday that he thinks that scenario is more likely than any alternative, including that the virus erupted after transferring from animals to humans or in a live-animal market.The most likely origin “was from a laboratory -- you know, escaped,” said Redfield, who served during former President Donald Trump’s administration. “Other people don’t believe that. That’s fine. Science will eventually figure it out.”Redfield added that he was “not implying any intentionality,” or accusing China of purposefully releasing it, and that he guesses the virus “started transmitting somewhere in September, October, in Wuhan.”Trump frequently assigned blame to China for the pandemic, calling it the “China Virus” and even “Kung Flu,” descriptions that have been criticized as helping to spawn a barrage of attacks on Asian Americans.The origin of the virus remains unclear and is a matter of dispute. Anthony Fauci, one of President Joe Biden’s top health advisers, said Friday that Redfield’s view isn’t held by a majority of health officials.The World Health Organization is due to release a report on its origins this month, informed by a team of 17 international scientists. There are four main theories, including that it came from a lab, but research by the scientists involved shows the most likely is that the virus was transferred to humans after spreading, and adapting, from bats to an intermediary host species. It’s not clear what species that was.The WHO research also found no evidence that the virus spread before December 2019, suggesting the first cases probably began no earlier than late November -- a more recent timeline than Redfield is suggesting.Redfield said the virus’s strength, in how easily it spreads, suggests it was being developed in a lab. If it had come from animals, it would have likely taken more time to adapt to spreading between humans, he said.“I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human -- and, at that moment in time, the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity for human-to-human transmission,” Redfield said. “It takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient in human-to-human transmission. I just don’t think this makes biological sense.”He was asked whether he believes the lab was working to specifically make the virus more efficient. “Let’s just say, I have a coronavirus, and I’m working on it -- most of us in the lab are trying to grow virus,” he said. “We try to make it grow better and better and better and better, so we can do experiments and figure out about it. That’s the way I put it together.”Fauci -- the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who worked with Redfield but remains in his post -- said Redfield was expressing an opinion that isn’t widely held.“The alternative explanation, which most public health individuals go by, is that this virus was actually circulating in China, likely in Wuhan, for a month or more before they were clinically recognized at the end of December,” Fauci said at a press briefing Friday. That means “the virus clearly could have adapted itself” during that time.The current CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, declined to comment at the same press briefing on Friday, saying she didn’t have any information for or against any hypothesis. “We are looking forward to a WHO report that should be coming out soon that examines the origins of this pandemic,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-originated-from-wuhan-lab-says-former-cdc-chief-101616773635223.html
26-03-2021||World||Germany raises Covid-19 warning for France after latest spike in infections||Germany raised its Covid warning on France after a rapid rise in cases there as the European Union’s two biggest countries try to deal with a resurgent pandemic that’s compounding political damage from chaotic vaccination rollouts.France is now rated a high-incidence virus area, Germany’s health authority RKI said in an update on travel recommendations. The move means that travelers from France require a negative Covid test before entering.Meanwhile, France extended a lockdown to three additional regions to try to halt the spread of the virus.Those moves are just the latest in what’s been yet another dramatic week for the EU, involving infighting between governments over vaccines, tensions with the UK over export controls, and an investigation into a stash of AstraZeneca Plc vaccines in Italy.Voters trying to keep up have been whipsawed by developments, most notably when German Chancellor Angela Merkel had to call off a planned five-day lockdown over Easter after an intense backlash. That dramatic move encapsulated the view that Europe’s leaders are failing to get to grip with a situation that is costing lives daily.German Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday that cases are rising too rapidly and the virus variants are a dangerous driver of this trend. The number of people who have tested positive out of 100,000 over the past seven days has nearly doubled in the past month to 119.1, according to RKI.“If this continues unchecked, we will face the danger that our health care system will reach capacity during the month of April,” Spahn said.Germany will also introduce mandatory testing for everyone entering the country via air. From Monday, airlines have to make sure everyone is tested before boarding the plane.“This is a precautionary measure to prevent the virus to spread because of holiday trips,” Spahn said.France’s situation looks even worse. With close to 4,700 people placed in intensive care as of Thursday, the number is approaching the peak seen last fall, at 4,900, according the French health authorities. The Covid incidence rate is at 325, almost triple Germany’s.Despite the deteriorating situation, French President Emmanuel Macron has ignored calls to put the country under a third nation-wide lockdown. He’s also defended his decision, saying numbers earlier in the year didn’t justify such action.“I have no mea culpa to make, no remorse, no failure to declare,” Macron told reporters on Thursday.Amid the Covid surge, European leaders are pushing to speed up their rollout of vaccinations, and are counting on a rapid pickup of deliveries in the second quarter.There was some good news on that front on Friday, when the European Medicines Agency approved two vaccination plants in the Netherlands and Germany.One of those is the Dutch Halix plant, which makes the drug substance for the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine and has been at the center of talks between the UK and the EU over a claim on the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-raises-covid-19-warning-for-france-after-latest-spike-in-infections-101616772509901.html

Another police official, Mohammad Alauddin, said a Chittagong hospital had received eight people with gunshot wounds, adding: "Among them four succumbed to their injuries."He identified the dead as three students and a tailor.Modi landed in Dhaka on Friday for a two-day visit to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence.After being received by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Modi met opposition and government leaders.Hundreds of protesters then clashed with police near a large mosque in Dhaka, witness Jahangir Alam said. He said dozens were hurt when police fired rubber bullets and teargas after protesters pelted them with stones and set ablaze motorcycles.Social media network Facebook and its Messenger app, which are often used to organise protests in the country, appeared to be down in some parts of Bangladesh.An official from Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission declined to comment.

26-03-2021||World||Most mutated Covid-19 variant yet found in travellers from Tanzania||The most mutated variant of the coronavirus yet was found in travellers from Tanzania, prompting scientists to call for greater monitoring in a country that has largely ignored the pandemic.A report submitted to the World Health Organization and regional bodies show the strain has 10 more mutations than found on any other version, according to Tulio de Oliveira, director of Krisp, a scientific institute that carries out genetic testing for 10 African nations. Krisp, which discovered a new strain in South Africa last year that propelled a resurgence of infections in the country, found the new variant in travellers arriving in Angola from Tanzania.“It is potentially of interest,” de Oliveira said in an interview on Friday.Variants of the coronavirus have caused concern globally as, for instance, the one first identified in South Africa known as 501Y.V2 has proven more infectious and able to more easily evade some vaccines. Still, no work has been done yet on the version found in three Tanzanian travellers to ascertain whether it is more infectious or severe than other strains.The newly discovered version will be grown at laboratories at Krisp and an attempt will be made to ascertain how easily it evades antibodies, de Oliveira said. The variant comes from a lineage of the virus first identified in China, whereas many others trace their roots to Europe.Under recently deceased President John Magufuli, Tanzania stopped releasing data on coronavirus infections and opened up the economy including the resort island of Zanzibar, which attracts international tourists. Magufuli’s stance attracted criticism from neighbours and the WHO as anecdotal evidence suggested many people in the country have contracted the disease.His successor, Samia Suluhu Hassan, has yet to indicate whether she will change his policies.“This may be a big wake up call to Tanzania,” de Oliveira said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-mutated-covid-19-variant-yet-found-in-travellers-from-tanzania-101616771190577.html
26-03-2021||World||Myanmar civil disobedience movement nominated for 2022 Nobel Peace Prize||The civil disobedience movement that has sprung up in Myanmar since the military coup has been nominated for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize, a Norwegian academic said Friday.Kristian Stokke, professor of sociology at the University of Oslo, said the movement represents an exemplary peaceful response to the power grab by Myanmar's army on February 1."The civil disobedience movement is an important mass mobilisation for democracy in Myanmar that is taking place, so far, with non-violent means," he told AFP."This pro-democracy movement, especially if successful, can also have consequences outside Myanmar and inspire other non-violent pro-democracy movements elsewhere at a time when democracy is under pressure from authoritarian forces," he added.According to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners (AAPP), a local monitoring group, 320 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 arrested since the coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi -- who herself received the prestigious award in 1991."What is important and gives a glimmer of hope is that what started as a response to a military coup has become a broader alliance across the many differences, especially ethnic ones, within Burmese society," Stokke said.The Norwegian Nobel Committee only accepts nominations submitted before the 31 January deadline, so the proposal submitted last week by Stokke and five other academics can only be considered for next year's prize.Tens of thousands of people, among them parliamentarians and ministers from all countries, former laureates and certain university professors, are eligible to submit a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.The committee itself does not disclose who was considered or even nominated other than announcing the winner, though those who submit a nomination can publish it.The 2021 peace prize winner will be announced on October 8. The World Food Programme (WFP) won last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-civil-disobedience-movement-nominated-for-2022-nobel-peace-prize-101616770900720.html
26-03-2021||World||Republican Mitt Romney gets Profile in Courage Award for impeachment vote||US Sen. Mitt Romney was named the recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on Friday for splitting with his party and becoming the only Republican to vote to convict former President Donald Trump during his first impeachment trial.The award was created by the family of the late president to honor public figures who risk their careers by embracing unpopular positions for the greater good, and is named after Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “Profiles in Courage."“Senator Romney's commitment to our Constitution makes him a worthy successor to the senators who inspired my father to write ‘Profiles in Courage,' ” Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, said in a statement from the JFK Library Foundation. “He reminds us that our Democracy depends on the courage, conscience and character of our elected officials.”Romney, 74, said he is inspired by the memory of his late father, George Romney, an automotive executive and governor of Michigan.“When I think of courage, I think of my Dad,” said the Utah Republican, who is also the former governor of Massachusetts. “He did what was right regardless of consequence. I aspire to his example, though I have failed from time to time. We must subordinate our political fortunes to the causes of freedom, equal opportunity and truth, particularly as they are under assault here and abroad.”Trump's first trial in 2020 focused on the former president's relationship with Ukraine. Romney became the first senator in US history to vote for the conviction of a president who belonged to his own party, and was subject to intense criticism and even threats from Trump's supporters.But he did not back down, the foundation said.When Trump and many Republicans questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, Romney defended the integrity of the results and opposed efforts to overturn them.After the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection by Trump's supporters at the US Capitol, Romney called on his fellow Republican senators to stand up for the truth about the election. At Trump’s second impeachment trial, Romney was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict the former president of inciting the attack.Kennedy's book recounts the stories of eight US senators who risked their careers by taking principled stands for unpopular positions. The award was created by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation in 1989.Romney will be presented with the award, a sterling silver lantern symbolizing a beacon of hope, at a virtual ceremony in May.Previous winners have included Presidents Barack Obama, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush; US Sen. John McCain; and Liberian peace activist and Nobel laureate Leymah Gbowee. The recipients are selected by a bipartisan 15-member panel of national leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-mitt-romney-gets-profile-in-courage-award-for-impeachment-vote-101616770106174.html
26-03-2021||World||Vaccine row escalates as France accuses UK of 'blackmail'||A row over Covid-19 vaccine access escalated Friday, with France accusing Britain of "blackmail" in its dealings with the EU, and Russia and China of misusing vaccines to boost their foreign policy clout.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian's salvo came a day after the European Union threatened to ban pharma firms from exporting coronavirus vaccines to the UK and other well-supplied countries until they make good on their promised deliveries to the bloc.British-based AstraZeneca would likely be the first target of any such restrictions.The UK, Le Drian said, was under pressure because it lacked doses for second vaccine shots."The United Kingdom has taken great pride in vaccinating well with the first dose except they have a problem with the second dose," he told France Info radio."You are vaccinated when you have had both doses. Today there are as many people vaccinated with both in France as the United Kingdom," he added.'A bit handicapped'According to data compiled by AFP, Britain has administered two vaccine doses to 4.1 percent of its population, against 3.9 percent overall in France."You can't be playing like this, a bit of blackmail, just because you hurried to get people vaccinated with a first shot, and now you're a bit handicapped because you don't have the second one," Le Drian added.Le Drian did not say what precisely constituted the alleged British blackmail, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson had warned earlier in the week that trade "blockades" would chill investment."I would just gently point out to anybody considering a blockade, or interruption of supply chains, that companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed," he told lawmakers.The latest EU-UK row centres on an AstraZeneca plant in the Netherlands, which Johnson's government claims as part of the British vaccine supply chain.'New type of world war'Any suggestions of British vaccine selfishness have found robust responses in British media, with The Times accusing President Emmanuel Macron of "evident anglophobia" and "petty jingoism", and The Sun calling him "arrogant".EU chief Ursula von der Leyen's stark warning of a vaccine export stop came after a video summit of all 27 EU leaders and stoked fears that cross-Channel rivalry could damage global efforts to combat the pandemic.France has made clear it sees vaccine policies feeding not just European, but global competition for influence."We are looking at a new type of world war," Macron said after the EU summit. "We are looking in particular at Russian and Chinese attacks and attempts to gain influence through the vaccine."This situation, he said, meant the EU had to strengthen its own vaccine capabilities.- 'Absolutely disagree' -His foreign minister on Friday also accused Russia and China of using their vaccines to gain influence abroad even before they had finished inoculating their own populations, a claim rejected by Moscow."We absolutely disagree with the fact that both Russia and China are waging some kind of war," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. "And we absolutely disagree with the fact that Russia and China are using the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines as tools of influence."Russia and China have, for their part, accused Western countries of hoarding vaccines to the detriment of poor nations.Russia has applied to Europe's medicines regulator EMA to gain approval for the use of its Sputnik V vaccine in the 27-nation bloc, but is still waiting for an answer.The German government said Friday that it would be open to using Sputnik V once it had EMA approval.In the meantime the developers are pushing Sputnik V -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- in other regions and say the jab has been registered in 55 countries around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-row-escalates-as-france-accuses-uk-of-blackmail-101616769002928.html

26-03-2021||World||Taiwan reports largest ever incursion by Chinese air force||Twenty Chinese military aircraft entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone on Friday, in the largest incursion yet reported by the island's defence ministry and marking a dramatic escalation of tension across the Taiwan Strait.The island's defence ministry said the air force deployed missiles to "monitor" the incursion into the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone. It also said its planes warned the Chinese aircraft, including by radio.It marked the largest incursion to date by the Chinese air force since Taiwan's defence ministry began disclosing almost daily Chinese military flights over the waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea last year.Some of the Chinese aircraft flew in the airspace to the south of Taiwan and passed through the Bashi Channel which separates the island from the Philippines, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement.A person familiar with Taiwan's security planning told Reuters the Chinese military was conducting exercises that would simulate an operation against U.S. warships that sail through the Bashi Channel.China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up military activities near the democratic island in recent months, a move Taiwan says jeopardizes regional stability.The presence of so many Chinese combat aircraft on Friday's mission - Taiwan said it was made up of four nuclear-capable H-6K bombers and 10 J-16 fighter jets, among others - was unusual and came as the island's air force suspended all training missions after two fighter jet crashes this week.There was no immediate comment from China's defence ministry. Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country's determination to defend its sovereignty.Earlier on Friday, Taiwan and the United States signed their first agreement under the administration of new president Joe Biden, establishing a Coast Guard Working Group to coordinate policy, after China's passing of a law that allows its coast guard to fire on foreign vessels.While the United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself and is the island's main arms supplier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reports-largest-ever-incursion-by-chinese-air-force-101616767982152.html

26-03-2021||World||US Senate panel splits along party lines on Justice Dept nominee Vanita Gupta||The Senate Judiciary Committee has ended in a tie vote over the nomination of Indian-American civil rights lawyer Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general of the United States, amid objections from the Republicans.The committee on Thursday voted 11-11 on Gupta’s nomination. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, can now file a discharge motion on her nomination to allow a full Senate vote on her nomination.If confirmed, Gupta, 46, would be the first woman of colour to serve as associate attorney general, and the first civil rights lawyer to serve in one of the top three positions at the US Department of Justice. More than 100 organisations have urged the Senate to confirm Gupta.“Under the provisions of S. Res. 27, Leader Schumer may now file a discharge motion on Ms Gupta’s nomination to place her on the executive calendar,” the Senate Judiciary Committee said after it voted for the nomination of Vanita Gupta to be US Associate Attorney General by a vote of 11-11.Ahead of the vote, all Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote a letter to Senator Durbin demanding a second confirmation hearing on Gupta.“While under oath, Vanita Gupta misled the Committee on at least four issues: Her support for eliminating qualified immunity; her support for decriminalising all drugs; her support for defunding the police; and her death penalty record," they wrote."Unfortunately, in her responses a week later to our written questions, Ms.Gupta was no more forthcoming. In some cases, she doubled down on her misleading statements from the hearing, and in others, she refused to answer altogether," the Republican senators wrote.“We urge you to immediately schedule a second hearing with Ms. Gupta so that she can answer for her misleading statements, and for her refusal to respond to our written questions," they wrote.Dick Durbin, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "Vanita Gupta is an exceptionally well-qualified person to be Associate Attorney General… her extensive support from prominent conservatives is not an aberration," said Senator"It is the natural result of the fact that she has worked across the partisan divide throughout her entire career,” Durbin said.In his remarks during the voting process, Durbin said that he is “struggling to understand” the fierce opposition of the Republicans to this nominee.“She is extraordinary. She has the support of law enforcement groups that any one of us would be proud to have. And yet, she continues to be labelled as soft on crime or wanting to defund the police, and there’s no truth to that whatsoever,” Durbin said.The Democrats alleged that during the Judiciary Committee’s vote on Gupta’s nomination to be Associate Attorney General, Committee Republicans did everything in their power to block the vote on this highly qualified and historic nominee – filibustering for nearly two hours and then invoking an obscure Senate rule to prevent the Committee from meeting beyond 12:00 PM.“This obstruction of a nominee with broad support from across the political spectrum left Chair Durbin with no option but to call a roll call vote before the Committee meeting was terminated by Republicans’ invocation of this rule,” said a media release issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee.Meanwhile, on the Senate floor, Republican Senator John Cornyn discussed the alleged ties of Gupta to the firm Avantor, which sells a chemical that has been linked to the illicit drug trade in Mexico.“The nominee for the third highest-ranking position at the Department of Justice has profited to the tune of millions of dollars from Avantor stock,” he alleged.“Vanita Gupta has been nominated to serve as the Associate Attorney General and she is a very large shareholder in this publicly-traded company. This isn't just a blind investment in a mutual fund, this is the family business. Ms. Gupta's father is Avantor’s Chairman of the Board,” Cornyn said.“I cannot support the nomination of Ms Gupta to serve as Associate Attorney General and I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose her nomination as well,” he said.In a statement after the split vote, Wade Henderson, interim president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said that Gupta is exactly the leader the country needs in this role at this critical moment.“Now is not the time for baseless and harmful partisan tactics. With broad support that crosses ideological divides, Gupta is a consensus builder who will bring vital civil rights and racial justice experience to the Justice Department. The country needs Gupta and her experience in this important role now, and the Senate must take swift and immediate action to confirm her,” he said.Gupta currently is president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. She previously served as Acting Assistant Attorney General and head of the US Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration.The Heritage Foundation think tank, alleged that Gupta is a far-Left partisan activist who supports defunding the police and packing the Supreme Court, among a host of other extreme policies.“While President Biden gives lip service to unity and bipartisanship, Gupta’s nomination continues a disturbing trend of bowing to the liberal wing of his party when making nominations for key posts in his administration. Senators should reject Vanita Gupta for this post,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-splits-along-party-lines-on-justice-dept-nominee-vanita-gupta-101616767140673.html

The black Mujib jackets have been designed with 6 buttons, two pockets on the lower half and a front pocket on the left, as worn by Rahman.In keeping with the eco-friendly nature of the Khadi fabric, the covers for these jackets too have been made of black Khadi cotton fabric with Khadi India’s logo embroidered over it.During the National Day event, Prime Minister Modi handed over the Gandhi Peace Prize 2020, being conferred by India upon Rahman, to his daughters -- Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana."This is one of the most memorable days of my life. I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with Gandhi Peace Prize," said Modi.The Gandhi Peace Prize is an annual award instituted by the government of India since 1995, the 125th birth anniversary commemoration year of Mahatma Gandhi.The Gandhi Peace Prize 2020 was conferred on Bangabandhu early this week. It was for the first time that the award was given away posthumously.Modi arrived in Bangladesh on a two-day visit to attend the celebrations of the golden jubilee of the country's independence, the birth centenary of Rahman and hold talks with his counterpart Hasina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-dons-mujib-jacket-as-he-pays-tribute-to-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-101616765742943.html

The United States is leading the immunisation drive with over 133 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine already administered, which is more than one-fourth of the total Covid-19 shots administered globally.According to a CNN report, most US states have announced their plan to open up immunisation for all eligible individuals, which means 16 and older will be able to get Pfizer-BioNTech jab while 18 and older will be able to receive Moderna’s and Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccines. The states that have already opened vaccination for the general public are Mississippi, Alaska, West Virginia, Utah, Georgia and Arizona.Here’s the schedule announced by other states, according to CNN, to open vaccination eligibility to the general public:March 29: Oklahoma, Texas, Ohio, North Dakota, LouisianaMarch 30: MinnesotaMarch 31: IndianaApril 1: Montana, ConnecticutApril 2: New HampshireApril 5: Michigan, Tennessee, Idaho, Iowa, Florida, NevadaApril 7: North CarolinaApril 9: MissouriApril 12: Illinois, KentuckyApril 15: CaliforniaApril 19: Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode IslandApril 27: MarylandMay 1: Wisconsin, Oregon, South Dakota, WashingtonMay 3: South CarolinaNew Mexico, Virginia, Colorado have planned to open up the vaccination in April but haven’t set an exact date. On the other hand, Nebraska, Kansas, Hawaii, Delaware have indicated to allow vaccination for all individuals in May or later. It is still unclear when Alabama, Arkansas, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wyoming will allow vaccination for the general public.The United States has crossed the grim milestone of 30 million Covid-19 cases and has reported more than 546,000 related deaths so far, the highest in the world. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a new vaccination goal of 200 million Covid-19 shots within his first 100 days in office. The earlier goal of 100 million doses of vaccine to be administered within the same time frame was reached ahead of the schedule last Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-these-us-states-have-shared-plan-to-vaccinate-general-public-101616765202844.html

This time, India handed over 109 ambulances for the people of Bangladesh. I extend my heartiest thanks to PM Modi, his government and the people of India. Before this, India had cooperated with us and gifted us vaccines for Covid,” Prime minister Hasina said while addressing an event to mark Bangladesh's National Day.Also Read: PM Modi meets 'Muktijoddhas' of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War"India is not only our next-door neighbour, we have a historical, social, cultural heritage and geographical rapport. The people and government of India were immensely involved in the evolution process of Bangladesh during our liberation war in 1971," she said.Remembering the military coup of 1975, in which her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed, she said, "I remember with great anguish, August 15 1975 - a dark night for Bangladesh when the Father of the Nation was assassinated. My mother, three brothers, two sisters-in-law, a 10-year-old brother, and uncle were brutally assassinated, and I remember all those who attained martyrdom that night.”“During those difficult times, India sheltered about 10 million people who fled from Bangladesh in the face of persecution by Pakistani soldiers, in the face of killing, genocide and rape. India gave them shelter, food and medication. They helped our freedom fighters with all types of cooperation," she said.Hasina was addressing the event, of which PM Modi was also a part, at the National Parade Ground in Dhaka. PM Modi is on a visit to the country after the Bangladesh government invited him to take part in the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of its independence. The invite is seen as a step towards strengthening the 50-year-old diplomatic ties between the two nations.Bangladesh is also celebrating the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is also the recipient of this year's Gandhi Peace Prize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/during-our-good-times-and-bad-bangladesh-pm-expresses-gratitude-to-india-101616765520510.html
26-03-2021||World||How UK Covid variant tore through an English island and onto the world stage||Warm weather brings tourists to the Isle of Sheppey, a flat, marshy island near the mouth of the River Thames. Each summer, they fill Sheppey's many caravan parks or flock to villages with seaside attractions geared toward old-school British tourists: pubs and penny arcades, mini-golf and fish and chips.Another kind of visitor stays all year round. Clustered in fields and marshes in eastern Sheppey are three prisons holding about 2,500 men. Giant wind turbines stand like sentries outside the lichen-clad walls of HMP Elmley, the largest of the three, where a 52-year-old prison officer named Paul Tottman worked.On Oct. 28, a Wednesday, he returned home "very angry," said his wife, Laura. Covid-19 infections among HMP Elmley's staff and prisoners were rising, and Tottman, who was asthmatic, felt vulnerable. On Thursday, she said, the prison called to tell Tottman that he had been in contact with a Covid-positive person and should self-isolate. Soon, Tottman also tested positive, and was feverish and fighting for breath.Sheppey had barely been touched by the pandemic's first wave last spring. This time, the disease tore through the prison and across the island. It hit the Tottman family hard. Laura and their daughter Hattie fell ill, and within a week of his test, Paul was taken to hospital. "Then it started to go downhill," Laura said.Sheppey has been prone to invasion ever since Ivar the Boneless and his Viking hordes conquered it in the ninth century. The arrival of a deadlier and more transmissible variant of coronavirus – the B.1.1.7 "variant of concern" – was also swift and destructive. Although scientists say the first known case was later traced elsewhere in the county of Kent, it was Sheppey and its borough of Swale where the variant first took hold.The new variant quickly spread from Kent across London and southern England, going from an estimated 3% of cases in England at the end of October to 96% at the start of February. The surge pushed Britain's Covid death toll into six figures; it now stands at 126,000. Two-thirds of those deaths have occurred since Sept. 20, when the variant was first detected.The so-called Kent or UK variant has now been reported in more than 100 countries. Recent research has shown that it is not only more contagious but also more deadly, although existing vaccines still work against it. The variant's arrival has fuelled a rise in infections elsewhere in Europe that threatens to outpace sluggish vaccination programs. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts it will be America's dominant variant by the end of this month; experts warn that the country should be bracing for impact and not – as many states are – loosening restrictions.The Kent variant was identified by the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, or COG-UK, a unique scientific endeavour set up last March to explore how genomic research might help tackle the pandemic. Since it emerged in 2019, the coronavirus has mutated thousands of times. These mutations can be tracked by sequencing, or "reading," their complete set of genetic instructions, or genomes.Solving the mystery of the Kent variant was a race against time by the COG-UK scientists, who have sequenced almost half of the world's catalogue of Covid-19 genomes. The first case of B.1.1.7 was later traced back to September, but scientists didn't fully connect it to the surge in cases until December, when they confirmed their fears: The variant was so transmissible, it was leap-frogging restrictions put in place to tackle the virus.At the time, COG-UK was sequencing about 9,000 samples a week, using leftover swabs from the labs where most of Britain's Covid-19 tests are processed. For most of last year, that process took about two weeks. But collecting and sequencing genomes is – relatively speaking – the easy part. Much harder is quickly establishing whether a variant is more contagious or deadly – or, in B.1.1.7's case, both. A range of factors can explain a jump in infections, from a super-spreader event to a change in human behaviour as hot weather turns to cold.Also, although two weeks between swabbing and sequencing is fast by the standards of genomic research, it wasn't fast enough to keep up with a highly transmissible variant. While scientists puzzled from afar, funeral directors on Sheppey worked 18-hour days to cope with the dead, and Kent's hospitals filled up with patients who were often too sick to save.In the end, COG-UK's scientists relied upon a timely tipoff from a distant colleague and a hack involving Covid tests to zero in on the Kent variant and more quickly confirm how dangerous it was. "There wasn't some set method for detecting a variant like this," said Erik Volz, a genetic epidemiologist at Imperial College London and member of COG-UK. "We had to do it on the fly and develop methods as we went."Although the scientists couldn't stop the variant's conquest of Britain, they had become a warning system for the world. And Sheppey had become an improbable breeding ground for a variant that spans the globe.The island as a place apartSheppey is no stranger to contagion. Off its western coast lies Deadman's Island, a mudbank strewn with human bones thought to belong to men and boys who died of infectious diseases on prison ships moored nearby in centuries past. One such disease was "marsh fever," later known as malaria, carried by Sheppey's swamp-bred mosquitoes. Britain's last major outbreak of malaria happened on the island, brought there by troops returning from World War One. (After an earlier conflict – the Battle of Trafalgar – Admiral Nelson's body was brought ashore at Sheppey preserved in a barrel of booze.)The tidal strait that separates Sheppey from the rest of Kent is narrow and spanned by two bridges, the larger opened only in 2006. Some locals still regard the island as a place apart. Angela Harrison, a local councillor responsible for health, was born on Sheppey and said she knew people who had never left it. Central London lies only 40 miles up the Thames, but Sheppey (population: 40,000) feels untouched by metropolitan wealth or values.Harrison said it became clear in late October that a new wave of infections had hit the island particularly hard. "Everyone was asking the same question: Why – what have we done?" she said. Some islanders blamed outsiders for bringing in the virus, she said, or blamed each other for not wearing face masks. Sheppey was vulnerable because many people work in food distribution centres, care homes or the holiday parks – jobs they can't do while sheltering at home.Bill Tatton, a councillor who represents Sheppey East, lives in Warden, a village flanked by large caravan holiday parks. In hindsight, he said, the island ought to have shut the two bridges and implemented a "sensible lockdown – no one in, no one out, for two weeks."Tatton added: "There were people ... who said, 'Since they built that very high bridge across the Swale, we've had nothing but problems.'"The bridge links Sheppey to the rest of Kent, known as the "Garden of England" for its past abundance of orchards and hops gardens, and for its beaches, castles and postcard-perfect English villages. But Kent is less idyllic than its image suggests. "There's a big class divide, a big geographical divide," said Jackie Cassell, a public health expert at Brighton and Sussex Medical School who grew up on Sheppey. "Most of the money is in the middle of the county and most of the poverty is at the edges."One of those edges is Sheppey's main town of Sheerness. It ranks among the most deprived areas in Britain; about half of its children live in poverty. Many people trace Sheppey's decline to the closure of the Sheerness Naval Dockyard in 1960, which threw thousands out of work. Hundreds more lost their jobs when the steelworks shut in 2011.These days, jobs on Sheppey are generally scarce and low-quality, said Tatton, the councillor. Many islanders seek jobs on what they call "the mainland" – that is, Britain.Prison falls prey to pandemicOne of Sheppey's biggest employers is Her Majesty's Prison Service. Tottman had worked at HMP Elmley for 22 years. Laura said her husband accepted that Covid made a tough job riskier. Socially distancing was often impossible in cells and cramped walkways, and ventilation was poor."You can't just open the windows and let fresh air in," Laura said. On Nov. 6, Tottman was taken to a hospital in Margate, a seaside town in Kent. Laura spoke to him regularly via Facetime, his voice muffled by an oxygen mask.Mike Rolfe, who worked with Tottman at HMP Elmley, is the founder of the Criminal Justice Workers' Union, which says it represents about 450 staff across Sheppey's three prisons. "It was really just a free-for-all once we had that disease in prison," he said. "Even those who were really careful were catching it quite easily." Rolfe estimates that 75% of HMP Elmley's 500 staff tested positive for Covid during the recent surge. At one point, he said, about 100 staff were off work.The prison service said it took "quick and decisive action" at the start of the pandemic to limit the spread of the virus. This included halting social visits for adult prisoners, creating 1,200 temporary cells and making more PPE available to staff. The prison service also said it had mandated the wider use of face masks by its staff in guidance published on Oct. 12 – by which time, said union leader Rolfe, the outbreak at HMP Elmley had begun."We weren't wearing face masks right up until we had a problem," he said. Asked about this issue, a spokesman for the prison service said efforts by its staff had saved lives and kept Covid cases and deaths "significantly lower than predicted."A local hospital overwhelmedBy this time Covid infections were rising nationwide. On Oct. 31, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced England's second national lockdown, lasting four weeks. Restaurants, pubs, gyms and non-essential shops were shut, but – unlike during the first lockdown in March – schools remained open, streets were busier, and many trades continued.The lockdown drove down infections across Britain, but not on Sheppey. By Nov. 18, Swale borough was Britain's worst-hit Covid hotspot, with an infection rate of 631.7 cases per 100,000 people. The rate in Sheppey East, where the prisons are located, was eye-popping: 2,079.5 per 100,000 people, or about nine times the national average.A Sheppey entrepreneur called Henry Cooper watched the disease rip through his family. Cooper, who runs a caravan park, fell ill after a family gathering in late September. In a matter of weeks, Covid-19 had killed his grandfather, hospitalized his father and pushed Cooper to what felt like death's door. "The whole island just exploded with Covid," he said. "It was absolutely terrifying."Jeffrey Barrett is a statistical geneticist and the director of the Covid genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, a COG-UK member that processes about half of Britain's genome data. Initially, Barrett and other COG-UK scientists attributed Sheppey's spike in cases not to a new variant but to the outbreak at HMP Elmley. The outbreak, they speculated, might have infected the wider community.Barrett said it is now clear that the prison wasn't infecting the wider community; the community was infecting the prison.The same spike that Barrett studied from afar was flooding Medway Maritime Hospital. The hospital is in Gillingham, on the mainland, a 30-minute drive from Sheppey, and serves the island and the rest of populous northern Kent. In the first two weeks of November, the number of Covid patients at Medway Maritime doubled.By the end of November, it would be the busiest Covid hospital in Britain, with almost half of its adult general and acute-care beds occupied by patients with the disease. Ambulances lined up for hours outside as staff struggled to make room for the sick.Each morning from his hospital bed in Margate, prison officer Tottman sent his wife messages to tell her how he had slept. On Nov. 16, the messages stopped. Overnight, Tottman had been put on a ventilator and into a medical coma.Three days later, he was transferred to St. Thomas' Hospital in central London for ECMO treatment. ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, is a risky, last-ditch procedure that did the work of Tottman's ravaged lungs, offering them a chance to heal.Laura travelled up to London to see him. She put on a protective apron, mask and visor, and sat next to her husband. Tubes snaked in and out of his comatose body. Laura was hopeful. She felt her husband was lucky to have this rare treatment.Zeroing in on the variantAt the end of November, Britain's latest infection figures were published. They were stark. Despite the weeks-long national lockdown, cases were still surging in Kent and southeast England, and public health officials couldn't explain why."We were not thinking of it as a matter of national urgency at that point," said Barrett, the statistical geneticist. In the days and weeks ahead, however, Britain's genomic scientists zeroed in on B.1.1.7.The first breakthrough came in early December, when Andrew Rambaut, a British evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, got a tipoff from a scientist thousands of miles away. The scientist, a Brazilian named Tulio de Oliveira, had noticed an unusual set of mutations on the virus when investigating a spike in cases in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. In doing so, De Oliveira had uncovered the so-called South African variant, which has blunted the effectiveness of some vaccines.Based on this tip, Rambaut began combing Britain's genome databases, and B.1.1.7 stood out for two reasons. First, it had quickly accumulated a startling number of mutations, 23 in all. Second, Rambaut noticed that eight of those mutations were on the spike protein, which helps the virus lock on to human cells. This was significant because it potentially affected how transmissible the virus is.More proof was needed. That's when Volz, the genetic epidemiologist, got involved, working out how fast B.1.1.7 was spreading.He said that COG-UK's surveillance data showed a rapid rise in samples of B.1.1.7. "The scale of that growth was faster than anything I had seen before," Volz said.By Dec. 7, Volz had come up with an estimate by comparing the growth of B.1.1.7 with other variants that the new variant was 70% more transmissible. Even so, Volz was confused – initially – because variants sometimes show fast growth spikes, then fizzle out. But "the more we studied it, the more concerning it became," he said.The next day, Dec. 8, was a momentous one. Britain became the first Western country to start vaccinating people against Covid, sparking hope that the virus might finally be contained. Rambaut joined a call with experts from Public Health England, a government agency that handles health emergencies, to discuss the variant that threatened to dash those hopes. The scientists decided to ramp up their investigations into B.1.1.7.Tracking a variant by sequencing its entire genome is accurate but slow. But Barrett, the statistical geneticist, made a discovery that speeded up the process.Standard, gene-based Covid tests don't sequence an entire genome. They look for three genes, and come back positive if at least two are clearly detected. By December, some laboratories had noticed that an unusual number of positive tests were failing to detect one of those three targeted genes. Barrett was asked to work out why, and soon found the answer: The tests were failing to detect the gene because a variant had mutated it. And that variant was B.1.1.7.This meant COG-UK's scientists could now track the new variant through Covid tests with the missing gene. And because results from tests take days, rather than the weeks required to sequence a genome, they could track the variant much faster.By mid-December, scientists confirmed that B.1.1.7 was behind the surge in cases – and it was likely more contagious than previous variants. "Everyone was like, 'Oh shit,'" Barrett said.By Dec. 18, the evidence was formally considered by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, a committee of scientists that provides risk assessment and mitigation advice to the government. The group expressed "moderate confidence that demonstrates a substantial increase in transmissibility compared to other variants."The next day, Johnson announced that the new variant was up to 70% more transmissible than its predecessors. The government abruptly cancelled Christmas plans for millions. Dozens of countries banned flights from the UK. French authorities temporarily stopped all arrivals from the Eurotunnel, which connects Britain – via Kent – with the rest of Europe. Britain was cut off, an island alone in a pandemic world.Race between vaccines and variantPaul Tottman, the Sheppey prison officer, didn't respond to ECMO treatment. "His lungs were just too badly damaged," said his wife, Laura. Five days before Christmas, with his family at his bedside, doctors at St. Thomas' turned off Tottman's life support. "He was only 52," said Laura. "He had years ahead of him."Britain is now emerging piecemeal from a three-month lockdown that, alongside a fast-moving vaccination programme, has sharply reduced the number of Covid-19 deaths and infections. It is a race between the variant and the vaccines, said Erik Volz, who predicted that B.1.1.7 will continue to grow globally but will "hit a wall once we get more people vaccinated."Jeffrey Barrett said scientists were now expanding and accelerating COG-UK's genomic surveillance system, allowing them to respond more quickly to outbreaks and mutations. Scientists, he said, usually operate on incentives that define their careers: They publish work and get credit for it. "Now the incentive is: Save humanity," Barrett said. "That overrides individual careers. I hope we retain a bit of that in the future."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-uk-covid-variant-tore-through-an-english-island-and-onto-the-world-stage-101616763092086.html
26-03-2021||World||Migrant arrivals to Europe lower but deaths remain high||The number of migrants and asylum-seekers who reached Europe in 2020 is the lowest it has been in the past decade, according to a report released Friday by the United Nations migration agency. But deaths and disappearances on sea routes remain alarmingly high with only a small fraction of bodies recovered and victims identified.Of the 93,000 people who entered Europe irregularly last year, roughly 92% did so via the Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean Sea as well as through the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa to Spain’s Canary Islands, often on unseaworthy boats.Arrivals in the Canaries, considered part of the Schengen area, increased by 750% last year following tougher border controls and interceptions on the Mediterranean by North African countries.The sea routes are lethal. The International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrants Project has confirmed the death or disappearances of at least 2,300 people last year. This number is higher than in 2019 when 2,095 victims were recorded and slightly lower than in 2018 which had 2,344.The Central Mediterranean north of Libya saw 984 people perish in 2020. Meanwhile, on the Atlantic route to the Canaries at least 849 victims were verified — more than four times as many as in any previous year, according to the report, “Maritime Migration to Europe.”But the organization admits its data is incomplete. So-called “invisible shipwrecks,” when entire boats disappear and leave no survivors, are especially concerning, the report said.In 2020 there were at least 19 cases of invisible shipwrecks in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, with 571 people reported missing, according to IOM data requested by the AP.“Such cases are extremely difficult to detect, let alone verify, and are yet another indication that the true number of deaths on maritime routes to Europe is far higher than indicated by the available data,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-arrivals-to-europe-lower-but-deaths-remain-high-101616763675770.html

I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with Gandhi Peace Prize," said Modi.He handed over the award, a citation, a plaque and a shawl to Sheikh Rehana in the presence of Prime Minister Hasina.Hasina in his address thanked Prime Minister Modi and the Government of India for bestowing the prestigious honour on her father, who is also the Father of the Nation.The Gandhi Peace Prize is an annual award instituted by the government of India since 1995, the 125th birth anniversary commemoration year of Mahatma Gandhi.The Gandhi Peace Prize 2020 was conferred on Bangabandhu early this week. It was for the first time that the award was given away posthumously.Modi earlier said Bangabandhu was a champion of human rights and freedom, and a hero to Indians as well.The award carries an amount of ₹1 crore, a citation, plaque and an exquisite traditional handicraft/ handloom item.Mujibur Rahman was imprisoned in Pakistan when Bangladesh was born. Pakistan was forced to set him free on January 8, 1972.He returned to Dhaka on January 10, 1972. He later took over as Prime Minister of Bangladesh but was assassinated by some military officers during a coup d'etat on August 15, 1975. His wife, brother, sons and daughters-in-law were also assassinated along with him. Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana survived as they were in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-hands-over-gandhi-peace-prize-for-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-to-his-daughter-101616763473845.html

Some victims seemed unconscious, while others could be see bleeding. Bystanders carried bodies, laying them out on the ground near the site of the accident.Egypt’s railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and poor management. Official figures show that 1,793 train accidents took place in 2017 across the country.In 2018, a passenger train derailed near the southern city of Aswan, injuring at least six people and prompting authorities to fire the chief of the country’s railways.In the same year, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said the government lacks about 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $14.1 billion, to overhaul the run-down rail system. El-Sissi spoke a day after a passenger train collided with a cargo train, killing at least 12 people, including a child.A year earlier, two passenger trains collided just outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, killing 43 people. In 2016, at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.Egypt's deadliest train crash took place in 2002, when over 300 people were killed when fire erupted in speeding train traveling from Cairo to southern Egypt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trains-collide-in-southern-egypt-killing-at-least-32-101616760834891.html
26-03-2021||World||China outlines Covid-origin findings ahead of WHO report, says country has 'nothing to hide'||Chinese officials briefed diplomats Friday on the ongoing research into the origin of Covid-19, ahead of the expected release of a long-awaited report from the World Health Organization.The briefing appeared to be an attempt by China to get out its view on the report, which has become enmeshed in a diplomatic spat. The US and others have raised questions about Chinese influence and the independence of the findings, and China has accused critics of politicising a scientific study.“Our purpose is to show our openness and transparency," said Yang Tao, a Foreign Ministry official. “China fought the epidemic in a transparent manner and has nothing to hide.”The report, which has been delayed repeatedly, is based on a visit earlier this year by a WHO team of international experts to Wuhan, the city in central China where infections from a new coronavirus were first reported in late 2019.The experts worked with Chinese counterparts, and both sides have to agree on the final report. It's unclear when it will come out.Feng Zijian, a Chinese team member and the deputy director of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the experts examined four possible ways the virus got to Wuhan.They are: a bat carrying the virus infected a human, a bat infected an intermediate mammal that spread it to a human, shipments of cold or frozen food, and a laboratory that researches viruses in Wuhan.The experts voted on the hypotheses after in-depth discussion and concluded one of the two animal routes or the cold chain was most likely how it was transmitted. A lab leak was viewed as extremely unlikely, Feng said.His remarks were reported by state broadcaster CCTV, which said envoys from 50 countries and the League of Arab States and the African Union attended the briefing at the Foreign Ministry.“China firmly opposes certain countries’ attempts to politicize the origin tracing issue and make groundless accusations and hold China accountable,” the ministry said in an online post about the briefing.Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, "I would like to stress that virus tracing is a scientific issue that should be studied by scientists through cooperation.”She told reporters that the experts are still discussing the contents and translation of the report, and she did not know when it would be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-outlines-covid-origin-findings-ahead-of-who-report-says-country-has-nothing-to-hide-101616759905400.html
26-03-2021||World||In retaliatory move, China now sanctions UK entities, lawmakers||China has sanctioned individuals including lawmakers and entities in the UK over what it called “lies and disinformation” about the situation in Xinjiang. This comes days after Britain imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over alleged rights abuses in the northwestern Chinese province.Beijing’s move is retaliation against a set of coordinated sanctions imposed by the US, the European Union, Britain and Canada against China over what they claim are human rights violations against the Uighur Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).Beijing applied retaliatory sanctions against the EU earlier this week.Among those sanctioned on Friday by China were nine UK individuals and four entities including chairman of the foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat and other MPs and scholars, the Chinese foreign ministry said.Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith and the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission have been sanctioned because they “maliciously spread lies and disinformation”.Four entities named by Beijing were the China Research Group, Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers, a London-based law firm.The tit-for-tat sanctions mean that the targeted individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering Chinese territory, the ministry said, adding that Chinese citizens and institutions will also be prohibited from doing business with them.“China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not to go further down the wrong path,” the ministry said. “Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions.”Activists and UN rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang where they have allegedly been tortured and forced into labour among other violations of human rights.China, repeatedly denying all accusations of abuse, says camps are for vocational training and deradicalisation.Beijing has also said the inmates have been released from the camps.Access to the Xinjiang camps is strictly restricted, making it impossible to independently verify whether all the camps have closed.Earlier this week, Beijing sanctioned 10 individuals including EU lawmakers and four entities for harming “…China’s sovereignty and interests and maliciously spread lies and disinformation”.“It (the EU) must stop lecturing others on human rights and interfering in their internal affairs. It must end the hypocritical practice of double standards and stop going further down the wrong path. Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions,” the Chinese statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-retaliatory-move-china-now-sanctions-uk-entities-lawmakers-101616758108999.html
26-03-2021||World||Dominion Voting sues Fox News for $1.6 billion over 2020 US election claims||Dominion Voting Systems on Friday filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, arguing the cable news giant falsely claimed in an effort to boost faltering ratings that the voting company had rigged the 2020 election.It's the first defamation suit filed against a media outlet by the voting company, which was a target of misleading, false and bizarre claims spread by President Donald Trump and his allies in the aftermath of Trump's election loss to Joe Biden. Those claims helped spur on rioters who stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6 in a violent siege that left five people dead, including a police officer. The siege led to Trump's historic second impeachment.Dominion argues that Fox News, which amplified inaccurate assertions that Dominion altered votes, “sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process,” according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The Associated Press.Some Fox News on-air reporting segments have debunked some of the claims targeting Dominion.There was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, a fact that a range of election officials across the country — and even Trump's attorney general, William Barr — have confirmed. Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, key battleground states crucial to Biden’s victory, also vouched for the integrity of the elections in their states. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies were dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, which has three Trump-nominated justices.Still, some Fox News employees elevated false charges that Dominion had changed votes through algorithms in its voting machines that had been created in Venezuela to rig elections for the late dictator Hugo Chavez. On-air personalities brought on Trump allies Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, who spread the claims, and then amplified those claims on Fox News’ massive social media platforms.Dominion said in the lawsuit that it tried repeatedly to set the record straight but was ignored by Fox News.The company argues that Fox News, a network that features several pro-Trump personalities, pushed the false claims to explain away the former president's loss. The cable giant lost viewers after the election and was seen by some Trump supporters as not being supportive enough of the Republican.Attorneys for Dominion said Fox News’ behavior differs greatly from that of other media outlets that reported on the claims.“This was a conscious, knowing business decision to endorse and repeat and broadcast these lies in order to keep its viewership,” said attorney Justin Nelson, of Susman Godfrey LLC.Though Dominion serves 28 states, until the 2020 election it had been largely unknown outside the election community. It is now widely targeted in conservative circles, seen by millions of people as one of the main villains in a fictional tale in which Democrats nationwide conspired to steal votes from Trump, the lawsuit said.Dominion’s employees, from its software engineers to its founder, have been harassed. Some received death threats. And the company has suffered “enormous and irreparable economic harm," lawyers said.Dominion has also sued Giuliani, Powell and the CEO of Minnesota-based MyPillow over the claims. A rival technology company, Smartmatic USA, also sued Fox News over election claims. Unlike Dominion, Smartmatic’s participation in the 2020 election was restricted to Los Angeles County.Dominion lawyers said they have not yet filed lawsuits against specific media personalities at Fox News but the door remains open. Some at Fox News knew the claims were false but their comments were drowned out, lawyers said.“The buck stops with Fox on this,” attorney Stephen Shackelford said. “Fox chose to put this on all of its many platforms. They rebroadcast, republished it on social media and other places.”The suit was filed in Delaware, where both companies are incorporated, though Fox News is headquartered in New York and Dominion is based in Denver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dominion-voting-sues-fox-news-for-1-6-billion-over-2020-election-claims-101616757466651.html
26-03-2021||World||Explained: North Korean missiles getting more agile, evasive||In resuming its ballistic testing activity after a yearlong pause, North Korea has demonstrated a potentially nuclear-capable weapon that shows how it continues to expand its military capabilities amid a stalemate in diplomacy with the United States.The two short-range missiles the North fired into the sea this week were its first meaningful provocation since the inauguration of President Joe Biden, who on Thursday delivered a restrained response to the launches, saying “there will be responses if they choose to escalate.”Since a provocative run in North Korean nuclear and missile tests in 2016 and 2017, much of the US focus has been on North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missiles that pose a direct threat to the American homeland.But experts say North Korea’s growing arsenal of shorter-range solid-fuel weapons are more destabilizing for U. allies South Korea and Japan. And the latest launches underscored the North’s efforts to improve its capacities for delivering nuclear strikes and overwhelming missile defense systems.The MissileNorth Korea’s state media said Friday the weapons it fired a day earlier from its eastern coast were a new type of "tactical guided projectile” that borrowed the core technology of an earlier system.According to the Korean Central News Agency, the new solid-fuel missiles, which are designed to be fired from land vehicles, could be armed with warheads weighing as much as 2.5 tons. During Thursday’s tests, the missiles demonstrated low-altitude, maneuverable flight and accurately hit a sea target 600 kilometers (372 miles) away.Analysts say the North likely tested an upgraded version of a system modeled after Russia’s Iskander mobile ballistic missiles. Their flatter trajectories compared to conventional ballistic weapons make them fly at an altitude where air is dense enough to allow for maneuverability. The unpredictability makes them harder to be intercepted by missile defense systems, experts say.South Korea’s military took an unusually long time to release its assessment on the launches Thursday before it said hours later that the missiles traveled as far as 450 kilometers (279 miles).Kim Dong-yub, a professor from Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies, said the discrepancy between the South Korean and North Korean assessments possibly shows how difficult it is for radar systems to accurately track these missiles during flight.“Even if our military got things wrong, it doesn’t matter for now as they could easily adjust their assessment after analyzing satellite data,” said Kim, a former South Korean military official. “But how are you going to do that in times of war?”The WarheadWhether missiles traveled 450 kilometers or 600 kilometers, that’s more than enough range to hit any corner of mainland South Korea. And experts say the North’s efforts to arm them with huge warheads indicate they are being designed for nuclear strikes.The tests came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a January ruling party congress vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of US-led sanctions and pressure and issued a broad wish list of military hardware that included new tactical nuclear weapons.If North Korea successfully develops an operational system, these missiles will provide an ability to launch tactical nuclear attacks on military bases and other strategic targets in South Korea, said Yang Wook, a military expert who teaches at South Korea’s Hannam University.“We have long said it would be difficult for North Korea to put nuclear warheads on (short-range) missiles if it fails to make them small and light enough,” said Yang. But North Korea would no longer have to do so if its missiles could reliably deliver a warhead of 2.5 tons, which Yang said would be more than three times heavier than most warheads on existing North Korean missiles.Lee Choon Geun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said the missiles would pose a huge threat for South Korea even if they are conventionally armed.“A conventional warhead of 2.5 tons would be enough to bust deeply built bunkers,” he said. “That capacity would also allow for something more powerful than tactical nuclear weapons, possibly thermonuclear devices.”More TestingNorth Korea has a history of testing new US administrations with weapons demonstrations aimed at forcing the Americans back to the negotiating table.Kim Jong Un so far has nothing to show for his ambitious summits with former President Donald Trump, which collapsed in 2019 over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s disarmament steps.While Thursday’s launches were less provocative compared to the nuclear and ICBM tests in 2017 that inspired war fears before the North shifted toward diplomacy with the Trump administration in 2018, most experts say the North is likely to dial up its testing activities.The North conducted more than a dozen short-range launches amid stalled diplomacy in 2019 and 2020 as Trump dismissed the tests despite the threat they posed to South Korea and Japan. The United States stations a total of 80,000 troops in the two Asian countries, the core of America’s military presence in the Asia-Pacific region.“These missiles are no joke because it seems pretty clear they’re aiming to mount nuclear warheads,” and evade missile defense systems, said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security.She said the nature of these missiles would require US and South Korea to develop an effective response by returning to their normal scale and scope of joint military exercises, which have been downsized under the Trump administration to make room for diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-north-korean-missiles-getting-more-agile-evasive-101616756256586.html
26-03-2021||World||How to dislodge a 200,000-ton ship from a canal wall||When you can’t shift a ship that’s stuck fast into the wall of a canal that’s vital to world trade, there’s only one thing to do: call the salvage guys.The Ever Given container ship -- a 200,000-ton behemoth -- has been blocking what is arguably the world’s most important waterway, the Suez Canal, since Tuesday morning.The struggle to dislodge it is now turning the world’s attention to the work of SMIT Salvage, a legendary Dutch firm whose employees parachute themselves from one ship wreckage to the next, saving vessels often during violent storms. The company is synonymous with some of the most daring naval salvages, including lifting a sunken Russian nuclear submarine in 2001, and removing fuel from inside the Costa Concordia cruise ship after it ran aground in Italy in 2012.SMIT, a unit of Royal Boskalis Westminster NV, is one of the companies appointed by Ever Given’s owner to help move the vessel. The first job will be to work out exactly how entrenched in the wall the ship is, said Boskalis spokesman Martijn Schuttevaer.“It will be critical to inspect the vessel and how deeply it is lodged in the embankment,” Schuttevaer said. “The question is how solidly she has been grounded.”The answer to that question will dictate what comes next. The salvors could have to find a way to lighten the vessel’s enormous weight so that it can be pulled to a less obstructive position. At the moment, it’s blocking the path of more than 100 vessels.The canal handles something like 10% of seaborne trade, spanning everything from finished goods to oil, gas, and dry-bulk commodities. And those cargoes aren’t flowing while the Ever Given is stuck.The process of making the ship lighter means removing things like the ballast water, which helps keep ships steady when they’re at sea. Fuel will probably have to be unloaded too, Schuttavaer said.In a worst-case scenario, it could be that some of the carrier’s containers -- usually filled with everything from furniture to televisions -- may have to be taken off. How long that process lasts would depend on how much equipment is around to do the heavy lifting. It can often involve flying in helicopters to remove the crates one by one.SMIT was due to fly an 8-person team in at dawn Thursday local time to board and inspect the vessel and the grounding. A big part of the initial underwater assessment is how much the banks slope at that point in the canal. Japan’s Nippon Salvage Co. has also been hired to assist in the re-floating, according to a person familiar with the matter.Such teams are usually led by a salvage master, often a former captain or someone with knowledge of the industry, but can also include divers, welders and crane operators, according to Joseph Farrell III, director of business development at Resolve Marine, another company that offers salvage services. He declined to comment specifically on the Ever Given.Stern TestPictures now seen across the globe of the vessel spread fully across the canal, point to the first major hurdle. It ran aground both at the front and at the back, almost perpendicular to the canal walls. That’s leaving very little room to simply tow it away from either end, SMIT says.For now, the focus is on dredging around the vessel. The canal authority has dispatched two of its dredgers, the Mashor and the 10th of Ramadan, to remove sand from underwater before rescuers attempt to pull it. From the shore, excavators are also working around the vessel. Western shipping experts who analysed photos of the Ever Given calculated that her protruding bulb was as much as 5 meters buried into the canal wall.Not everything in the grounding has been bad news. One thing that’s likely to make the process easier is that the ship has gotten itself stuck in sand, rather than rock. More malleable material around the Ever Given should make for a slightly smoother escape.There are already tug boats around the ship working to help with its removal, but with such a giant vessel, bigger ones with more horsepower are usually needed. Crews are hoping that periods of higher tide over the next few days will be conducive to helping free the Ever Given.Until then, the world’s commodity and maritime markets -- and the world trade they serve -- will be left hanging, waiting on the professionals to help shift a 200,000-ton ship.“There’s only a few companies in the world that do what we do,” said Farrell. “It’s a challenge, the container ships are always the biggest jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-to-dislodge-a-200-000-ton-ship-from-a-canal-wall-101616755893329.html
26-03-2021||World||Amazon denies reports of workers urinating in bottles, ‘heckles’ US senators||E-commerce giant Amazon has resorted to a combative tone on social media to defend the allegations of poor working conditions and exploitation of loopholes in the tax system. Amazon News, which describes itself as an official Twitter account for news about the e-commerce firm, pushed back against claims made in several media reports about workers urinating in plastic bottles to save time for meeting the targets.According to a Business Insider report, Amazon imposes strict time breaks and targets for warehouse workers and issues warning to those who don’t meet the goals or take extended breaks. English journalist James Bloodworth, who worked undercover at Amazon, has also documented the working condition in his book titled ‘Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain’. “I was the person who found the pee in the bottle. Trust me, it happened,” tweeted Bloodworth.It started with a tweet from an Amazon executive, Dave Clark, taking a jibe at Vermont senator Bernie Sanders’ plan to meet the company’s workers in Alabama who are attempting to unionise. Clark said that he welcomes Sanders to Birmingham, a city in Alabama, and appreciates his push for a progressive workplace, however, he suggested that the senator himself has failed to deliver progressive legislation.“I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace,” tweeted Clark. The Amazon executive then highlighted the company’s minimum wage policy of $15 per hour, something the Democrats, including US President Joe Biden, have been pushing for.Wisconsin congressman Mark Pocan said that paying workers $15 an hour doesn't make the company a progressive workplace when “you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles”. “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one,” Amazon News replied to Pocan’s tweet.1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one.The reply has so far received around 3000 likes and has been quote-tweeted at least 15,000 times. According to dictionary.com, when replies to a tweet vastly outnumber likes or retweets, it’s called “getting ratioed” in Twitterverse. It means people are objecting to the tweet and considering its content bad, often indicating a PR disaster for companies.In another Twitter fight, when Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren posted a video of her discussing the tax system and talking about a bill to make the “most profitable companies pay a fair share”, Amazon News replied saying the company doesn’t make the law and “just follow them”. It also asked Warren to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour while she’s “working on changing the tax code”.“I didn’t write the loopholes you exploit, @amazon – your armies of lawyers and lobbyists did. But you bet I’ll fight to make you pay your fair share. And fight your union-busting. And fight to break up Big Tech so you’re not powerful enough to heckle senators with snotty tweets,” replied Warren.I didn’t write the loopholes you exploit, @amazon – your armies of lawyers and lobbyists did.

26-03-2021||World||US Supreme Court weighs taking up major gun rights case||The US Supreme Court on Friday will discuss taking up a major new gun rights case involving a National Rifle Association-backed challenge to a New York state law that restricts the ability of residents to carry concealed handguns in public.The nine justices will discuss the case at their private weekly conference at a time of heightened concern about gun violence in the United States following a pair of mass shootings in a span of a week, one in Georgia and the other in Colorado, that killed a total of 18 people.Two gun owners and the New York affiliate of the NRA, an influential gun rights group closely aligned with Republicans, are asking the justices to hear an appeal of a lower court ruling throwing out their challenge to a policy that requires a state resident to show "proper cause" to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun outside the home.Lower courts rejected the argument made by plaintiffs that the restrictions violated the US Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.The court is not expected to announce whether it will take action on the appeal until Monday at the earliest.If the justices do eventually take up the case and hear oral arguments, they would once again step into a swirling debate over gun rights in a nation that has a gun fatality rate consistently higher than other rich countries.Democratic President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged the Senate to approve two bills passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on March 11 that would broaden background checks on gun buyers. Biden also called for a national ban on assault-style weapons, while the White House said he is considering executive actions to address gun violence that would not require the approval of Congress.Numerous mass shootings in the United States have failed to spur the US. Congress to pass gun control legislation sought by Democrats, thanks in large part to opposition from congressional Republicans and the NRA.The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority is seen as holding an expansive view of Second Amendment rights.The New York case, if accepted, could lead to the most consequential ruling on the scope of the Second Amendment in more than a decade. The court in a landmark 2008 ruling recognized for the first time an individual's right to keep guns at home for self-defense, and in 2010 applied that right to the states.The plaintiffs in the New York case are asking for that right to be extended beyond the home. A ruling against New York could force lower courts to cast a skeptical eye on new or existing gun control laws.Under New York's law on carrying concealed handguns, a resident may obtain licenses that are restricted to hunting and target practice, or if they hold certain jobs such as a bank messenger or correctional officer. But to carry a concealed handgun without restriction, an applicant must convince a firearms licensing officer of an actual - rather than merely speculative - need for self-defense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-weighs-taking-up-major-gun-rights-case-101616755132827.html

It's the biggest genocide in our history," Lula told Germany's Der Spiegel weekly, adding that Bolsonaro had lied to the Brazilian people about the pandemic."We must save Brazil from Covid-19," the former president added, saying that "Brazil will not withstand it if this man continues to govern in this way".As Brazil surpassed 300,000 deaths from the virus on Wednesday, Lula called on Bolsonaro to apologise to the families of victims.More than 12 million people in total have been infected in Brazil, including the virus-sceptical far-right President Bolsonaro.The country has seen record daily infections in the last week and thousands of deaths per day, blamed on a local variant of the virus that is believed to be more contagious.Lula, 75, led Brazil through an economic boom from 2003 to 2010 as head of the left-wing Workers' Party before being sentenced to a total of 26 years in prison on charges of taking bribes in 2017.After the corruption conviction against him was annulled earlier this month, recent opinion polls suggest that he is the best-placed politician to challenge far-right incumbent Bolsonaro in next year's elections.Brazil's supreme court ruled Tuesday that the former president had been convicted by a "biased" judge.In the interview published Friday, Lula claimed that the conviction was the result of a "pact between the judiciary and some parts of the media" in order to remove his successor and party colleague Dilma Rousseff from office and prevent him from running in the 2018 elections.Asked whether he would run against Bolsonaro in 2022, the former president said that it was not the time to talk about candidacies."Our attention should be focused not on the election, but on fighting the virus and vaccinating the public," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-covid-deaths-biggest-genocide-in-our-history-former-prez-lula-da-silva-101616754360202.html
26-03-2021||World||UK MPs vote to extend emergency Covid laws until September||British lawmakers have voted unanimously to extend the emergency legislation for lockdown measures to control the spread of coronavirus for another six months, until September.In a House of Commons vote on Thursday night, the Coronavirus Act 2020 was passed by 484 votes to 76, a majority of 408.An expected rebellion within the ruling Conservative Party ranks saw 36 Tory backbenchers vote against the government legislation in opposition of the continuing curbs on freedoms and 21 Labour MPs as well as the Liberal Democrats also voted against the extension."I cannot answer whether we will be retiring it in six months. My preference would be yes, but given the last year, I think a prediction would be hasty," UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs ahead of the vote on the emergency powers, which must be reviewed every six months by law.The minister said that 12 provisions in the legislation were no longer needed because of progress that had been made in dealing with the deadly virus. These include easing some responsibilities on the social care sector, laws governing the retention of biometric data for health and security purposes, and obligations on businesses that work in the food supply chain."Although this act remains essential and there are elements of it which we are seeking the renewal of, we have always said we will only retain powers as long as they are necessary," he said.The act was described as "draconian" by several MPs ahead of the vote, with Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, dubbing it "excessive and disproportionate"."The libertarian in me is also trying to protect people's fundamental right to life and their ability to live their lives normally,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said ahead of the vote.“And the only way really to restore that for everybody is for us to beat the disease and the best path to freedom is down the cautious but irreversible road map that we've set out – that's what the freedom lover wants," he said.As part of the Commons vote this week, MPs also approved the regulations underpinning the steps to ease restrictions from March 29 – as laid out in Johnson’s “roadmap” out of lockdown.The Coronavirus Act had been fast-tracked through Parliament back in March last year to bring in emergency powers to respond to the pandemic as the UK went into its first stay-at-home lockdown.The government has said that while the legal extension runs until September, it hopes to be able to lift most restrictions on gatherings and travel by June 21 as part of its roadmap.The special powers under the Act include allowing the emergency registration of healthcare professionals such as nurses, the power to temporarily close schools and prevent tenants from being evicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mps-vote-to-extend-emergency-covid-laws-until-september-101616752678771.html

26-03-2021||World||Indian-American Dr Vivek Murthy sworn in as US Surgeon General||Indian-American physician Vivek Murthy has been sworn in as the 21st Surgeon General of the US, a role in which his top priority would be to end the coronavirus pandemic that has severely hit the country and be a voice for science.“Honoured to be sworn in as your Surgeon General. I owe this day to my family who has guided & supported me every step of the way,” Dr Murthy, 43, said on Thursday soon after being sworn in as the top doctor of the country by Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra.He has occupied the position of America’s Surgeon General for the second time. In 2011, president Barack Obama tapped him to serve on the advisory group on prevention, health promotion, and integrative and public health.“I stand ready to work with you to end this pandemic & build a world where good health is within everyone’s grasp,” he said.“Ready to take on this position as the Nation’s Doctor to help end this pandemic, be a voice for science, & support our nation on its path to rebuilding and healing,” said Dr Murthy, who now is the highest ranking Indian-American in the Biden administration.Covid-19 has taken the lives of several members of Murthy's extended family. During his confirmation hearing in February, he said that seven of his family members in India and America have died due to the virus.A day earlier Murthy was confirmed by the Senate by 57-43 votes.As US Surgeon General, Murthy will advise President Biden on the coronavirus pandemic and will be the federal government’s leading voice on public health.In 2013, Obama nominated Dr Murthy to be the Surgeon General. He was the youngest ever to hold the office at the age of 37. However, he had to abruptly leave the position during the Trump administration.During his previous tenure as 19th Surgeon General, Dr Murthy has created initiatives to tackle America’s most pressing public health challenges.As “America's Doctor he helped lead the national response to a range of health challenges, including the Ebola and Zika viruses, the opioid crisis, and the growing threat of stress and loneliness to Americans' physical and mental wellbeing.He also issued the first Surgeons General’s report on Alcohol, Drugs and Health, in which he challenged the nation to expand access to prevention and treatment and to recognise addiction as a chronic illness, not a character flaw. Dr Murthy continued the office’s legacy on preventing tobacco-related disease, releasing a historic Surgeon General’s report on e-cigarettes and youth.Prior to his tenure as Surgeon General, Dr Murthy co-founded VISIONS, a global HIV/AIDS education organization; the Swasthya Project, a rural health partnership that trained women in South India to become community health workers and educators; TrialNetworks, a technology company dedicated to improving collaboration and efficiency in clinical trials; and Doctors for America, a nonprofit mobilising physicians and medical students to improve access to affordable care.His scientific research has focused on vaccine development and the participation of women and minorities in clinical trials. As an internal medicine doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and at Harvard Medical School, Dr Murthy cared for thousands of patients over the years and trained undergraduates, medical students, and medical residents.Raised in Miami, Dr Murthy received his bachelor of arts degree from Harvard, his masters in business administration from the Yale School of Management, and his MD from the Yale School of Medicine.Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said that Dr Murty is an exceptionally talented, experienced, and compassionate leader who will continue guiding our country forward in our efforts to finally defeat this virus and tackle the many public health crises the country faces — from an epidemic of gun violence to environmental injustice.Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus chair Congresswoman Judy Chu said that it is significant that Dr Murthy will be one of the top Asian Americans in federal government at a moment when Asian American and Pacific Islanders communities are being disproportionately impacted by both the coronavirus as well as surging anti-Asian discrimination and violence.“During this critical time, it is significant to have a Surgeon General who understands these differences between communities and the need to target help where it is most needed in culturally and linguistically competent ways. I applaud President Biden for elevating such a qualified public health expert as Dr Murthy and for his commitment to building a diverse federal workforce that more closely resembles the country we serve,“ she said.The US has the highest coronavirus case tally in the world at 30,079,283 and the highest death toll at 546,822.Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance and some 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed their doors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-dr-vivek-murthy-sworn-in-as-us-surgeon-general-101616752044656.html
26-03-2021||World||At least 5 dead after tornado cluster sweeps through US' Alabama, Georgia||Blaring tornado sirens and howling winds roared across parts of western Georgia early Friday as severe storms pounded southern states, including in Alabama where at least five people died in twisters that wrecked homes, splintered trees and crumpled businesses.Meteorologists said a large, dangerous tornado swept through metro Atlanta's Coweta County around midnight Friday, sparking a tornado emergency for the city of Newnan and surrounding communities. There were several reports of downed trees and power lines.Newnan police asked residents to “get off the roads” in a Facebook post, explaining that emergency officials were surveying the area. Newnan Utilities said the storm knocked out its phone and internet services but that they were “fully aware of downed lines, gas leaks and many impassable roads.”Coweta County said its public schools would be closed Friday due to the extensive damage.Newnan Mayor Keith Brady said no fatalities were immediately reported.The strong storm followed a series of tornadoes that ripped through Alabama on Thursday, including one that authorities said travelled roughly 100 miles (160 kilometres) across the state.Check out this incredible drone footage of a violent, wedge tornado in Ashby, Alabama on Thursday! #ALwx #Tornado #TornadoWarning #dronephotography pic.twitter.com/h1Hw6Rcai0Significant damage in Pelham. And this is just one house. #alabamatornado @WVTM13 pic.twitter.com/QdCP1RybNqIn east Alabama, Calhoun County Sheriff Matthew Wade said five people died in a twister that cut a diagonal path across the county, striking mostly rural areas — something that likely kept the death toll from being higher.“Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go to the families, and we are going to do our best to let them know we love them,” Wade said at an evening briefing.Multiple twisters sprang from a “supercell” of storms, said John De Block, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Birmingham.Vast areas of Shelby County near Birmingham — the state’s biggest city — were badly damaged.In the city of Pelham, James Dunaway said he initially ignored the tornado warning when it came over his phone. But then he heard the twister approaching, left the upstairs bedroom where he had been watching television and entered a hallway — just before the storm blew off the roof and sides of his house. His bedroom was left fully exposed.“I’m very lucky to be alive,” Dunaway, 75, told Al.com.Firefighters outside a flattened home in the Eagle Point subdivision, also in Shelby County, said the family that lived there made it out alive. Nearby homes were roofless or missing their second stories.Farther west in the city of Centreville, south of Tuscaloosa, Cindy Smitherman and her family and neighbours huddled in their underground storm pit as a twister passed over their home.A tree fell on the shelter door, trapping the eight inside for about 20 minutes until someone came with a chain saw to help free them, said Smitherman, 62. The twister downed trees, overturned cars and destroyed a workshop on the property.“I’m just glad we’re alive,” she said. “Praise the Lord.”Centreville Mayor Mike Oakley told ABC 33/40 news that a local airport was hit. “We have aeroplanes torn apart like toys. We’ve got homes along here that are totally destroyed, trees down, power lines down. It’s pretty devastating.”As many as eight tornadoes might have hit Alabama on Thursday, De Block said. He said investigation teams will review eight suspected tornado tracks, and the final twister number will depend on if any of those tracks can be connected.First lady Jill Biden postponed a trip to Birmingham and Jasper, Alabama, that she had planned for Friday because of the severe weather, her office said in a news release.“Thinking of everyone in Alabama and all of those impacted by the severe weather across the South tonight. My prayers are with the grieving families. Please stay safe,” Biden tweeted late Thursday.Earlier, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey issued an emergency declaration for 46 counties, and officials opened shelters in and around Birmingham.Other parts of the southern U.S. were also affected, with dangerous thunderstorms and flooding concerns for parts of Tennessee, Kentucky and the Carolinas.In addition to deaths in Alabama, Mississippi had a storm-related death on Wednesday. Ester Jarrell, 62, died in that state’s Wilkinson County when a large tree toppled over onto her mobile home after heavy rain soaked the ground, an official told AP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-at-least-5-dead-after-tornado-cluster-sweeps-through-alabama-georgia-101616749117589.html
26-03-2021||World||Pakistan govt to buy 7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from China: Minister||Pakistan is planning to buy 7 million doses of the coronavirus vaccines from China as the nation is experiencing a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, a top minister has said, its first purchase from any country.Earlier, Pakistan has said that it is not planning to buy vaccines anytime soon as it aims to tackle the Covid-19 challenge through herd immunity and donated vaccines from friendly countries like China.Herd immunity occurs when a large number of people, usually 70 to 90 per cent, become immune to a contagious disease after being infected to it.Planning Minister Asad Umar, who also heads the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) – on Thursday said that the first consignment would arrive in Pakistan before the end of this month.“We are in the process to procure Sinopharm and CanSino from China. Two batches of the vaccines, including 1 million doses of Sinopharm vaccine, will reach Pakistan by the end of this month,” Umar said.He said the government was planning to bring more people into the vaccination drive by including those over the age of 50 years from next month. Earlier, only health workers and those above 60 years of age were being vaccinated.Pakistan launched its vaccination drive on February 2 with the frontline health workers which was expanded on March 10 when people of 60 were included. But the country has faced problems in getting enough vaccines to include everyone.The country aims to vaccinate 70 million people this year.Pakistan is also endeavouring to procure vaccines from other sources, including the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) – a global initiative for equitable access to the vaccines led by Unicef, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others.Last year, Gavi had announced to provide 17 million doses to Pakistan in March. However, as the pandemic escalated worldwide, Europe’s own production could not meet the requirement of its own population and the doses could not reach Pakistan.Initially, China donated 500,000 doses of Sinopharm on February 1. In March, Pakistan received the second shipment of half a million doses of vaccines donated by China.Meanwhile, the virus is spreading rapidly and Pakistan has recorded 10.3 per cent positivity, the second time when positivity crossed double digits this week, according to the ministry of National Health Services.For the first time in eight months, Pakistan reported over 4,000 coronavirus cases on Friday as the third wave of Covid-19 intensified.The country has recorded 645,356 coronavirus cases. The death toll climbed to 14,091 after 63 more people died in the last one day. On the positive side, the recovery rate is good and so fat 591,145 people recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-govt-to-buy-7-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-from-china-minister-101616747691699.html
26-03-2021||World||North Korea confirms missile tests as US Prez Joe Biden warns of response||North Korea on Friday confirmed it had tested a new guided missile, as President Joe Biden warned of consequences if Pyongyang escalates tensions amid stalled nuclear negotiations.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said the two “new-type tactical guided projectiles” accurately hit the target off the eastern coast on Thursday. Photos on the website of the North’s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed a missile lifting off from a transport erector launcher amid bright flames.KCNA quoted top official Ri Pyong Chol, who supervised the test, as saying that the new weapon’s development “is of great significance in bolstering up the military power of the country and deterring all sorts of military threats existing on the Korean Peninsula.”Japanese officials said both weapons tested Thursday were ballistic missiles, which are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions. According to South Korean officials, North Korea fired two other missiles on Sunday but they were likely cruise missiles, which are not banned.The test-firings were the North’s first major provocation since Biden took office in January. Some experts say North Korea aimed to apply pressure on the Biden administration to boost its leverage in future talks.“We’re consulting with our allies and partners,” Biden told a news conference Thursday. “And there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly. But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.”The United States has asked for a meeting of the UN Security Council committee that monitors sanctions against North Korea, and it’s set to take place Friday morning behind closed doors. The committee includes representatives from all 15 nations on the council.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who’s pursuing better ties with North Korea, issued a rare criticism of Pyongyang on Friday over the launches.“I know very well our people have big worries about North Korea’s missile launches yesterday,” Moon said during a military ceremony. “Now is time for South and North Korea and the United States to make efforts to (resume) talks. An act that hampers the dialogue mood is not desirable at all.”US-North Korea talks on curbing the North’s nuclear ambitions have been in a limbo for about two years due to disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. In January, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he would expand his weapons arsenal and build up his country’s military capability to cope with what he called American hostility.KCNA said the new weapon’s warhead weight has been improved to 2.5 tons (5,510 pounds). It said Thursday’s test also confirmed the reliability of the improved version of the weapon’s solid fuel engine, which would boost missile mobility, and of its low-altitude, maneuverable flight.South Korean observers said the weapon is likely an upgraded North Korean version of the Russian-made Iskander, a short-range nuclear-capable missile designed to fly at a low altitude and make in-flight guidance adjustments. They said it has a better chance of evading missile defense systems in South Korea.Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said Friday the North Korean weapon is a new type of ballistic missile that was shown during a military parade in Pyongyang in January. Kishi said Japan would strengthen its missile defense system to “ensure peace and safety.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-missile-tests-as-us-prez-joe-biden-warns-of-response-101616747801193.html

Most, including Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, remain detained.The army's seizure of power halted the Southeast Asian nation’s move toward democracy that began when Suu Kyi’s party took office in 2016 for its first term, after more than five decades of military rule.The movement against the junta and its takeover received a major boost Thursday when the United States and Britain announced tough sanctions against two military-owned conglomerates with vast holdings in many sectors.The U.S. Treasury Department said its action against Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation Limited targets the army’s control of large parts of the country’s economy, “which is a vital financial lifeline for the military junta.”The sanctions against the two companies and their holdings block access to any property they control in the United States and effectively bars any U.S. person or company from conducting any sort of business with them, including supplying them with funds or providing goods or services.Myanmar’s home-grown “Civil Disobedience Movement” against military rule is targeting the economy in order to make it difficult for the junta to govern. It has advocated work stoppages by state enterprise workers, bank closures and disinvestment by foreign companies.Myanmar’s economy is already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which surged there in the second half of last year.The World Bank, in a Asia-wide review released Friday, forecast that Myanmar’s economy will contract by 10% in 2021 after growing a meager 1.7% in 2020 and 6.8% in 2019.Anti-coup protests continued Friday in cities and towns across Myanmar, despite the threat of lethal force by the security forces. Reports on social media of casualties caused by the security forces could not immediately be confirmed.At about 4 a.m. Friday, unidentified people tossed firebombs at the headquarters of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party in Yangon, but nearby residents managed to put out the fire before it could cause any major damage.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners described a typical deadly confrontation Thursday in Taunggyi, in Shan State in eastern Myanmar, when “the junta used live ammunition, trying to create a combat zone of residential areas, resulting in four civilians shot and killed, one dead body was dragged away, some other civilians were injured.“Moreover, junta forces raided houses and violently arrested youths and civilians, thereafter destroying motorcycles, cars and barricades. They stormed streets unprovoked, shouted obscenities and vandalized property.”The Civil Disobedience Movement — CDM — which was founded largely by medical workers, has drawn plaudits for its strategy, including a nomination for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize by six social science professors at the University of Oslo in Norway.“Our nomination is a recognition of this anti-coup resistance that is working for peace and democracy through non-violent means,” said their nomination letter.Speaking for the six, Professor Kristian Stokke told The Associated Press their hope is that “the Peace Prize nomination will generate further international recognition and support for the movement and its peaceful aims and means.”A leading member of the CDM, who asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety, said the nomination “reiterates the need for the junta ... to refrain from any type of violence and peacefully and immediately transfer the power to the democratically elected leaders of the nation.”Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize for 1991 for leading a nonviolent struggle against a previous military dictatorship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protest-deaths-top-300-as-us-uk-impose-sanctions-101616746616666.html
26-03-2021||World||China slaps sanctions on UK lawmakers over Xinjiang claims||China announced retaliatory sanctions on senior British politicians including the former leader of the ruling Conservative Party for “maliciously spreading lies and disinformation” about its Xinjiang region.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced it is targeting nine individuals and four entities in the U.K. in a statement on Friday morning.The nine sanctioned individuals are former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the party’s policy adviser Neil O’Brien, chair of Parliament’s foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat, David Alton, Tim Loughton, Nusrat Ghani, Helena Kennedy, Geoffrey Nice and Joanne Nicola Smith Finley.The individuals and their relatives are banned from entering China or trading with Chinese citizens and institutions. Any assets they have in the Asian nation will also be frozen, the statement said. The four entities hit are the China Research Group of U.K. lawmakers, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uyghur Tribunal and Essex Court Chambers.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab hit back in a statement. “It speaks volumes that, while the U.K. joins the international community in sanctioning those responsible for human rights abuses, the Chinese government sanctions its critics.“If Beijing want to credibly rebut claims of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, it should allow the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights full access to verify the truth. “The Chinese Foreign Ministry said sanctions that London earlier levied on China over allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang were “based on nothing but lies and disinformation” and “grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs”.The message being sent to the U.K. and Europe is that by “siding with the U.S., they will not do themselves any good,” said Wang Yiwei, director of the Center for European Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. China’s aim is to eliminate the influence of these individuals, which removes them as stumbling blocks to future cooperation, he said.TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTakeDuncan Smith vowed to wear the sanction as a “badge of honor”, posting on Twitter that it was the duty of lawmakers to call out the Chinese government’s “human rights abuse” and “genocide”.Ghani said on Twitter she would not be “intimidated or silenced”. She told BBC radio: “This is a wake up call for all democratic countries and lawmakers that we will not be able to conduct our business without China sanctioning us for just attempting to expose what’s happening in Xinjiang and the abuse against the Uyghurs.”Earlier this week the U.K. joined the U.S., Canada and the European Union in imposing sanctions against China over alleged human rights abuses of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Western governments accuse China of interning up to 1 million Muslim Uyghurs in camps and compelling them to work, while also forcing children across the region into boarding schools.The U.S. and lawmakers in Canada and the Netherlands have labeled Beijing’s actions in the region bordering Central Asia as genocide.China dismisses the allegations, saying it is building infrastructure to boost the economy, providing jobs and educating children.Multinationals are becoming ensnared in the controversy, with Chinese social-media users calling for boycotts of Hennes & Mauritz AB and Nike Inc. for not using cotton grown in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-sanctions-on-uk-lawmakers-over-xinjiang-claims-101616747224806.html
26-03-2021||World||Strong winds resulted in grounding of MV Ever given, crew safe||MV Ever Given, the massive Japanese-owned container vessel that has created a logjam in the Suez Canal after it ran aground this week, has an all-Indian crew of 25 members who are all currently safe. The ship’s management and Egyptian officials have contended that strong winds resulted in the 200,000-tonne ship getting wedged across the canal on March 23. The blockage has affected the daily movement of goods worth an estimated $9.6 billion, according to data from Lloyd’s List. Ever Given, among the largest container vessels in the world, was sailing from China to Rotterdam when the incident occurred. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the technical manager of Ever Given, said in a statement that the vessel was transiting northbound through the canal with two canal pilots on board, and that initial investigations suggested it “grounded due to strong wind”. Also Read | Suez Canal block could hit product supply chains. Here’s why“All 25 crew are safe and accounted for. All crew are Indian nationals and remain onboard. The crew are working closely with all parties involved to re-float the vessel. The hard work and tireless professionalism of the Master and crew is greatly appreciated,” BSM said. According to the Suez Canal Authority’s official rules of navigation, a ship’s master or captain will be held responsible for any accidents while transiting through the canal. “Masters are held solely responsible for all damage or accidents of whatever kind resulting from the navigation or handling of their vessels directly or indirectly by day or night,” says the section of the rules of navigation related to pilotage. Shoei Kisen Kaisha, the Japanese owner of Ever Given, said in a separate statement that there was “no information on crew injuries caused by this accident and oil spills”. The company also apologised for “causing a great deal of concern to the vessels scheduled to sail and their related parties while navigating the Suez Canal due to the accident of this vessel”. Evergreen Marine, the Taiwanese firm that operates Ever Given, too cited the ship’s owner as confirming that the crew, vessel and cargo “are all safe, and no marine pollution has materialised”. The Taiwanese firm also indicated that all expenses related to the recovery operation and third party liabilities would have to be borne by the owner. “As the vessel is chartered, the responsibility for the expense incurred in the recovery operation; third party liability and the cost of repair (if any) is the owners,” Evergreen Marine said in a statement. BSM said its priority is to safely re-float Ever Given and ensure that marine traffic in the Suez Canal resumes. “The focus now is on dredging to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the vessel’s bow. In addition to the dredgers already on site a specialised suction dredger is now with the vessel and will shortly begin work. This dredger can shift 2,000 cubic metres of material every hour,” BSM said. Shoei Kisen Kaisha acknowledged that “the situation is extremely difficult”, while Evergreen Marine said two professional maritime rescue teams from Smit Salvage of the Netherlands and Nippon Salvage of Japan had been appointed to help free the vessel. “These teams will be working with the Captain and the Suez Canal Authority to design a more effective plan for refloating the vessel as soon as possible,” the Taiwanese shipping firm said. Earlier reports that the vessel, which is 400 metres long and 59 metres wide, had been partially refloated have proved to be incorrect. With about 12% of global trade passing through the Suez Canal, which provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe by connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, shipping firms are now considering the use of a longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa that can take a fortnight longer. About 50 merchant vessels and 1.45 million barrels of oil pass through the Suez Canal daily. Authorities are now hoping to free Ever Given at high tide during March 27-28. If this attempt fails, the next opportunity is expected to be only after a fortnight, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-winds-resulted-in-grounding-of-mv-ever-given-crew-safe-101616744307931.html
26-03-2021||World||Kenosha shooting: Jacob Blake sues officer who shot him last year||Jacob Blake Jr., the Black man from Kenosha, Wisconsin who was shot by a police officer last year and was left paralyzed from the waist down, has sued the cop who fired at him in a federal court.Blake was shot several times in the back in the presence of his young children in August, sparking several days of deadly protests against police brutality and racism in his hometown and across the country.Earlier this year, Wisconsin prosecutors cleared Rusten Sheskey, the officer involved in the shooting, saying he acted in self-defense.Blake's latest 19-page lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin sought an unspecified amount in compensation for the injuries he suffered, and "a substantial sum" in punitive damages.His lawyers also demanded to be paid for costs, legal fees, "and such other relief as is just and equitable."Blake's lawyers did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Protests erupted last summer after a viral cellphone video showed Blake walking around the front of his car with Sheskey following and opening fire after Blake opened the door.But investigators said the video was incomplete and failed to show that Blake was armed with a knife and had resisted arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-shooting-jacob-blake-sues-officer-who-shot-him-last-year-101616742216266.html
26-03-2021||World||Egypt races to free giant vessel blocking Suez Canal||A giant container ship remained stuck sideways Friday in Egypt's Suez Canal, as authorities race to free the vessel and reopen traffic in a crucial East-West waterway for global shipping.The Ever Given, a Panama-flagged ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, ran aground Tuesday in the narrow, man-made canal dividing continental Africa from the Sinai Peninsula.The ship, owned by Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, has blocked traffic in the canal, leaving dozens of smaller ships stranded in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.The vessel's bow was touching the eastern wall, while its stern appeared lodged against the western wall — an extraordinary event that experts said they had never heard of happening before in the canal's 150-year history.The ship ran aground some 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) north of the southernly mouth of the canal, near the city of Suez, an area of the canal that's a single lane.The Suez Canal Authority, which operates the waterway, has deployed several tugboats in efforts to refloat the massive vessel, including a specialised suction dredger that is able to shift 2,000 cubic metres of material every hour.As of Friday morning, the vessel remained grounded in the same position, with tugboats and dredgers still working to free it, according to Canal service provider Leth Agencies.It reminded unclear when the route would reopen.An Egyptian canal authority official called the refloating a “very sensitive and complicated” operation which needs to “be handled very carefully". They want to avoid "any complications" that could extend the canal closure. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to talk to journalists.A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specialised in salvaging, started working with the canal authority Thursday. The rescue efforts have focused on dredging to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the vessel's bow.The canal authority said late Thursday that they would need to remove between 15,000 to 20,000 cubic metres (530,000 to 706,000 cubic feet) of sand to reach a depth of 12 to 16 metres (39 to 52 feet). That depth is likely to allow the ship to float freely again, it said.It wasn't immediately clear what caused the Ever Given to become wedged on Tuesday. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, said the ship had experienced a blackout without elaborating.Evergreen Marine Corp, a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, said in a statement that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea, but that none of its containers had sunk.The Suez Canal also blamed bad weather for the incident.The blockage has caused headaches for global trade. Around 10% of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Mideast.At least 150 ships were waiting for the Ever Given to be cleared, including vessels near Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea, Port Suez on the Red Sea and those already stuck in the canal system on Egypt's Great Bitter Lake, Leth Agencies said.Using data from Automatic Identification System trackers on ships at sea, data firm Refinitiv shared an analysis with the AP showing over 300 ships remained en route to the waterway over the next two weeks.Some vessels could still change course, but the crush of ships listing the Suez Canal as their destination shows that an even-greater backlog looms for shippers already under pressure amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-races-to-free-giant-vessel-blocking-suez-canal-101616740763511.html

26-03-2021||World||China announces sanctions on Britons as UK joins EU move in Xinjiang||China on Friday announced sanctions on British individuals and entities following the UK's joining the EU and others in sanctioning Chinese officials accused of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region.A statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the move by the Western bloc was based on “nothing but lies and disinformation, flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations".Britain's ambassador to China has been summoned for a diplomatic protest, the statement said. Sanctioned individuals and groups would be barred from visiting Chinese territory and banned from having financial transactions with Chinese citizens and institutions.Nine British individuals and four institutions were placed on the sanctions list, including member of Parliament Iain Duncan Smith and the Conservative Party's Human Rights Commission. Smith is a former leader of the Conservatives.China's sanctions are the latest move in an increasingly bitter row over Xinjiang, where Beijing is accused of detaining more than 1 million members of Uyghur and other Muslim minority group engaging in forced labour and imposing coercive birth control measures.Chinese state TV called Thursday for a boycott of Swedish retail chain H&M as Beijing lashed out at foreign clothing and footwear brands following Monday's decision by the 27-nation European Union, the United States, Britain and Canada to impose travel and financial sanctions on four Chinese officials blamed for abuses in Xinjiang.“China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not go further down the wrong path. Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions," the Foreign Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-sanctions-on-britons-as-uk-joins-eu-move-in-xinjiang-101616736524965.html
26-03-2021||World||US Covid-19 cases are rising again, reversing months of progress||Covid cases in the US are rising again, reversing course after months of decline and threatening another setback in the return to normality.The seven-day average of new cases jumped to 57,695 Wednesday, 9.5% above the prior week, marking the biggest increase since Jan. 12, according to Johns Hopkins University data.While that’s a fraction of the mid-January peak, the change in direction is worrisome as states fling open their economies, variant cases multiply and the country races to vaccinate as many people as possible to stave off another wave.“We are not out of danger,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which produces influential Covid-19 projections. “We’re slowing down, and in many places going in the wrong direction.”New York case numbers reported this week by Johns Hopkins appeared artificially inflated after data lags. But that didn’t have a meaningful impact on the national trend, which is rising to roughly the same degree even without New York.“Now is not the time to let up. We have the goal in sight, we need more vaccines and we need more effective ways to get it out,” said Isaac Weisfuse, a medical epidemiologist and adjunct professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “It’s really nothing short of a tragedy for somebody to get infected and die at this stage.”An almost 10% uptick should have states reconsidering reopening plans and trying to accelerate vaccination, focusing on the hardest-hit neighborhoods, Weisfuse said. Growing pandemic fatigue among younger Americans, especially those traveling for spring break, is a significant concern, because they’re less likely to have received shots.The US has vaccinated 1 in 4 people, and last week averaged about 2.5 million doses per day, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. That’s not enough to reach herd immunity and many public-health experts fear another surge could occur before the immunization push reaches full steam. Texas, Tennessee and Alabama are among the slowest in the country, which may reflect vaccine hesitancy among Republicans, especially men.While vaccinations and waning seasonality of the coronavirus are playing to America’s advantage, that’s weighed against more-contagious variants, increasing mobility and declining mask-wearing, Mokdad said.Case declines in big states such as California, Texas and Florida have masked rises elsewhere. “We’re seeing a localized surge, but we could see it everywhere,” Mokdad said. “If we are not quick to dialing back or imposing mandates to slow down the surge, yes, we’re going to see a surge in cases.”Hospitalizations in some states also are beginning to defy the downward trend. Seven states, including New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, reported increasing average daily Covid-19 admissions for a week straight, according to a University of Minnesota analysis of data from the Department of Health and Human Services.“It’s important not to ignore changes, especially when those changes become more consistent” said Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a health-care risk management professor leading the analysis.The good news: Fewer of those hospitalizations may lead to intensive-care admissions or deaths, because the vaccination campaign has focused on elderly Americans and those most at risk, Karaca-Mandic said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-are-rising-again-reversing-months-of-progress-101616734503902.html

Reuters could not independently verify all the accounts.The killings have drawn outrage and prompted some sanctions from Western countries, including the United States. The use of lethal force against civilians had also been condemned by some Southeast Asian neighbours, which tend to be restrained in their criticism."Crimes against humanity are committed daily," said the non-profit Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) group, which has been recording the deaths as well as nearly 3,000 people arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.The group had recorded 320 deaths by March 25.Its data show at least 25 percent of those who were killed died from shots to the head, raising suspicions they were deliberately targeted for killing. Full data is not available for every death."Everything points to troops adopting shoot to kill tactics to suppress the protests," Amnesty International said earlier this month.The junta denies using excessive force and says that its actions have met international norms in the face of a situation it says is a threat to national security.Nearly 90% of the dead were male. Some 36% were aged 24 or under.The youngest victim, seven-year-old Khin Myo Chit, was shot dead in the second city of Mandalay on Tuesday. She was at her home with her father when she was killed.Win Kyi, 78, is the oldest person recorded to have been killed and was among around 50 people killed in Yangon's Hlaing Thayar district on March 14, the bloodiest day so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-300-people-killed-by-myanmar-forces-since-coup-claims-advocacy-group-101616728561138.html

The number could continue to rise as officials link more deaths to the storm that knocked out power to more than 4 million customers in Texas.Many homes went without power or drinkable water for days after subfreezing temperatures, failing power plants and record demand for heat pushed Texas' electric grid to the breaking point.Texas officials earlier this month put the initial tally of deaths at 57 but warned it would increase.The disaster has launched a congressional investigation and led to the ouster of the head of the state's embattled electric grid, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-death-toll-from-february-storm-outages-surpasses-100-101616728164278.html
26-03-2021||World||US going to hold China accountable to follow rules, says Joe Biden||The United States working with its partners and allies is going to hold China accountable to follow the rules, US President Joe Biden has said, as he referred to his recent meeting with leaders from Quad countries involving Australia, India and Japan.“Earlier this month, and apparently got the Chinese attention, that's not why did it, I met with our allies and -- how we're going to hold China accountable in the region, Australia, India, Japan, the United States, the so-called Quad, because we have to have democracies working together,” he said.Addressing his first solo news conference in the East Room of the White House on Thursday, Biden said that soon he is going to invite an alliance of democracies to come to Washington DC to “discuss the future”. “We are going to make it clear that, in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules, to follow the rules, whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or the agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things,” he asserted.The conference was attended by 30 reporters from various media outlets, including two foreign correspondents.Biden, in response to a question, said he sees stiff competition with China.“China has an overall goal -- and I don't criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That's not going to happen on my watch because the United States is going to continue to grow and expand,” he said.After becoming the 46th President of the United States on January 20, Biden has spoken with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping over the phone once. The phone call, he said, lasted for two hours.Biden said as vice president during the Obama administration, he spent hours together with Xi.“It was very, very straightforward. He doesn't have a democratic with a small D bone in his body, but he's a smart, smart guy. He's one of the guys like Putin who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future. Democracy can't function in an ever complex world,” he said.“So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were his people on the call as well as mine listening, we had a two-hour conversation, for two hours. And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I told him in person on several occasions, that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition,” he added.“Two, that we'll have strong competition but we'll insist that China play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're going to need three things to do that I'm telling our people. First, we're going to invest in American workers and American science,” the US President.Biden said he is setting up his administration to be able to do that.“The second thing we're going to do is we're going to reestablish our alliances,” he asserted.“I've been very clear with it. It's not anti-Chinese. We have talked about it.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-going-to-hold-china-accountable-to-follow-rules-says-joe-biden-101616727724545.html
26-03-2021||World||North Korea confirms missile tests as Joe Biden warns of response||North Korea on Friday confirmed it had tested a new guided missile as President Joe Biden warned of consequences if Pyongyang escalates tensions amid stalled nuclear negotiations.The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the two “new-type tactical guided projectiles” accurately hit the target off the eastern coast on Thursday. Photos on the website of the North's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed a missile lifting off from a transport erector launcher amid bright flames.KCNA quoted top official Ri Pyong Chol, who supervised the test, as saying that the new weapon's development “is of great significance in bolstering up the military power of the country and deterring all sorts of military threats existing on the Korean Peninsula.”Japanese officials said both weapons tested Thursday were ballistic missiles, which are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions. According to South Korean officials, North Korea fired two other missiles on Sunday but they were likely cruise missiles, which are not banned.The test-firings were the North's first major provocation since Biden took office in January. Some experts say North Korea aimed to apply pressure on the Biden administration to boost its leverage in future talks.“We're consulting with our allies and partners,” Biden told a news conference Thursday. “And there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly. But I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.”The United States asked for a meeting of the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea and it will take place Friday morning behind closed doors. The committee includes representatives from all 15 nations on the council.US-North Korea talks on curbing the North's nuclear ambitions have been in a limbo for about two years due to disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. In January, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he would expand his weapons arsenal and build up his country's military capability to cope with what he called American hostility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-missile-tests-as-joe-biden-warns-of-response-101616725689487.html
26-03-2021||World||EU faces major shortfall in AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines as third wave surges||EU leaders voiced frustration on Thursday over a massive shortfall in contracted deliveries of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, as a third wave of infections surged across Europe.With inoculation programmes running far behind those of Britain and the United States, the bloc's executive warned that vaccine exports by the British-Swedish company would be blocked until it delivers the shots it promised to the EU."We have to and want to explain to our European citizens that they get their fair share," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference after a video-conference summit of the European Union's leaders."The company has to catch up, has to honour the contract it has with the European member states, before it can engage again in exporting vaccines," she said.Of 300 million doses due to be delivered to EU countries by the end of June, Astrazeneca aims to deliver only 100 million.That has contributed to a stuttering start to vaccination rollouts. As of March 23, Britain had administered nearly 46 shots for every 100 people, compared with under 14 per 100 in the 27-nation bloc it left last year, according to figures compiled by website Our World In Data.This week, the European Commission unveiled plans to tighten oversight of vaccine exports. This would allow greater scope to block shipments to countries with higher inoculation rates.The EU is divided over whether to take a tougher line on vaccine exports by companies that do not meet contractual commitments. French President Emmanuel Macron made it clear he was fully behind it."It's the end of naivety," he told a news conference after the summit. "I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments with Europeans."QUARREL WITH BRITAINEurope's troubled vaccine rollout has led to a quarrel with Britain, which has imported 21 million doses made in the EU, according to an EU official. Britain says it did a better job negotiating with manufacturers and arranging supply chains.The EU says it should share more, notably to help make up the shortfall in contracted deliveries of AstraZeneca shots.Brussels and London sought to cool tensions on Wednesday, declaring they were working "to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens".Highlighting the EU's difficulties, U.S. biotech Novavax is delaying signing a contract to supply its vaccine to the bloc, an EU official told Reuters on Thursday, due to problems sourcing some raw materials.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he and other leaders hoped the stricter approach to vaccine exports would not be applied, and warned of "broader consequences" if it is.Von der Leyen, seeking to counter accusations that the EU's threat of export blocks amounted to "vaccine nationalism", presented slides showing that 77 million vaccine doses had been shipped from EU plants to over 40 countries since the start of December.She said the EU would still hit its target to have 70% of adults inoculated by the summer and noted that, although a third wave of infections was underway, mortality increases were slower than the spread of the virus due to vaccinations of the elderly.io)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-faces-major-shortfall-in-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccines-as-third-wave-surges-101616719333017.html
26-03-2021||World||'Plan to run for re-election': Joe Biden hints at 2024 campaign||President Joe Biden on Thursday said he would likely seek reelection in 2024, but the 78-year-old Democrat left open the possibility of stepping aside after one term.“My plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation,” Biden told reporters in a wide-ranging news conference, the first of his young presidency.He later pushed back against a reporter's suggestion that his 2024 plans were definite.“I said, ‘That is my expectation,’” Biden said. “I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four-and-a-half, three-and-a-half years ahead for certain."Traditionally, there is no question as to whether a first-term president will run for reelection. Former President Donald Trump, for example, announced his plans to seek reelection on his first day in office. But questions about Biden's 2024 intentions have swirled since even before his November victory — because of his age. At 78, Biden is the oldest person to assume the presidency.In office only two months, his 2024 plans have a direct effect on his political strength. If viewed as a one-term president, Biden would effectively be a lame duck with diminished sway at home and abroad as he pursues an aggressive agenda.Given a high-profile opportunity to clarify his status Thursday, he sought to create the impression he was not a lame duck, but he avoided making any definite promises.Should he run again, Biden said he “would fully expect” to choose Vice President Kamala Harris to be his running mate again. "She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner,” he said.Biden seemed exasperated when asked if he expected Trump to run on the Republican side in four years.“I don’t even think about it. I have no idea," Biden said, suggesting that Trump may not even be part of the Republican Party.It may seem early, but several Republican presidential prospects are already jockeying for position ahead of the GOP’s 2024 nomination fight.On Friday, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to deliver a speech in Iowa, which traditionally holds the nation's first presidential primary contest. Trump has teased another run, but he would be 78 himself at the beginning of the next president’s term.With a Democrat in the White House, there has been virtually no jockeying on the Democratic side so far. Harris would be the most likely successor should Biden step aside, but she would probably face competition. So soon after taking office, however, Harris' allies have taken no steps to prepare for a presidential bid of her own.Privately, many Democrats believe Biden will not seek a second term. But publicly, there's few willing to question his intentions.“He’s starting out by so far successfully improving our pandemic response both from a health perspective and economic perspective, which lays the groundwork for a successful term and reelection strategy," said Democratic strategist Josh Schwerin. “He's running.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plan-to-run-for-re-election-joe-biden-hints-at-2024-campaign-101616717349774.html
26-03-2021||World||Tech CEOs told ‘time for self-regulation is over’||The chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter appeared before Congress on Thursday to answer questions about extremism and misinformation on their services in their first appearances since pro-Trump rioters assaulted the US Capitol on January 6.Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg; Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google parent Alphabet Inc; and Twitter Inc CEO Jack Dorsey are testifying before the joint hearing by two subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Lawmakers began the hearing by criticising the social media platforms for their role in the riot and in the spread of Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.“You failed to meaningfully change after your platform has played a role in fomenting insurrection and abetting the spread of the virus and trampling American civil liberties,” said Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, chair of the Energy and Commerce committee.“Your business model itself has become the problem and the time for self-regulation is over. It’s time we legislate to hold you accountable,” he added.“The witnesses here today have demonstrated time and again that promises to self-regulate don’t work,” said Jan Schakowsky, chair of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, in an opening statement. “They must be held accountable for allowing disinformation and misinformation to spread across their platforms, infect our public discourse, and threaten our democracy.”Republicans on the panel also criticised the tech giants for what they see as efforts to stifle conservative voices.Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican, criticised the power of tech companies’ algorithms to determine what children see online.“Over 20 years ago, before we knew what Big Tech would become, Congress gave you liability protections. I want to know, why do you think you still deserve those protections today?” said McMorris Rodgers, the committee’s top Republican. “What will it take for your business model to stop harming children?”Some lawmakers are calling for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online websites from liability over user content, to be scrapped or rejigged. Some Democrats, including President Joe Biden, agree.The tech executives differ in their support for making changes to Section 230. In his prepared opening remarks, Zuckerberg said he supports making the liability protection conditional on having systems in place for removing unlawful material. Under Zuckerberg’s proposal, a third party would determine whether a company’s systems are adequate.Google’s Pichai, whose company owns the most popular internet search engine, signalled that he is opposed to any changes to the law. Reforming it or repealing it altogether “would have unintended consequences -- harming both free expression and the ability of platforms to take responsible action to protect users in the face of constantly evolving challenges,” he said in prepared testimony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tech-ceos-told-time-for-self-regulation-is-over-101616713691094.html
26-03-2021||World||Suez Canal block could hit product supply chains. Here's why||The cargo ship blocking the Suez Canal is holding up traffic that carries nearly $10 billion worth of goods every day, so a quick clearing of the logjam is key to limiting the economic fallout.Efforts continued Thursday to dislodge the Ever Given container ship and restore traffic on the critical man-made waterway that connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides a shipping shortcut between Europe and Asia.HOW VITAL IS THE CANAL TO SHIPPING?About 10% of all global trade flows through the 120-mile-long canal, which allows tankers and container ships to avoid a long trip around the southern tip of Africa.The iconic shipping journal Lloyd’s List estimates that goods worth $9.6 billion pass through the canal every day. Lloyd’s says about $5.1 billion of that traffic is westbound and $4.5 billion is eastbound.About one-fourth of that traffic is on container ships –- like the one that is currently burrowed into one side wall of the canal. Lloyd’s says more than 50 ships traverse the canal on an average day, carrying 1.2 billion tons of cargo.WHAT EFFECT WILL THIS HAVE ON SUPPLY CHAINS?When it comes to shipping goods from Asia to Europe, there are virtually no alternatives such as rail or truck transportation, said Sharat Ganapati, an economics professor at Georgetown University. The blockage will delay a range of parts and raw materials for European products such as cotton from India for clothes, petroleum from the Middle East for plastics, and auto parts from China, he said.“The fact that you have the most pivotal node in the trading network being blocked is going to have important welfare effects around the world,” said Woan Foong Wong, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.There will be less direct impact on the United States, which receives most shipments from Asia on the West Coast. Still, imports from Europe may be delayed, and the blockage will prevent empty shipping containers from being returned to Asia, adding to a container shortage caused by rising demand for consumer goods during the pandemic.“If you get a bump in one place, that is going to percolate through the system,” Ganapati said. “It is going to take a while to get things un-gummed up.”HOW WILL CONSUMERS BE AFFECTED?It's possible that US consumers will feel some impact if shipping is disrupted for more than a few days. Finished products from Asia to the United States go over the Pacific. However, some components for products that are assembled in Europe and shipped to the US could be delayed by the canal closure.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the canal blockage likely won’t have much impact on the US or global economies unless it drags on for weeks or months.It may push up oil prices, “but we are not talking dollars on the barrel, we are talking pennies on the barrel,” Zandi said.Germany's economy could suffer, though, if the blockage delays the shipment of auto parts to that company's large car manufacturers, Zandi said.And Spain, Italy, and France could see higher gas prices because they rely on oil shipments through the canal, Ganapati said.WHAT ABOUT OIL SHIPMENTS?About 1.9 million barrels of oil a day go through the canal, according to Lloyd’s. That’s about 7% of all seaborne oil. The closure could affect shipments of oil and natural gas from the Mideast to Europe. S&P Global Platts Analytics said about 1 million barrels of crude and 1.4 million barrels of gasoline and other refined products flow from the Middle East and Asia north through the canal to Europe on the average day.Jim Burkhard, who heads crude oil research at IHS Markit, said the impact on the global oil market will be limited if the canal is cleared soon. Energy demand is still weak due to the pandemic, and the Sumed pipeline has unused capacity to move oil around the canal, from one end near Alexandria, Egypt, to a terminal near the Red Sea.“If this were to last a month, there are other options — you can sail around Africa. Of course, that would add cost,” Burkhard said. “If this ship is moved in the next week, it will be a footnote in history when it comes to the oil market.”The price of benchmark international crude rose after the blockage, but prices retreated Thursday. Analysts attributed the price drop to an industry group’s report of large US inventories and concern that pandemic-related lockdowns in Europe will further dent demand for energy – outweighing concern about the stuck ship.COULD OIL-RELATED PRODUCTS BE SLOWED?Shipments of Europe-bound refined petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel also go through the canal, and they will be delayed. Burkhard said refineries in Europe could be pushed to temporarily increase production to pick up the slack, Burkhard said.Tankers using the Suez carry 8% to 10% of the world's liquefied natural gas, according to research firms. Wood Mackenzie analyst Lucas Schmitt said only a few LNG shipments were near the canal when the blockage occurred.“We don’t expect major bottlenecks unless the situation drags on,” Schmitt said. He added that the timing of the incident — it's spring, when LNG demand typically eases — means it will have less impact on prices than recent delays at the Panama Canal had. Those delays caused LNG shipping rates to surge, according to data from S&P Global Platts Analytics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-block-could-hit-product-supply-chains-here-s-why-101616709943534.html
26-03-2021||World||Man in Atlanta grocery had 6 guns, wore body armor: Police||A worker at an Atlanta grocery store heard “clicking sounds," and it sounded to him like someone was loading weapons inside a restroom stall, he told police. Then he saw an an “AR-15-style rifle" leaning against the wall.The sharp-eyed Instacart worker is getting credit for helping officers to stop the man wearing body armor and carrying a half-dozen guns from roaming through the Publix grocery store Wednesday, police said.The new details are included in police incident reports released Thursday by Atlanta police. The man's intentions are not explained in the reports.The worker, Charles Russell, “heard clicking sounds from the bathroom stall," a police report states. “It sounded to him like someone was loading firearms."Russell then alerted a manager at the store, urging him to call 911.Two Atlanta police officers arrived. One grabbed a rifle from his patrol car, put on a ballistic helmet and went into the store, where he apparently surprised the armed man as he came around the corner from the restroom.“I immediately ordered the accused to put his hands up and don't move to which he complied," the officer wrote in his report. “The accused appeared to be surprised when he saw us that close to him."Officers then arrested Rico Marley, 22, without a shot being fired.The pistols he had were loaded with rounds in chambers, and a revolver was also fully loaded, the officer wrote. He then looked inside Marley's bag and found a loaded AR-15-style rifle and a loaded shotgun, said the officer, who noted that the suspect was wearing body armor.Marley waived his initial court hearing Thursday. He’s charged with five counts of criminal attempt to commit a felony; and six counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, police said.Investigators also said Marley was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation. It’s unclear whether he had an attorney.Russell told WSB-TV that when he saw the man in the store's bathroom, he immediately thought of Tuesday's mass shooting at a King Sooper's in Boulder that left 10 people dead.“It possibly could have stopped something,” Russell told the TV station.Marley's arrest also happened days after eight people were fatally shot at three massage businesses in the Atlanta area.Police have been working to determine what exactly Marley planned to do with the arsenal. There were no reports of Marley pointing a weapon or using a weapon before authorities arrived.____Martin reported from Marietta, Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-in-atlanta-grocery-had-6-guns-wore-body-armor-police-101616709785358.html
26-03-2021||India||Bangladesh scripted new destiny 50 yrs ago: Sonia||New Delhi Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday extended her wishes to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the occasion of Bangladesh’s 50th Independence Day, saying that the year 1971 was “transformative” for India as well. “Fifty years ago, the courageous people of Bangladesh had scripted a whole new destiny for themselves and transformed both history and geography of the sub-continent,” Sonia said in a video message to the neighbouring country. “Over the past five decades, Bangladesh’s remarkable achievements in social development, community participation, economic growth and other areas have been very impressive and have received global recognition,” she added. Drawing a parallel between the developments in India and Bangladesh in 1971, Sonia maintained that the period was “as much a transformative year for India as it was for Bangladesh”, referring to the rise of former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi as a political leader as well as a statesman. “On this joyous occasion, and as someone who lived through the transformative hours, days, weeks and months of 1971 by Indira Gandhi’s side along with my husband Rajiv ji, I am personally delighted to share the pride of Sheikh Hasina and millions of her countrymen and women,” she said. Reminiscing the friendship between Indira and Bangladesh founding father ‘Bangabandu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose birth centenary was also observed on Friday, Sonia said: “We in India have always had a special relationship with the people of Bangladesh. This has been in very large measures because of the role Indira Gandhi played in the historic events of 1971.” She added that the two leaders had established “bonds of mutual respect, admiration and deep friendship”. Sonia, who was also among the invitees to Dhaka for the celebrations, couldn’t travel to Dhaka due to Covid-19 restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-scripted-new-destiny-50-yrs-ago-sonia-101616782951949.html
26-03-2021||India||Indian, Pak armies hold flag meet on ceasefire agreement||NEW DELHIThe Indian and Pakistani armies on Friday held a flag meeting in the Poonch sector to ensure that both sides uphold the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in line with the understanding reached by the two director generals of military operations last month. The two militaries last month announced that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24. Friday’s flag meet was held at the brigade commander level. “Post the DGMOs Understanding 2021, a Brigade Commander Level Flag Meeting was held between Indian and Pakistan Army at Poonch Rawalkot Crossing Point on 26 Mar 2021 to discuss implementation mechanism as per the understanding,” the Indian Army said on Twitter. “The ceasefire is holding good and the brigade-commander level flag meet was planned to ensure that both sides adhere to the understanding reached between the two DGMOs,” said a senior official. It is for the first time in about five to six years that the LoC has been silent which bodes well for the future, army chief General MM Naravane said at an event on Friday. He said three reasons behind Pakistan’s move for peace were Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sanctions, domestic compulsions and the situation on its Western border with Afghanistan. The 12 months preceding the announcement by the Indian and Pakistan militaries that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC saw the highest number of border violations by the neigbouring army since the original ceasefire agreement in November 2003. Official figures obtained by HT show that the Pakistan Army violated the ceasefire at least a dozen times daily on an average between February 2020 and February 2021 when both sides agreed to strict observance of all agreements and understandings to observe a ceasefire along the LoC. The year 2020 witnessed 4,645 violations by Pakistan on the LoC, with August and September – the first anniversary of the Centre revoking the special status of the state on August 5, 2019 – accounting for the highest number of violations for any two consecutive months in 17 years. This figure for last year stood at more than 5,100 if the violations along the international border are also counted. Data shows August and September alone accounted for 835 ceasefire violations last year. Ceasefire violations by the Pakistani Army sharply increased over the last five years – recording a 10-fold jump since 2016 when the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes against terror pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to the Pakistan-backed suicide attack on an army camp in Uri. The year 2016 accounted for 449 violations, with the numbers only rocketing in the following years – 881 (2017), 1,629 (2018) and 3,168 (2019). The unusual spike in ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army on the LoC in recent years was to help terrorist infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir to feed the terror machinery in the state and destabilise the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-pak-armies-hold-flag-meet-on-ceasefire-agreement-101616782951239.html
26-03-2021||India||PDP’s Para gave ₹5cr to Hurriyat tokeep Valley on boil: NIA charge sheet||New Delhi Peoples Democratic Party leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Para gave ₹5 crore to Hurriyat Conference to keep Kashmir on the boil after the encounter of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani, the National Investigation Agency has said in a charge sheet filed on Monday. This amount was given by Para “possibly on behalf of PDP to Hurriyat Conference for keeping the secessionist activities alive”, NIA added in the charge sheet. HT has reviewed excerpts of the charge sheet. Para was arrested on November 25 last year by the central agency after multiple rounds of questioning. In a statement issued later in the day, PDP additional spokesperson Najmu Saqib said the charges against Para were an attempt to muzzle the voices of Kashmir. “A through and through democrat who dedicated his life to strengthening the cause of the mainstream in Jammu And Kashmir, Waheed by putting his life and limb in harm’s way, is being punished for what he should’ve been appreciated for,” Saqib said.“We strongly believe that none of these frivolous charges would stand judicial scrutiny and Waheed would eventually get justice,” Saqib added.The charge sheet, which focuses on Para’s role in supporting terror and secessionist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, said “Para gave ₹5 crore in 2016 to Altaf Ahmad Shah alias Fantoosh to keep the situation boiling in Kashmir valley after the killing of HM terrorist Burhan Wani.”Funtoosh is separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s son-in-law and a member of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference. He was arrested in July 2017 in a J&K terror funding case.According to the investigation agency, Funtoosh was a close associate of Para and the two maintained contact during the turmoil in the wake of Wani’s killing. Wani, 21-year-old Hizbul commander and the poster boy of militancy in Kashmir, was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8, 2016. The encounter led to large scale stone pelting and public unrest in the Kashmir valley which went on for months. The encounter took place during the tenure of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti as the erstwhile state’s chief minister. Para has been named as accused in the supplementary charge sheet filed in NIA’s probe against suspended J&K police officer Davinder Singh, who was arrested in January 2020 for assisting HM terrorists.Elaborating on the PDP youth leader’s role in the case, NIA charge sheet said Para also gave ₹10 lakh to advocate Irfan Shafi Mir to hand over to HM terrorists, Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu. Mir and Naveed were arrested with Singh last year.In February-March 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, “Irfan Mir called Para on secure social chat platform, Signal, and made him talk to Syed Naveed Mushtaq when he was staying in the rented house of Irfan Mir in Jammu. Para talked to Syed Naveed and asked him to take care of his party workers campaigning for parliament election in Pulwama”, the NIA charge sheet said. The charge sheet also said that Para gave another ₹10 lakh to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Abu Dujana, apart from providing logistical support to LeT commander Naved Jatt. The agency, however, did not mention the year of this exchange. Jatt, who was involved in the killing of journalist Shujaat Bukhari, was gunned down by security forces in November 2018. Subsequently, the agency added “Para was also involved in gun running racket in Kupwara area in 2016”. “He used to bring weapons in his vehicle accompanied by an escort vehicle as none of the security agencies used to check it [him being a politician],” NIA said. According to NIA, Para played a crucial role in sustaining the “political-separatist-terrorist” nexus in Jammu and Kashmir apart from financing the activities of the Hizbul Mujahideen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdps-para-gave-5cr-to-hurriyat-tokeep-valley-on-boil-nia-charge-sheet-101616782890835.html
26-03-2021||India||Nikita Tomar murder: Court gives life imprisonment to both stalkers||Gurugram A fast-track court in Faridabad on Friday sentenced two men to life imprisonment and fined them ₹20,000 in the Nikita Tomar murder case that shocked the national capital region in October last year.Tauseef, who had been stalking the 21-year-old Tomar and shot her at point blank range, and his associate Rehaan were held guilty of murder, kidnapping, conspiracy and under sections of the Arms Act by additional sessions judge Sartaj Baswana on Wednesday. A large number of city residents, activists and family members of the victim packed the district court in Faridabad before the verdict was pronounced around 3.45pm. Under the Arms Act the men were given four years of imprisonment that will run concurrent with the life sentence, said Adal Singh Rawat, counsel for the victim’s family. “We will file a petition in the high court seeking death penalty for the brutal murder of Nikita. We respect the verdict of the court but after going through the judgement, we will approach the high court for justice,” said Rawat.Tomar was shot dead on October 26 outside her college in Ballabhgarh town of Faridabad by Tauseef, when he failed to abduct her along with his accomplice Rehaan, who drove the getaway car after the murder was committed, said police. The crime committed in broad daylight brought women’s safety in sharp focus and led to protests across Haryana. Faridabad police constituted a special investigation team and a charge sheet was filed within 11 days of the murder. The court sentenced the accused exactly five months after the incident.The father of the victim, Moolraj Tomar, expressed disappointment over the quantum of punishment.“We will approach the higher courts and seek death penalty for the convicts. We respect the court but will challenge the verdict,” he said. The family of the victim and its lawyers acknowledged that the speedy investigation conducted by Faridabad police and regular hearings in the fast-track court helped secure the conviction of the two accused.Sanjiv Singh Rao, senior counsel, said footage recovered from the place of occurrence and from a toll plaza nearby played a crucial role in identifying the perpetrators. “The phone call records of the accused helped in establishing that they were roaming around the college in Ballabhgarh and planning the crime for almost four days prior to the incident. The footage showed how the duo acted in tandem, helped each other and escaped after committing the grisly crime,” he said.Faridabad police on Friday preferred not to comment on the matter. A police spokesperson said the department did not want to comment on a court order. However, the Faridabad police did post a tweet saying, “Faridabad police #avengers end game for the killers of #NikitaTomar. Handed down life imprisonment for the cowardly act”.The defence counsel, however, maintained that this case did not come under the purview of capital punishment as it was not in the rarest of the rare category. “This case does not fall in the rarest of the rare category. Our submission was that the accused are medical students, have no previous convictions. The death was caused by a single bullet injury,” said Anees Khan, the defence counsel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nikita-tomar-murder-court-gives-life-imprisonment-to-both-stalkers-101616782890266.html
26-03-2021||India||Cannot be capital of illegal immigrants: Centre on plea seeks to stall Rohingya deportation||New Delhi: India cannot become “the international capital of illegal immigrants”, the Union government on Friday said in the Supreme Court while opposing a plea the seeks the release of at least 150 Rohingya refugees detained in a Jammu sub-jail and the stalling of their deportation.The government termed the Rohingya “absolutely illegal immigrants” who posed “serious threats to the national security” before a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde. The Centre also contended that the right to settle in India could not be asserted by illegal immigrants under the garb of the Constitution’s Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and liberty. The bench reserved its verdict.On March 6, on the instructions of the ministry of home affairs, the J&K administration started a verification drive of the Rohingya, and moved some of them to a holding centre, pending their potential deportation. There are close to 7,000 Rohingya refugees in J&K, numbers that have increased since the late 2000s when they first arrived in the region after escaping from Myanmar, where they were facing religious persecution. India has previously deported Rohingya refugees, and this has been a long-standing demand of the BJP in J&K.Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta submitted that a similar application to stop the deportation of Rohingya from Assam was dismissed by the top court in 2018, and that the present application must meet the same fate. “They are illegal immigrants. The continuance of the illegal immigration of Rohingyas into India and their continued stay in India, apart from being absolutely illegal is also found to be having serious national security ramifications and poses serious security threats,” the SG submitted before the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. He added that the Centre has begun the process of deporting Rohingya after receiving a confirmation from the Myanmar government regarding their nationality, and that the apex court should steer clear of the “diplomatic issue” since it fell within the exclusive domain of the Executive. Representing the J&K administration, senior advocate Harish Salve cautioned the bench against “starting a dangerous trend” by interfering with a subject related to illegal immigrants and diplomatic relations with another country. Arguing for the applicant, Mohammad Salimullah, advocate Prashant Bhushan alluded to a January 2020 judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that highlighted the persecution faced by the Rohingya in Myanmar. Bhushan said that an urgent intervention by the apex court was required since those “detained” in Jammu could at any time be deported back to Myanmar, from where they fled fearing oppression. The bench told Bhushan that it doesn’t support a genocide “of any kind anywhere” but what “happens in a foreign country is beyond our control”. “We are certain that there should be no genocide on this earth. We are not supporting genocide of any kind anywhere. But the question here is different. You did not tell us that a similar application by you had already been dismissed by this court,” the bench said. The SG and Salve also objected to Bhushan referencing the ICJ judgment, arguing that the ruling operated in the realm of the public international law, and could not override the local laws of a country. Salve added that India was not a party to the principle of non-refoulement, as mentioned in the Refugee Convention of 1951 treaties, and therefore judicial orders could not obligate the government to follow non-refoulement (which restrains it from expelling refugees fearing persecution in their home state). The Centre’s affidavit in the SC, seen by HT, maintained that it has to first secure the interests of its own citizens before those of illegal immigrants who, it said, were casting a burden on the already depleting natural resources of the country in addition to posing a security threat. “The Constitution makes it abundantly clear that India as a sovereign nation, has the first and foremost Constitutional obligation and duty towards its citizens and to ensure that the demographic and social structure of the country is not changed to its detriment, the resulting socio-economic problems do not occur to the prejudice of the citizens and the resources of the nation are utilised to fulfil the fundamental rights of its own citizens and are not diverted to the detriment of the citizens, due to influx of illegal migrants into the territory of India,” stated the affidavit. It also cited a 1991 SC judgment to state that although Article 21 (right to life and liberty) extended to foreign nationals, the fundamental right to reside and settle in this country, as mentioned in Article 19(1)(e) of the Constitution, was applicable only to its citizens. “Therefore, the foreign nationals concerned from Myanmar have been illegally residing within India and cannot plead for mercy under the garb of Article 21 as the vires of the same are not applicable to the individuals concerned from Myanmar,” the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-be-capital-of-illegal-immigrants-centre-on-plea-seeks-to-stall-rohingya-deportation-101616782830905.html
26-03-2021||India||States asked to regulate crowds before festivals amid covid spike||New Delhi The Centre on Friday directed all states and Union territories (UTs) to regulate the crowd and ensure strict enforcement of protocols ahead of various festivals in view of rising coronavirus cases in the country.With 62,267 cases within a span of 24 hours, the overall Covid-19 tally rose to 11,908,357, according the HT dashboard. The active caseload breached the 450,000-mark after four months. The death toll hit to 161,295 with 292 new fatalities.In a letter to chief secretaries of all states and UTs, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla called for necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus and directed states and UTs to issue instructions to district administrations and police authorities to “scrupulously enforce Covid appropriate behaviour and SOPs in all public gatherings during the upcoming festivals.”“In view of the upcoming festivals such as Holi, Shab-e-Barat, harvesting festivals, Easter, Eid-ul-Fitr etc, state governments and UT administrations should take necessary measures to regulate crowds during these festivals by ensuring strict observance of Covid appropriate behavior such as wearing of mask and maintaining social distancing as mandated in aforesaid guidelines and in National Directives for Covid-19 management,” Bhalla said in his letter. The official’s letter further mentioned that strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behavior in public places and gatherings will help break the chain of transmission and reduce the virus caseload in the country. “As has been emphasised time and again by health experts, strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour in public places and gatherings will help in breaking the chain of transmission and reduce the incidence of Covid cases in the country,” he said.In a fresh set of guidelines on March 23, the Centre had directed the states and UTs to enhance RT-PCR tests, ensure strict enforcement of test-track-treat protocol and increase the pace of vaccination to cover all priority groups. The Centre announced that all fresh cases will require to be isolated or quarantined at the earliest and provided timely treatment. All contacts of the infected cases will also have to be traced quickly and isolated, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-asked-to-regulate-crowds-before-festivals-amid-covid-spike-101616782530306.html
26-03-2021||India||Ahead of Mahakumbh, Covid cases jump in Haridwar||Rudrapur: The number of new Covid-19 cases in Haridwar, where millions are gathering for the Mahakumbh pilgrimage, has grown by over 250% in the last week compared to the first week of the month, and the test positivity rate on Friday was nearly three times of what it was on March 1, reinforcing fears that the gathering is fuelling a bigger outbreak.Between 30 and 50 million pilgrims are expected to visit the shortened month-long festival in April. Before the pandemic, over 120 million people were expected to visit a four-month Mahakumbh. The first shahi snan (royal bath) that kicked off the festivities on March 11 was attended by over 3.3 million people. The next is on April 1.In the first week of the month, 78 new cases were recorded in Haridwar. In the past seven days, this number has grown to 278. But the number of daily tests has not logged any significant increase – there were 4,715 tests on Friday and a little under 4,000 on March 1. On the first day of the month, only 16 cases were recorded, compared to 58 on Friday –a sharp increase in the positivity rate that is reflected over the week as well.As on Friday, Haridwar accounts for 385 active cases of total 1,162 in the state. Officials in other states are now beginning to record infections in pilgrims who went to Haridwar. On Friday, eight people from one family tested positive for Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district, according to Guna district magistrate Kumar Purshotam. Chief medical officer Haridwar, Dr SK Jha said on Friday that given the expectation that up to 10 million pilgrims can arrive for the Shahi Snan on April 1, testing capacity is being increased and capacity to isolate pilgrims found positive is being strengthened. “Those with no negative Covid-19 reports would be returned. And those found positive through random testing would be isolated. We have capacity to isolate over 10,000 people, with the help of private hospitals. The testing on normal days will be increased as per the pilgrim rush and on Shahi Snan days, it can go even beyond 50,000. For last four days, we have been conducting tests of 3,000 to 5,000 people,” Jha said.The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday directed the state government to ensure that pilgrims coming for Mahakumbh show a negative RT-PCR test taken not more than 72 hours earlier, after members of the court-appointed committee to check situation and arrangements in Mahakumbh submitted their reports to the court.On Sunday, Centre wrote to the state, stressing that the positivity rate in Haridwar has the potential to rapidly turning to an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh.On Friday, the administration announced some curbs on celebrations for Holi (which falls on Monday), allowing venues to host only 50% of their capacity and no single event can exceed an attendance of over 100 people. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities, who has been analysing Covid-19 data for the last year, said the testing numbers in Haridwar need to be scaled up over ten times in accordance with the expectations of the pilgrim influx. “On Thursday, they tested over 3,900 people. With such low testing at present, what can be the situation when one crore people will turn up. It won’t serve the purpose because even if Covid-19 infection is brought by few people into Kumbh area, it has potential to spread in millions”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-mahakumbh-covid-cases-jump-in-haridwar-101616782470283.html
26-03-2021||India||9 Covid patients killed in fire at Mumbai hospital||Nine Covid-19 patients, mostly senior citizens, were killed on Friday after a massive fire broke out at Sunrise Hospital, located inside the Dreams Mall in Bhandup, officials said. Six of the dead were on ventilators. The fire started on first floor of the mall on Thursday night and soon spread to the third floor, which houses the hospital. Officials from the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said the firefighting system, including sprinklers, were not functioning. A notice for non-compliance of fire safety norms was issued to the mall in November 2020, they added.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the spot, ordered an enquiry into the incident, announced ₹5 lakh compensation to the family of the deceased, and asked for their forgiveness. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has ordered a fire audit of all the Covid-19 hospitals and health centres in the wake of the incident, and Mumbai’s mayor Kishori Pednekar has ordered an additional inquiry into how a Covid hospital was allowed to run inside a mall.“If there is any negligence or delay in it, it will be investigated and action will be taken against those who are responsible for it,” said chief minister Thackeray. “The hospital was functioning on a temporary permission that was due to end on March 31. Unfortunately, the fire started on the first floor [of the mall]. Many Covid patients were safely taken out of hospital.”Thackeray also pulled up the administration. “We wake up after such incidents and inquiries are ordered. I have already asked state authorities to carry out structural and fire audits of hospitals and Covid Care Centres and Jumbo facilities and ensure no such incidents happen. Some people who were on ventilators could not be saved. I ask for forgiveness for their families.”According to BMC, there were 78 patients in the hospital at the time of the incident. Two were already dead after failing to recover from Covid-related complications, and nine died due to the fire. The blaze was first reported at around 11.45pm on the first floor of the mall. MFB was yet to give details about the cause of the fire. Sunrise Hospital authorities contended in a statement that it responded responsibly to the incident, and called for an investigation to determine how the fire spread. “The fire was on the first floor of Dreams Mall, Bhandup, and not in the hospital. The smoke had reached up to Sunrise Hospital located at the top floor. All fire alarms beeped and hence all patients were safely evacuated due to the smoke to the fire refuge area .There were two dead bodies (due to Covid) which were also evacuated. There was no casualty due to fire. All patients were promptly shifted to Jumbo Covid centre (and some to other private hospitals). The patients were shifted alive, but there were few patients on ventilator and extremely critical. We believe that the casualties have not occurred due to fire, but either in transit or at other hospitals,” the hospital claimed.It further said that the hospital was started in “exceptional circumstances of Covid last year”, and was “functioning with all due compliances”. “The hospital staff did their best in safely evacuating patients on wheelchairs and beds to the refuge areas and by following the fire drills. The patients were then shifted with the help of local authorities... We have spoken to the authorities and request them to investigate and find the cause of the fire. The guilty need to be punished as the lives of people have been lost in the unfortunate incident,” the statement added.Hemant Parab, deputy chief fire officer, MFB, said the mall was in violation of safety norms. “In the backdrop of a fire last year in City Centre Mall, we had inspected this particular Dreams Mall. A notice was issued to them for non-compliance of fire safety violations due to certain concerns. During fire fighting also we observed that none of the fire safety mechanisms got activated inside the mall. We will conduct a detailed probe into the incident now.”Though the fire was brought under control by Friday afternoon, , firefighting was underway at the time of going to print. Till Friday evening, BMC had traced 46 patients who were evacuated from the hospital. Several of them shifted to nearby hospitals, whereas some opted to go back to their homes, the civic body said.A political slugfest also began after the incident, with the Bharatiya Janata Party blaming BMC of cutting corners to allow the hospital to function.“A case of homicide should be registered against the officials who allowed the operations of the hospital inside the mall. Despite repeated complaints by local BJP corporator Sakshi Dalvi, it was ignored due to political pressure. In reply to the complaint in writing, the Medical Officer Health Department of BMC said that they had issued a certificate of registration to Sunrise Hospital. The fire brigade also issued a no-objection certificate,” BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde said. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who also visited the spot, said, “It seems that the authorities have not learnt from past incidents in Bhandara or even in Apex Hospital in Mulund last year. The government has not woken up even after similar incidents in the past. We cannot expect anything better from the BMC considering its system is filled with corruption.”The BMC, on its part, said it will probe if there were any other violations. “The hospital had occupation certificate and also the fire compliance to operate, but we are told there were fire violations inside the mall. However, that is under fire department’s purview, but I have asked my staff to investigate whether there were any other structural violations inside the mall,” assistant municipal commissioner V Acharekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-covid-patients-killed-in-fire-at-mumbai-hospital-101616782410302.html
26-03-2021||India||Gaganyaan, India's human space mission, will use 'green propulsion': ISRO||India's human space mission Gaganyaan is likely to have a green propellant, ISRO chief K Sivan said on Friday, stressing that it is working towards using green fuel in all its future launches.He said India is in talks with Australia to have a ground station at the Coco Islands for the Gaganyaan mission. In addition, ISRO wants to build a NAVIC ground station in Australia, he said.Speaking at the India Economic Conclave, Sivan said ISRO is not aspiring to be a world leader.He said ISRO's prime objective is to serve the nation and meet its space infrastructure, its needs in space transportation, space science as well as space applications for a wide range of socio-economic benefits as well as advancing the understanding of fundamental science.Replying to a question on using a green propellant for its launches, he said, "Green propulsion is essential. We are going to fly Gaganyaan with green propulsion. It is an essential requirement," he said.He said ISRO has already started the development of green propulsion."We are going to bring the green propulsion system in our launch vehicles because this is the need of the hour. We want to ensure that all toxic and hazardous propellants are avoided."(Its) development is going on fast track mode and very soon our rockets will replace with green propulsion. That is our aim," he said.On Gaganyaan, he said "each and every heart of the ISRO family is beating" for the ambitious programme.The programme was hit due to the coronavirus pandemic. ISRO was to initially send three Indians to space by 2022."Hardware flow has already started from industry and tests and developmental activities are progressing very well," he said.Sivan added that it expects to carry out the crew test as well as the first unmanned mission by the end of this year. This will be followed by one more unmanned mission flight."If everything goes well, we will conduct human space flight," Sivan said.On the Small Satellites Launch Vehicle (SSLV), Sivan said it is a "game-changer" in providing low-cost on-demand access to space for small satellites.The SSLV will be made by the industry on a much larger scale than PSLV, GSLV and GSLV Mark-III, he said. "The first flight (of SSLV) is targeted for this year-end," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gaganyaan-india-s-human-space-mission-will-use-green-propulsion-isro-101616776504769.html

26-03-2021||India||Supreme Court reserves order on Gautam Navlakha’s bail plea||The Supreme Court on Friday reserved orders on a petition filed by civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha demanding bail on default after he pointed out that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) failed to file its charge sheet in the Bhima-Koregaon case within the stipulated period of 90 days.Navlakha is facing stringent charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his alleged links with banned organization – Communist Party of India (Maoist). Once charge sheet is not filed within the period of 90 days, an accused can seek default bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.A bench of Justices UU Lalit and KM Joseph reserved its judgment after hearing senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Nithya Ramakrishnan for Navlakha and Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju for NIA.Sibal argued that while calculating the period of arrest, the 34 days of his house arrest suffered by the petitioner between August 28, 2018 and October 1, 2018 should be counted. These 34 days were crucial towards calculating his period of custody as subsequently he was in 11-day police custody (April 14, 2020 to April 25, 2020) and 46 days of judicial custody (April 25, 2020 to June 10, 2020). This argument was rejected by the Bombay High Court on February 8 this year. The High Court had held, “It is not possible for us to fathom a situation where detention of the appellant (Navlakha) though held to be illegal and unlawful rendering the authorization by the Magistrate untenable should still be construed as an authorized detention for the purpose of Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” Sibal argued in the top court that any kind of detention of an accused must be reckoned with the offence and here the offence for which the accused was in house arrest and later in judicial custody was the same. By change of nature of custody, there will be no effect on the period of detention undergone by the accused, he added.Contradicting him, ASG Raju argued that a detention can only be lawful if it was obtained under the orders passed by a Magistrate. In the case of house arrest, no order of Magistrate was obtained and hence it cannot be treated as legal custody. Navlakha was first arrested in connected with this case in August 2018 when the case was probed by the Maharashtra Police. After NIA took over the probe last year, Navlakha surrendered in April 2020. During the period of house arrest, Navlakha was not allowed to meet anybody and even the NIA did not have access to him. For this reason too, the HC supported the argument advanced by NIA to deny any relief to Navlakha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-reserves-order-on-gautam-navlakha-s-bail-plea-101616775750701.html
26-03-2021||India||Daily Covid-19 cases shoot up nearly 4 times in poll-bound Bengal in 40 days||The daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up nearly four times in the past 40 days in West Bengal even as the crucial assembly polls are scheduled to take off in the eastern state from Saturday. The Indian Meteorological department has also warned of a possible heat wave in some districts of south Bengal and has advised people to stay indoors between 12 noon and 4 pm. Even though the entire country is witnessing a second wave with Covid-19 cases rising at an alarming rate, experts say that the mass gatherings during election campaign and people putting down their guard against the virus could be the possible reasons behind the rise in West Bengal. While the everyday Covid-19 cases had shot up to more than 4000 in late-October 2020 during the festive season, it had dropped to 133 on February 15 this year. On March 26, however, the state registered 646 new cases, a rise of around 4.8 times during the last 40 days. “If you see the rallies and road shows of political leaders in any district, you will hardly see anyone wearing a mask. Forget social distancing. These are ideal conditions that favour the spread of Covd-19,” said a senior official of the state health department. The eight-phase assembly elections will begin from March 27 with 30 assembly constituencies in five districts going to polls in the first phase on the first day itself. Polling is scheduled between 7 am and 6:30 pm. Top leaders of both the BJP and the TMC, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Mamata Banerjee among others have held rallies in these districts in the past few day and every time the political parties boast of people gathering in lakhs. “Any kind of festival, be it social, cultural or religious is bound to trigger a spike in Covid-19 cases as there would be a gathering and people tend to lower their guard. Political rallies and elections are no exception. The more restraint we show during such festivals the less would be the spike as we had seen during Durga Puja and other festivals last year. But the moment we lower our guards, cases will shoot up proportionately,” said Asis Manna, vice principal of the state-run Infectious Diseases Hospital in Kolkata. But hardly anyone in public rallies, political meetings and road shows could be seen wearing masks or maintaining social distance. Even political leaders and star campaigners, some of whom are senior citizens could also be spotted without masks. Last year when Covd-19 cases were raging in the state, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had blamed political rallies and protests for rising Covid-19 cases among the police force, as police need to tackle the workers and political supporters during such events to maintain law and order. Data shared by the state government shows that even though Kolkata and North 24 Parganas, the two most densely populated districts, have the highest number of cases, some of the districts which are going to polls have also seen a rise in the past few days. While in Purulia cases have shot up three times from 4 to 12, in Paschim Midnapore cases have jumped from 1 to 12 between February 15 and March 25. On Friday, the maximum temperature in Kolkata touched 37 degrees Celsius, which was two degrees above normal. Some areas, such as Uluberia in Howrah, registered heat-waves, with the temperature soaring to 39.6 degrees Celsius, which was more than six degrees above normal. “Day temperature is likely to continue above normal by 2 degrees – 4 degrees over the districts of Gangetic West Bengal and heat wave condition is likely to prevail over the districts of East Midnapore, North and South 24 Parganas district during the next 2 – 3 days,” said a statement released by the IMD on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-covid-19-cases-shoot-up-nearly-4-times-in-poll-bound-bengal-in-40-days-101616775089954.html
26-03-2021||India||Supreme Court reserves verdict in Maratha reservation case||The Supreme Court Friday reserved judgement on a batch of petitions challenging the Bombay High Court verdict which had upheld the grant of reservation to Marathas in admissions and government jobs in the state.A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan concluded the hearing of arguments in the matter in which submissions were also advanced on whether the landmark 1992 Indra Sawhney verdict (called the Mandal judgement), which put a cap of 50 per cent on reservations, requires reconsideration by a larger bench.“KK Venugopal, Attorney General has addressed his arguments in reply to the submissions made in the writ petition... Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General appearing for the UOI (Union of India) and the state of Gujarat adopts the submission of the Attorney General. Hearing completed. Judgment reserved,” said the bench, which also comprised justices, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.The bench had commenced hearing arguments in the matter on March 15.On March 8, the top court had said that it proposes to consider issues, including whether the judgement in the Indra Sawhney case needs to be referred to or requires re-look by a larger bench “in the light of subsequent constitutional amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics of the society”.The high court, while upholding the law in June 2019, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and the quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions.The Centre had argued in the top court that Maharashtra has the legislative competence for granting reservation to Marathas and its decision is Constitutional as the 102nd amendment does not denude a state of the power to declare its list of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC).The 102nd Constitution Amendment Act of 2018 inserted Articles 338B, which deals with the structure, duties and powers of the National Commission for Backward Class (NCBC), and 342A dealing with the power of the President to notify a particular caste as SEBC as also of Parliament to change the list.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had said that in its view, the SEBC Act 2018 of Maharashtra granting reservation to people of the Maratha community in the state in jobs and admissions is Constitutional.“The Centre is of the view that the Maharashtra SEBC Act is constitutional. We construe Article 342A gives enabling role to Central government to determine the SEBC,” Mehta had said, adding that the Centre adopts the submissions of the Attorney General and it should be considered as the view of the Union government.On March 18, the Attorney General had told the top court that the 102nd amendment to the Constitution does not deprive state legislatures to enact law determining the SEBC and conferring benefits on them.The apex court had on September 9 last year stayed the implementation of legislation and referred to a larger bench the batch of pleas challenging the validity of the law, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits would not be disturbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-reserves-verdict-in-maratha-reservation-case-101616774602426.html

This has been in very large measure because of the role Indira Gandhi played in historic events of 1971,” referring to India’s support for Bangladesh’s liberation war (Mukti-Jhuddo). She added that the two leaders had established “bonds of mutual respect, admiration and deep friendship”.Drawing a parallel between the developments in India and Bangladesh in 1971, Gandhi maintained that it was “as much a transformative year for India as it was for Bangladesh”, referring to the rise of India Gandhi as a political leader as well as a statesman.Looking back at the joyous occasion of the birth of Bangladesh, the Congress president also mentioned how both countries continue to face similar challenges.“Both our countries face many challenges-- economic, political and environmental. Most of all, both Bangladesh and India, which have been beacons for the celebrations of their diversity and are being called upon to protect and strengthen their composite heritage and their traditions of liberal pluralism,” Gandhi said.The Congress president, who was present in Delhi during the period of war, recalled how she and her late husband Rajiv Gandhi lived through that period.“On this joyous occasion, and as someone who lived through the transformative hours, days, weeks and months of 1971 by Indira Gandhi’s side along with my husband Rajiv ji, I am personally delighted to share the pride of Sheikh Hasina and millions of her countrymen and women,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1971-a-transformative-year-for-india-as-well-sonia-gandhi-s-message-to-sheikh-hasina-101616768609441.html

Here's why||Passing a driving license test in India is likely to get difficult as people will be required to pass a stringent skill test, including reversing vehicles with accuracy for qualification. The Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Thursday told the Lok Sabha in a written reply about the new rules and passing percentage.Here’s all you need to know:The minister told Parliament that the passing percentage for the eligibility of a driving license in all Regional Transport Offices (RTO) has been fixed at 69 per cent.The candidates will be required to reverse the vehicle into a limited opening either to the right or left under control and reasonable accuracy to qualify the test. “In the case of a vehicle having a reverse gear, driving the vehicle backwards, reverse it into a limited opening either to the right or left under control and with reasonable accuracy is one of the parameters of qualifying in the driving skill test,” news agency PTI quoted Gadkari as saying.These measures are as per the provision of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, to produce qualified drivers, he said.The applicants will be provided with a video link for the driving test demo at the time of booking an appointment for the test.Also Read | No more lockdowns in Telangana, says KCR amid Covid-19 surgePhysical or live demonstrations at the driving test track as well as on the LED screen in all Automated Driving Test Tracks (ADTTs) will be shown before the beginning of the actual skill test.Applicants can avail themselves hassle-free services to get a driving license as certain services linked to licenses and certificate registrations have been made completely online through Aadhaar authentication on a voluntary basis, the minister informed in another written reply. This has been done to reduce the footfall of applicants in the RTO offices in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.In an advisory issued by the ministry of road transport and highways on Friday, the government has extended the validity of vehicle documents like driving licence (DL), registration certificate (RC) and permits till June 30 amid the surge in the Covid-19 cases.Gadkari said a day before that the license can be renewed anytime between one year before its expiry till one year after its expiry for the benefit of the citizens away from their hometowns, visiting abroad etc.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/passing-driving-license-test-likely-to-get-difficult-here-s-why-101616765723330.html
26-03-2021||India||Recent surge in Covid-19 cases being closely monitored: Harsh Vardhan||The recent surge in coronavirus cases in the country is being closely monitored and measures, including strict enforcement of Covid protocols and creating micro-containment zones, will be taken to keep a check the contagion, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday.Vaccination drive is going on and its pace is increasing with each passing day. Priority groups have been identified on the basis of recommendations of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), he said."The focus is protecting those at highest risk of mortality and those involved in pandemic response. As of Friday, 5.31 crore doses have been administered. In January, 2.4 lakh doses were being administered daily, whereas in the last week of March it was 20 lakh. Now, the government has expanded the coverage to citizens above 45 years."The pace of vaccination is going to increase. As for imposing restrictions, Covid-19 situation continues to evolve and change each day. The silver lining here is that we are better prepared now to tackle any challenges that the pandemic throws our way," he said.Steps, including include strict enforcement of Covid-19 protocols as well as creating micro-containment zones wherever needed will be used to keep a check on the rise in cases, he said at the 'India Economic Conclave' organised by Times Now.Commenting on the Covid-19 trajectory in India and the recent surge in cases, Vardhan said concerted efforts of the Centre and the states and the country's investment in the 'test, track and treat' strategy have resulted in India recording one of the lowest cases and deaths per million population."We have amply demonstrated that our policy of test, track and treat effectively contains the transmission of the virus."The health minister said a graded opening up of the economy and beginning commercial activities followed a sustained decline in Covid-19 epi-curve in the country."This was essential to negate the economic impact that Covid-19 has had globally, including India. Historically, the pandemics of the past have come in waves and Covid is no exception. This was amply witnessed when the second wave hit Europe and the Americas. It still eludes the scientific community why pandemics behave in this way," he said.Vardhan said physical distancing is an established non-pharmaceutical intervention to suppress and contain the transmission of Covid-19."The modality for ensuring physical distancing measures has to be evidence-based. In this context, partial lockdowns, such as night curfews or weekend lockdowns, would not have much impact on the transmission cycle.""As for the vaccine, there are still many critical unknowns, especially with regards to the impact on transmission and duration of protection these vaccines offer. Further, what is clear is it reduces the severity of the disease and hence impacts mortality."The health minister said the vaccination drive is being conducted in accordance with emerging science-based data analysed through algorithms which suggest that if a majority of the population are immunised then it is possible to get control over the disease."This is like achieving herd immunity through vaccination," he said.Six vaccines are at different stages of trial and will be granted permission as and when they complete all statutory requirements. The Drugs Controller General of India is looking on this matter, Vardhan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recent-surge-in-covid-19-cases-being-closely-monitored-harsh-vardhan-101616766647832.html

The Bengaluru-headquartered space agency was earlier looking to launch the satellite on March 28, subject to weather conditions. "There is a minor issue with the satellite", ISRO sources told PTI. "As of now, we are planning to launch it on April 18". GISAT-1 was originally planned to be launched from Sriharikota spaceport, about 100 kms north of Chennai, on March five last year but was postponed a day before the blast-off due to technical reasons. ISRO sources had earlier said the delay in the launch was due to Covid-19-induced lockdown which affected normal work. According to ISRO, GISAT-1 will facilitate near real-time observation of the Indian sub-continent, under cloud-free condition, at frequent intervals. Weighing about 2,268kg, GISAT-1 is the firststate-of- the-art agile earth observation satellite which will be placed in a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit by GSLV-F10. "Subsequently, the satellite will reach the final geostationary orbit using its on board propulsion system", ISRO had said a few days before the planned launch in March last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-revises-launch-schedule-of-gisat-1-after-minor-issue-with-satellite-101616766210941.html

26-03-2021||India||PM Modi meets 'Muktijoddhas' of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday met Bangladeshi political and community leaders in Dhaka, including representatives of minorities and 'Muktijoddhas', the fighters of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.Prime Minister Narendra Modi met 'Muktijodhas', the liberation war fighters of Bangladesh, in Dhaka today pic.twitter.com/avBVi9oLhVThe Prime Minister is on a two-day visit to Dhaka, where he is slated to attend the celebrations of the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence, the birth centenary of ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and hold talks with his counterpart Sheikh Hasina.The fact that Modi met the country's freedom fighters, so named after 'Muktijuddho' (literally, "the fight for freedom"), sends a strong message of India-Bangladesh solidarity, which has its roots in the subcontinent's history.On March 25, 50 years ago, the Pakistan army led a genocidal crackdown in Dhaka, which had changed the course of the history of the Indian subcontinent. It led to the Liberation War, the division of Pakistan, and the creation of Bangladesh.India, moved by the plight of millions of war-ravaged Bengali civilians, had initially been providing diplomatic, economic, and military support to Bangladeshi nationalists but later joined the war on December 3, 1971, following a series of preemptive airstrikes by Pakistan. The 'Mukti Bahini' ("liberation army"), the guerilla resistance movement, played a decisive factor in India’s quick victory and the liberation of Bangladesh: The Pakistan army surrendered on December 16, 1971, less than two weeks after the war broke out.Speaking at an event in Dhaka, Prime Minister remembered the bloodied history which led to India joining Bangladesh in its struggle for independence against Pakistan."The pictures of atrocities that the Pakistan Army inflicted on the people here used to distract us. For many days, those pictures didn't let us sleep," ANI quoted Modi as saying.He added, "I would like to remind brothers and sisters in Bangladesh with pride, being involved in the struggle for independence of Bangladesh was one of the first movements of my life. I must have been 20-22 years old when I and my colleagues did Satyagraha for Bangladesh's freedom."The pictures of atrocities that the Pakistan Army inflicted on the people here used to distract us.

I must have been 20-22 years old when I&my colleagues did Satyagraha for Bangladesh's freedom: PM Modi in Dhaka pic.twitter.com/f6O68ldPfnAfter the 1971 war, Sheikh Mujib earned the title of 'Bangabandhu' ("friend of Bengal") and India secured a permanent place in the history of Bangladesh's freedom struggle.With Prime Minister Modi's two-day visit to remember Mujib, the "father of the nation" of Bangladesh, and celebrate the golden jubilee of the 1971 liberation war, the optics puts forth a new frontier for diplomatic ties between the two countries — that India’s relations with Bangladesh have gone way beyond symbolism. It is now part of an integrated vision of the Prime Minister for the development of eastern India, with the help and support of Bangladesh.Also Read: Delhi-Dhaka ties move beyond symbolism, seek to power growth and connectivityModi, who is visiting Bangladesh on his first trip to a foreign country since the outbreak of the coronavirus, was received by the country's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport upon his arrival. A salute of 19 guns and a Guard of honour were accorded to Prime Minister Modi at the airport. In a statement, the Union Ministry of External Affairs MEA said that as part of his two-day visit to Bangladesh, Modi met the community leaders, including representatives of minorities in Bangladesh, the 'Mukhtijoddhas', friends of India and youth icons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-meets-muktijoddhas-of-1971-bangladesh-liberation-war-101616753496058.html

As early as March 15, 2020, Indian PM called all SAARC leaders and came forward to help, to work together. Since Covid-19 is a global issue we have to work together in collaboration. The Indian PM took leadership, we joined in,” the Bangladesh minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.His remark comes on a day when PM Modi is in the neighbouring country for a two-day trip marking Bangladesh’s National Day. His visit was earlier scheduled in March last year but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Thanking India and Modi for the vaccine supply, Momen told ANI, “India provided 2 million vaccines as a gift and PM Modi, on the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh and 100th anniversary of the father of our nation, is giving another 1.2 million vaccines as a gift. They have assured that the contract will be met on time. We would like to buy more.” He added that Modi has assured his counterpart Sheikh Hasina that if India develops a vaccine, Bangladesh will get it at the same time. “He kept his word and with this, he has won the hearts and minds of people. We paid for it in advance,” the foreign minister said.At present, there are 584,395 confirmed cases in Bangladesh and 8,797 has died of the viral disease so far. Momen said he looked forward to a new Indian subcontinent with improved waterways connectivity. “We have developed strong connections with our neighbours, particularly India. We have developed very strong connectivity by road, railways, waterways as well as air routes. We have more to do in waterways because it is cost-effective,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.The foreign minister also called for other neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar to come together for better connectivity between South Asian countries. “I am looking for a day that we will not need any passport to travel within this region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-took-leadership-we-joined-in-bangladesh-minister-hails-india-s-covid-19-efforts-101616753688727.html
26-03-2021||India||India can’t become capital of illegal migrants: Govt on Rohingyas’ deportation||India cannot become the “international capital of illegal migrants”, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Friday while opposing a plea seeking release and protection of over 150 Rohingyas sent to a holding centre in Jammu as part of a process to identify undocumented immigrants for deportation to Myanmar.In an affidavit, the Centre called Rohingyas “absolutely illegal migrants” who posed “serious threats to the national security” as a Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde-led bench reserved its order on the plea.The Jammu & Kashmir administration began the process of identifying undocumented immigrants on March 6. Over 150 of them were sent to the holding centre under the Foreigners Act. Officials insisted due process of law was followed and added the immigrants sent to the centre did not have valid travel documents.Also Read | Aid workers struggle to reunite Rohingya children separated by deadly fireHundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have since 2017 fled Myanmar to escape persecution and many of them have been staying in India. The UN has called a Myanmar army’s campaign against the Rohingya “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.The government underlined “illegal migrants” cannot assert the right to settle in India under the Constitution’s Article 21 (the right to life and liberty).Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, submitted the Supreme Court dismissed a similar application to stop the deportation of Rohingyas in Assam in 2018. He added the fresh plea must meet the same fate.“The continuance of the illegal immigration of Rohingyas into India and their continued stay in India, apart from being absolutely illegal, is also found to be having serious national security ramifications and poses serious security threats,” Mehta told the bench, which also includes justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Mehta said the Centre has begun the process for deporting Rohingyas after receiving a confirmation from Myanmar regarding their nationality. He added the court should steer clear of the “diplomatic issue” since it falls within the exclusive domain of the executive.Senior advocate Harish Salve, who represented the Jammu & Kashmir administration, cautioned the bench against “starting a dangerous trend” by interfering with a subject that related to “illegal migrants” and diplomatic relations.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who argued for the petitioner Salimullah, cited the International Court of Justice (ICJ)’s January 2020 judgment on the persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar and how they were subjected to serious crimes in violation of international humanitarian laws. Bhushan said an urgent intervention of the Supreme Court was required since those held in Jammu could be deported to Myanmar from where they fled fearing prosecution.The bench told Bhushan: “You are saying that they might be massacred once sent back to Myanmar. What happens in a foreign country is beyond our control... We are certain that there should be no genocide on this earth. We are not supporting the genocide of any kind anywhere. But the question here is different. You did not tell us that a similar application by you had already been dismissed by this court.”Salve said ICJ’s judgment was in the realm of the public international law and could not override local laws of a country. He added India was not a party to the principle of non-refoulement as mentioned in the 1951 Refugee Convention.The principle under international human rights law guarantees people should not be returned to a country where they would face torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and other irreparable harm.Salve said India is not obliged to follow non-refoulment, which would restrain it from expelling a refugee fearing persecution.The affidavit, seen by HT, maintained India has to secure the interests of its own citizens before catering to the interests of illegal migrants “casting a burden on the already-depleting natural resources of the country”.“The Constitution makes it abundantly clear that India, as a sovereign nation, has the first and foremost Constitutional obligation and duty towards its citizens and to ensure that the demographic and social structure of the country is not changed to its detriment, the resulting socio-economic problems do not occur to the prejudice of the citizens and the resources of the nation are utilized to fulfil the fundamental rights of its own citizens and are not diverted to the detriment of the citizens, due to influx of illegal migrants into the territory of India,” the affidavit said.It cited a 1991 Supreme Court judgment that said although Constitution’s Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) extended to foreign nationals, the fundamental right to reside and settle in India under Article 19(1)(e) was applicable only to citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-t-become-capital-of-illegal-migrants-govt-on-rohingyas-deportation-101616754569448.html

26-03-2021||India||FCI turns to tech to shield its procurement system from fraudsters||During the 2020 kharif, or summer-sown season, food bowl Punjab’s paddy output stood at nearly 18.1 million tonnes. The Food Corporation of India (FCI), the state-run food-stocking agency responsible for procuring grains from farmers at support prices, ended up buying 20.3 million tonnes of paddy from the state, or 11% more than the state produced.Procurement, which refers to the government’s buying of farm produce at assured prices, is an “open-ended” process. This means FCI has to buy all produce farmers and traders bring to its procurement centres.This “open-ended” procurement process also makes the system vulnerable to scams. It is easy for unscrupulous traders to game the system by selling rice already sold to FCI during previous seasons.In states such as Punjab and Haryana, where the agricultural produce market committees’ procurement yards are within reach of every farmer, the stocks procured by the state’s agencies are transferred to rice mills where they are milled over the next five months. After the paddy is milled, the rice is handed over to FCI. The agency stores it in its own or hired silos.Also Read | Govt procures paddy worth ₹1.06 lakh crore so far this kharif seasonFrequently, traders buy foodgrains at lower than government-assured prices from poorer states such as Bihar, transport the produce to Punjab and Haryana, where the procurement system is robust, and profit from it. These are the likely reasons why FCI ended up buying more paddy from Punjab than the state actually produced last year.To prevent such practices, which bloats the government’s food subsidy bill, the government is turning to technology. FCI will soon introduce gadgets at its procurement centres that will show the “age of rice”. It is part of a proposed national programme to detect old rice being recirculated and resold to FCI by middlemen and traders who hoard rice.“Rice-age testing is already on in Andhra Pradesh. Its successful implementation there means that the FCI will roll it out across the country, mainly in procurement-heavy states,” said food secretary Sudhangshu Pandey.The gadgets being used in Andhra Pradesh to detect rice age involves pouring certain chemicals on a sample of rice. If the rice is freshly milled, then it turns to a certain colour that indicates it has been freshly harvested.FCI has also come out with a draft proposal to change the quality norms that apply to rice and wheat bought by it, according to a copy of the proposal seen by the HT, which could limit the total quantity of foodgrains procured by the agency.The agency’s draft proposal recommends that only wheat with a moisture content of 12% or less will be fit for procurement, down from 14% currently. Similarly, the agency has proposed reducing the permissible limit of “foreign matter” in rice it procures to 1% from 2% currently.FCI’s draft proposal says the changes are necessary to meet international standards of foodgrains for easy export.“However, it can adversely impact costs of farmers, who need to ensure proper post-harvest processing to meet higher standards of procurement,” said RN Mani, an agro-economist formerly with Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fci-turns-to-tech-to-shield-its-procurement-system-from-fraudsters-101616752468647.html

Modi will be the only foreign leader at the main National Day celebrations marking 50 years of Bangladesh’s independence on Friday. He will also participate in events commemorating the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation, and 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two sides. This is the prime minister’s first foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak last year, and he said in a statement issued ahead of his departure that the trip will underline India’s support for the Bangladesh’s economic and developmental achievements. In a special gesture, Hasina and members of her cabinet welcomed Modi at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. The prime minister was accorded a 19-gun salute and a guard of honour. Also Read | ‘Special visit begins with a special gesture’ tweets PMOIn a tweet posted in Bangla, Modi said: “I have reached Dhaka. Thanks to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for giving me a special welcome at the airport. This visit will contribute to further strengthening our bilateral relations.” Soon after his arrival, Modi visited the Jatiyo Sriti Shoudho or the National Martyrs’ Memorial that pays tributes to the valour and the sacrifice of those who died in Bangladesh’s liberation war in 1971. The monument, located in Savar, 35 km northwest of the capital Dhaka, was designed by Syed Mainul Hossain. Bugles played The Last Post as the Bangladesh flag was hoisted at half mast, and Modi placed a wreath and stood in silence in front of the memorial as a mark of respect to the martyrs. Modi planted a sapling of the Arjun tree at the memorial complex and signed the visitor’s book. He wrote: “I pay my heartfelt tribute to the patriotic martyrs of Bangladesh whose glorious sacrifices enabled the birth of this great nation. May every visitor to this revered ground honour the sacred memory of the millions who were slain but not silenced. “Their valour will continue to inspire future generations to fight injustice and defend the cause of righteousness. On behalf of the people of India, I pray that the eternal flame at Savar remains a lasting reminder of the noble victory of truth and courage over deceit and oppression.” Later, Modi met community leaders, including representatives of Bangladesh’s minorities, freedom fighters and youth icons. He also met leaders from the 14-party ruling alliance led by its convener. Discussions centred on different aspects of bilateral relations were held during the meeting, officials said. Modi subsequently held another meeting with leaders of Bangladesh’s Opposition parties. Besides holding talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart, Modi will also offer prayers to Goddess Kali at Jashoreshwari Kali temple, one of 51 Shaktipeeths in the Puranic tradition, and interacted with representatives of the Matua community at Orakandi, from where Sri Sri Harichandra Thakur disseminated his message.

26-03-2021||India||Modi thinks he is only the Prime Minister of the Hindi heartland: MK Stalin||Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief, MK Stalin, 68, will contest the Tamil Nadu assembly elections on April 6. While he has been in the electoral fray for decades, this is the first time he will contest as the party’s chief minister’s candidate, bearing the legacy of the Dravidian party after the demise of his father M Karunanidhi in 2018. Since he began his political journey in the DMK as a teenager, Stalin has been the party’s youth wing leader, a six-time legislator, Chennai mayor, deputy chief minister, rural development minister and now Opposition leader. As he prepares for his biggest battle, Stalin speaks to HT about his political beliefs and the current electoral situation. Excerpts:What have you learnt being out of power for a decade? Whether in power or in the Opposition, I have learnt to work for the welfare of the people. It is because the DMK is the party that is always with people in their joy and sorrow. DMK was launched not only for power but essentially for social empowerment of the deprived class and downtrodden in society. DMK works for the welfare of the people and fights for the rights of the women. I have always led the party in such a way that those in power act on people’s demand. Hence, DMK is with people’s power always and it is the party with mass support always. Also Read | The political life of DMK’s MK StalinDid you believe that the Edappadi Palaniswami-led government would complete its term or are you surprised? He was barely known before 2016; how do you feel that you will be fighting him as your primary rival? DMK is a party which stands for ideology. We never tried to come to power through the back door. Even during the chaos in AIADMK due to ill health and death of former chief minister Jayalalithaa, DMK clarified time and again that it will not come to power through the back door. If you see the massive corruption in Palaniswami regime and the way in which he allowed his ministers to plunder the treasury, one cannot be surprised at the continuance of Palaniswami government till the end of its term. Even now, he is known only by the advertisement campaign done by spending government money, and not by his deeds. The people know him now only for his poor performance and failures on all fronts during these four years of misgovernance. What is your view on Narendra Modi? The Bharatiya Janata Party has been investing in infrastructure projects and increasing its booth-level strength to gain a footing in Tamil Nadu. What do you think of its prospects?Prime Minister Modi is thinking that he is the Prime Minister of only the Hindi heartland. He has no interest in the development of Tamil Nadu and for that matter, any states ruled by non-NDA (National Democratic Alliance) parties. From the beginning, Modi has been only demeaning cooperative federalism and is in a hurry to usurp of the power of states. The State List and Concurrent List, which are part of the Constitution, is under constant threat under the BJP regime at the Centre. As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, they used the AIADMK only to communalise the otherwise communally harmonious land of Tamil Nadu. No infrastructure projects for Tamil Nadu have been implemented during Modi government. AIIMS at Madurai, announced six years back, is a non-starter even today. The people of Tamil Nadu believe that both AIADMK and BJP are one and the same and hence, they will reject BJP and also its allies AIADMK in the state. Also Read | Udhayanidhi Stalin gets creative at his rally, displays note, brick, old photosIf the situation demands, in a post-poll scenario, would you be open to joining hands with the BJP? Your father defended DMK aligning with BJP between 1999 and 2003. It’s not been a political untouchable.DMK is the champion of secular values and a party for democracy. How do you expect such a post-poll scenario? DMK will not align with the BJP politically and we are in the secular alliance, led by the Congress nationally. Do you think the AIADMK’s alliance with BJP is the biggest factor against it and do you think anti-Hindi sentiment is still strong in Tamil Nadu? I have already said that AIADMK and BJP are one and the same. Both are disrespecting the sentiments of youth of Tamil Nadu. Both are depriving lakhs of youngsters in Tamil Nadu of employment opportunities. Both are destroying the educational opportunities for the youngsters of Tamil Nadu. More than a dozen young girls and boys died by suicide because of the NEET exam but both AIADMK and BJP governments remained mute spectators. Medical education of rural youth has been snatched by BJP and, even now, it is introducing NEET for nursing education also. Tamil Nadu is always opposed to the act of imposition of Hindi, which ignores and insults the mother tongue — classical Tamil. That sentiment is rampant in the state and it will reflect in the election. You were 13 when you began organising youth wing functions and you’ve worked your way up in administration and politically in different capacities within the DMK. What is your response to the AIADMK-BJP criticism against dynastic politics since your son Udhayanidhi was appointed as youth wing secretary, he’s one of your star campaigners and is contesting from Chepauk? DMK is the family of cadres because they are committed to the noblest Dravidian ideology. When you are wedded to one particular ideology, that too for the upliftment of the people and development of the state, you cannot expect that he or she will switch over to a different party and a different ideology. Adopting his father’s or his father’s party ideology cannot be termed as dynasty politics. Just because he is my son, I cannot compel him to adopt a different ideology. That is the position of those in DMK. Are you grooming him the way your father groomed you for politics?But one thing is sure — either me or any one in party cannot groom their sons in politics just because they are in DMK. For growing in DMK, one has to work hard, reach out to the people and fight for the state’s welfare. The AIADMK and BJP’s criticism is born out of frustration, aimed to hide their corrupt and communal alliance from the eyes of people who have suffered in the last ten years of misrule of AIADMK. If your father, M Karunanidhi was alive, what advice do you think he would give you at this juncture? He would have advised me to go to the people with the slogan of “throw the communal and corrupt forces out of Tamil Nadu” and “Restore the pride and self-respect of Tamil Nadu”. Now I am doing exactly what he would have wished and hence even in his absence, I am following the ideology that was near and dear to his heart only. Political observers say that DMK won’t be able to repeat its sweep of 2019 in 2021. What in your assessment has changed or went wrong after you won 38/39 in the 2019 parliamentary elections because subsequently the gains in by-polls and civic polls were not enough. Do you think you will sweep 2021 elections with your mission 200 or do you assess this to be a close election?Despite all blatant misuse of power by the AIADMK government, the people of Tamil Nadu gave us a massive victory in rural local body election. AIADMK was rattled at the victory of DMK and that is why they did not conduct urban local body elections. In the by-elections too, the DMK won more seats than the AIADMK. The 2019 Parliamentary election victory will be repeated now and the DMK and its alliance parties would sweep all the 234 assembly seats. What are your top priorities if you come to power and how would they be different from your father’s? I have promised that the grievance petitions received from the people during “Stalin in Your Constituency Programme” would be solved within 100 days of coming to power. That would be my first priority. In Trichy, I announced “Stalin’s Seven Assurances” - which is a vision document of DMK for Tamil Nadu for the next 10 years. DMK Manifesto is the hero as usual.

He was initially scheduled to visit the country last March, but had to postpone his programme due to the rapidly spreading disease. The current visit comes on the invitation extended by PM Sheikh Hasina to participate in Bangladesh’s National Day celebrations.National Day, or the Independence Day of Bangladesh, is celebrated annually on March 26. It was on this date in 1971 that East Pakistan, as the country was then called, declared its “independence” from Pakistan. Bangladesh was recognised in 1972, months after formally getting independence from Pakistan, following the Indo-Pak war of December 1971.Last year’s National Day celebrations would have also commemorated the 100th birth anniversary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is also known as Bangladesh’s “Father of the Nation.” Rahman was the country’s first President and later became Prime Minister but was assassinated in 1975. PM Sheikh Hasina is his daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-special-welcome-in-dhaka-modi-thanks-bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-101616746170783.html

26-03-2021||India||Heat stress in India can reduce industrial output: Study||For every one-degree Celsius (°C) rise in annual temperatures over average temperatures for the 1980-2000 period, Indian industrial plants likely produced 2% less revenue, according to a research paper co-authored by economists and experts from Delhi’s Indian Statistical Institute and the University of Chicago. The researchers used data from around 58,000 factories in India to arrive at the correlation.With the government’s focus on transforming India into a manufacturing hub, the findings of the paper are significant.Anant Sudarshan, South Asia Director, Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago, said the effect of high temperatures on lower crop yields has been previously established. “This paper shows that rising temperatures can also hurt economic output in other sectors by reducing the productivity of human labour. The damage is greatest when already warm days become hotter,” Sudarshan said in a statement on Thursday.The statement added if India wishes to succeed in becoming a manufacturing powerhouse using cheap labour, it needs to think hard about how to adapt to a hotter world.“That 1°C rise over the baseline only puts a number to the possible impact on industrial output. But the effect of this temperature rise is more pronounced when warm days become hotter. So, the rise in average temperatures in [the] summer season directly impacts productivity,” said Sudarshan.The paper, which has been accepted for publication in the University of Chicago’s Journal of Political Economy, said the losses are mainly due to a reduction in the output elasticity of labour.Factory workers may produce less while at work due to heat stress and also be absent more often, according to the study.The analysis of long-term national-level data for the study was supplemented with that on workers involved in cloth weaving, garment sewing, and steel industries to separately identify these two effects. The researchers found the output of individual workers and teams declines on hot days as well as in weeks with more hot days.The cloth weaving factories studied are in Surat, the National Capital Region, Hyderabad and Chhindwara. The steel production data is from Bhilai. The researchers obtained payment slips for each day and digitised these to generate a worker-level dataset of daily output and attendance. They also sourced weather data from public weather stations and India Meteorological Department to map the impact.The multi-year study indicates that climate control in the workplace removes productivity declines, but not absenteeism possibly because workers remain exposed to high temperatures at home and outside.E Somanathan, a professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, said in the absence of climate control, worker productivity declines on hot days. “...we spot absenteeism even for workers in factories with cooling facilities. When you compound that with limited adoption of climate control technologies in manufacturing industries, you know that we are dealing with a complex problem here.” Somanathan added it is entirely possible that the industrial sector might respond to high temperatures by increasing automation and shifting away from labour-intensive sectors in hot parts of the world. “These adaptive responses may negatively influence wage inequality,” he said in a statement.M Rajeevan Nair, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said he has not read the paper, but they know the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves are going up in central and northwest India as well as the heat-wave zone along the east coast. “New modelling studies are showing that even if we managed to keep global warming under 1.5°C, heat waves will rise. Heatwaves can be fatal, so we have to be very well prepared. India Meteorological Department and National Disaster Management Authority are preparing heat action plans for states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heat-stress-in-india-can-reduce-industrial-output-study-101616743348655.html

Dismissed.”Priyanka Singh had approached the Supreme Court after the Bombay high court on February 15 refused to quash the FIR against her while allowing the quashing of FIR against her sister Meetu Singh.According to the FIR, by Chakraborty accused the two sisters of prescribing medicines for Sushant Singh Rajput and sought a probe against them for alleged abetment to suicide under Indian Penal Code Section 306 and other relevant provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.Also Read | Don’t object to Rhea bail, disagree with some HC observations: NCB to SCPriyanka Singh was represented in the Supreme Court by senior advocate Vikas Singh who said that in August 2020 when the top court transferred the FIR in connection with the late actor’s death to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), it held that subsequent proceedings arising out of the FIR will be probed by CBI.Despite this direction, the Bombay high court did not quash the proceedings, Vikas Singh argued.Moreover Priyanka Singh had maintained that no second FIR could be possible after inquest proceedings were closed by Maharashtra Police.The FIR was registered at Bandra police station on September 7, 2020.

26-03-2021||India||Not a born politician but learning fast: Metro Man on track with his 2nd innings||In traditional Kerala mundu (dhoti), blue striped shirt and dotting sandal paste on his forehead, 'Metro Man' E Sreedharan gently discourages when youngsters try to touch his feet in reverence during the campaign trail.Last week, when some women washed his feet during a meeting, there was a controversy. Though he tried his best to explain that it was a custom to greet guests in some areas of Palakkad, his opponents refused to buy it saying he enjoys “feudalist traditions.”A man of few words, his camp of followers have to often remind him to wave his hands when the waiting crowd greets him. And he follows directions of the seasoned leaders, who accompany him, in letter and spirit. In sweltering heat (Palakkad is usually the hottest district in the state) the 88-yr-old enjoys his fresh innings.“I am not a born politician. But I am fast learning the lessons of politics. It is a different ball game. A civil engineer for six decades, I was familiar with the heat and dust but here both are quite different but I enjoy them,” the oldest poll candidate in the state admits that he’s still a student of politics.When an aged man reminded him near the Victoria College, one of the oldest educational institutions of Kerala founded in 1887, that he has to cut down his campaign during warm hours, he thanked him profusely.“Look, some people are concerned about my age, some are genuine but others take a dig. Age is just a number and I have enough energy left in me. If I can serve people at this age what is wrong in it,” he explains. With his entry, the innocuous constituency draws enough national attention. Union home minister Amit Shah had already visited the VIP constituency on Wednesday and PM Modi is arriving in March-end seeking votes for him.“He’s leading the NDA battle in Kerala,” Shah said during his roadshow in Kanjikkode, an industrial hub.Displaying his trademark gentle behaviour and smile, he reaches out to masses with folded hands. “Sir, you don’t have to bow before us. You made our state and country proud. We feel sad when you come to us with folded hands,” a college girl at Victoria College told Sreedharan. He thanked her and reminded her that Victoria is his alma mater. He and the former Chief Election Commissioner were classmates at Victoria College.“If you elect me I will develop the area and make Palakkad one of the best cities in the country. I have enough ideas but you have to help me,” he told another crowd in Petta in the city. It is a fact that it is a gentleman’s game in Palakkad with no mud-slinging or personal attacks. His entry catapulted the constituency into headlines.“The BJP is the most misunderstood party in Kerala and its opponents compete themselves to discredit it. Both fronts damaged the state beyond repair. Under PM’s Modi dynamic leadership, the country is surging ahead and its signs are visible in Kerala also and the party will be a kingmaker soon,” he said.Photos of Pambhan bridge in Rameswaram, Konkan Railway and Delhi Metro pop up (his main contributions) at some places but he refuses to mention them in any meetings. “We have to look ahead,” comes in his reply whenever he is asked about his professional feats.But his opponents agree he chose a “wrong party”. “He is a man of high integrity and stature. But he joined a party that is wedded to divisive ideology. People are best judges, let them decide,” said his main rival, young sitting legislator Shafi Parambhil of the Congress.In the 2016 assembly election, Parambhil had defeated Shobha Surendran of the BJP with over 17,000 votes. CPI(M) candidate NN Krishnadas, a former MP, came third here. This time also the main fight is between the Congress and the BJP but CPI(M) candidate CP Pramod claims the main fight to be between his party and the BJP.An engineer by profession, the ‘Metro Man’ is banking on the growth trajectory of the BJP in Palakkad. In 2011, the party’s vote share stood at 19.86 per cent which went up to 29.08 per cent in 2016. In the fierce three-cornered contest, five per cent more will make much impact, his followers vouch. The party thinks that Sreedharan will able to add a large number of independent votes and he can cross the bridge easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-born-politician-but-learning-fast-metro-man-on-track-with-his-2nd-innings-101616741488038.html

26-03-2021||India||Supreme Court refuses to stop sale of electoral bonds ahead of assembly polls||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to stop the fresh sale of electoral bonds from April 1 till it decides on the validity of the instrument used for donating money to political parties. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, held that the electoral bonds were being issued periodically after a consultation with the Election Commission of India and that there was no change in circumstances that required it to put brakes on the sale at this juncture. The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, underlined that electoral bonds had been sold in the last three years in specified months as well. The court order came on an interim application moved by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), which requested that the court restrain the sale of these bonds ahead of the assembly elections in four states and a Union Territory. The elections start on March 27, and end on April 29. The counting of votes is on May 2. Also Read | EC supports electoral bonds, seeks transparency: Here’s what it told SCEarlier, the ADR questioned what it called “anonymous funding to political parties”, adding transparency in elections was a right of voters not under the Right to Information Act but as a matter of right in a democracy. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing ADR, argued that there was a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies. Rebutting the allegations, attorney general KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, referred to certain checks and balances. He said that parties were required to file their income tax returns each year showing how they expended the money. The political party could face deregistration if it was found to participate in anti-national or illegal activities. Venugopal also said that the use of bonds was essential for the country as it curbed black money being used in elections. On its part, the Election Commission (EC) told the Supreme Court that it supported the existing system of political party funding through electoral bonds, although it added that it would like the process to be more transparent.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for EC said, “The Commission is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing it. If we don’t support it we will go into a pre-existing system of receiving donations through cash. Electoral bonds goes one step forward as all bonds have to be obtained from the bank only. This way there is accountability. But we are also asking for transparency. That can be considered later by the court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-to-stop-sale-of-electoral-bonds-ahead-of-assembly-polls-101616740407768.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said that in April last year interim orders were passed by the court directing political parties to submit receipts of electoral bonds to EC in a sealed cover. This was held by the court of being a sufficient safeguard.The apex court’s order came on an application moved by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), which had requested the court to restrain sales of these bonds ahead of the assembly elections. The ADR claimed that bonds should not be issued as “it legalised bribery by companies to political parties”.The Election Commission of India, however, backed the sale of bonds but raised concerns over its transparency. Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for EC said, “The Commission is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing it. If we don’t support it we will go into a pre-existing system of receiving donations through cash. Electoral bonds goes one step forward as all bonds have to be obtained from the bank only. This way there is accountability. But we are also asking for transparency. That can be considered later by the Court.”The court had reserved the order in the case on March 24 after hearing arguments from all the parties.During the hearing, the Attorney General of India KK Venugopal assured the court that funds received through electoral bonds were white money that could only be issued through cheque and demand draft, and for which Know Your Customer (KYC) norms had to be followed, according to news agency PTI.Meanwhile, advocate Prashant Bhushan appearing for ADR, cited a letter written by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Shaktikanta Das, which states that the electoral bond scheme was fraught with risk and would impact India's financial system. PTI reported. He was also quoted as saying that the RBI raised serious objections and said this will facilitate money laundering through shell company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-to-stay-sale-of-fresh-electoral-bonds-from-april-1-ahead-of-polls-in-4-states-and-union-territory-of-puducherry-101616738398545.html

Friday’s Bharat Bandh, from 6am to 6pm, marks the completion of four months of the farmer’s agitation.The farmers have been camping at various borders of Delhi since November 26 last year demanding a complete rollback of the new farm laws.Farmer union leader Rakesh Tikait, who was in Haryana's Yamunanagar last night on Thursday has asserted that the nationwide shutdown will be a success and will have the support of many. "We are demanding that the three laws should be taken back for the last four months and the government has to accept the demands," he said.While the blockade has been called across states, its impact was majorly seen in the northern states of Punjab and Haryana and Delhi. The farmers have gathered at several highways and roads in the two states including in Bathinda, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Patiala, Mohali, Rohtak, Jhajjar and Bhiwani districts.Some of the protesters also blocked the Ambala-Delhi highway near Ambala Cantt, police said. According to officials, heavy security has been deployed in the two states.The shutdown was also observed in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh where members of Left parties held demonstrations at Maddilapalem junction against the Centre’s agriculture laws and privatisation of Vizag steel plant, news agency ANI said, adding that a rally will be organised at National Highway-16, which is connected between Kolkata to Chennai, later in the day.The Samkyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has appealed to protesters to be peaceful and not get involved in any kind of illegitimate debate and conflict during the 'bandh'. "All shops, malls, markets and institutions will remain closed under complete Bharat Bandh. All minor and big roads and trains will be blocked. All services will remain suspended except for ambulance and other essential services. The effect of Bharat Bandh will be observed inside Delhi as well," the umbrella body of protesting unions said in a statement, according to PTI. In a video message, SKM leader Darshan Pal said that supplies of vegetables and milk will also stopped by the protesting farmers.The farmers and the central leadership have so far held 11 rounds of meetings that have failed to end the impasse over the legislation cleared during the monsoon session of Parliament last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-latest-updates-trains-halted-shops-closed-how-nationwide-blockade-called-by-farmers-is-panning-out-101616737018393.html

Before the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, ADR questioned what it called “anonymous funding to political parties”, adding transparency in elections was a right of voters not under the Right to Information Act but as a matter of right in a democracy. Also Read | EC supports electoral bonds, seeks transparency: Here’s what it told SCAdvocate Prashant Bhushan, representing ADR, argued that there was a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies. Rebutting the allegations, attorney general KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, referred to certain checks and balances. He said that parties were required to file their income tax returns each year showing how they expended the money. The political party could face deregistration if it was found to participate in anti-national or illegal activities. Venugopal also said that the use of bonds was essential for the country as it curbed black money being used in elections. On its part, the Election Commission (EC) told the Supreme Court that it supported the existing system of political party funding through electoral bonds, although it added that it would like the process to be more transparent.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for EC said, “The Commission is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing it. If we don’t support it we will go into a pre-existing system of receiving donations through cash. Electoral bonds goes one step forward as all bonds have to be obtained from the bank only. This way there is accountability. But we are also asking for transparency. That can be considered later by the court.” The new application has been moved in a pending petition on this issue by the same organisation filed in 2017. ADR pointed out that the petition challenging electoral bonds wa pending in the Supreme Court since September 2017. The matter was last heard on January 20 last year, following which ADR requested the court in October last year to list the matter ahead of the assembly elections in Bihar.In its PIL, ADR sought that the amendments carried out to the Finance Act providing an anonymous route for political parties to receive corporate funding through electoral bonds be struck down. These donations enjoy 100% tax exemption as they don’t have to be reported to the Income Tax department either, the petition added. “The Electoral Bonds Scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” that application filed by ADR stated, adding that the Finance Act of 2017 exempts use of electoral bonds from disclosure under the Representation of Peoples Act. ADR moved applications in March 2019 and again in November 2019 to stay the implementation of the Electoral Bond Scheme but they were not granted. In April 2019, the Supreme Court, in an interim order, asked political parties to disclose to the Election Commission in sealed covers details of donations received by way of electoral bonds. In the same order, the top court observed that the matter of electoral bonds gives rise to “weighty issues which have a tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country” which require an in-depth hearing. Out of more than ₹6,000 crore worth of Electoral Bonds sold so far, nearly ₹2,551 crore were sold in 2018-19. As per the annual audit report submitted by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with the Election Commission, the party received the highest amount of electoral bonds amounting to ₹1450.89 crore i.e. 56.9% of the total. The Congress received nearly ₹383.26 crore which is 15% of the total. The amount received by the BJP in 2018-19 was nearly seven times the amount it received the previous year and alone constituted 60.2% of the total income, which in the previous year was only 20.4%. Electoral bonds received by Congress in 2018-19 amounted to ₹383.26 crore whereas it was only ₹5 crore in 2017-18. Electoral bonds accounted for 41.7% of the total income earned by INC in 2018-19, while it was only 2.5% of the income in 2017-18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-deliver-order-on-stopping-fresh-sale-of-electoral-bonds-ahead-of-polls-101616736087670.html

Here is all you need to know about the observation:• The court held that such systems were an affront to human dignity and should change for future batches.• It dealt a blow to the army selection board decision of November by which only 277 of 615 eligible women short-service commission officers were granted permanent commission.• The court allowed the remaining officers who lost out on the opportunity to get a second chance. • The court said the women officers to be considered will have to achieve the 60% merit cut-off, fulfil the medical criteria and qualify the vigilance and disciplinary clearance.• It said the pattern of evaluation by excluding subsequent achievements of the petitioners and failing to account for the inherent patterns of discrimination that were produced as a consequence of casual grading and skewed incentive structures have resulted in indirect and systemic discrimination. Also Read | Supreme Court orders status quo on water supply to Delhi• The court said the discrimination has caused economic and psychological harm and an affront to their dignity• “We must recognise here that the structures of our society have been created by males and for males.

Hiran’s Scorpio was allegedly used by arrested Mumbai Police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze to plant explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, to regain his reputation. The central agency is also questioning Vinayak Shinde (a convicted constable) and Naresh Gour (a bookie), who were arrested by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) earlier this week for allegedly killing Hiran at the behest of Vaze. NIA, while taking custody of Vaze on Thursday, said they need to interrogate him as both cases are connected. Officials cited above said they will confront Vaze with Shinde and Gour on Friday to unearth the entire conspiracy. An initial examination of several witnesses revealed that Hiran was killed after he refused to take the blame for parking the explosive-laden SUV on Carmichael Road that day (600 metres from Antilia), they said. Also Read | Being made a scapegoat, says Sachin Vaze; in custody till April 3Hiran’s autopsy report is also being analysed by a team of investigators and medical experts to look into the cause of death. Hiran’s body was found at the creek with his mouth stuffed with handkerchiefs and covered with a scarf, and all his personal belongings, including his ring, chain and wrist watch, were missing. Hiran’s wife Vimla had told the cops that her husband left home in an auto-rickshaw the previous night and had even filed a missing complaint. NIA officials, who didn’t want to be named, said they will record statements from Hiran’s family members as well. The agency is also analysing mobile phones, emails and documents of Shinde and Gour. It will also look into financial dealings of Vaze and other officers of Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) – which was headed by Vaze, officials said. As reported by HT exclusively, Vaze had planned the explosives in front of Antilia allegedly to prove his worth to Mumbai Police. Vaze was suspended for three years, from 2004 to 2007.

Modi said he was looking forward to participating in the National Day celebrations, which will also commemorate the birth centenary of “Bangabandhu” Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation of Bangladesh.On Monday, India announced that the Gandhi Peace Prize for the year 2020 would be conferred on the Bangladeshi leader for his “immense and unparalleled contribution” in “inspiring the liberation of Bangladesh”. “Bangabandhu was one of the tallest leaders of the last century, whose life and ideals continue to inspire millions,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-begins-2-day-visit-to-bangladesh-from-today-101616716951665.html

26-03-2021||India||Fast-track court begins trial five years after Akhlaq’s murder||A fast-track court on Thursday started the trial in the murder of Mohammad Akhlaq five years after he was allegedly lynched by a mob over suspicion of storing beef in his house in Dadri’s Bisada village. Akhlaq’s son Danish, then 22, was seriously injured while trying to save his father.The victim’s family could not appear before the court on Thursday, the first day for the trial, after the charges were framed against the suspects on February 25 this year for the September 28, 2015, incident.The matter is being heard in the court of Dr Anil Kumar Singh, additional district judge, Fast Track Court – 1.“The charges were framed against the suspects recently. The defence lawyers moved discharge applications but they were rejected by the court. Now, the trial has begun in this case. The victim’s kin and witnesses are required to testify in the court for evidence,” said Yusuf Saifi, counsel for Akhlaq’s family.Saifi added that his clients did not receive the court summon for appearance. “They may attend the next hearing on April 14, once they receive summons,” he said. Akhlaq’s daughter Shaishta, son Danish, and wife Ikraman, are among the key witnesses in this case.Of the 18 suspects, two persons have died and three suspects were juveniles at the time of the incident. The court has framed charges against the 13 adult suspects. The accused who were minors at the time of Akhlaq’s killing will be tried by the Juvenile Justice Board , said Saifi.The government has given security to Akhlaq’s elder son Sartaj and brother Jaan Mohammad.Akhlaq was beaten to death and his son severely assaulted on September 29 by a mob in his village which accused him of eating beef. The mob -- which gathered following a public announcement from a nearby temple -- attacked Akhlaq and his son, Danish, even as family members kept screaming that the meat was not ’beef’. Later, a report by a veterinary officer with the Uttar Pradesh government revealed that the meat found in Akhlaq’s house was not beef.“The suspects have denied the charges. The court will begin the trial now,” said Ram Saran Nagar, counsel for the accused Hariom and Bhim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fasttrack-court-begins-trial-five-years-after-akhlaq-s-murder-101616714266085.html
26-03-2021||India||Genome analysis for reinfection cases in capital||Samples of anyone with a past history of Covid-19 who tests positive again, or those who catch the disease after getting two doses of a vaccine, will be mandatorily sent for whole genome sequencing, the Delhi government ordered on Thursday. The decision is aimed at augmenting surveillance to look for any concerning variants.The decision comes a day after the Centre said it found the presence of a novel variant of Sars-Cov-2 in Delhi in nine samples, while 65 others had the UK variant B.1.1.7. It is yet to be established how the novel variant changes the nature of the virus, but it contains two mutations (E484Q and L452R) that could make it spread more readily or evade the immunity conferred by a past infection or a vaccine. The directorate general of health services (DGHS) directive also said that each district has to send 12 samples (three each of mild, moderate, severe and critical cases) of Covid-19 positive cases per week to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for whole genome sequencing. “This will help us in detecting which strain is causing most of the infections here – whether it is the new variant, other variants such as UK, South Africa or Brazil, or something else,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/genome-analysis-for-reinfection-cases-in-capital-101616713934675.html
26-03-2021||India||Being made a scapegoat, says Sachin Vaze; in custody till April 3||A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Thursday extended the custody of suspended Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze till April 3 after the federal investigative agency told the court that it found 62 cartridges from his residence which were unaccounted for and that 25 bullets issued by the police department to him were missing.NIA officials have said that Vaze is the man behind the Antilla explosives case. On February 25, a green Scorpio was found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence. It contained a bag with 20 loose sticks of gelatin (with no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani and his wife. Vaze, who used to head the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of Mumbai Police’s Crime Branch, was initially in charge of the case.NIA took over the probe on March 9 following an order by the Union home ministry and arrested Vaze on March 13. It is also probing Vaze’s role in the death of Mansukh Hiran, a Thane businessman linked to the car.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, representing NIA, told the court that Vaze was issued 30 bullets by his department, but NIA was able to find only five at his Thane residence during searches. Singh said that NIA had seized 62 cartridges from Vaze’s house that are unaccounted for.“I have been made a scapegoat in this entire incident and have nothing to do with the crime,” Vaze told the court on Thursday. “I was the investigating officer for one-and-a-half days and I did what was required to investigate the case... Not only me, but all Crime Branch officers and Mumbai Police also did (what was required),” Vaze said. “But suddenly something changed and when I went to NIA on March 13, I was put under arrest,” he told the judge through his lawyer, senior advocate Abad Ponda.NIA on Wednesday said it would invoke sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), an anti-terror law, against Vaze. The sections deal with conspiring to commit a terror act.ASG Singh told the court of special NIA judge PR Sintre on Thursday that the agency wanted to probe how Vaze managed to accumulate such a sizable stock of ammunition. He told the court that Vaze has not been cooperating and was yet to reveal crucial information such as the provenance of the loose gelatin sticks.Ponda said that since there was no detonator, the case did not fall under UAPA. The scope of the anti-terrorist law, Ponda said, extended only if there was an intention to hurt the unity, sovereignty, integrity and security of the country and target a community. The judge extended Vaze’s remand by 15 days instead of 30, as is permissible under the UAPA.The murderThe ASG said the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran was connected to the bomb scare and needed to be probed.Hiran, an auto parts dealer who was previously known to Vaze, had borrowed the Scorpio vehicle between November and the first week of February. His body washed up ashore the Reti Bunder creek on March 5.Following his death, Hiran’s wife sought a probe against Vaze.NIA took Vaze to the creek on Thursday night to reconstruct the crime scene.At a press conference held earlier this week, Maharashtra ATS chief Jaijeet Singh -- whose unit was involved in Hiran death probe -- said Vaze was the “mastermind” and the murder was carried out by Naresh Gor (a bookie) and Vinayak Shinde (a former constable).Both men are now in the custody of NIA, which was also handed over the murder case files, evidence and post mortem reports on Thursday.Sharing details of the investigation, an NIA officer told HT, “As part of his plan to produce a sensational case in Mumbai and then solve it in record time, the arrested assistant police inspector, who was in charge of the CIU, asked Hiran to leave his Scorpio on the highway on February 17.”“Hiran, after leaving the car on Mulund-Airoli Road, met Vaze near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus the same day, and handed over the keys as asked by the officer. Vaze then asked Hiran to lodge a complaint (of a missing car), which Hiran filed on February 18,” the officer added.Once he was made the investigating officer, Vaze asked Hiran to take the rap, but the latter demurred, said a second NIA officer. NIA officials believe Vaze’s plan was to create a link between Hiran (once he confessed) and some Pakistani terror group or suspect, to make it look like a conspiracy planned by Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence. The officials admitted this remains a theory yet to be proved.New leadsNIA officials said they have Vaze’s call records, showing multiple calls to and from Hiran in February and much before that. They also claim to have his location data, his presence at various locations as seen in CCTV footage, and testimony from witnesses.NIA told the court on Thursday that Vaze, during the time he was tasked to investigate the explosives in the Scorpio, allegedly collected and destroyed CCTV footage of several places.ASG Singh said that at least seven relevant Digital Video Recordings were destroyed by the accused, but the agency collected at least 112 TB data in the form of Call Detail Records (CDR) and Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDR) and the team wished to confront Vaze with this.NIA also said it has collected forensic evidence such as burnt clothes, ₹5.73 lakh cash with a note counting machine, several number plates, as well as other samples from five cars, including a Mercedes Vaze drove and an Innova of the Crime Branch.Explosives plantedFrom February 17 to 25, the Scorpio was with Vaze and his associates in CIU, investigations revealed. On February 25, a fourth NIA investigator said, Vaze and a constable of CIU went in a convoy of two cars — the Scorpio and an Innova — to Carmichael Road around 2:20am to drop the Scorpio, laden with gelatin sticks, near Ambani’s residence, Antilia. A threat letter, addressed to Ambani and his wife, Nita, had already been placed beforehand in the vehicle. “Vaze and the constable took turns to drive Scorpio and then they returned in the Innova,” the officer said.“But, around 4.30am, Vaze returned to the spot to check the Scorpio as he thought he had left his identity card in it by mistake,” the officer added. This visit, NIA officials said, has been established by CCTV footage from Mulund toll naka, where the Innova can be seen re-entering Mumbai from Thane around 4am after leaving the city half-an-hour earlier.NIA officials said the agency will likely make the constable, whom they did not name, a witness rather than charge him in conspiracy.(With inputs from Neeraj Chauhan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/being-made-a-scapegoat-says-sachin-vaze-in-custody-till-april-3-101616713186464.html
26-03-2021||India||Army’s criteria go against women: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Thursday came down hard on what it called “male for male” structures in the army that resulted in several deserving women short-service commission officers from being considered for permanent commission, holding that such systems were an affront to human dignity and should change for future batches.Dealing a blow to the army selection board decision of November by which only 277 of 615 eligible women short-service commission officers (WSSCOs) were granted permanent commission, the bench allowed the remaining officers who lost out on the opportunity to get a second chance. The court said the women officers to be considered will have to achieve the 60% merit cut-off, fulfil the medical criteria and qualify the vigilance and disciplinary clearance.“The pattern of evaluation, by excluding subsequent achievements of the petitioners and failing to account for the inherent patterns of discrimination that were produced as a consequence of casual grading and skewed incentive structures, has resulted in indirect and systemic discrimination. This discrimination has caused an economic and psychological harm and an affront to their dignity,” a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said.“We must recognise here that the structures of our society have been created by males and for males. As a result, certain structures that may seem to be the ‘norm’... are a reflection of the insidious patriarchal system,” the bench said, attacking the criteria of benchmarking women officers against their male counterparts as indirectly discriminatory.The court had in February last year held in favour of women being eligible for permanent commission in the army’s non-combat streams. As per a list supplied by the army to the court, only 422 of 615 officers fulfilled the merit and discipline criteria. As per the SC judgment, barring the 277 who got selected and 57 who opted out of permanent commission, nearly 280 women officers would have a fresh chance to be considered. This includes 88 officers whose results were withheld.In all, 86 women officers approached the court claiming that the selection board formed by the army pursuant to the court order was a rejection board that benchmarked women against men for consideration of annual confidential reports. Most of the women who were now aged 40-50 were required to show top medical fitness at the time of the fifth and tenth year of service when their male counterparts were considered.On the merit criteria, the court said, “Some of the finest women officers who have served the Indian Army and brought distinction by their performance and achievements have been excluded by refusing to consider their achievements on the specious ground that these were after the 5th/10th year of service.” It noted a few names of officers who received presidential honours and excelled in sporting events but not granted permanent commission.In its 137-page judgment, the court was profuse in its praise for the women officers who showed the tenacity of fighting a protracted legal battle despite hardships of serving in the army and gender stereotypes.The court noted with anguish that “such lack of consideration given to the recent performance of WSSCOs for grant of PC (permanent commission) is a disservice not just to these officers who have served the nation, but also to the Indian Army, which on one hand salutes these officers by awarding them honours and decorations, and on the other hand, fails to assess the true value of these honours when it matters the most — to be treated on an equal footing as male officers who are granted PC.”The army had supported such benchmarking by citing previous internal orders providing for grant of 250 permanent commissions in a year provided that the officers met the 60% cut-off grade. The court directed the army to revise its criteria for evaluation of ACRs and cut-offs for grant of permanent commissions to future batches.Justice Chandrachud, writing the judgment, observed: “A superficial sense of equality is not in the true spirit of the Constitution and attempts to make equality only symbolic… It is not enough to proudly state that women officers are allowed to serve the nation in the armed forces, when the true picture of their service conditions tells a different story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armys-criteria-go-against-women-supreme-court-101616712958188.html

On Thursday, Bengaluru registered 1,623 fresh cases out of the total of 2,523 from across the state.“There is a spike in cases every day. It is increasingly found in passengers arriving in the city from other states. As of now, the requirement (of a test report) is for those coming from Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab and Chandigarh (to Bengaluru). But going forward, it is applicable to visitors from all states ,“ the minister said.However, only visitors from Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab and Chandigarh need negative Covid-19 RT-PCR test reports for travelling to other parts of Karnataka.Government officials said people without test reports will be tested, and asked to be in quarantine till the results are available. They also added that the requirement isn’t just for visitors but also Bengaluru and Karnataka residents who travel outside the state and then return.Stating that 60% of the cases in Bengaluru have a history of inter-state travel, Sudhakar said the government will revive the practice of stamping the hands of those who need to undergo home isolation. “Many young people who are supposed to undergo home isolation are freely walking around because they are asymptomatic 9and there is no way of knowing they need to be in quarantine). We need to curb this,” he said.The government has also decided to resume its Quarantine Watch application which was suspended after the state witnessed a drop in Covid cases, to monitor those undergoing home isolation.On Thursday, the State Disaster Management Board has directed the commissioner of BBMP, all deputy commissioners, and all authorities concerned to prevent public gatherings during upcoming festivals such as Holi and Good Friday.On Wednesday, the state government proposed imposing strict penalties on establishments such as hotels, departmental stores and organisers of public events or large gatherings who fail to enforce safety protocols.In a late night order, the government announced a fine of ₹5,000-10,000 on all establishments found violating safety protocols such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing.“The owners of the establishment will be responsible for: a) ensuring compulsory wearing of masks and social distancing; b) enforcing restrictions on the number of persons to be allowed,” the order read.As a precautionary measure, the government has limited the number of wedding attendees to 500 in open spaces and 200 in closed areas; it has permitted a gathering of 50 to 100 people in birthday parties and funerals, depending on whether they are held in enclosed or open spaces; and it has restricted the number of attendees to 500 at religious and political events.There are currently 18,207 active coronavirus cases in Karnataka. As many as 12,471 people have succumbed to the virus while 978,478 patients have recovered. According to the Union health ministry, 3,044,524 (a little over three million) vaccine doses have been administered in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtpcr-negative-report-now-must-to-enter-bengaluru-101616706350902.html
26-03-2021||India||CBI may probe only key bank frauds||The government is considering having the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) look into some extraordinary bank frauds, with specialised agencies such as the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) being asked to investigate most other cases -- a move aimed at allaying the fear of being prosecuted for purely commercial decisions that is forcing bankers to go slow on lending.CBI may be kept out of most loan default cases, two people familiar with the thinking in the government said on condition of anonymity. The economy, recovering from the devastating impact of the still ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, needs higher credit growth, but bank employees are hesitating to sanction loans fearing CBI, they added.The ministries of home, finance and corporate affairs, SFIO, CBI and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) did not respond to email queries seeking comment.India’s economy shrank by 24.4% in the three months ended June 30 and 7.3% in the three months ended October, before entering growth territory and expanding by 0.4% in the three months ended December 31. The government has estimated the entire year’s GDP contraction at 8%.Higher credit growth is one of the requirements to accelerate gross domestic product (GDP), one of the two people said. According to the latest data of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) annualised non-food bank credit growth in January this year was slower at 5.7% compared to 8.5% in the same period last year. Credit to industry, however, contracted by 1.3% in January 2021 as compared to 2.5% growth in January 2020, it said.In December 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the HT Leadership Summit that bank employees should not be penalised for “genuine business decisions”. The same month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said honest bankers need not to fear the three Cs – CBI, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).But numbers present the rationale behind the fear.In just three years, from 2018 till 2020, CBI registered bank fraud cases involving amounts over ₹1 lakh crore, according to an HT analysis of the agency’s first information reports (FIRs). In 2020 alone, the agency registered over 200 bank fraud cases, involving amount totaling ₹70,000 crore, the highest ever in a year. In 2019, close to 100 bank fraud cases were filed by CBI involving around ₹20,000 crore .The agency has also hired around 50 bank officials on deputation in last few years to assist it in banking investigations.To be sure, it is likely that high-profile cases involving significant defaults, or fugitive borrowers, will still be investigated by the agency. For instance, CBI has been investigating the IDBI Bank - Kingfisher Airlines case, involving the latter’s promoter, Vijay Mallya.It is also likely that CBI will investigate bank fraud cases where the promoters have fled the country. The government informed the parliament in September last year that 38 people, named in bank fraud cases, fled India between 2015 and 2019.Soumya Datta, general secretary, All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) said: “The proposed move (restricting CBI’s role in the banking sector) will certainly benefit all stakeholders. We have already raised our concerns to the government that there is a fear psychosis in the banking industry.”Datta said that officials are often scared to lend and the bankers are not inclined to settle bad loans to avoid harassment by the investigative agencies. A senior executive of a large state-owned bank said on condition of anonymity that “bank officials do not want to take even legitimate decisions that could invite attention of agencies like CBI and jeopardise their careers”.Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Company, said the proposed move to give larger responsibility to SFIO for handling bulk of bank-related cases is pragmatic and will address larger number of cases while saving CBI’s time and resources so that it can focus on big-ticket cases.“Robust credit culture is the need of the hour for revival of the economy and the efforts of the government to augment growth by improving the credit culture can be achieved with not only strong principles and actions but also pragmatic deterrents and rewards within the lending organisations,” he said.A former CBI director said on condition of anonymity that “CBI should only register big fraud cases and smaller cases can be given to the states’ economic offences wing”. He added that the floor “for example, cases above ₹500 crore” has to be decided by the government..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-may-probe-only-key-bank-frauds-101616706344918.html
26-03-2021||India||Growth, Assamese identity key issues in polls: Sarma||Guwahati Assam finance minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Himanta Biswa Sarma said that identity and development will be the key issues in the assembly polls scheduled to start on March 27.The party, head of the ruling coalition in the state, has set a target of winning over 100 seats along with its allies in the 126-member Assam assembly, he said. The BJP itself, Sarma claimed, would improve its tally “significantly”.“The BJP is contesting more seats than the last time; our allies have given us more space,” Sarma added.In the 2016 state polls, the BJP won 60 of the 89 seats it contested. In the upcoming three-phase elections, the party is contesting 92 seats, while its allies, the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), will contest eight and 26 seats respectively.“This election will be fought on the issues of identity and development in equal measure,” Sarma said.While the party is facing anti-incumbency and a backlash in some regions of the state over the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Sarma said the state government’s welfare schemes will help the BJP increase its tally.The party is banking on improving its tally in 47 seats in the Upper Assam region where anti-CAA sentiment was a major concern for the party. The BJP won 35 of these 47 seats in 2016.“Our target is to add at least 5 to 6 more seats here. Whether we will be able to maintain the lead in the second and third phase we will have to see, because there is a chance of losing about 10 seats in the second and the third phase [where the opposition has more strongholds]. At the end, the party will eventually make up for the losses because we are contesting more seats,” Sarma said.Violent protests erupted in 2019 after Parliament approved the Citizenship Amendment Bill which seeks to fast-track the grant of citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. In Assam, where fear of outsiders translated into a seven-year long protest ending with the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985, some people saw the law as an instrument that would legitimise the claims of outsiders. The Assam Accord set the deadline for foreigners or outsiders entering the state to be treated as residents (and granted citizenship) as March 1975. CAA shifted this to December 2014, creating a stir in the state.Two regional parties, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and the Raijor Dal, are hoping to dent the BJP’s vote share in the region, banking on the anti-CAA sentiment.Sarma, however, dismissed these concerns. “They will not affect our traditional vote bank. These parties [AJP and RD] will dent the Congress vote bank by about 2000-3000 votes in all the constituencies.”The updated NRC for Assam, released in August 2019, excluded 1.9 million of the nearly 33 million applicants. Calling the list faulty, the BJP said that the names of many genuine citizens were left out. The NRC is yet to be notified.In lower Assam, where there is a significant Muslim population in constituencies such as Barpeta, Bongaigaon, and Nalbari , the BJP is confident that alliance with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF may end up hurting the Congress. While admitting that the Congress-AIUDF combine has a “good chance” in the region, Sarma said a shift from the “strategic alliance” between the Congress and the AIUDF to a “formal alliance” has upset traditional Congress voters.“In seats such as Nazira, which were once seen as strongholds of the Congress, people are not voting for them because of the alliance [with AIUDF],” Sarma pointed out, adding that a “strategic alliance” or announcement of a deeper alliance after tge first phase of polling may have actually helped the Congress.The BJP believes the Congress will lose between six to seven seats in its strongholds. “The alliance may help them in lower and middle Assam, but there is the loss that the party will face in the Northern and upper part of the state,” he said.The Congress, which has come under sharp attack from the BJP for its alliance with the allegedly communal AIDUF, has said that the ruling party is trying to polarize voters. “They had no problems contesting the district council elections sitting in Ajmal’s lap. When they wanted seats in the Rajya Sabha they went to Ajmal for his votes and now when he has rejected them he has suddenly become communal. The BJP’s three principles of fighting an election are divide and rule, distract and rule and distort and rule,” said Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh.Sarma said that the conflict with Ajmal is “civilisational”. “Our culture is different, and reconciliation is not easily possible. This conflict was not started by Ajmal, he is the symbol of what is inimical to us. He symbolizes civilisational conflict,” he said.“He is an Indian but not an Assamese. From 1935, the late Gopinath Bordoloi started the Congress versus Muslim League fight, it was then taken up by the AGP and now depends on the BJP. This is a real battle in Assam, which we call a civilisational conflict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/growth-assamese-identity-key-issues-in-polls-sarma-101616706326863.html
26-03-2021||India||Raipur bans entry to tourist spots amid Covid-19 spike||The Raipur district administration on Thursday banned the entry of people at tourism spots and prohibited religious, social, political and other gathering to contain the spread of Covid-19 after a fresh spike in cases has hit Chhattisgarh hard over the past 11 days, leading to more than 100 deaths.Raipur has also made seven days’ home quarantine mandatory for anyone entering the city from other states.Chhattisgarh reported 2,419 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the state’s highest single-day spike in the last four months. On November 23 last year, Chhattisgarh had recorded 2,061 cases. Raipur district reported 573 new cases on Thursday.With 14 more Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours, the statewide toll mounted to 4,025, a health official said. Officials said that cases have been rising sharply since March 13, when Chhattisgarh recorded 543 cases.According to a statement on Wednesday by the district administration, Holi celebrations and other public gatherings have been banned (Holi falls on March 29), although the ritual of ‘Holika Dahan’, the previous evening, has been permitted in groups of no larger than five people.“All kinds of religious festivals, cultural and political programmes, sports, exhibitions and fairs, functions and public programmes have been banned. Religious places will remain open for only paying obeisance and people can enter places of worship individually, but organising any kind of group or public programmes will be prohibited,” the statement said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raipur-bans-entry-to-tourist-spots-amid-covid-19-spike-101616706320846.html
26-03-2021||India||‘No vaccine shortage, states have used only 54 of 80 million doses sent’||States across the country have together used up 54 million of the roughly 80 million doses of coronavirus vaccines distributed till now, according to government figures as of 8pm on Thursday, as officials maintained that the country has adequate doses for now while more are expected to be shipped within the next week.On average, over the week, India has administered 2.3 million doses a day. At this rate, accounting for wastage of about 6.5% (as estimated by the government), the existing stock will last for around eight days.Last week, India placed orders for 120 million more doses. “We expect these shipments to begin over the weekend – almost certainly before the end of the month,” said a person aware of the vaccine logistics, asking not to be named.Government officials have not shared details of stocks in different regions, and multiple states, including Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Maharashtra, have in the past month raised concerns of looming shortages over the past month.“India has enough supplies to vaccinate its vulnerable population,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on the sidelines of the ministry’s weekly media briefing on Covid-19 on Wednesday. “Centre has distributed 80,700,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses to all states and union territories so far, and has enough supplies to cater to country’s demands” he added.“We are receiving the vaccine doses regularly, there is no problem with the supply. There is no shortage in the institute,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.A senior Delhi government official, who asked not to be named, too said that there was no shortage in the state.India’s vaccine stocks appear to be on a stronger footing, especially when compared to the European Union where low stocks have triggered police raids on warehouses and diplomatic disputes with other nations such as the UK and Australia.The situation in the country is helped by the capacity of India’s pharma industry – Serum Institute of India, which is manufacturing Covishield (the dose developed as AZD1222 by Oxford-AstraZeneca), is the world’s largest vaccine maker by volume. SII CEO Adar Poonawalla has in the past said he expects production capacity to reach 100 million doses a month this year.“In case of emergencies, we are equipped to ship large tranches at short notice to any part of the country,” the person quoted above added.While India’s vaccination rate is the second highest in the world (behind US), it also has a large population it needs to target. With the country having entered its second wave of the pandemic, with cases accelerating at the fastest pace seen yet, experts are calling for people and the government to do more to quicken the vaccination campaign.“Vaccine hesitancy is common whenever there is a new vaccine in market, and since it is one of the key measures to control the outbreak, the primary job of all stakeholders is to ensure concerns regarding vaccines are allayed. The government is making an effort in this direction,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonology, AIIMS, Delhi.Government experts have reiterated on several occasions recently that both vaccines approved for use in India are safe, and there was no clotting reported related to Covishled in the country as was the case abroad due to which some European countries paused use of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.The other vaccine in use is Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.“Covishield is safe and there is no signal of concern regarding it as of now,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog during the briefing on Wednesday.India’s adverse effect monitoring mechanism did not find any concerns, he added.ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava, at the same briefing, also said both doses were effective against the UK and the Brazilian variants of Sars-Cov-2. Research, however, is on to know whether the vaccines are effective against the South African variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-vaccine-shortage-states-have-used-only-54-of-80-million-doses-sent-101616706292931.html
26-03-2021||India||Farmers’ Bharat Bandh may impact normal life in Punjab, Haryana today||A call for a 12-hour Bharat Bandh by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of farmers’ unions, on Friday is likely to have an impact in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.The strike, in protest against the three contentious farm laws, is slated to be observed from 6 am till 6 pm. All business establishments, road and rail services will remain suspended during this period.The 32 farmers’ bodies, which are part of SKM, are making efforts to ensure the bandh impact is also felt in other parts of the country, farmer leaders said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, among other states, have been staging a sit-in along Delhi borders, mainly Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, since November 27, seeking repeal of the farm laws – Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act – passed in Parliament in the Monsoon Session. The protesting farmers fear that the new agricultural laws will dismantle the Minimum Support price (MSP) and corporatise farming.Despite 12 rounds of talks, the farmers and the Centre have failed to resolve the stalemate.According to Bharat Kisan Union (BKU) (Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh, an appeal has been issued to all trade unions and traders, banks and government offices to remain shut to make the strike a success.“Samyukt Kisan Morcha has appealed to all sections of the society to participate,” Singh said, adding that farm leaders also visited markets and met representatives of trade unions to seek their support for the bandh.Farm leaders such as BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait and Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav have visited several states in the past one month to create awareness and seek support of local farm bodies for the strike.“Many trade and bank unions who are protesting against selling of the government public sector enterprises have extended their support to the bandh call,” Singh said.No road and rail movement will be allowed during the strike.“Farm unions will block the state and national highways and key rail routes to halt the movement of traffic,” the BKU leader said.In Haryana, Balwant Nambardar, head of Phogat khap, said farmers have decided to block railways at five points and roads across 30 locations in Bhiwani and Dadri districts. “We have asked the farmers to reach their nearby protest site to observe a complete bandh,” he said.INLD state president Nafe Singh Rathee assured the support of his party workers for the bandh.’In Rajasthan, SKM convenor Sanjay Madhav said all shops and markets, barring medical stores, petrol pumps and ambulance services, will remain shut. “Farmers will block the service lane and also Delhi-Jaipur lane on Jaipur-Delhi National Highway at Shahjahanpur along Rajasthan-Haryana border where farmers have been agitating for the last four months,” he said.However, Kota Vyapar Mahasangh president Kranti Jain said no bandh would be observed in the state as the festival season is round the corner.The 32 farmers’ bodies, which are part of SKM, are making efforts to ensure the bandh impact is also felt in other parts of the country, according to farm leaders.Meanwhile in Bihar, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav has decided to club the Bharat Bandh with Bihar Bandh called by his party to protest against the forceful removal of party legislators from the state assembly on Tuesday.“To protest against the death of democracy by chief minister (Nitish Kumar), beating of MLAs, inflation, stand against farm bills, I call for Bihar Bandh on March 26,” Yadav tweeted.In Andhra Pradesh, the protesting workers at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant along with political parties have decided to observe a shutdown in the port city to protest against the Centre’s decision to privatise the steel plant as well as lend support to the farmers’ in their cause.Police officials in various states have said that extra force would be deployed to prevent any untoward incident. Punjab police additional director general (law and order) Ishwar Singh said the field staff have been directed to remain alert while patrolling and setting up of check points have increased.Sonipat superintendent of police Jashandeep Randhawa said he has held a meeting with senior district police officials to maintain law and order at Kundli border among other areas in the district.The bandh is also likely to have an impact in the four election-bound states and one Union territory – Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Assam and Puducherry. In West Bengal, peasant front leaders of Left parties said meetings would be held in this regard (bandh call).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-bharat-bandh-may-impact-normal-life-in-punjab-haryana-today-101616706281948.html
26-03-2021||India||Govt plans round table meeting to brainstorm long-term pollution control plan||Environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday announced a round table conference next month to be attended by experts and different organisations to formulate a long-term action plan to tackle pollution in the national capital. The announcement was made after Rai held a review meeting with officials from the environment department and Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Thursday.“On April 12 and 13, Delhi will hold a round table conference at the Secretariat. Environment experts and others will be called to the conference, so that we can formulate the next action plan…We will take suggestions of experts and different organisations working on pollution and then the Delhi government will discuss and develop an action plan,” Rai said.Last year, the Delhi government ran an anti-dust campaign in Delhi, used a bio-decomposer to stop stubble burning, held a ”red light on, car off” campaign, started a green war room at the Secretariat to monitor and coordinate efforts by different agencies to control air pollution, and also launched the Green Delhi app.The government said after the meeting, officials would engage in the formulation of the action plan based on the advice given by experts. Rai also called for monitoring of all pollution hot spots in Delhi and said agencies related to construction work should be aware of dust pollution norms.“Regular monitoring of all hot spots in Delhi should happen. I am ordering action on complaints that are coming to the green war room. The second important point was discussed on dust pollution. We took action in many places, especially last year. The public works department and the municipal corporations have also been instructed to spray water continuously on roads,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-round-table-meeting-to-brainstorm-long-term-pollution-control-plan-101616699273638.html
26-03-2021||India||11 bills cleared in truncated budget session of Parliament||Indian Parliament’s truncated budget session ended on Wednesday after both Houses cleared 11 bills including the controversial legislation that defined the Delhi government as LG. It was the second session to be held amid the Covid-19 pandemic, after last year’s monsoon session.None of the 13 bills introduced in the session has been referred to parliamentary Committees. According to the PRS Legislative Research, in the current Lok Sabha, so far just 11% of the introduced Bills have been referred for parliamentary scrutiny. The rate is much lower than the 14th (60%), 15th (71%), and 16th (27%) Lok Sabhas.The session was cut short by 10 days as many lawmakers wanted to return to their states ahead of the ensuing assembly elections in four states and the union territory of Puducherry.The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha saw massive protests over soaring fuel prices and vocal opposition to the three contentious farm bills washed out almost the entire first week. But both Houses worked overtime and the Lok Sabha eventually clocked 114% productivity and the Rajya Sabha, 85% in the second half of the budget session that began on March 8.For the first time since the pandemic began, both Houses of Parliament returned to their usual schedule and social distancing norms were partially waived off even as a large section of the MPs remained busy in the poll campaign. The changes were made on account of low attendance, but also a recognition of the low incidence of cases when the session began, and the launch of India’s Covid-19 vaccine drive in January. Unfortunately, the session ended with a surging second wave of infections across the country.The Question Hour and the Zero Hour also returned in the daily schedule after the last session (monsoon, 2020) dispensed with both.The session started with the President’s address, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave his first speech in Parliament after the enactment of the three contentious farm laws in which he told farmers that the government’s doors are always open for talks.The Lok Sabha alone cleared 18 bills, at times worked till midnight and recorded participation of 146 lawmakers in the budget debate that alone lasted for almost 15 hours. After the first week was washed out in disruptions, the Lower House sat late for more than 48 hours to make up for the lost time.Amid the second wave of the Covid pandemic, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who played a key role in resolving the stalemate in the first week, tested positive and missed the last four days of the session. This is the first time, Birla, working without a deputy Speaker since June 2019, missed the proceedings.In his valedictory address, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu informed that the Upper House spent 104 hours and 23 minutes against the total scheduled time of 116 hours and 31 minutes. It lost 21 hours and 26 minutes due to disruptions but worked for extra 14 hours and 28 minutes. Naidu pointed out that the overall productivity of the last five sessions including the latest one was about 94%.Naidu admitted that while efforts are on to improve functioning of the House panels, “there are some areas of concern, such as less attendance of Members and the duration of the meetings, which need further improvement.” He asked party leaders to “sensitize their members” to take the committees’ work “seriously”.The Lok Sabha issued a statement to underline that a total of 583 matters of Urgent Public Importance and a total of 405 matters under Rule 377 were taken up while 48 statements were given by ministers. In the Rajya Sabha, the Union Budget was discussed for 10 hours and 43 minutes on three days. As many as 199 Members participated in the discussion on bills in the Upper House.The next session of Parliament is scheduled to meet in July but the final schedule will be decided keeping in mind the Covid situation.In a press conference after the end of the session, the Congress criticised the government for not sending a single bill to House panels for scrutiny. The Congress’ chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh said: “All these bills will be challenged in courts in the future. The government can claim it was a productive session. But it was possible only because the Congress offered a constructive support to the government to run Parliament.”Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Ramesh and Congress Lok Sabha leader Ravneet Singh Bittu also alleged that the government is selling off public assets to a handful of industrialists. They also added that the Congress was not in the favour of adjourning the session two weeks before its scheduled close.“We highlighted fuel price rise and all issues of the people before the House. But the government brazenly runs the House as it has brute majority. In UPA days, we used to listen to all members,” said Kharge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-bills-cleared-in-truncated-budget-session-of-parliament-101616699287720.html

26-03-2021||India||Supreme Court pulls up govt over delay in appointment of judges||The Supreme Court on Thursday, criticised the central government for delaying the process of appointment of judges, lamenting that it has been sitting on some recommendations for more than 19 months despite the final nod of the collegium.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde underlined that 55 names were pending with the government for more than six months and sought a categorical answer from the government on the timeline to notify appointments of some judges and sending the rest of the names to the collegium for further consideration. The numbers include some final recommendations and some names proposed in the first stage of the appointment.“There are other names too, but these 55 names are the most delayed ones, pending with the government for more than six months. This has gone beyond any degree of reasonable time period,” said the bench, which also included justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant.Justice Kaul referred to a chart prepared by him to demonstrate the vacancy positions in each high court and the pendency of the names at different levels in the appointment process, regretting that problems occurred at every stage.“There should be a reasonable time frame within which the law ministry must respond after receiving the recommendations from the collegium. There are many cases in which there is no response for eight months or even one year. After names are recommended by the collegium, the ministry must make appointment s or send back these names with their objection,” justice Kaul told attorney general KK Venugopal, who appeared for the government.The SC collegium comprises the CJI and two most senior judges of the apex court and decides on matters of appointment of high court and Supreme Court judges.The bench added that after the SC collegium forwards the names of judges to be appointed to the high court to the (Union) government, it (the government) is supposed to take the views of the state government concerned, get a report from the Intelligence Bureau, and then, send the names back to the collegium for further consideration -- but that there appears to be no deadline for this process.“There seems to be no time limit within which this is being done. There are 45 names pending with you for more than 6 months but they are yet to be sent (back) to the collegium. Ten names have been cleared by the collegium finally and under the existing memorandum of procedure, you have to either appoint them or send them back with objections. Once we reiterate the same names, you will have to appoint them. But these 10 names, neither have they been appointed nor have we heard anything about them from the government,” the bench told the A-G.Justice Kaul, reading out from the chart, pointed out there were five names for appointments in the Calcutta HC that are pending with the government for 19 months, since July 25, 2019, despite the final recommendation of the SC collegium. Similarly, one name for the Jammu and Kashmir high court has been pending for 17 months and four names for the Delhi HC, for seven months.About the 45 other names that were still to be referred by the government to the collegium for consideration, justice Kaul said, two names for the Himachal Pradesh HC have been pending for 14 months; 21 names for the Rajasthan HC, for 9 months; 9 names for the Calcutta HC and two names for the Gauhati HC, for 8 months; five names for the Punjab and Haryana HC, for 7 months; and 6 names for the Madhya Pradesh HC, 6 months.“We are really concerned about these 45 names pending with you for more than six months but they are yet to be sent to the collegium. Also, the other 10 names, you must tell us when you are going to notify those appointments. We can pass an order that you will make a statement, or you can tell us that you will make a statement on the next date,” the bench told Venugopal.It also told the A-G that there were 80 names pending with the government but the focus at present was on having clarity regarding these 55 names first. Venugopal assured the bench that he would be able to make a statement on the next date of hearing on April 8 after receiving appropriate instructions from the law ministry.During the hearing, the bench also expressed concern that there were 240 vacancies in high courts for which no names had been recommended by the HC collegium. “That is also a concern, and we are addressing them. We will go step by step,” observed the court.As on March 22, 2021, the 25 high courts in the country have a staggering vacancy of 420 judges -- more than a third of the total positions. There are only 661 judges out of the total sanctioned strength of 1,080.However, there are only 180 names in contemplation for appointment as high court judges against the shortage of 420 judges. Of the 180 names being considered, a majority of the names (131) are pending with the central government with the oldest recommendations for appointment going back to July 2019 for appointment to the Calcutta high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-pulls-up-govt-over-delay-in-appointment-of-judges-101616699301692.html

26-03-2021||India||With highest-ever budget allocation, focus on development: J&K L-G||Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Friday termed the ₹1,08,621-crore budget approved by the central government for Jammu and Kashmir as historic. “The budget has been provided to rebuild the economy, create jobs and secure the future of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” Sinha said. He observed that the quantum jump in the budget allocation in all sectors spoke volumes about the Prime Minister’s resolve towards development of J&K. “J&K had been getting a larger per capita budget than other states even in the past. However, we will ensure that work is being done on ground and the money is being utilised for the welfare of the people without discrimination, besides tapping into the potential of the sectors which are less explored,” he said. On the budget allocation for the Jal Shakti department, Sinha said that with a quantum jump of ₹5,102 crore, taking the total to ₹6,346 crore, the government was hoping to achieve the target under the Prime Minister’s ambitious ‘Har Ghar Nal Se Jal’ programme within the time frame. He said that a provision for ₹2,008 crore has been kept for agriculture and horticulture sectors, which was ₹695 crore more than the previous budget allocation. “For rural development, ₹4,817 crore has been allocated, which is ₹342 crore more than previous years. The tourism sector budget has been given a ₹509 crore hike, taking the budget allocation to ₹786 crore, he said. On health and medical education , he observed that the sector had witnessed a major transformation in the last two years. “And, for the year 2021-22, the sector has an allocation of ₹1,456 crore, ₹190 crore more than the previous year,” he said. Rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrant pandits in valley maybe on cards, hints LGHinting that a proper rehabilitation plan for migrant Kashmiri Pandits maybe in the pipeline, Sinha on Thursday said a lot has been thought about the community and soon “something is going to happen which you have not even imagined”.“The provision of the budget for relief and rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits has also increased. For the welfare of Kashmiri Pandit community, work on 6,000 jobs for them has been accelerated,” he said. For empowerment of district development councils (DDCs) and block development councils (BDCs), a provision of ₹200 crore for 20 DDCs ( ₹10 crore for each DDC) of Jammu and Kashmir, besides ₹25 lakh has been kept for each BDC. Further, ₹30 crore has been earmarked for establishment of DDC/BDC offices and ₹1313 crore has been allocated for Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), he said. Underscoring the targets set by the government aimed at creating more livelihood opportunities and accelerating the development process, the lieutenant governor said as many as 25,000 youth have been provided with financial support under different schemes. On PDP youth leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra’s alleged nexus with militants and his terror funding links, Sinha said , “We have institutions in the country and they work honestly. Let them work independently and probe, I think, will be taken it to its logical conclusion”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-highest-ever-budget-allocation-focus-on-development-j-k-lg-101616702606113.html

26-03-2021||India||Civilians maimed in Pak shelling in Poonch to get artificial limbs||In a bid to improve the lives of civilians maimed during Pakistan’s shelling and firing along the Line of Control, the Indian Army in collaboration with a New Delhi-based NGO will be proving artificial limbs to the victims in Poonch district. An artificial limbs fitment measurement camp was also organised on Thursday. “The Banwat Battalion of Poonch Brigade organised an artificial limbs fitment measurement camp and took measurements of disabled civilians, who lost their limbs during the ceasefire violations and other action along the LoC,” said defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand. A team from the Kiwanis Club, New Delhi, had the measurements of 32 specially-abled people taken free of cost. Beneficiaries had come from different villages of Poonch such as Kausaliyan, Gagriyan, Chool, Saujiyan, Dhanna, Dokri, and Kasba among others, the spokesperson said, adding that it was all the more vital to hold the camp because of its proximity to the line of control and lack of accessibility to hospitals. The NGO will return in a couple of months with artificial limbs for those fitted on Thursday, the spokesperson said, adding that the NGO wanted to provide prosthetics to the needy in a phased manner and wants to cover villages along the LoC that bore the maximum brunt of Pakistan’s shelling in recent times. “Such measurement camps by the Indian Army in remote villages near the border fence in Poonch strengthens the bond between the forces and the people. Such events go a long way in developing goodwill and a sense of togetherness in laying foundation of a patriotic and motivated next generation,” he said. Though the renewed truce between India and Pakistan along the 744 km long line of control (LoC) and 200-km International Border (IB) has brought much needed relief to the villagers as guns have fallen silent on either side of the divide since February 25, many villagers —young and old, men and women — have been maimed in Pak shelling and firing over the years. During Indo-Pak hostilities. Kathua, Samba, Jammu, Poonch and Rajouri districts in Jammu region bear the maximum brunt of shelling, as a result of which hapless villagers either get killed or maimed. Ghulam Nabi of Saujiyan village said that Pak shelling always posed a serious threat to farmers, children, shepherds and cattle. “Those who die are fortunate. Those who lose their limbs suffer as do their families,” he said. Another local Rifat Bi of Kasba village hoped that the ceasefire agreement remains intact and is honoured in letter and spirit by Pakistan. “It will be a boon for people like us who live on the LoC,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civilians-maimed-in-pak-shelling-in-poonch-to-get-artificial-limbs-101616701765133.html
26-03-2021||India||RJD and its allies call for Bihar Bandh today||The Rashtriya Janata Dal and Left parties have called for a Bihar Bandh (shutdown) on March 26, in protest against the alleged assault on legislators during an agitation against the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, inside the state Assembly on Tuesday.Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Thursday said the shutdown had been called against the autocratic attitude of chief minister Nitish Kumar and the way police were allowed entry into the Assembly to evict legislators protesting against the Bill.“The state police have become Janata Dal (United) police. The police were deployed inside the Assembly to get a Bill passed which would give them unbridled powers,” he said at a press conference.Yadav also hit out at the CM for trying to justify the police action inside the Assembly by reasoning that police were called because of the chaos created by Opposition members.“Doesn’t the Opposition have the right to protest inside the House over a bill or any other issue? That does not mean police can be called to evict MLAs and drag out even women legislators. I have footage of how the police and others behaved on that day inside the Assembly,. All democratic values and ethics were thrown to the wind,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-and-its-allies-call-for-bihar-bandh-today-101616701346597.html
26-03-2021||India||Tigress Sundari back in Madhya Pradesh as translocation project fails||A tigress was translocated to Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) from Satkosia Tiger Reserve in Odisha in the wee hours of Thursday, a forest official said.Tigress Sundari, who was relocated from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve three years ago as part of a rehabilitation programme, returned to the state after travelling about 700 km, the official added.The tiger was tranquilized and brought in a van fitted with a cage and released in Ghorela enclosure of Mukki area of KTR in Balaghat district, Rajneesh Singh, public relation officer of wildlife wing of the forest, said.“A team of veterinary doctors checked and left the big cat in the enclosure on Thursday morning. The tigress is completely healthy and active,” KTR joint director S K Sinha said.Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Madhya Pradesh, said: “As part of the rewilding process, we have to check how the tigress is adopting to the habitat and whether she has the capability to kill her prey. On that basis, we will decide whether to release her in the forest or not.”In 2018, Sundari, along with a male tiger Mahavir, was taken to Satkosia Tiger Reserve in Odisha from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve under the first inter-state tiger relocation project in the country, to shore up the tiger population in the state. The relocation was also aimed at reducing the tiger population in areas with excess tigers to reduce territorial disputes and to reintroduce tigers in places where their count has dropped due to various reasons.The project, however, failed after Mahavir was killed by poachers and villagers staged a protest against Sundari as she had reportedly attacked some of them. The forest officials in Odisha then shifted the tigress to an enclosure.A petition was later filed in the Madhya Pradesh high court, seeking return of the tigress following which the state forest department began the rewilding process, Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tigress-sundari-back-in-madhya-pradesh-as-translocation-project-fails-101616699310825.html
26-03-2021||India||Bermuda to Pak: TMC and BJP leaders’ remarks stir up a row||Kolkata: Controversial remarks by leaders across political lines continued to intensify the poll battle in West Bengal on Thursday. While the Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh sought to defend his “Bermuda shorts” remark about chief minister Mamata Banerjee, backlash against Trinamool Congress leader Sheikh Alam’s comment on the state’s Muslim population prompted him to issue an apology. On Thursday, Ghosh said his earlier remarks were an attempt at defending the honor of the saree that all Bengali women wear. Speaking to reporters, Ghosh said, “As chief minister, Mamata Banerjee should act appropriately so that Bengal’s culture is not affected. A woman in a saree should not be showing her legs. People are talking about this. I only raised my objection.”His justification came a day after the state’s ruling TMC shared a 14-second video of Ghosh’s Purulia rally, in which he could be heard saying that the CM should wear Bermuda shorts if she wanted to display the injuries sustained on her leg during a roadshow on March 10. “Her (Banerjee’s) plaster was replaced with crepe bandage. But she is still showing her leg to everyone. She is wearing her saree in such a way that one leg is visible while the other is not. I have never seen anyone wearing saree like this. If she has to show her leg then she can wear Bermudas so that people can see clearly,” Ghosh said. The TMC called the remarks distasteful and lodged a complaint with the Election Commission of India, accusing Ghosh of using indecent language against the chief minister.The row, however, escalated as BJP leaders came out in Ghosh’s defence. The head of BJP’s information technology cell, Amit Malviya, shared a video on Thursday in which Banerjee could be heard making personal comments about BJP leaders. (Have we seen the video? What did Mamata say in the video?)The TMC courted controversy after Alam, a village level leader of the party, said at a public meeting in Birbhum district that “four Pakistan can be created if India’s 30 per cent Muslims unite”. A video of the incident has been widely circulated on social media. “The BJP always talks of 30 % Muslims. If they are segregated, four Pakistans will be created. Where will the remaining 70 % go?” Alam could be heard saying in the video. Later in the day, however, Alam issued an apology. “I was referring to Adhikari’s statement on 30% Muslims in Nandigram. He says he will fight with the support of 70 % voters. I meant to say that if this 30% people are driven out of India, four Pakistans have to be created. I did not mean we want to create four Pakistans in India. I apologize if I have hurt anyone,” Alam said.The BJP, however, lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, even as the TMC distanced itself from Alam. “He is not a member of our party,” the TMC’s Birbhum district unit president Anubrata Mondal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bermuda-to-pak-tmc-and-bjp-leaders-remarks-stir-up-a-row-101616699004276.html
26-03-2021||India||‘No vaccine shortage, states have used only 54 of 80 mn doses sent’||States across the country have together used up 54 million of the roughly 80 million doses of coronavirus vaccines distributed till now, according to government figures as of 8pm on Thursday, as officials maintained that the country has adequate doses for now while more are expected to be shipped within the next week.On an average, over the week, India has administered 2.3 million doses a day. At this rate, accounting for wastage of about 6.5% (as estimated by the government), the existing stock will last for around eight days. Last week, India placed orders for 120 million more doses. “We expect these shipments to begin over the weekend – almost certainly before the end of the month,” said a person aware of the vaccine logistics, asking not to be named. Government officials have not shared details of stocks in different regions, and multiple states, including Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Maharashtra, have in the past month raised concerns of looming shortages over the past month.“India has enough supplies to vaccinate its vulnerable population,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on the sidelines of the ministry’s weekly media briefing on Covid-19 on Wednesday. “Centre has distributed 80,700,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses to all states and union territories so far, and has enough supplies to cater to country’s demands” he added.“We are receiving the vaccine doses regularly, there is no problem with the supply. There is no shortage in the institute,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.A senior Delhi government official, who asked not to be named, too said that there was no shortage in the state.India’s vaccine stocks appear to be on a stronger footing, especially when compared to the European Union where low stocks have triggered police raids on warehouses and diplomatic disputes with other nations such as the UK and Australia. The situation in the country is helped by the capacity of India’s pharma industry – Serum Institute of India, which is manufacturing Covishield (the dose developed as AZD1222 by Oxford-AstraZeneca), is the world’s largest vaccine maker by volume. SII CEO Adar Poonawalla has in the past said he expects production capacity to reach 100 million doses a month this year.“In case of emergencies, we are equipped to ship large tranches at short notice to any part of the country,” the person quoted above added.While India’s vaccination rate is the second highest in the world (behind US), it also has a large population it needs to target. With the country having entered its second wave of the pandemic, with cases accelerating at the fastest pace seen yet, experts are calling for people and the government to do more to quicken the vaccination campaign.“Vaccine hesitancy is common whenever there is a new vaccine in market, and since it is one of the key measures to control the outbreak, the primary job of all stakeholders is to ensure concerns regarding vaccines are allayed. The government is making an effort in this direction,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonology, AIIMS, Delhi.Government experts have reiterated on several occasions recently that both vaccines approved for use in India are safe, and there was no clotting reported related to Covishled in the country as was the case abroad due to which some European countries paused use of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.The other vaccine in use is Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.“Covishield is safe and there is no signal of concern regarding it as of now,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog during the briefing on Wednesday. India’s adverse effect monitoring mechanism did not find any concerns, he added. ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava, at the same briefing, also said both doses were effective against the UK and the Brazilian variants of Sars-Cov-2. Research, however, is on to know whether the vaccines are effective against the South African variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-vaccine-shortage-states-have-used-only-54-of-80-mn-doses-sent-101616698044922.html

26-03-2021||India||SC pulls up govt over delay in appointment of judges||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Thursday, criticised the central government for delaying the process of appointment of judges, lamenting that it has been sitting on some recommendations for more than 19 months despite the final nod of the collegium. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde underlined that 55 names were pending with the government for more than six months and sought a categorical answer from the government on the timeline to notify appointments of some judges and sending the rest of the names to the collegium for further consideration. The numbers include some final recommendations, and some names proposed in the first stage of the appointment. “There are other names too, but these 55 names are the most delayed ones, pending with the government for more than six months. This has gone beyond any degree of reasonable time period,” said the bench, which also included justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant. Justice Kaul referred to a chart prepared by him to demonstrate the vacancy positions in each high court and the pendency of the names at different levels in the appointment process, regretting that problems occurred at every stage. “There should be a reasonable time frame within which the law ministry must respond after receiving the recommendations from the collegium. There are many cases in which there is no response for eight months or even one year. After names are recommended by the collegium, the ministry must make appointment s or send back these names with their objection,” justice Kaul told attorney general KK Venugopal, who appeared for the government. The SC collegium comprises the CJI and two most senior judges of the apex court and decides on matters of appointment of high court and Supreme Courtjudges. The bench added that after the SC collegium forwards the names of judges to be appointed to the high court to the (Union) government, it (the government) is supposed to take the views of the state government concerned, get a report from the Intelligence Bureau, and then, send the names back to the collegium for further consideration -- but that there appears to be no deadline for this process. “There seems to be no time limit within which this is being done. There are 45 names pending with you for more than 6 months but they are yet to be sent (back) to the collegium. Ten names have been cleared by the collegium finally and under the existing memorandum of procedure, you have to either appoint them or send them back with objections. Once we reiterate the same names, you will have to appoint them. But these 10 names, neither have they been appointed nor have we heard anything about them from the government,” the bench told the A-G. Justice Kaul, reading out from the chart, pointed out there were five names for appointments in the Calcutta HC that are pending with the government for 19 months, since July 25, 2019, despite the final recommendation of the SC collegium. Similarly, one name for the Jammu and Kashmir high court has been pending for 17 months and four names for the Delhi HC, for seven months. About the 45 other names that were still to be referred by the government to the collegium for consideration, justice Kaul said, two names for the Himachal Pradesh HC have been pending for 14 months; 21 names for the Rajasthan HC, for 9 months; 9 names for the Calcutta HC and two names for the Gauhati HC, for 8 months; five names for the Punjab and Haryana HC, for 7 months; and 6 names for the Madhya Pradesh HC, 6 months. “We are really concerned about these 45 names pending with you for more than six months but they are yet to be sent to the collegium. Also, the other 10 names, you must tell us when you are going to notify those appointments. We can pass an order that you will make a statement, or you can tell us that you will make a statement on the next date,” the bench told Venugopal. It also told the A-G that there were 80 names pending with the government but the focus at present was on having clarity regarding these 55 names first. Venugopal assured the bench that he would be able to make a statement on the next date of hearing on April 8 after receiving appropriate instructions from the law ministry. During the hearing, the bench also expressed concern that there were 240 vacancies in high courts for which no names had been recommended by the HC collegium. “That is also a concern, and we are addressing them. We will go step by step,” observed the court. As on March 22, 2021, the 25 high courts in the country have a staggering vacancy of 420 judges -- more than a third of the total positions. There are only 661 judges out of the total sanctioned strength of 1,080. However, there are only 180 names in contemplation for appointment as high court judges against the shortage of 420 judges. Of the 180 names being considered, a majority of the names (131) are pending with the central government with the oldest recommendations for appointment going back to July 2019 for appointment to the Calcutta high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-pulls-up-govt-over-delay-in-appointment-of-judges-101616697564886.html

The umbrella body of the protesting farmers’ union, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, (SKM) has appealed to the citizens across the country to make the bandh a success.Farmers across the nation have been protesting since last year against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, which were passed by Parliament in September.“We appeal to the people of the country to make this Bharat Bandh a success and honour their 'Annadata’,” PTI quoted farmers’ union leader Darshan Pal as saying.Here’s all you need to know about the Bharat Bandh:Rail, road transportation services are likely to be affected and markets and other public places will remain closed from 6am to 6pm on Friday. However, this is may not be applicable in poll-bound states.Also Read | How one Delhi policewoman risked it all to trace one missing child per dayParticipation in Bharat Bandh in support of the farmers will be optional for traders. General secretary of Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal, Ghaziabad, Ashok Chawla said no association will force anyone to close their shops or compel them to keep it open as traders are free to make their own decision.The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) in Andhra Pradesh has expressed solidarity with the farmers’ union Bharat Bandh called on Friday. The state government has appealed to the farmers to observe the Bharat bandh peacefully and avoid any untoward incident that could cause inconvenience to the general public. In Andhra Pradesh, as the Bandh will be observed, the government institutions will open after 1pm and RTC buses will also begin operations in the afternoon. All emergency services will be operational as usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-tomorrow-rail-road-transport-likely-to-be-affected-from-6am-to-6pm-101616665016776.html
26-03-2021||India||Farmer unions call Bharat Bandh on March 26 on completion of 4 months of protest||Farmers' unions have called for a nationwide strike on Friday when their ongoing protest at Delhi borders will complete four months, news agency PTI reported. Announcing their future programmes protesting the three agriculture laws enacted by Parliament in 2020, the farmers' unions said that some trade unions will also join them in their protest against fuel price hike on March 15.Following Red Fort violence, which sullied the image of the so-far peaceful protest by the farmers, the farmers' unions are focussing more on spreading their message to other states through visits, mahapanchayats etc, instead of staying put only at Delhi borders. So farmers from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh are coming to Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur protest sites, the union leaders are touring other states and some of those who have been at the sites since November-December are going back to take care of crops.On February 26, the Confederation of All India Traders called a nationwide strike demanding a review of the provisions of the goods and services tax (GST) regime.Recently, the farmers observed the 100th day of their ongoing protest and said the protests will go on unless the laws are repealed."If needed, we, on lakhs of tractors will reach Parliament to press for the repeal of the three black laws. 3,500 tractors entered Delhi on Republic Day. These were not hired tractors," Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said in Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-call-bharat-bandh-on-march-26-on-completion-of-4-months-of-protest-101615383800314.html
26-03-2021||Today's||Can Quad working groups lead to an Asian NATO?||Leaders of Quad — Australia, Japan, India and the United States (US) — made history recently with their first summit. They also made news with their plan to distribute Covid-19 vaccines in the Indo-Pacific — made in India, the pharmacy of the world. But obscured by the big announcements was the formation of three working groups, which will keep the cooperation going between summits and meetings, potentially fostering over time a habit, an institution.Quad was born as a habit. For nine days after a tsunami struck seven Indo-Pacific rim countries on December 26, 2004, a group of officials from Australia, Japan, India and the US had congregated on a conference call to coordinate their rescue and relief operations. Called the Tsunami Core Group, they met at an appointed time every day for calls that lasted no more than 40 minutes, as recounted by Marc Grossman, the top US diplomat who chaired the group. One of their “primary objectives” was “putting itself out of business”.The group was shut down on January 5, 2006. But it had sown, by then, seeds of a habit that would grow over a period of time to become the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Popularly called Quad now, its leaders joined hands for another leap of faith in the shadow of another global catastrophe.This time, the group has no intention of “pushing itself out of business”. In fact, it wants to grow and that’s what the three groups will do. They are the Quad Vaccine Experts Group, the Quad Climate Working Group and the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group.The Covid-19 vaccine group has a use-by-date — the end of the year — to submit its recommendation and it will then phase itself out or will presumably fall into disuse once the pandemic has been brought under control.The other two groups face no timelines, and can continue for a long time, forging that habit. The working group on climate won’t see its work wind down any time soon. Couched in non-enforceable terms of “cooperation”, “coordination” and “advancing”, the group’s brief is tied to the Paris Agreement. And consider this: Three of the Quad members are among the world’s 5 most-polluting countries — the US is at number 2, India at 3 and Japan at 5.The group on critical and emerging technology has set an expansive agenda, which includes “coordination on technology standards development, including between our national technology standards bodies and working with a broad range of partners”. That work cannot have an early wrap-up date, what with technology evolving continuously. Is it going to call it a day after dealing with 5G and Huawei, for instance?Australia, Japan, India and the US do quite a lot bilaterally and trilaterally; three of them are treaty allies. The three working groups, if taken seriously, can potentially set Quad on course to the kind of formalisation that some have said is its inescapable future, an Asian North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).yashwant.raj@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/can-quad-working-groups-lead-to-an-asian-nato-101616761472561.html
26-03-2021||Today's||Why India’s polity has adopted the logic of Nyay||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has announced a minimum income scheme for the poorest families of Bengal in its election manifesto for the upcoming state elections, as has the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu. The Congress, in Kerala and Assam, has also talked about a minimum income guarantee scheme, and the Bharatiya Janata Party too has promised a variant of income assistance in its election manifesto.Political parties of all hues, across states, are embracing the idea of a basic minimum income for citizens. It may be tempting to dismiss this as hollow election propaganda. But it is no coincidence that different parties have all converged on this one core idea. View this along with the other recent nativistic policy announcements by the governments of Haryana and Jharkhand to reserve jobs in their states for local citizens, and there emerges a larger pattern.“Household income” is perhaps the most critical political, economic and social issue in the country today. The jobs and income situation is staggeringly dismal. In the absence of any other concrete and immediate solution to boost incomes or create new jobs, political parties are seeking to address this issue by providing income assistance to citizens in the form of cash and/or in the form of job reservations.The idea of a basic minimum income in India has so far been discussed primarily as an economic idea to reform government welfare delivery and make it more efficient in the form of cash transfers. This is a misplaced positioning of the idea.The notion that no family should fall below a certain minimum income threshold, which can guarantee a life of dignity and respect in society is, foremost, a political-philosophy construct. A basic minimum income is not an efficiency tool for governance to replace in-kind welfare with cash assistance. It is a doctrine for a harmonious society where the gap between the haves and the have-nots does not become so enormously large that it threatens to erupt into violence and cause social disorder. Politics is the medium to resolve the contests of such forces and hence, the idea of a basic minimum income in a society should primarily be championed by political leaders.In India, the idea of a basic minimum income was first articulated to the mass public and championed politically during the 2019 elections, when the then Congress president, Rahul Gandhi, unveiled the Nyuntam Aay Yojana (Nyay) initiative. Under Nyay, the woman head of the poorest 20% of India’s families would get ₹6,000 a month as income assistance for her family directly in her bank account or through some other easily accessible window.The logic behind the numbers of Nyay was that in today’s India, a family needs a basic minimum income of ₹12,000 a month to lead a life of dignity and respect, which represents the 20th percentile of the household income distribution in India. The poorest one-fifth of India’s households, on average, earn only ₹6,000 a month. Hence, the gap between their average current earnings and what it takes to live a life of dignity is ₹6,000 ( ₹12,000- ₹6,000) a month. Nyay was envisaged as a federal scheme to be funded by both the Centre and the states and implemented by the states.A cheeky counter-factual would be that had India elected the Congress in May 2019, and had a functioning Nyay scheme by April 2020, when the pandemic hit, millions of families may not have had to struggle to eat or millions of migrants may not have been desperate to walk back to their homes for food and income. A sudden lack of income was the biggest damage inflicted on families by the lockdown and Nyay would have provided the required safety net.A Nyay-type programme is perhaps even more critically required in post-Covid-19 times where economic recovery is extremely skewed in favour of the wealthy and exacerbates India’s already large income inequality. The finance minister took great pride in announcing a positive headline Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the October to December 2020 quarter. But, even in the shorter month of February 2021, 28 million families, with absolutely no other source of income, pleaded for work at paltry minimum wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). This was the highest demand for MGNREGS work in the last seven months, just when India’s economy was apparently recovering strongly. Clearly, these 28 million families did not experience any of the robustness of the economic recovery that the government waxed eloquent about. A recent report indicated that 75 million more Indians may have slipped back into poverty post-Covid, just when the financial markets have blessed the richest Indians with even greater wealth.The basic income proposals announced by the various parties may vary in its details from Nyay but the idea is the same. However, in a post-Goods and Services Tax (GST) era, states have very little fiscal autonomy or the money to be able to fund and implement their own income schemes on a large-scale. Hence, any version of an income scheme designed and funded only by the state without assistance from the Centre will be limited in its impact.The very idea of a minimum basic income is to set an income floor and provide a cushion for people that slip below it. The resurgence in Nyay-type ideas is neither mere populism nor a coincidence. It is a manifestation of the ominous income inequality that threatens to rupture our social disorder.I recall a meeting in 2019 when Rahul Gandhi told some of us, “Political parties will soon have to address income inequality with a concrete plan such as a minimum income threshold”, which laid the origins for Nyay. Similar to his early warning about Covid-19, his call for a political embrace of a minimum income initiative has proved to be prophetic.Praveen Chakravarty is a political economist and senior office-bearer of the CongressThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-india-s-polity-has-adopted-the-logic-of-nyay-101616761469050.html
26-03-2021||Today's||India’s Covid-19 fatality rates — low in south India, high among migrants||When the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) arrived in India, many feared that the health indicators of the population and under-resourced health care facilities would lead to high Covid-19 mortality. More than a year later, India is among the countries with lower than expected mortality rates from Covid-19, despite infection rates of over 50% in many parts of the country.In a new study, we set out to use the best available data to measure the infection fatality rate from Covid-19 and how it varied across the country. Notably, most popular claims about India’s mortality rate have relied on an imperfect statistic called the case fatality rate (CFR). The CFR divides the number of positive Covid-19 tests by the number of Covid-19 deaths — but this measure almost always overstates the actual infection fatality rate, because so many people with mild symptoms are never even tested. Instead, we set out to measure the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) — the probability that an individual who gets the coronavirus at a given age will die — which is a key input in thinking about vaccine planning and activity restriction.Also Read | Second surge of Covid-19 infections quicker than first waveBut even such a basic statistic is not easily measured. Measuring IFR requires carefully designed studies that test for Covid-19 antibodies in random samples of thousands of people. Such seroprevalence studies have primarily been run in richer countries, but India has run a number of its own since the pandemic began. We combined data from major serostudies in Mumbai, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, and matched these to administrative reports of Covid-19 deaths in each location. We also used records from random samples of migrants returning to Bihar on special trains in response to the national lockdown; positively tested individuals were tracked, and we know how many of them died.We focused in particular on age-specific fatality. It is widely known that Covid-19 is more severe for the elderly. We wanted to know how fatality in India compares with fatality in other countries, at the same age. This isolates anything special about the susceptibility of Indians to severe infection or access to healthcare.Our calculations suggested that infection fatality rates were lower in many parts of India than in richer countries. Middle-aged men infected with Covid-19 were half as likely to die in Mumbai than in a sample of high-income countries, 88% less likely in Karnataka, and 96% less likely in Tamil Nadu.It must be noted that under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths in India can explain some of this gap, but is very unlikely to explain all of it. Excess mortality in Mumbai was twice as high as the number of reported Covid-19 deaths — enough to close the IFR gap with richer countries. But in Tamil Nadu, Covid-19 deaths would have to be undercounted by a factor of 30 to explain the gap, suggesting that undercounting cannot be the whole story.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 count surpasses 59,000 for the first time since Oct 17When we looked at migrants returning to Bihar, we found a starkly different story. The fatality rates among older positive-testing migrants was twice as high as in richer countries. Among younger migrants, it was even worse: over 1% of Covid-19-positive migrant men under the age of 49 died in the followup period, an age group with negligible mortality in other countries. The severe economic and physical distress during the arduous return journey, piled on top of their poorer baseline health may have made migrants highly vulnerable to death after infection. The same phenomenon could explain why mortality was higher in Mumbai than in the southern states — because Mumbai’s outbreak was concentrated among a poor slum population with poor health and worse access to care.A final striking finding that emerged from our study was that the elderly in India faced a smaller relative mortality disadvantage than in other countries. Most of India’s mortality advantage occurred among those over the age of 60. Our study cannot explain why this was the case, but one explanation likely has to do with the types of people who make it to old age in India relative to in other countries. Many of the most vulnerable may already have died, leaving a relatively robust group of elderly survivors, who further may have immune systems strengthened by a lifetime of viral exposure.We also do not know the exact reasons for the terrible mortality rates among returning migrants. After a year of economic crisis, it is crucial to identify patterns of economic distress that could raise vulnerability to severe infection. Another key puzzle is why infection fatality rates were so different in Mumbai, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.As vaccines are disseminated, the end of this pandemic is hopefully in sight. Research on patterns of infection and mortality will be essential not only for current vaccination planning, but also to understand and prepare for the future pandemics that will surely emerge.Paul Novosad is associate professor of economics at Dartmouth College.

26-03-2021||Editorials||Deepening ties with Dhaka | HT Editorial||For India, each neighbour is important — for political, cultural, economic and security reasons. If there is an open border and special relationship with Nepal, there is a deep friendship and strategic trust with Bhutan. If Sri Lanka is crucial to India’s maritime interests in the Indian Ocean as well as stability in south India, Pakistan is important, largely because of its track record of hostility and terrorism. But if there is one neighbour where all of India’s interests converge, it is Bangladesh. The future of India’s Act East policy, stability and development in the Northeast, economic integration in the larger region, climate crisis, cross-border flow of people, and peace and security are contingent on ties with Dhaka.Over the past decade, if there is one success of India’s neighbourhood policy, it is this relationship. And this is primarily due to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s clear strategic outlook — she has respected India’s security needs, and in turn, Delhi has backed her, both politically, even at the cost of turning a blind eye to Bangladesh’s democratic backsliding, and economically. And in this, there has been continuity from Manmohan Singh to Narendra Modi, who is visiting Bangladesh to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Liberation War and 100th birth anniversary of Sheikh Mujib ur Rehman, Ms Hasina’s late father. There remain issues, of course, from India’s inability to seal a Teesta water-sharing deal to Beijing’s enhanced push in Bangladesh. But the big picture remains of enhanced cordiality and connectivity.To sustain this, however, India needs to make a careful distinction between the bilateral relationship and the domestic political imperatives of the ruling party. The discourse around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens alienated the Dhaka street, and generated pressure on Ms Hasina to take a critical approach towards India. While Dhaka has calmed tempers, thanks to India’s assurance that this is a purely internal matter, the framing of the issue remains a sore point. PM Modi is also planning to visit an important Matua temple, perhaps with an eye to the community’s importance in the West Bengal elections. While this shows the depth of cross-border relations, a bilateral visit must not become a tool for domestic electoral signalling. Respecting each other’s sovereignty and interests, within an inclusive, connected and democratic region, is the best road map for the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/deepening-ties-with-dhaka-hteditorial-101616761471206.html
