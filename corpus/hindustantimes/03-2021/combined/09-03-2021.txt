Members of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) said that there are around 60 lanes in the colony that need to be relaid as the condition of the surfaces is poor. “Around 15 roads are in absolute poor condition and we have decided to construct these roads first. ₹10,000 from every household is being collected as both the developer and government authorities have failed to help us,” said Pravin Yadav, the president of the RWA. However, the developer said that the house owners have failed to pay maintenance charges. “They want to travel to the moon without paying for it. They owe the company ₹21 crore. Whatever we can do within our resources and means, we have been doing,” said Anil Hasija, vice president, Ardee Infrastructure Private Limited. Residents said they have constructed three roads so far and are working on relaying more roads.On Monday, the residents also submitted a letter to the authorities, asking the Department of Town and Country Planning to expedite the transfer of the colony to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). 2,500 families are living in Ardee City. Chaitalee Mandhotra, a resident, said that the developer has not relaid the road in the last 10 years and major accidents took place due to potholes. “We have spent around ₹8 to 9 lakh in building roads in two lanes and work is going on for a third lane. What is the point of paying taxes to the government if basic infrastructure can’t be ensured? Many senior citizens live in this colony and they suffer due to poor amenities, be it roads, water supply or sewage,” she said. DTCP officials said that they have already given the go-ahead for the MCG takeover. “We have already submitted all documents and records of the colony to MCG and the transfer process will be completed soon,” said Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rs-10k-per-household-ardee-city-s-funding-plan-to-rebuild-roads-in-colony-101615313727953.html

With an average of 3,500 inoculations per day since March 1, the district has consumed nearly 65% of more than 100,000 vaccine doses allocated to it till now. According to the health department data, roughly 82,000 people in Gurugram have received the vaccine till Tuesday, marking the highest number of vaccinations in the state. “Continuing with the current pace of vaccination, where almost 5,000 people are getting vaccinated every day in private hospitals, there has been a need to keep the additional vaccine stock. Through regional vaccine stores, the department has procured 15,000 additional doses, each, of Covishield and Covaxin allocated to other districts since they have lower footfall compared to Gurugram,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. According to the district health department data, Gurugram has, until now, received over 105,170 doses of Covishield and 22,000 doses of Covaxin since January 16. Of these, at least 82, 680 doses have been administered to prioritised population groups — over 24,000 to people above 60 years and with people aged 45 to 59 years with existing co-morbid conditions and over 56,000 doses to front-line and healthcare workers. “The state has at least 7.5 lakh (750,000) doses of Covishield and 2 lakh (200,000) doses of Covaxin in the state vaccine warehouse,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department. “On an average, 34,000 doses have been administered every day (across the state). Going by the daily consumption of vaccine, the available stock is sufficient for 10 next days and by March 16, additional doses will be received from the central government. Since vaccination (rate) is high in Gurugram, additional doses will be delivered to the district,” Arora said. From March 1, vaccination sites in the district were increased to at least 45 private hospitals and 23 government hospitals. The turnout has been gradually increasing, reaching almost 8,000 on Monday. As many as 5,167 people above the age of 60 years and 635 aged 45-59 having co-morbidities took the shot on Tuesday. Also, at least 819 healthcare workers and 474 front-line workers took the second doses of their vaccines, mostly at public health set-ups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-procures-30-000-additional-vaccine-doses-101615313727421.html
09-03-2021||Gurugram||With 75 new cases, Gurugram reports highest daily jump in two months||At least 75 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the last 24 hours on Tuesday — the highest jump in daily cases after almost two months. Data also showed that average new infections this week increased by almost 50% as compared to the number of cases recorded in the last week of February, forcing health department to increase testing. “Testing will be increased in the district to gauge the rising prevalence of infection. Testing camps are already being conducted in areas where more than five cases are being reported in a day. Teams will also conduct random testing to identify localities from where cases are being reported at a faster pace,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO). According to the data, the district is presently testing almost 2,900 samples every day. As there has been an increase in the daily test positivity rate – positive samples out of the samples tested in a day – from less than 1% in February to almost 1.9% in the last one week, the health department has also planned to increase the number of containment zones in the city. The district until December 2020 recorded more than 100 new infections a day. It declined to almost 88 new infections on January 8. But the active cases stood at 772. Due to daily decline in new cases to roughly 30 every day, the active case count had declined to 372 by February 1. Going by the daily health bulletin issued by the district health department, the active cases count reduced to almost 239 by February 23, after which it gradually started increasing, with daily case count fluctuating between 29 and 62. On an average, 26 new cases were reported daily between February 17 and February 23. It jumped to almost 44 new cases between February 24 and March 2, after which it further grew to almost 53 new cases on an average in the last one week. While daily cases have now touched 75, active cases have reached 437. The overall tally has reached 59,449. Due to the constant upward trajectory, Haryana is currently among the eight states in the country noticing a spike in daily cases. “The matter will be discussed in the district task force meeting on Wednesday. Gurugram testing numbers are higher compared to other districts; therefore new infections are being reported. In case if the number further increases reserved beds for Covid-19 patients will also be increased,” said Yadav. Currently, out of the 437 active cases at least 37 are admitted in hospitals, while 399 are under home isolation. Only one patient has been isolated at a Covid care centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/with-75-new-cases-gurugram-reports-highest-daily-jump-in-two-months-101615313726802.html
09-03-2021||Gurugram||Grap ban on diesel generators removed from Gurugram, Faridabad||The ban imposed on using diesel generators under Graded Response Action Plan(Grap) has been lifted from Gurugram and Faridabad, said officials of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Tuesday. The ban was imposed in October last year as per the orders of the National Green Tribunal(NGT) to prevent rising air pollution in Delhi-NCR. These measures are meant to be implemented as a matter of course between October 15 and March 15 every year — which also happens to be the official length of the winter pollution cycle. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said, “As the air quality is improving with the onset of summer, the ban imposed on diesel generators under Grap has been lifted by the Central Pollution Control Board. An order in this regard was issued last week. However, we are still keeping a tab on different activities being undertaken in the city to prevent air pollution and deterioration of the air quality.” A letter, dated March 5, issued by Shiv Das Meena, chairman of CPCB states, “As per the forecast received air quality in Delhi-NCR is expected to be better in the coming days due to improved ventilation conditions. Based on this forecast and prediction, CPCB has decided that the ban on use of diesel generator sets in Delhi-NCR is lifted(sic)” The CPCB, however, directed the state pollution control boards to ensure that large construction sites adhere to prescribed guidelines and take adequate measures to manage dust pollution. The implementing agencies have also been asked to continue to take stringent actions with emphasis on pollution hot spots. On October 9 last year, the Environmental Pollution Control Board Authority(EPCA) had directed the Haryana government to strictly impose the ban on the use of diesel generators in Gurugram and Faridabad in view of the rising levels of air pollution. Meanwhile, air quality in Gurugram, remained in the ‘poor’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday, with a reading of 272 on the daily pollution bulletin — an increase from an AQI reading of 204 recorded a day prior. The air quality in the region has worsened in the past few days, as the AQI at 177 was recorded to be in the ‘moderate’ category on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/grap-ban-on-diesel-generators-removed-from-gurugram-faridabad-101615313726288.html
09-03-2021||Gurugram||GMDA seeks to extend coverage||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to extend its coverage to the entirety of the Gurugram district and also increase the metropolitan area in the district, officials familiar with the development said on Tuesday. A proposal has been initiated to extend the jurisdictional boundaries of GMDA as well as extend the Gurugram Metropolitan Area (GMA) to help with connectivity and management issues. The authority has issued a public notice seeking suggestions, comments and objections. The public notice, issued last week, states, “…acting upon the suggestions of MLA Sohna and other members as well as the directions of the Hon’ble Chairman, GMDA, given in 6th authority meeting of GMDA held on 16.03.2020, the proposal of extending the boundaries of GMA to coincide with the territory of district Gurugram, was examined by GMDA.” Bhuvnesh Kumar, chief town planner of urban planning division, GMDA, who was part of the committee and worked on developing the new map said that the decision has been taken following public requests.“We are planning to take the whole of Gurugram district under the jurisdiction of the GMDA as it will bring uniformity and ease connectivity issues. At present, we have to coordinate with different authorities for development work outside the Gurugram Metropolitan Area, but with the extension, working for regional connectivity will become easier,” said Kumar. The notice further mentions that after the sixth authority meeting, a committee headed by the chief executive officer of GMDA was also formed to discuss the feasibility of extension of the limits of the Gurugram Metropolitan Area. The committee met on February 11 this year, “…wherein it was decided to initiate the process of public consultation on this issue, so that compiled report may be put in the next GMDA meeting.” The current Gurugram Metropolitan Area boundary covers 675 square kilometres, which will be increased to 1,258 sq km, with the proposed addition of 583 sq km. At present, the GMDA has jurisdiction over the Gurugram-Manesar urban complex, Sarbasipur, Jaduala, Jhanjrola, the complete area under the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, Farrukhnagar and parts of Sohna tehsil, Farukhnagar tehsil, Manesar tehsil, and Gurugram tehsil. The extended boundary will include all areas under the municipal corporations and councils of Gurugram (208 sq km), Manesar (124 sq km), Farrukhnagar (22 sq km), Pataudi (30 sq km) and Sohna (11 sq km), but officials said that work on different projects will be done in collaboration.The authority has uploaded a proposed map of the extended limits of the Gurugram Metropolitan Area on its website, on which citizens can submit their responses till April 2. Kumar said that if the Gurugram Metropolitan Area is extended, then the approval process for different projects will also reduce. “For both inter-district and intra-district connectivity, the extension of the area will be helpful as there will be lesser authorities concerned and projects can be taken up faster,” added Kumar. Member of legislative assembly Sohna, Sanjay Singh, could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer of GMDA said, “If the boundary of GMDA is extended, it will include all the municipal corporations, but all agencies will be working independently. For projects that overlap, work will be done in collaboration.” However, he said that the specifics of managing different functions is yet to be finalised. Also, he said that there are no plans to set up new offices for covering an extended area and work will be managed by existing personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-seeks-to-extend-coverage-101615313725695.html
09-03-2021||Gurugram||Primary schools to start lessons from scratch||Heads of primary wings in government schools that reopened last week after a year of remote classes said they would be starting lessons from scratch for students, especially in classes 1 and 2, to tackle the learning deficit. School teachers said that only about 10% of students had managed to keep up with remote classes through WhatsApp and a majority need hand-holding. Deputy district education officer Kalpna Singh said that students couldn’t do much during remote learning and bridging the gap could take a long time. “If a child in a junior class goes on leave for even a day or two, it takes some time to get back into the routine of structuralized learning. Due to the pandemic, students were deprived of classes for one whole year. Online classes did not have much of an impact on students of classes 1 and 2. Gaps and delays are bound to happen,” said Singh. She said that teachers had been directed to engage the attention of students and encourage more students to join lessons. “Students have returned to classrooms after a year. First and foremost, we need to focus on keeping them engaged. Once that happens, we can direct energies towards covering the learning gap since the break caused due to the pandemic will have a long-lasting impact,” said Singh. Neelam, primary in-charge of the government primary school in Bhondsi, said that nearly 60% of the class strength was back in school. “We will be starting the curriculum from the beginning. Many of them couldn’t comprehend the lessons taught during remote classes and forgotten the basic concepts of writing and reciting. After a long gap, the struggle will be to get them back into the fold,” said Neelam, who goes by her first name.She said that the school had formed groups of students based on their current understanding of lessons to facilitate a needs-based approach. “We are encouraging group learning so that students can support each other. Some students are better placed since they received hand-holding support from parents during remote classes. These students are being asked to work in tandem with others who didn’t have access to lessons during remote classes,” said Neelam. She said that while teachers were paying extra attention to students, the co-learning approach seemed to be working. “In group activities, we see that students are motivated by seeing others practise the same concepts. At least until the schools close for vacation, we will continue with collaborative learning till all students catch up with lessons,” she said. Bijender, head of government primary school at Darbaripur, said that only 10-15% of students continuously engaged with remote classes through WhatsApp and most couldn’t keep up with the syllabus.“Online classes did not have many benefits for younger children. We have a month or more to go before schools might shut for the summer break. In this limited time, we have to ensure that at least the basic concepts are taught. To aid the same, we have created a refresher course with important topics and areas that need attention. Our focus will be on covering the basics for now,” said Bijender, adding that schools might have to cover the remaining syllabus after the summer break.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/primary-schools-to-start-lessons-from-scratch-101615313724584.html

DTCP officials said that a survey of private colonies is underway as they have received several complaints regarding the misuse of plots particularly those belonging to the EWS category. The action in private colonies will follow a large-scale sealing drive that was carried out by the department in DLF Phase 3 last week in which action was taken against 150 commercial establishments. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that commercial activities particularly on EWS plots are under the scanner of the department as these create a lot of problems for local residents. “Action will be taken against violators and properties sealed in private colonies after the survey has been completed,” he said. Meanwhile, an enforcement team of the department carried out a demolition drive in two colonies being developed in Sohna and Bhondsi and cleared 30 acres of land. “Around 100 plinths, a few under-construction houses, three offices of property dealers and two shops in these illegal colonies were demolished. A large team from Gurugram Police supported the drive,” said Bhath. DTCP officials said that four earth-moving machines were also deployed during the drive. The team also demolished few illegal structures on Sohna Road as well in the evening. “A warning was also issued to the property dealers to refrain from selling such illegal plots as otherwise penal action would be taken against them,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-take-action-against-commercial-establishments-on-ews-plots-101615313725175.html
09-03-2021||Gurugram||Fake call centre in Udyog Vihar busted; four held||The police on Monday night busted a fake call centre that had been operating out of a building in Udyog Vihar for the past four months and arrested four people. According to the police, the call centre employees have been allegedly duping US citizens by posing as officials of law enforcement agencies and threatening to cancel their social security numbers if they failed to pay a fine. This is the fourth such call centre to be busted by the police and ninth this year. According to the police, the call centre had duped at least 800 people based in the US. The police said they used to buy data from Delhi every month. A case was registered on Tuesday at Udyog Vihar police station under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 66D and 75 of the IT Act against the business partners of the call centre.The suspects were identified as Ranjeet Singh Rana from Udaipur, Rajasthan and Bhavesh Pankhi from Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The police said two team leaders were also held from the spot. The police said the three partners were running the call centre and that they had prior experience in working for call centres in Gurugram. The police said the suspects were paying ₹1.5 lakh as monthly rent for their office in Udyog Vihar. The suspects were produced before the district and sessions court on Tuesday and were taken on police remand. The police allegedly recovered seven hard disks, a script meant to dupe people and computers from the call centre. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said they received a tip-off on March 1 that a group in the city was running a fake call centre. It took the police a few days to locate the place. “We had conducted an internal investigation and our teams raided the office on Monday night. We will get the recovered hard disks scanned along with their systems to get an exact number of people duped by the call centre,” he said. The police said the confiscated hardware will be sent to a laboratory in Madhuban, Karnal, for forensic examination. Rao said that there were 35 men and four women working as telecallers in the call centre. The executives were given US citizens’ data. They used to make random calls, informing them that their social security numbers are at risk of being cancelled as they are “offenders” and need to pay a fine to ensure the continuation of the same. “This call centre was set up with 40 workstations. The telecallers underwent a week’s training to make calls to the US, and a script was shared with them. They had also set up a toll-free number, which was shared with the victims,” he said. The police said the payment was generally through virtual payment gateways, credit and debit cards, gift cards, iTunes cards, etc. The police said the exact number of victims and the amount of money siphoned may be higher than anticipated. The suspects used to provide pick and drop facility to all the employees and were paying ₹20,000 a month as salary and nearly ₹35,000 as an incentive for duping US citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fake-call-centre-in-udyog-vihar-busted-four-held-101615313723396.html

Among the arrested persons was a driver employed with the firm who the police said planned robbery. Police identified the suspects as driver Nafees Khan (27), Bobby kushwaha (26) and Mohit Rawat (19). Two of the gang’s accomplices, Suraj Kori and Sunny Kumar, were absconding. “Khan had brought the cash from Aligarh two days before the incident and knew that it will be taken to be deposited in the bank. He planned the robbery with his accomplices. Khan went to Lucknow with his employer to avoid suspicion on his involvement, while his accomplices executed the crime. However, while we tracked about 30 employees of the firm, Khan’s name also cropped up among those who knew about the cash transfer,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1). Police said that the plan involved Rawat and Kori on a scooter, while Kushwaha and Sunny provided backup on a motorcycle. When the company’s accountant arrived at the bank, Rawat and Kori held them at gunpoint and robbed them. “In the investigation, we gathered enough evidence to arrest them from near Kavi Nagar flyover while they were trying to flee. We recovered ₹6 lakh cash and the motorcyle used during the crime,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-including-driver-of-firm-arrested-for-robbing-10-lakh-cash-from-employees-101615312404619.html

According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which monitors 126 cities across the country, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad turned out to be the most polluted cities on Tuesday.The air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Tuesday was 293 against 192 a day earlier, as per CPCB data. Similarly, AQI of Greater Noida was 339 against 196 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 334 against 230 on Monday.An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.“The wind speed dropped slightly on Tuesday but it is expected to rise by Friday,” said an official at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“There had been some thundery activities over pockets of NCR, leading to dusty winds that affect the air quality. There are chances of rains on March 12. If there is a moderate rain, then it will improve the air quality,” Said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality may deteriorate over the next two days due to moderate wind speed but will improve by the end of the week.“Surface winds are east-northeasterly and moderate. A decrease in surface wind speed is forecasted. This can cause a slight decrease in ventilation and marginal deterioration in air quality for the next two days. AQI is likely to stay in the poor to the lower end of the very poor category for the next two days. An increase in ventilation is expected on 12th and AQI likely to improve to the poor to moderate category. Thunderstorms and local dust lifting are likely at isolated places for the next two days,” said a SAFAR statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/greater-noida-ghaziabad-most-polluted-in-country-101615312344607.html

Rakesh Singh, one of the agitators, said they had not been paid since November.“We’ve been hired by a private agency that bagged tenders for housekeeping and security arrangements in this hospital.

As the structures will be pre-fabricated, there will be no disturbance to the ecology of the sanctuary. We had already received permission from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change regarding the same. Total cost of the project is around ₹60 lakh and we will start it in the next two months,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer (DFO), GB Nagar. He said that the rules and rates for the night camping, including access to the sanctuary during night time, are yet to be decided. The officials stated that the department will also build “sunset points” at the sanctuary for which the entry timing for the sanctuary will be extended by an hour.“The bird sanctuary offers some of the most stunning sunsets and we have decided to promote them. So sunset points will be developed in the sanctuary for which we will extend the closing time from current 5pm to 6pm,” said Srivastava.Spread over 400 hectares, the Okhla Bird Sanctuary is home to a number of water and terrestrial birds. The sanctuary, however, suffers issues like water pollution due to excessive effluents in Yamuna river, and over the years, sanctuary has seen a drop in number of winter migratory birds. The Asian Waterbird Census 2021 held by Wetlands International South Asia in January counted a total 8,068 birds against 8,776 birds in January last year and 12,212 birds in January 2019.Experts said that while the idea is good, the sanctuary has already suffered a lot due to the development activities around it. “There will be an impact on the local ecology at the sanctuary. The night camping will cause light pollution, among others, as you cannot expect the campers to camp in the dark. The sanctuary is a smaller area and over the years it has already been disturbed a lot. So, the step seems a good idea as it may attract youth towards nature, but would have been effective if the area was larger,” said Anand Banerjee, a noted conservationist.Vikrant Tongad, a city-based environmentalist, also objected to the plan stating that the habitat will be affected. “I have nothing against ecotourism, but at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary there is already less land and a high-tension line passes over it. The habitat will be hampered if even a small part of the sanctuary is concretised.

I want to announce that the existing parameters or notifications for government employment will stay and the five-year requirement for a resident certificate is only for private jobs,” the CM said.As per government instructions, caste certificate for SCs is granted only to those who are residents of Haryana by birth.Khattar became emotional on Tuesday while recalling scenes of Congress women MLAs pulling a tractor during the Congress protest march over fuel price hike.“Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Raghuvir Singh Kadian were proudly sitting on the tractor being pulled by women MLAs. And this happened on International Women’s Day. Hooda, a CM-level leader would have earned goodwill had he pulled the tractor with women MLAs sitting on the tractor,” Khattar said.He added that he was deeply anguished at the disrespect shown by Congress leaders towards women.Reacting to this statement, Hooda said that women MLAs were pulling the tractor to mark their protests against the sufferings of people due to fuel price hike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5yr-domicile-condition-only-for-pvt-jobs-khattar-101615312283272.html
09-03-2021||Lucknow||Reservation of village panchayats - Complaints galore over census data-caste population gap||: A significant gap between ground reality with regard to numerical strength of various castes and a decade-old census data in thousands of villages has prompted villagers in large numbers to raise questions over the categorisation/reservation of their village panchayats for the forthcoming rural elections in UP, people dealing with the issue in the panchayati raj department said. Though the compilation of the objections received in various districts is still in progress, a higher number of complaints are said to have been received this time in all districts forcing chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari to convene a meeting with senior panchayati raj department officials to discuss the issue last week. District magistrates issued lists categorising all around 58,000 village panchayats as per the government’s reservation policy on March 2 and 3 inviting objections to the same by March 8. The final lists will be published between March 10 and 12 after disposing of objections.Director, panchayati raj, Kinjal Singh said people registering their objections and DMs making disposal of the same was a routine practice adopted every time rural polls were held. “Complaints and objections will be complied by Wednesday evening. Then district-level officials will dispose them of on merit after which final lists will be brought out,” she said. According to an official aware of the matter, a large number of complaints have come broadly on two counts. First, in number of cases there is a mismatch between the census data and the actual position of population on the ground. “There are complaints that census data shows people belonging to a particular caste living in a village while actually nobody of that caste lives there or their numerical strength is far less than sown in the census. “Since village panchayats were reserved on the basis of the 2011 census, a lot of complainants have raised questions on the categorisation alleging that incorrect census data must have affected the reservation,” he said.Second reason, according to him, is changes in the composition of hundreds of village panchayats in over 40 districts due to their complete or partial merger in urban areas during the last five years.“It has been seen that many village panchayats have been reserved for STs while there is no ST population there or many other village panchayats have been reserved for ST, SC or BC despite the fact the population under these categories there is less than 2 and as per rules a village panchayat cannot be reserved for a caste if population of that caste in a village is less than two,” he said.This, the official said, happened because of decrease in number of ST, SC or OBC population in many villages either due to death of residents or their migration to other places since the 2011 census or because of the changes forced by merger of rural areas into cities and towns.“But majority of complaints/objections must be frivolous ones filed by vested interests who wanted a particular panchayat to be reserved for a particular caste or put that under an unreserved category but the categorisation did not happen according to their desire,” the official said.“Such people, as it always happens, are now desperate to get the categorisation of their village panchayat modified and hence filed false complaints,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/reservation-of-village-panchayats-complaints-galore-over-census-data-caste-population-gap-101615312163903.html

The RWA has so far identified 48 senior citizens who have shown interest in getting vaccinated, said office bearers of the resident body.“Many people are reluctant to get vaccinated. We are trying to convince them and hope that more people will come forward. So far, we have a list of 48 senior citizens. The RWA will sponsor the first dose of the vaccine for those who want to get vaccinated at private centres,” said Sanjeev Kumar, president of Sector 51 RWA.He said that a registration camp was set up a few days ago to help those seniors who are not tech-savvy. “A number of senior citizens are living alone, while some others are bed ridden due to illnesses. The idea is to help as many people as we can. On weekends, we also help them with travelling to a vaccination centre. We have also spoken to a private clinic to save some slots for walk-ins from our sector,” said Kumar.Residents said that the initiative is helpful to them. “Me and my wife got vaccinated yesterday at the clinic. The doctors, one of them lives in our sector only, were very friendly. Hopefully, more people will come forward for the vaccination,” said 70-year-old Pawan Kumar Sharma, a resident of Sector 51.The RWA is also working on making a list of people with co-morbidities to help them out as well with the vaccination process, its president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rwa-of-noida-sector-51-comes-to-aid-of-senior-citizens-for-vaccination-101615312163286.html

Many have to rely on family to hold them. Even outside the vaccination room, there are long queues and social distancing is hardly maintained. But that is how government hospitals are. So, people try to get free vaccine here and go home without complaining,” said a senior woman who on Tuesday who did not wish to be named. “It would be better if the vaccination rooms are shifted to the ground floor,” said Ravinder Sharma, a 64-year-old beneficiary. What has made the situation difficult are the many health care workers and front line workers who missed their first shot and are now making use of the walk-in provision to get their shot. This has stressed the hospital.Chief medical officer Dr N K Gupta said he was aware of the situation.“We have requested the vaccination teams to vaccinate senior citizens in their vehicles if they cannot climb stairs. We will request the hospital to consider shifting the vaccination rooms to the ground floor,” he said. “We have the vaccination room on the first floor because our OPD is on the ground floor where we serve about 800-900 patients daily. That would not help maintain social distancing,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the hospital. He said the hospital had an elevator at the back but is out of order. “Even if we make it operational, we do not have an elevator operator at our hospital without who we cannot allow patients to use it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/senior-citizens-find-tough-to-visit-first-floor-vaccination-room-at-ghaziabad-s-district-hospital-101615312103199.html

The Co-WIN portal is a central government-designed system to record and track vaccinations. If the data is missing, then people who registered on the app and got their first dose will not be able to track or get information on their second dose, which is essential to complete the vaccination. The vaccination drive for senior citizens or those with co-morbidities, under phase-3 of the drive, began on March 1.Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr N K Gupta said that the issue was discovered on Tuesday when they received a status report of their vaccinations drive for senior citizens till March 8. While the district record said it had vaccinated 14,832 people till then, the portal had recorded only 6,676. Gautam Budh Nagar CMO Dr Deepak Ohri said they had vaccinated of over 14,000 in phase-3. But the system showed just 5,747.“According to the portal figures sent to us from the state officials, we have covered only 7.14% of the 93,840 target for the month,” said Gupta. “But our records showed that it was closer to 16%.” The Ghaziabad department suspect that hospitals may not be entering data onto the platform. The government officials met over the issue following which the CMO issued directions that supply of vaccine would be held back for hospitals if they do not update details over the portal. “We have deployed officers to check details. It is possible that some hospitals may not be entering or updating records and it is a cause for concern. It could be a technical issue from the portal’s side also, so I have alerted state government to this,” said the Ghaziabad CMO. “I am completely foxed with the data. Prima facie, the reason behind the difference appears to be an error by hospitals in uploading the details. I am going to verify the daily records and their entries at all the sites in the district. If some sort of discrepancy is found at any site, we’ll cancel the vaccination there as the district magistrate has already permitted for that,” said Dr Ohri.How data is enteredAccording to officials, hospitals are required to update details of beneficiaries on the day of the vaccination. Only after this is the provisional vaccination certificate (after the first dose) and complete vaccination certificate (after second dose) are generated. The hospitals and other vaccination centres are provided with a login ID and password to update records. According to officials, the provisional certificates is sometimes given in handwritten notes to people that will include the next vaccination dates. In this course, the hospital delays entering it to accommodate more beneficiaries and eventually forgets about it, said an official.“To sort out the issues, we have asked our officers to check session details of all the hospitals about number of entries done online and the pending entries. If we find any private hospitals whose details are pending, we will be forced to hold back vaccine supply till they update details,” said Dr Vishram Singh, district immunisation officer. Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad, said that the issue was serious. “Action should be initiated if any hospital is found not following procedure. The rate of vaccination is already low in the district. It would be worthwhile if the state government allows vaccination at clinics. We already take up vaccination of Influenza at clinics and the Covid vaccination should also be allowed. If this happens, the coverage will increase considerably,” he added. As per the UP government, Ghaziabad has about 373,920 beneficiaries under phase-3.In order to enhance the vaccination coverage, the Uttar Pradesh health department officials during a video conferencing with district health department officials directed them to create session slots for the entire month of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/16k-vaccine-beneficiaries-data-missing-from-co-win-portal-in-ghaziabad-noida-101615311923249.html

The closure report was pending with the court since April 4, 2017 and it accepted the report on Saturday. Additional district government councilor (ADGC) Lalit Bhardwaj said SIT’s inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was the complainant in the case and he submitted a closure report on April 4, 2017 after finding no evidence against the MLA and others. Subodh was killed by a frenzied mob in December 2018 after an incident of cow slaughter in Stana area of district Bulandshahar. He was then posted as inspector in Syana kotwali. Bhardwaj said after Sabodh’s death no one objected to the closure report and the court accepted it after recording the statement of the policeman who submitted the death report of Sabodh in the court. A case under sections 420,153A, 120B of IPC and 66 of IT Act was registered against Som and 200 others who liked the video, allegedly uploaded by Som after the killing of two brothers in Kawal village of Muzaffarnagar.

Muneer’s quest for knowledge proved so strong that he took no time in leaving his cushy job as research associate with Google in Moscow to pursue master of science course and then a doctorate in electrical engineering in Columbia University. A few weeks back, he was also awarded with Emerging Scientist 2020 Award at the 11th international scientist conference in Kolkata. Muneer told HT: “The research and development wing of the Columbia University would fund my studies.” However, to reach this height, Muneer braved all odds of life. Born in July, 1996, in Gauriya village, , Muneer Khan was the youngest among five brothers and three sisters and lost his father when he was just one-year-old. Fortunately, his under-educated siblings wanted to see him well-educated. “After completing my primary education at the government-run primary school in my village and junior high school from a zila panchayat college, I was admitted to City Montessory School Inter College in Lakhimpur city, which changed my entire life.” “Given my meritorious record and interest in science, the college waived my fees and provided all facilities, which led me to develop a project to generate electricity from waste material,” Muneer said. He added that the project won him the young scientist award from none other than the former president of India late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. On his merit, Muneer later succeeded in getting admission to Birla Institute of Applied Sciences in Nainital, where he completed many innovative projects. During his studies at Birla institute, Muneer Khan developed smart water and soil monitoring systems for Uttarakhand government and a non-fatal but effective photon-emitting electronic gun for riot control project. In his second year of BTech, Muneer had the opportunity to participate in various projects, including safety intelligent censor for colloborative robotics. Muneer’s talent and ceaseless efforts brought him an unexpected job opportunity from a Geneva-based CERN lab just after his BTech in 2019, at an annual package of Rs. 98 lakh. This was followed by his employment in Google in Moscow as a research associate at an even more attractive package. However, Muneer is no longer interested in serving abroad. “Whatever I have achieved is in India and it is my sacred duty to serve my nation with whatever talent I have,” he said. “After completing my master’s and PhD degrees from Columbia University during the next three years, I have resolved to set up my own start-up in India.” “Now, I intend to become job creator and not job seeker so that I can help those youths who have faced similar odds in their lives,” Muneer said. --Deokant Pandey||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/perseverance-pays-young-kheri-scientist-makes-his-way-to-columbia-university-101615311023192.html

State higher education minister and close aide of Rawat, Dhan Singh Rawat, is leading the race as the main frontrunner. He hails from GarhwalTwo other contenders include Rajya Sabha member Anil Baluni and Lok Sabha member from Nainital-US Nagar, Ajay Bhatt.Rawat is leading the race due to various factors including his Thakur caste factor to balance the caste equation in the state. BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat, who belongs to the Kumaon region, is also believed to be one of the options."Dhan Singh is also a close aide of Trivendra Singh Rawat and has risen to the rank of minister in the current government from being a party worker. Also, his name was suggested by Trivendra during his meeting with the national leaders," said a senior party leader.He added, "Being a close aide of Trivendra Singh Rawat, Dhan Singh is also considered a crowd puller for the party events in the state. Also, he has not been in any controversy. The only factor that can go against him is the fact that he is junior among all ministers."Dhan Singh Rawat represents Srinagar Garhwal legislative seat. He was born in Pauri Garhwal and educated at the local village school and later went to Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University. From his college days, he was associated with the RSS and later rose in the state party ranks, becoming state secretary of Uttarakhand BJP. He couldn’t win in the assembly elections in 2012 but won from Srinagar Garhwal in 2017 and became a state minister (independent charge) with the portfolios of higher education, cooperatives, dairy development and protocols. Rawat had also held a 59-day yatra for the statehood of UttarakhandOn the two other names, the leader said, "Baluni and Bhatt are also in the race but to accommodate any of them, the party would have to recalculate the caste calculations in the party.""The party state president is already a Brahmin and if either of them is named as new CM, then both the top posts would be held by a Brahmin which would be problematic in the organisation. The CM has to be a Thakur. Else in a new equation, Dhan Singh could be made the new party state president and either of two aforementioned could be then named the new CM," he said.Among the two, Bhatt has been the party state president before becoming an MP in the 2019 general election. He has the experience of running the party.Baluni, on the other hand, is at the third spot due to his health factor as he has returned to Uttarakhand after undergoing treatment for months in Mumbai for an ailment.Apart from the three, other names include Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, both former CMs of the state.Amid the buzz over the leadership change in Uttarakhand since the last few days, Nishank's aides had been making an environment in the state that he would be the next CM. But if party insiders are to be believed, it is unlikely that he would leave a significant Central portfolio for the CM position. The state is heading closer to the assembly polls which are due next year.The new CM face would be decided after the legislative party meeting at the BJP state headquarters on Wednesday morning at 10 am in Dehradun in the presence of party central observers including former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and state unit in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/replacing-rawat-3-frontrunners-2-parliamentarians-in-race-for-post-of-u-khand-cm-101615309303962.html

09-03-2021||Mumbai||Uncovering truth behind Hiran Mansukh's death crucial for MVA: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said it was important for the "image" and "prestige" of the Maharashtra government to uncover the truth behind the mysterious death of Hiren Mansukh, who was said to be the owner of the vehicle with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence.Mansukh, around 45 years old, was found dead on the banks of a creek along the Mumbra-Reti Bunder road in neighboring Thane on Friday morning, police had said.Talking to reporters, Raut said the mysterious death of Mansukh, whose Scorpio vehicle was used to keep explosives near Ambani's residence, was "shocking and unfortunate"."It is wrong to politicise his death and put the government in the dock. There are doubts whether Mansukh's death was a suicide or murder. He was an important witness in the case," he said."The home department should unearth the truth at the earliest. It is important for the prestige and image of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government," he said.On Friday, state home minister Anil Deshmukh had announced that the probe into the case has been handed over from Mumbai Crime Branch to the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).Talking about it, Raut said that the opposition BJP's demand is to hand over the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA)."But it (giving the investigation to NIA) does not mean the case would be solved immediately. The home minister has handed over the case to the ATS, which is capable of solving it. Let us have faith," he said.Meanwhile, BJP leader Ashish Shelar targeted the Shiv Sena-led government as he questioned the presence of an "encounter specialist" assistant police inspector at the time of Mansukh's post-mortem."The encounter specialist's presence at the post- mortem of Mansukh is suspicious as he is neither part of Thane police nor the ATS, which is probing the case. It gives an impression that there is something that this government wants to hide," he said.Shelar also criticised the home minister over his "U- turn" on the case probe."Home minister Deshmukh was praising Thane and Mumbai police and their achievements, but within half-an-hour, he announced that the probe into the case would be handed over to the ATS. So what happened in just half-an-hour that prompted him to give the investigation to the ATS?" he asked.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Sandeep Deshpande demanded that a sitting judge should be appointed to carry out the investigation.Meanwhile, a police official from Thane said that Mansukh had left his shop around 8.30 pm on Thursday in an autorickshaw and since then his phone was switched off."His family members had lodged a missing person's report on Friday morning after he did not return home and a case was registered at Naupada police station. By that time, a body was found at Mumbra and it was later confirmed that the deceased was Mansukh," he added.His mobile phone is yet to be recovered, he said.His post-mortem was conducted at a civic-run hospital in Thane's Kalwa on Saturday, he said."The exact cause of his death will be known once the medical report comes," the official said, adding that security at Mansukh's residence in Naupada has been stepped up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uncovering-truth-behind-hiren-mansukh-s-death-crucial-for-mva-sanjay-raut-101615021245415.html

The state is performing well in the vaccination drive but to maintain it more vaccines are required,” he said.“I have spoken to Union minister Harsh Vardhan and apprised him of the situation. He has assured to look into it. Rajasthan is conducting 25 per cent of the country’s vaccination,” said the health minister.The state has requested the Centre to supply 6 million additional Covid-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, The Union health ministry on Tuesday clarified that there is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in Rajasthan, a day after some news reports claimed so.

I just did what a citizen is expected to do. I gathered courage from the training which I got through the National Cadet Corps. I was surprised when I came to know that the government has decided to appoint me SI in the state police,” said Chauhan.She added, “My feelings are impossible to describe in words. I am thankful to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, home secretary Abhay Kumar, IGP Bharatpur range Prasan Kumar Khamesra and Dholpur SP Kesar Singh.

There is no doubt that she will become a good police officer and will make the entire force proud,” he said.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot decided to directly offer an appointment to the young lady as a step towards promoting women empowerment and as a mark of honour to the girl for showing courage, virility and presence of mind which defeated the perpetrators of crime.

While all shut their eyes in fear, it was only Vasundhara who came forward and managed to thwart their attempts.”“It has never happened before in the state's history where such an appointment has been offered by the government. She told me it’s her dream come true and has filed an SI recruitment form. Her family is happy and cheerful.

On February 17, this number was 435. Earlier last week, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao had announced that the Jumbo Covid facilities in PMC will be made ready to admit patients if needed. After Rao’s announcement, the two civic bodies were to float new tenders for the operations. The process had not started till Tuesday. Abhijit More, health activist and state co-convenor for NGO Jan Arogya Abhiyan, said, “It is essential that the Jumbo hospitals are kept ready. Under the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Abhiyan scheme, we had contracts with private hospitals to admit Covid patients. These contracts expired in December. As cases were going down, they were not renewed. Under the current circumstances, it is pertinent that Jumbo hospitals are ready so critical patients won’t have to suffer.” Last year, the government decided to set up two Jumbo hospitals - one at the College of Engineering in Pune (COEP) and another at the Annasaheb Magar stadium in Pimpri-Chinchwad – both by August 20. However, delays in setting them up and subsequent issues about management of the COEP hospital, only deteriorated patients’ confidence in the facility.“We haven’t received the order from the divisional commissioner’s office to issue tenders for new operators for the jumbo facility. The audit report from IIT Delhi has been received by the divisional commissioner. Once it gets the clearance from the steering committee we can start the procedure,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner. Rao had earlier said till the time patients are admitted into these facilities, they could be used for vaccinations. The steering committee meeting for the Covid review is scheduled on March 10. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao did not respond to phone calls or text messages. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said though the number of positive cases is increasing, the proportion of patients in home isolation is more. He also pointed out that 13,000 tests are being done per day in the district Dr Avinash Bhondave, president, Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra, said, “The rate at which Covid cases have been rising, there could soon be a shortage of beds in Pune. Currently, beds are available in private hospitals and in Sassoon. In April we may face the situation where enough beds are not available. Jumbo Hospitals should be ready with all basic amenities, infrastructure and trained staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-tenders-issued-for-running-of-jumbo-covid-hospitals-by-pmc-pcmc-101615302082556.html

This has also led to a rise in the number of patients needing critical care and/or oxygen supply. This number has gone up from 435 on February 17, to 1,044 as of Tuesday, March 9. Despite the administration’s claims that new cases are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, the numbers suggest otherwise. As per the PMC’s daily health report, as of February 17, when the city reported 428 new cases, it had 145 critical patients, with 290 on oxygen supply, these two numbers adding up to 435. The city had 1,881 active patients and reported four deaths on that day.However, on Tuesday, the city reported 1,086 new cases, with 321 critical patients and 723 on oxygen supply, the last two numbers adding up to 1,044. The city’s active count has now jumped up to 7,020 and six deaths were reported by the PMC on Tuesday, March 9. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said on Monday that 80%-90% of the new cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee said, “The rise in cases is a definite sign that the rise in the spread of the infection is widespread. Although most of cases reported are those with mild symptoms.” Earlier, the district administration in a presentation had said that the newer cases are mostly family members of those in home isolation and are being taken care of by their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/number-of-critical-covid-case-in-pune-more-than-doubles-since-feb-17-101615301422412.html
09-03-2021||Gurugram||Ahead of no-confidence motion in Haryana assembly, BJP, JJP and Cong issue whips||Chief whips of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) and the Haryana Congress have asked their respective legislators to be present in the House on Wednesday when the opposition plans to move a no-confidence motion against the state government. Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta had fixed the date for the no-confidence motion last Friday. The no-confidence motion will be brought before the assembly during the ongoing budget session.“The members of CLP, Haryana are informed that no-confidence motion against the government shall be listed on March 10 in the business of the House,” Congress chief whip BB Batra told MLAs, according to a report by news agency PTI. “I issue a whip, that you must ensure your presence in the House on March 10 at 10 am positively and support the vote of no confidence. Members are advised not to leave the House without prior permission of the CLP leader,” Batra added.The BJP’s chief whip Kanwar Pal also issued a similar order. “All the members of the Bharatiya Janata Legislature Party are requested to remain present in the House throughout the 10th day of March during the current budget session of Haryana Vidhan Sabha. They should not leave the chamber without prior permission of the leader,” Pal said. The JJP chief whip chief whip Amarjeet Dhanda also asked MPs to be ‘present positively in the House throughout the day’ and support the government.Former chief minister Bhupinder S Hooda claimed that the government has admitted its own failures. Hooda said, “Does the Opposition need to say anything more? The government is admitting to its failures over law and order. Personal agenda, and not public interest, dictate the functioning of this coalition.”Hooda was referring to the extension of the tenure of director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. His move was condemned by several lawmakers of the BJP and JJP who feel that Yadava lacks control over his officers, which they say has led to the deterioration of the law and order situation. Haryana minister Anil Vij in February had written to the additional chief secretary (home) to send a panel of officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for selecting the next DGP despite Yadava having four years of service left.Former CM BS Hooda also said that the no-confidence motion will clearly show which MLAs support the farmers. “The coalition government has emerged as the biggest anti-farmer government in the country due to the dictatorial attitude towards the farmers' movement,” Hooda told PTI last week.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the farmers' unions agitating against farm laws, also on Saturday appealed to people to pressurise the MLAs of the JJP and the BJP to vote in favour of the no-confidence motion against the Haryana government on Wednesday. Darshan Pal, leader of the SKM, told people that the Khattar government needs to realise that the people are with the agitators.The Haryana assembly has 90-members but its effective strength is 88. The ruling BJP-JJP combine enjoys a majority in the legislative assembly—the BJP has 40 members, the JJP has 10 and seven Independent legislators who have extended their support to the government. One member from the Haryana Lokhit Party has also extended support to the government. Congress has 30 legislators in the Haryana legislative assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ahead-of-no-confidence-motion-in-haryana-assembly-bjp-jjp-and-cong-issue-whips-101615299586879.html

We [Srila and husband Mahesh Mathai] walked every day at high noon when there was nobody on the street. I had never spent so much time at home with Mahesh, my dogs and the staff who were with us. I loved it.It was a very busy time, too. The world had shut down, but you can’t shut down your responsibilities, with salaries to pay and commitments to keep. I had to reset our business plan [Srila owns Baro, an art and furniture store], so it wasn’t all downtime to sit and reflect. I was intensely busy, building a whole new business [a virtual marketplace for the store] while trying to deal with the fact that there’s a pandemic so you can’t work as you normally would. It was exhausting.The pandemic highlighted how horribly divided the world is. I feel a lot of anger about how things are being dealt with. It’s no one’s fault, the pandemic, but certainly how you deal with it is in your control. It’s been a disaster. I heard one panel of experts discuss how there is likely to be another [pandemic] in a few years – because that’s the world we’ve created. This is the new reality, so what can you do? You can empower science, get better systems in place for vaccinations, but more importantly, I wish the world would get better legislations in place for wealth to be distributed more equitably.I can do that within my microcosm: help put lives right and change mindsets, and perhaps try and get more people to ensure that within their microcosms, they build a world that’s better than the one outside.My life has also become smaller in a sense. To me, it’s maddening that intelligent people buy into ideas like India is doing fantastic because the stock market is booming or [are okay with the idea of] fascism. So I have started to live in a gated community of minds; people who think and feel the same way [as I].I find it rejuvenating to be in my small world: what I’m doing with the Baro Market, working within the same India but showing the parts of it that I really celebrate: the small brands; the crafts; people working in collaboration. It’s very inspiring.'People need people'ANNIE ZAIDI | WRITERAs a freelance writer, I’ve always dealt with uncertainty. While the disruption [caused by the pandemic] rattled the upper middle class and the privileged, uncertainty is something that artists and writers live with, as do the poor, whether it’s a consequence of meagre earnings or one illness in the family that drives you below the poverty line. What did hit me hard though was the realisation that this city isn’t built for people to stay home, that unless you’re affluent, home is just a place where you sleep.FFrom all over the world, videos emerged showing people singing in their balconies, but most apartments in Mumbai don’t have balconies. It doesn’t cost a builder much to add; it’s just a question of consideration for the person who will use that space. In this city, the wealthier you are, the more access you have to things that really should be free.The city has no parks and gardens to speak of, unlike Delhi where each neighbourhood has a park, so it’s at least possible to conceive of a situation where, perhaps by arranging time slots so they don’t get overcrowded, everyone would be allowed some access to air. Here, there are entire areas where there aren’t even any pavements. You begin to think if this is the new normal, then what kind of place do you want to live in.I enjoy the theatre, and I watched one play that was staged online. It was very well done under the circumstances, but nowhere close to a real theatre experience. The physical presence of everyone around you transforms experiences entirely.Being around people helps you process what you’re feeling and I’ve really begun to see the importance of that. I’ve participated in traditions earlier without really appreciating their purpose, but when the pandemic deprived people of the ability to grieve in traditional ways, to me it accentuated the need for rituals that allowed for a period of public grieving, as opposed to private grieving, which continues under all circumstances. I’ve become more aware of the importance of being around people and the significance of social mechanisms that allow people to participate in each other’s grief and in their moments of happiness, and to reach out to loved ones in their time of need.'Remote working is the most efficient way'RAHUL KADRI | ARCHITECT-URBAN PLANNERFor one, I realised that we can work from anywhere, as long as there is wi-fi. My wife [architect Shimul Jhaveri] and I were at The Club Mahabaleshwar for a week and it occurred to us that we don’t have to be in Mumbai to work. Once a month, we can go see a new place and work from there. People in our team are now working from Goa or Bhopal — they have moved back to their hometowns. It’s made a huge difference for our team members who used to commute from places like Kandivili and Thane. It’s also made a huge difference for our team members who used to commute from places like Kandivili and Thane. People with young children got to spend more time with them — of course, they got fed up too, but that’s a different story.I started to focus on my health. I started going to bed earlier, and that’s something I’ve been sticking to, except for when I’m at the restaurants. Because I was home and not travelling — which meant that I was not eating at restaurants or consuming so much airline food — I became disciplined about my meals, and that helped me lose weight and get into better shape. I’ve also started doing yoga every morning, which helps combat stress and strengthens the lungs.Workwise, it was an extremely challenging time but it only helped me realise that the restaurant business is what I do best. Many restaurants shuttered due to the pandemic and the loss in business — two of our properties, Ek Bar in Delhi and Fatty Bao in Kolkata, closed down too — and the buzzword in the food and beverage industry was “pivot”, with everyone talking about what [business] they were going to pivot to.Many changed business models, some even moved to entirely new streams. We decided to focus on our core business and stick to our philosophy that centred on great relationships with our customers, goodwill and credibility, and this helped us get back on our feet.Everything we have is pledged in the business. We had never cashed out as we believe in what we’re doing. I felt I am building a nice future for my family and it was a grim thought [that the industry may collapse]. A big realization for me was that one must prepare for what uncertainties the future may hold and put away something for the family. As a company, too, we have been exploring how to make ourselves less vulnerable for the future.‘Others pivoted; we stuck to our beliefs’AD SINGH | RESTAURATEURThe experience of being confined in our homes through the lockdown only reinforced my basic belief that family is important; the pandemic emphasised the importance of loved ones. The lockdown allowed me to spend a lot of time with my children, Zoey and Zen, who are nine and three. Working from home allowed me to get much closer to my daughter than I’ve ever been before.I started to focus on my health.

The months of complete lockdown were spent learning to be still, relaxing, meditating, reading and just being with oneself and the family. I revisited books I swear by, like the entire spiritual series by Parthasarathy, and I felt grateful for so many things like the positivity of the team and the fact that I had invested in a sustainable office building, where, incidentally, we can work without air-conditioning because of the open spaces and the design which incorporates natural cooling methods.It’s located in Navi Mumbai, near the hills, so it has a resort-like feel, which makes it such a lovely place to work in. There are about 700 to 800 of us working here, and years ago, we organised company buses from different parts of the city so even transport did not pose a problem. I was, however, painfully aware of the difficulties that many others faced. One moment when I felt very low was when the migrant labourers started walking back to their homes; that memory will stay with me forever.But it’s also important to remember the warmth of the people. So many came forward to help in whatever way they could. As a cancer survivor, who’s over 57, I had to be very cautious, but I offered what assistance I could from home.The pandemic made us all realise how much we take for granted, but it also underscored the need to respect the finite resources of the earth. The situation demanded that we live simpler lives.I’ve always eaten my meals at work, so mealtimes with the family made for a lovely change. At one point I decided to make my detergents and floor cleaners at home; I dabbled in cooking, which I rarely do, and really enjoyed sitting in the garden, listening to the chirping of birds, without a single thought in my mind. I want to believe that I’ll make time for these things now. I’ve been working non-stop for so many years that I feel I can work smarter now, rather than harder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-year-of-covid-lessons-in-lockdown-101615299930314.html
09-03-2021||Pune||Residents demand faster pace in completion of improvement works at Pashan-Sus flyover||Residents are unhappy with the diversion for commuters to travel from Pashan to Susgaon via NH48 service road due to safety concerns and traffic jams. The traffic was diverted at the junction due to the ongoing construction of the flyover connecting Pashan to Susgaon. The alternate route from Hyundai showroom, Sus road via Supreme HQ building to Nanawre subway is causing a strain for many living in Sus and Susgaon. Manoj Bhagwat, a resident of Sus is cautious while driving his car on the alternate road. “Considering the number of residents and the vehicles, the dimensions (width) of service road is not sufficient. There are society roads which are connecting perpendicular to the service road. This has reduced the visibility from either side which may lead to accidents in the future. In order to tackle this, authorities need to arrange a mirror since there isn’t a turning radius either.” He also added that since many residents opt to shop on the alternate road, there is no sufficient parking space along service road. Sameer Uttarkar, a resident of Pashan said, “The bridge/ flyover was the shortest route to reach Susgaon, now it is a nightmare for residents have to travel towards Baner to get onto the alternate route. The process of construction is very slow. In fact, they should have constructed the service roads connecting this bridge first so that traffic jams at this point were avoided. The service roads in this area are uneven and narrow at some parts for example the service road near Nanavare underpass is narrow compared to other service roads. Some underpasses near this area are only allowed for two-wheelers if four-wheelers are also allowed, it would reduce the pressure on the traffic.” According to the PMC special projects who are handling the construction of the flyover/ bridge for NHAI, the project is progressing and will be completed in a stipulated time. Indrabhan Randive, executive engineer in charge of the project said, “55 per cent of the construction is ready and another 45 per cent remains. We should be able to complete it by November 2021.” This bridge is being built at the cost of ₹40 crore and local corporator Baburao Chandere had proposed it a few years ago. This new flyover will connect the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway to Sus and Pashan with a 350-metre road from the west side. “The flyover will now be 18 metres instead of the existing 8 metres-wide Pashan-Sus Bridge which was insufficient with the increase of residences and IT companies in Hinjewadi and Sus,” added the engineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-demand-faster-pace-in-completion-of-improvement-works-at-pashan-sus-flyover-101615300522434.html

The pay- and-park space allotted has been non-operational. If we don’t allow parking in front of our stalls it will impact our business.”Shop owners claim traffic jams occur only sometimes.“I have been working at Meena pav bhaji for the last three years. I have never seen a major traffic congestion occurring due to two-wheeler parking. No shop owners allow four-wheeler parking in the evenings,” said Ramesh Sutar, a stall employee at Sarasbaugh.Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic), said, “Parking on both the sides at Khau Galli is not allowed. I will send officials to check the situation.”Commuters, café owners fume “Such rules were never there for the last 80 years, then why now? We can understand the footpath is needed for pedestrians in front of our café, but there is no problem parking in the side lane . People come and ask us where to park, we tell to find a place in the front, due to which, half of our customers do not return,” said, Hamid, of Goodluck Café, who goes only by his first name. The owner of Victoria Café, on condition of anonymity, said, “The rule has impacted our business. Our customers are students and if they don’t get parking, they don’t visit our café.”DCP Shrirame added, “No parking on both the sides near Goodluck Café leading to Suvarna Smruti hall is a must. Lots of congestion was happening on the road and now a free movement of vehicles is possible. The no- parking order will not be revoked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goodluck-cafe-lane-joins-new-list-of-no-parking-zones-much-to-chagrin-of-business-owners-101615298842185.html

"The building belongs to the railways. But I have come to know that no one from the railways reached the spot till now. Our fire department asked for the building map from them in order to enter the premises but there was no cooperation from them," she had said.Accountability war between fire department, railwaysCountering her claims, though, railways minister Piyush Goyal said that "all possible assistance has been provided by the Railways to the state government" over the unfortunate incident. Not only did railway officials, including the general manager, coordinate with the state government at the site but also a 'high-level inquiry' consisting of four principal heads of railway departments have been asked to look into the case, informed Goyal.Railway officials including the GM are at the site and are working in coordination with the State Govt for rescue and relief efforts. We are committed to doing everything possible to ensure safety of all concerned.All possible assistance has been provided by the Railways to the State Govt during this unfortunate fire accident. A high level inquiry consisting of four Principal heads of Railway departments has been ordered to ascertain the cause of the fire.Railway officials also countered her charges. "Officers of railways were present there, efforts were being made for whatever was required. Maybe a map wasn't made available immediately but staff members of railways were present to guide about the building,” Eastern Railway's general manager Manoj Joshi said in an interview with news agency ANI. “We will cooperate with the state in any probe they will conduct," Joshi added.The BJP’s West Bengal co-in-charge Amit Malviya in a tweet said that the state should equip local bodies with fire fighting equipment and put in place appropriate protocols.WB needs a proactive disaster management policy, equip local bodies with fire fighting equipment and put in appropriate protocols.It also needs a transparent and efficient fire fighting policy, with mechanism to certify buildings for fire preparedness.Pishi has failed Bengal!"Pishi" is the Bengali word used for paternal aunt and the BJP refers to Banerjee as one as she is the aunt of TMC lawmaker and party heavyweight Abhishek Banerjee.The state’s fire and emergency services minister Sujit Bose regretted that the BJP is politicising the tragedy for "cheap electoral gains". "From installing hydraulic ladder to largely containing the blaze, our men did everything possible. It is the railways which could not provide us with a map of the interiors of the 12th floor,” he said.Nine people, including four firefighters, three railway personnel and an assistant sub-inspector of Kolkata Police, died in the blaze.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/trinamool-bjp-trade-barbs-over-kolkata-fire-tragedy-101615288824553.html

According to Maha-Metro officials, as the three coaches (one train) have arrived from Nagpur on Sunday, the trial run on the one kilometre stretch from Vanaz depot to Anandnagar station will most likely start this month. Pune Metro has successfully conducted a six-kilometre trial run between Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Phugewadi in the first week of January. Maha-Metro plans to start commercial operations on two priority stretches of Pune Metro this year. According to officials, the contract with the Italian firm for coaches is for 34 train sets with each having three coaches (102 coaches) to be supplied in 160 weeks. The total cost of train coaches is around ₹1,100 crore.

Police said the vehicle was stolen from Airoli- Mulund Bridge on February 18. The mystery deepened after Hiran's body was found in a creek last Friday in Thane district neighbouring Mumbai.Also read: U-turn by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena: Raj says revive Nanar to get jobs for localsBefore the adjournments, Fadnavis claimed that Hiran's wife has given a statement that her husband may have been murdered by assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze.The Leader of Opposition demanded that Vaze be arrested under Indian Penal Code Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence).Fadnavis said Hiran's wife has claimed in her statement to police that her husband knew Vaze andthe Scorpio was with the police official from November 2020 to February 5, 2021."She had also said her husband was with Vaze on February 27, 28 and March 2. The complaint letter (of Hiran) addressed to the chief minister, DyCM and police commissioners of Mumbai and Thane which surfaced in public after his death was written on the instructions of Vaze," Fadnavis alleged.He said Hiran's wife also claimed in her statement that her husband told her that Vaze had asked him to get himself arrested and he would ensure his bail in a few days."On April 4, Mansukh told his brother Vinod to speak to a lawyer for anticipatory bail as he might be arrested. But, the lawyer said anticipatory bail will not be accepted as Mansukh is not an accused," Fadnavis said.The former chief minister further claimed that Hiran's last location was found with Dhananjay Vithal Gawde, against whom an FIR was lodged for seeking a ransom of ₹40 lakh in 2017.The other person who was mentioned in the FIR is Sachin Vaze, Fadnavis said."Mansukh's body was later found 40 km away. He may have been murdered in the car and the body may have been thrown into the creek. Since it was a low tide, the body was found," the BJP leader said.Countering Fadnavis, Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab, who is the state's parliamentary affairs minister, demanded arrest of those named in the suicide note of Lok Sabha member Delkar.To this, Fadnavis said the government was trying to "protect" Vaze."I have the suicide note (of Delkar) and no name, except of the administrator (of Dadra and Nagar Haveli Union Territory), is mentioned. The administrator doesn't belong to any party," he said.Delkar (58), a seven-term MP from the Dadra and Nagar Haveli, was found dead at a hotel on Marine Drive in south Mumbai on February 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mansukh-hiran-death-fadnavis-seeks-arrest-of-cop-sachin-vaze-101615281046384.html

The Congress has alleged that their members were put under pressure to quit the party, a charge rejected by the party rebels.Last week, president of Anantnag municipal council, Hilal Shah, joined the Apni Party along with 21 councillors. Shah and 16 of these councillors had won the local bodies elections in 2018 on a Congress ticket. Hilal Shah had contested several elections as a Congress party member in the past.Apni Party president, Altaf Bukhari welcomed him to the party at a function in Srinagar and said it will help make the party strong in south Kashmir which is considered a bastion of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP)."My workers decided to join the Apni party for the sake of the development of our areas. After we met the Apni Party leadership, we found that the party is more people-friendly than others," said Shah.Also read: ‘Rahul Gandhi should go to school’ - Giriraj Singh on 'ministry of fisheries' rowShah joined Congress in 2009 and unsuccessfully contested against former chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in the 2014 assembly elections. "I am a common man, I don’t have any political background. I contested my first election in 2007 as an independent candidate and joined the Congress two years later. My workers are only concerned about the development of Anantnag and nothing else," he added.With Shah’s entry, the Apni Party now has a foothold in south Kashmir's urban areas of Anantnag town. Earlier, municipal council president, Baramulla, Omar Azhar Kakroo, who belonged to the family of old Congress loyalists, joined Apni Party along with nine councillors. Now, the Congress, which had 10 members in Baramulla Municipal Council is left with a lone member.Omar Azhar Kakroo said he and his associates left the Congress because of its local leadership. "The party didn’t have any strong leader so we were forced to leave the party." He said there was no pressure on him or others from any quarter to join the Apni Party.Apni Party senior leader, Shoaib Lone said that Congress was now a defunct party. "People were leaving the party as its leadership was in disarray and fighting with each other." Lone, a former legislator who resigned from Congress last year, said that for these municipal leaders, the Apni Party was a natural choice. "Our party president is accessible and is always aware of the problems of party workers. The councillors who joined our party wanted to work for their people, so they decided to join us."Congress J-K president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir said the party lost control over two municipal councils in Baramulla and Anantnag. "The councillors and presidents were given threats by various agencies and were forced to join the Apni Party. Influential people intervened and forced our members to join the new party," Mir said. He added that time will prove that Congress members were forcibly made to join the Apni Party on the pretext of security, government accommodation and protection from false cases. “This has become a routine in the country," he claimed.Mir said the Congress still controls half a dozen councils in Kashmir. "The Almighty knows they will try to control these councils by force," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jk-congress-loses-2-key-municipal-bodies-in-south-and-north-kashmir-101615289007800.html

He said the Delhi government will do everything to ensure that the Capital is ready for such an event.“In the budget, we have mentioned a vision that the 2048 Olympic Games should be held in Delhi. We shall bid for the games and we will do whatever it takes to build the infrastructure and create other necessities required for this. We will talk to the Central government to bid for Delhi as an Olympic venue for the 2048 games,” Kejriwal told media persons after the presentation of the budget.The process of selection of candidate cities for the Olympic Games is a long-drawn one and is divided into two phases, according to the guidelines mentioned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The first part of the process is known as the invitation phase - where generally cities and National Olympic Committees (NOCs) take part in a dialogue with IOC and hold workshops and the second phase is the candidature process - where cities along with the NOCs make a formal commitment to bid for the games. The candidature process spans two years during which the IOC will thoroughly review the cities’ development plans, legal infrastructure and the IOC will also review on-site analysis of every candidate city.During the budget presentation, the Delhi chief minister also said that the government will aim to increase the per capita income of the city. Kejriwal said the government aims to lift the per capita income of the city so that it is on a par with Singapore. According to World Bank data, Singapore’s per capita income (as of 2019) is $65,233.3. A recent report shows that Delhi’s per capita income has shrunk ₹3,76,211 in 2019-20 to ₹3,54,004 in 2020-21.

He called the raid harassment and added the police’s special cell deliberately chose Tuesday for it as they knew he would be away for them to seize his computers and documents.“I had to be in court in a case related to the same agency [special cell]. I had to come to court to cross-examine one of their officers. The officer in the case is the same who has ordered the raids. They took a warrant and had two weeks to raid my office, but they chose to do it today [Tuesday]. They were aware that I would be in court.”In December, the special cell conducted searches at Pracha’s office in Nizamuddin in connection with a case filed against him. A video of the raid, which showed police and Pracha arguing inside his office, was widely circulated on social media. Citing client-attorney privilege, Pracha refused to show some papers then.

09-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab FM skips fund for Bathinda cancer institute in budget||The state-run Advanced Cancer Institute (ACI) in Bathinda, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s constituency, has once again been deprived of grant for upgrade in the proposed annual budget. Functioning since July 2016, the institute has been awaiting a PET-CT (positron emission tomography and computed tomography) scan machine. In the budget presented on Monday, Badal allocated ₹3,822 crore for the health and family welfare sector. Sources say the ACI’s nuclear department has infrastructure in place but needs funds for the machine to treat cancer patients, who need scans during or post-treatment for diagnosis and assessment of malignant cells. An imaging test is useful in revealing or evaluating cancers, including breast, cervix and thyroid. Due to the non-availability of PET scan at the ACI, patients have to travel to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH) in Faridkot, the only state institute to have the facility. The sources say that a couple of private medical institutions in Ludhiana have the testing facility but it costs nearly ₹15,000. Average daily footfall of 200 at OPD The ACI is a constituent of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, and the centre has an average daily footfall of 200 in the outdoor patient department (OPD) from Bathinda and adjoining districts of the state, Haryana and Rajasthan. The Bathinda institute was established by the former SAD-BJP government as Malwa region of Punjab has numerous cases of cancer patients. Prior to an exclusive facility in the state, patients had to travel to the nearest cancer hospital in Rajasthan’s Bikaner district. Much-needed testing facility ACI medical superintendent Dr Deepak Arora said on Tuesday that it would be beneficial if the centre is equipped with the much-needed testing facility. “According to the plan, the ACI was to get a PET scan facility in the second phase. We have started with radiotherapy and chemotherapy but the availability of testing will offer comfort to patents forced to travel to far-off places,” said Arora. An attendant said patients in need of a PET scan have to register first in Faridkot and then wait their turn, which comes after a month due to the rush at the medical college. “Not all patients prefer to wait that long for a test and go to private hospitals in Ludhiana that is expensive,” the attendant added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-fm-skips-fund-for-bathinda-cancer-institute-in-budget-101615287082219.html

He said that the government was working towards a pollution-free Delhi by India’s 100th year of independence.“Our government is working on a holistic, 360 degree-approach to tackle the problem of pollution in the city and we are doing that through various measures such as increasing the green cover, making anti-smog guns mandatory at construction sites and coming up with policies for the better management of solid waste. Our aim is that in the 100th year of independence, Delhi can leave behind the problem of pollution, just like Covid-19,” Sisodia said in his budget speech. Also Read | Delhi Budget 2021: Allocation for urban infra up, govt to work on decongestionThe Delhi government on Tuesday allocated ₹9,394 crore for improving the city’s environment. Making a special mention of the government’s electric vehicle policy, Sisodia said that before this initiative, the share of electric vehicles in Delhi was merely 0.2% of the total registered vehicles. However, after the policy was launched, this share has increased to 2.2% of the total registered vehicles in the Capital. “The government now aims that by 2024, the share of electric vehicles in Delhi will improve to around 25% and to make this happen, we are working towards installing as many as 500 charging points. At present, there are 72 such charging points in Delhi. The idea is to have a charging facility within every three kilometres,” Sisodia said. He also said that the aim of his government through such policies is to get “100% freedom from vehicular pollution”. To augment the public transport infrastructure, Sisodia said 1,300 additional e-buses will be added to the city’s fleet. For the first time in the last decade, Delhi has managed to get 6,693 public buses in its fleet; another 1,000 will be added by September. “We are inching towards getting the total fleet size to 11,000,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-budget-govt-to-tackle-pollution-with-360-degree-approach-says-sisodia-101615279461804.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||JNU foodies hail the reopening of canteens on campus!||Known for its big beautiful campus, Jawaharlal Nehru University’s vibrant ideological debates are often carried out at the many hip canteens and dhabas that it has within the campus. And students who identify themselves as the foodies of JNU, can’t keep calm since these eating joints have recently reopened! “The canteens are the spring of JNU, without them JNU doesn’t have a season and looks desolated. A few canteens on campus have become functional and students are visiting them like the canteens at School Of International Studies one and two (SIS-I, SIS-II), the library canteen, Godavari and Aravali. Babu Bhaiya in SIS-I is my favourite person! His laddoos keep my anger in check, and prevents me from getting hangry,” jokes Peerzada Haroon, an MPhil student of JNU, who recently visited the campus to check out the reopened canteens. Talking about how buzzy the food scene was on #Day1, Haroon adds, “I went to Aravali, a lot students were there. I went to library canteen and a lot students were there, too. Godavari again seemed full of chitter chatter. SIS-I and SIS-II are struggling to attract people perhaps because laddoos are yet to be made!”Every foodie has his own favourite food joint, and so is the case with the JNU students. “I miss the food of Mughal Darbaar Dhaba because it’s the only place on campus that offers good non-veg! It has been almost a year now that it’s not functional and I hope the administration reopens it soon,” says Bhanu, a PhD student at JNU, adding, “There was a notification last week that said that the other canteens will reopen in a phased manner, and will restart functioning soon, but no word on the Mughal Darbaar. I don’t know why they specifically left that one... The food inside campus is relatively cheaper as compared to the food outside the campus, and that’s why it’s great to have the canteens reopen finally.”It doesn’t come as a surprise that even a die hard foodie is sure to check how the sanitisation facilities have been put in place, since the pandemic had forced the campus and the canteen to remain shut for a long time. “I visited the library canteen today after many months; it felt nice to be back on campus although it was a bit odd to not be around all my friends. The canteens were sanitised. Everyone was wearing a mask. There were sanitiser bottles kept in the campus, and the food was tasty and clean as always,” says Arshid Hussain, an MPhil student at the university.What’s certainly back is the bonding over chai samosa! “I ate kadhi pakora, the dish that is much loved in the mess by students. Visiting the campus after a long time also gave me a chance to catch up with my campus friends who are living outside the campus for now and we flocked to Choudhary Ji to enjoy chai samosa, and talk about old times,” says Priya Kumari, an MPhil student, adding, “Stepping back into the JNU Campus after one year is giving me a sense of getting back to studies or work. Opening up of mess and canteens has also sorted my daily routine as now I don’t have to worry about cooking food and staying in an accommodation outside, which used to consume lot of time and energy.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-foodies-hail-the-reopening-of-canteens-on-campus-101615277782622.html

While presenting the budget, Sisodia said, “The government has provided water and sewer pipelines in 1,343 unauthorised colonies out of 1,797 colonies.” The government has planned in-situ redevelopment of slums.In the 2020-21 budget, the Delhi government allocated ₹3,723 crore for housing and urban development.As part of its initiative to decongest the city, the Delhi government has proposed to allocate nearly ₹600 crore, including ₹85 crore just for decongesting Ashram crossing in south Delhi. Delhi’s deputy CM Manish Sisodia announced that several important road projects will be completed within this financial year.While presenting the budget for the financial year 2021-22, Sisodia said, “The construction work of Ashram underpass will be completed by June this year after which the traffic on Mathura Road (Nizamuddin to Badarpur border) and Ashram crossing will ease out and there will be in reduction in travel time, pollution level and savings of fuel. I propose an outlay of ₹35 crore for this project in 2021-22. The extension of Ashram Flyover to DND Flyover will be completed by December 2021. I propose an outlay of ₹50 crore for this project in 2021-22,” said Sisodia.For its ambitious plan to beautify and redesign roads in the Capital, the government has proposed to allocate ₹500 crore. “In addition to the seven stretches (announced earlier), all preparations have been made for the beautification of roads of length 500km and it shall be carried out from this year onwards. I propose an outlay of ₹500 crore in the year 2021-22 for the scheme of street scaping and beautification of roads,” said Sisodia.The construction of two underpass projects at Wazirabad and Azadpur, one pedestrian subway near Gandhi Vihar on the Outer Ring Road and the construction of a bridge on the Najafgarh drain at Basaidarapur will be completed by May 2021, said Sisodia.The Delhi government’s Public Works Department is working on construction of five new projects in West and North Delhi to address the growing traffic problem in the area.The Delhi PWD plans to construct an integrated transit corridor between Punjabi Bagh flyover and Raja garden, an integrated transit corridor between Jwala Heri Market Red Light to Jwalapuri Red Light, a comprehensive scheme for Decongestion of Mukarba Chowk, Decongestion of Main Burari Road Junction on Parallel Road at Burari Delhi and construction of Road Over Bridge (ROB)/ Road Under Bridge (RUB) on Railway crossing no. LC-12 on Khera Kalan to Khera Khurd Road to ease congestion.The government is still working on three ambitious projects, which have been in planning for a long time, to decongest the city. The projects are: the East-West Corridor (elevated and tunnel road between Tikri and Anand Vihar), the North-South Corridor (elevated and tunnel road from the Signature Bridge to the airport) and an outer road running parallel to the Yamuna from the Signature Bridge to Sarai Kale Khan. Sisodia said that the government is waiting for UTTIPEC’s approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-budget-2021-allocation-for-urban-infra-up-govt-to-work-on-decongestion-101615276581027.html

09-03-2021||Other||One year of Covid: ‘Acceptance of being infected is longest, but first crucial step in path to recovery’||For a 20-something healthy person, the Covid19 infection is like an embodiment of a haiku - it starts off innocuous, quickly grows unpredictable, and leaves you in a mental space that is very different from when it began a short while ago. My family’s face-off with the virus solidified a hypothesis - the virus affects everyone differently. While the immediate effects of the infection are physical, they eventually transcend into psychological and social ones. At the end of August 2020, the month we got infected, my father, an ardent yogi, lost 13kg weight; and I found myself unable to run and in need of a therapist. Insurance had ensured zero financial stress for both of us, but I shudder at the thought of how people with symptoms like ours and no insurance managed. In the third week of July 2020, my father started going back to work after a break of four months. I had been working since the lockdown began and my family and I had convinced ourselves that we had managed to hack a way of keeping the virus out. We followed the purging techniques religiously; the word “sterillium”, had equated itself with water in our household and our olfactory senses are now accustomed to the sneeze-inducing odour. My father developed a cold and was granted medical leave from work. As we were too scared to enter an ENT doctor’s clinic, we decided to treat it with rudimentary cold medicine. Three days later, his cold was better, but he started developing mild cough. My mother, who is a retired nurse, had an instinct but refused to accept that her husband was infected.On July 27, 2020, I travelled to Chakan from Pune on my two-wheeler to report on the murder of a minor girl. The experience, as such stories often are, was confusing, if not traumatic. Therefore, I was not surprised when the set in the next day. By then, my father was practically wheezing instead of breathing. The realisation that an RT-PCR test was imminent settled on our collective conscience as a family. While booking a doctor’s appointment for my father, I started developing a fever and my mother simply froze. The doctor gave my father and me a prescription to get an RT-PCR test and the social anxiety of being the first ones in our residential society to have contracted the virus set in. We decided to drive down to a private laboratory and submit our swabs. Without any doubt, my father and I tested positive while my mother did not. Our doctor suggested that we go to the nearby hospital and get our vitals checked. This was a time when news of bed shortage was rife. As we went to a nearby private hospital, they checked our oxygen levels - my father’s was at 86, and I was at 89. We had gone with simply our phones and one debit card in order to minimise the number of things we bring out of the sanitised bubble in our house. The doctors asked us to get admitted immediately. Standing outside the emergency ward of the hospital, we quickly switched off our emotions to evade the effects of the panic that had started setting in. My mother knew what getting admitted would entail and we all simply shifted mental gears to the practical. What followed was two weeks of virtual paperwork, uncertainty, and laboured breathing, while being trapped inside the Covid-19 ward of the hospital. It was only at the end of day two in the hospital that I started experiencing the laboured breathing that my father had been experiencing for days. I was breathless even if I stood up too fast. We were both put on a course of 13 tablets, two injections, cough syrup, and an occasional steroid injection. My menstrual cycle went for a toss in the months to follow. I stopped experiencing symptoms after six days in the hospital while my father required oxygen support; experimental homeopathy treatment prescribed by the hospital; and 14 days to test negative. He entered the hospital wheezing. A husk of him came out of the hospital with a car parking bill of ₹7,000. Since he was not carrying any money, the hospital security let him drive out of the hospital after I paid ₹5,000 through an online transaction. The seven-10 days of infection seemed longer than weeks of working days. The infection unintentionally provides excess of that one resource that ambitious youngsters like to believe they have in short supply - time. The acceptance of being infected by the Covid-19-causing virus is the longest, but first crucial step in the recovery of an affected person. My father, an ardent yoga practitioner, has started practicing again, while I have started running, again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-year-of-covid-acceptance-of-being-infected-is-longest-but-first-crucial-step-in-path-to-recovery-101615275440484.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt allocates ₹50 crore in budget for free Covid jab in govt hospitals||Free vaccination against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for Delhi residents in government hospitals and the start of 100 new mahila mohalla clinics specialising in the treatment of women’s diseases were the key announcements in the health sector made by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in his budget speech on Tuesday. Even as private hospitals have started charging ₹250 per dose for immunising those in the third priority group, people over the age of 60 and those between the ages of 45 and 59 with comorbidities, the minister said that the government will continue to provide free vaccination to all Delhi residents in its own hospitals. The government has allocated ₹50 crore for the same. Also Read | Delhi Budget: Sisodia proposes virtual school, teachers’ training instituteAlthough the Centre has said that the vaccines will be procured and made available for the three priority groups, healthcare workers, frontline workers, and the old and comorbid, there has been no decision on what will be done to immunise the others. “Vaccines are available in private hospitals for ₹250, many people are wondering whether they should spend their earning for their ration or for vaccination... and in the 75th year of independence, nobody should think about that. Our government has decided that Delhi residents will continuously be provided vaccines for free in government hospitals,” said Sisodia in his budget speech. Speaking about the management of Covid-19, the minister said that it was the vision of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to start the process of home isolation and open the country’s first plasma bank that helped manage the high number of cases even as the world’s best healthcare systems crumbled during the pandemic. The government allocated ₹9,934 crore for the health sector, accounting for 14% of the total budget allocation. The minister also announced that after the mohalla clinic programme, the government has taken another revolutionary step in starting mahila mohalla clinics from next year. There will be 100 such clinics established in the first phase, followed by at least one such clinic in each of the 272 wards of Delhi. “We all know our mothers and sisters do not speak about their health issues openly. A woman from the middle class can go to a women’s specialist, but a woman from the lower middle class does not reach a gynaecologist. This is the reason many women live with disease thinking that it is nature. The Delhi government will take the responsibility to make a woman’s specialist and associated tests and medicine available within walking distance,” he said. The government also allocated ₹1,293 crore for the expansion of health infrastructure – the construction of new hospitals in Jwalapur, Siraspur, Madipur, and Vikaspuri, and remodelling of 19 existing hospitals. This will add 14,000 beds to the over 12,000 beds currently in Delhi government hospitals. The minister also said that the government already started two new hospitals – the one in Burari and the other in Ambedkar Nagar – during the pandemic for Covid-19 patients. The 1,241-bed Indira Gandhi hospital in Dwarka will also open up by next year, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-allocates-rs-50-crore-in-budget-for-free-covid-jab-in-govt-hospitals-101615275381114.html

Buyers, too, lost their purchasing power. The real estate sector, which provides employment to a large population, came to a complete standstill. However, the decision by the Maharashtra government to reduce stamp duty by three per cent revived the sector. This decision helped ready flats in the city sell, and put money in the hands of developers to start the new projects in Pune. While property registration numbers went up betwween October and December 2020, due to the stamp duty reduction, it did not add to the government coffers as revenue generation from stamp duty reduced.According to the statistics shared by the Inspector General of Registration’s (IGR) office, between September and December 2020, 11,94,013 document registrations were reported.A revenue of Rs11,702 crore was reported for the January to December period. This was against 8,44,963 document registrations bringing in Rs28,989 crore to the government exchequer in the Jan-Dec period of 2019.The centre imposed thee lockdown in March, as a result of which migrants workers were left stranded. By April and May, large chunk of workers left the city. As labour left the city, major infrastructure work like roads, water supply, and metro all got affected. In the absence of workers, municipal corporations were not able to carry out development works, even though they were allowed to, during lockdown. When the government allowed construction activity to resume, the first problem was labour. Without workers no construction activity was able to resume. Satish Magar, national president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) said, “Real estate sector was one of the worst affected. Investment was blocked and there was no respite seen. Government’s single decision on stamp duty changed the scenario and buyers also gave a huge response and purchased all the ready homes.” According to Magar, the real estate sector expects more demand from buyers in the coming days as the “work from home concept” will probably have citizens preferring to own their own homes. Prashant Waghware, city engineer, Pune Municipal Corporation said, “PMC got badly affected due to the lockdown as the revenue from building permission came down drastically. It was almost half as compared to previous year as no developer was willing to submit their files for new projects. Maharashtra government have a concession on stamp duty and people started purchasing homes. It helped to move the economy. Even the decision on introducing Unified Development Control Rules helped a lot as many developers are planning to launch new projects. All this will help to bring in more revenue for the building permission department.” Suhas Merchant, Credai Pune president said, “During lockdown, the real estate business came to a complete standstill, as labour went back to their hometowns. We took various initiatives for the welfare of labourers. Labour camps were made aware about the Covid-19 guidelines. Even financial institutes brought down the home-loan rates.” One of the builders, on condition of anonymity, said, “If the lockdown continued for a few months, almost all the small builders would have gone bankrupt. The state government’s 3 per cent stamp duty waiver, changedd the sector entirely. From villas to affordable housing all sold out. Now builders have enough money to start new projects. Even as the sector improved speedily, there is no chance of real estate prices dropping, as the builders’ capacity to hold inventory has increased again.” Stamp duty registration (in rupees)Month / 2019/ 2020 January/ 2,35,066/ 2,12,354 February/ 2,71,180/ 2,69,508 March/ 3,14,372/2, 14,195 April / 2,28,848/ 1,139 May/ 2,66223/ 42,573 June/ 3,20,183/ 1,53,155 July/ 2,58,632/ 1,65,139 August/ 2,21176/ 1,83,515 September/1,90,841/ 2,47,609 October/ 1,93995/ 2,47,601 November/ 2,20,808/ 2,74,773 December/ 2,39,292/ 3,97,396||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-year-of-covid-why-stamp-duty-reduction-may-have-single-handedly-rescued-real-estate-sector-101615275320473.html

There are both positive and negative sides which were seen last year. Students became more tech savvy due to online education; and they got more time to spend with parents, as working professionals were working from home. Initially, it was new for everyone and exciting. Even parents got family and bonding time with their children,” muses Dr Anjali Chaudhary of Sangopan -The Art of Parenting, a child counsellor and parenting coach. “When we talk about negative impact of Covid, there is the overuse of mobile phones and computers which caused various health issues. Students, who were earlier very studious and active, eventually became lazy and more prone to smartphones usage. Screen-sharing time increased, and other activities like sports and hobbies reduced,” Dr Chaudhary believes.“And the same happened with parents. They were already over-burdened with work, the children’s responsibility and their own personal issues. They are now at a point when they cannot wait for offices and regular offline school to start,” adds Dr Chaudhary. Archana Somawanshi, a working mother of two children, said, “The biggest challenge for parents in the last one year was to convince them that they should not go outside, maintain a social distance, wash hands regularly and focus on their studies. For working mothers like me, it was a double challenge, as we had to look after children, family members and our office work. When the lockdown began, our domestic help was let go odd, and till now, I am doing all my household work on my own.” Another parent Kiran Nagpure, sharing his experience of life in the times of Covid, said, “Initially when the lockdown began, we didn’t realise the seriousness of being at home. The first few days were fine, all of us – me, my wife and our five-year-old son didn’t have a fixed routine. Eventually we made a daily routine - household works, family time and work from home. In last one year this routine has helped us bond. This past year has made us understand the importance of having a routine in our daily life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-year-of-covid-locked-down-but-not-locked-out-families-in-the-time-of-wfh-101615275200424.html
09-03-2021||Other||One year of Covid: Crime gets a digital upgrade in face of pandemic||Cyber-crime in Pune city witnessed a spurt during the lockdown months, as online transactions, due to fear of the virus spreading through surfaces, increased. Vegetable vendors accepting payments through online transactions - once advertised as a hopeful future - became par for the course. The year of lockdown was as disturbing as unprecedented for a multitude of reasons. Multiple sectors like health, pharmaceutical, online payment and grocery service providers witnessed a spurt in the user-base… and in their misuser base. The effect was seen directly in the inbox meant for cybercrime-related complaints of the Pune police. “Compared to 2019, the number of complaints more than doubled in 2020,” recalls Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police, Cybercrime and Economic Offence Wing (EOW) of the Pune police. DCP Navatake, a software engineer by qualification, took office in October 2020, after movement restrictions started getting curtailed. As a result of the increased case load and changed leadership, staff strength has increased, and new units were introduced at the EOW and cybercrime cell. “Forming these units has helped us streamline the disposal of the huge number of pending cases. We have started a three-month training module for all officials of the cyber cell. Outside, as well as in-house experts, are called in to explain the basics to staff who have come from various backgrounds. This upskilling is the need of the hour,” said DCP Navatake. With the beginning of vaccination, the cyber-crime cell has started receiving complaints of frauds under the guise of providing vaccines. In the past few months, patient data of at least three hospitals was wrongfully used in fraud cases.In comparison to cyber-crime, registration of crimes like property theft, assault, and crimes against women decreased. During peak lockdown, there were days when the number of criminal cases registered in Pune city - with a population of at least a million people - was zero; a phenomenon unheard of. The number of registered cases of women who died within seven years of their marriage has remained near-constant for the past three years; lockdown could did not affect that statistic. While elaborate property crimes decreased, sporadic cases of theft of cash at pharmacies and grocery stores, the only two kinds of stores permitted to function during lockdown - were reported. CybercrimeFrom 5,523 complaint applications in 2018, the number of complaint applications jumped to 7,795 in 2019, and in 2020, 14,950 complaint applications were received by Pune city cybercrime cell. The largest contributors to these applications have been online fraud – involving dating, cheating, banking, and matrimonial cases; followed by social media-related cases, business-related online cases, hacking cases, and mobile phone-related offences. Online frauds jumped from 4,741 in 2019 to 8,824 in 2020; social media cases increased from 828 in 2019 to 2,174 in 2020; business-related cases increased from 636 in 2019 to 1,269 in 2020; hacking incidents increased from 113 in 2019 to 314 in 2020; and complaint applications about frauds committed using mobile phones increased from 88 in 2019 to 488 in 2020, according to records maintained by the cybercrime cell of Pune city police.Dowry-related deathsSection 304(b) of Indian Penal Code is invoked against the in-laws of a woman married for less than seven years, who dies due to dowry demands. In 2019, 16 such cases were registered in Pune city while 20 cases were registered in 2020. In 2018, 19 such cases were registered while 20 cases were registered in 2017. TheftThe collective number of different kinds of thefts, including house break-ins, chain snatching, mobile theft, and pick-pocketing, among others, was halved from 3,034 in 2019 and 3,544 in 2018, to 1,561 in 2020. The complete lockdown ensured no physical access to hotspots where such crimes were committed, and the looming fear of the virus was palpable in Pune which was one of the hotspots for the Covid19 infection. Vehicle theftAnother notable decline was in the vehicle theft cases. In the first six months of 2020, of which three months were under lockdown, the number of vehicle theft cases reported was 300, as against 1,000 in the first six months of 2019. Cases declined from 1,676 in 2019, to 975 in 2020. MurderThe year of the lockdown, however, did not affect the number of murder cases in Pune city. With 74 cases in 2019, the number of murder cases in 2020 was 71. One of the most violent murders during the lockdown months was that of Viraj Jagtap (20) a Dalit youth who was killed in Sangvi by the family members of a girl he was allegedly romantically interested in. Illegal possession and consumption of alcohol Under the Maharashtra Prohibition Act which prohibit possession or consumption of alcohol without required permits, increased in 2020. From 1,127 in 2019, registered cases went up to 1,243 in 2020. While the rush at liquor shops immediately after they were allowed to open was telling, the cases of theft at liquor shops just before the lockdown rules were brought into effect were also reported||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-year-of-covid-crime-gets-a-digital-upgrade-in-face-of-pandemic-101615275080425.html

We women must raise our voices on issues that make a difference to our lives||About five years ago, at a meeting for the preparation of the Pune Cycle Plan, a waste collector from SWaCH narrated her story: “I was around 35-years old when I decided to learn cycling. It helped me save time and money on travel for work. But, it was not easy for me. People in our community made remarks that I was becoming too bold, and that I might soon leave my husband.”It was dismaying to learn about such prejudices against women in this day and age, in Pune. But, she was courageous. She did learn cycling and has continued to cycle since then. We applaud such women.Women face difficulties because the city is not designed according to our needs, and no one is asking us. We encounter opposition to independent travel, both due to stereotypical attitudes, and out of concern for safety. Whatever be the cause, it restricts a woman’s freedom and ability to have a wholesome life.Among the various ways in which a city can empower women, is enabling independent travel. Women need transport options that work for them, by which they can access work, education and meet domestic and social needs.Ranjit Gadgil, programme director at NGO Parisar, says, “For a lot of women, a vehicle is a luxury, often not in their “control” and hence, public transport in Pune, much like the locals in Mumbai, is key. They do need travel options that are not restricted only to “safe” hours, or only short distances.”Studies here, and in other cities, show that women are more dependent on walking, cycling, use of rickshaws and public buses, and spend more time travelling. These are excellent modes from an environmental point of view, but they also must be designed and managed to be safe, comfortable and convenient for women.The travel patterns of women are also not the same as those of men, because their daily schedules are different. For example, the running of the home and care of children are typically seen as women’s work. Due to this, women may make a series of trips, such as dropping off children to school or day care, going to work, and purchasing domestic provisions on the way back.It is important to go beyond generic study insights to specifics – what type of services are needed and where, which areas feel unsafe? The PMC must enable platforms to engage with the public, and especially with women in all wards of the city, on a regular basis to understand these needs, and act to implement changes. Ward-level planning processes combined with creative mapping and discussion events are useful for this. For example, another SWaCH member had shared that, “Boys are zooming around on motorcycles while girls hesitate to even use a cycle. Why don’t you organise walking- and cycling-day events in vastis too. It will help to change the mentality.” Such events could be used for transforming attitudes, as well as mapping physical changes needed. These might include cycle stands near bus stops; identifying dark spots where street lights are needed; opening up a line of sight with other street users to improve safety; amenities for sitting spaces; trees with shade; drinking water and toilet facilities.It is clear that a city with safe, well-lit and active streets, with facilities to walk, cycle, use share-rickshaws and public transport will make a great difference to women’s lives.The opportunity to contribute to public decision-making, to change attitudes by involvement in civic decisions, and having a city that is safe and comfortable are intertwined.We need transport transformation in Pune, shaped by women. The Maharashtra Government’s Women and Child Welfare Department should take this on as a mission.Extending International Women’s Day to today, I #ChooseToChallenge myself and my sisters to raise our voices for safe, comfortable, affordable mobility. I #ChooseToChallenge the city and state governments to involve everyday women citizens in decision-making about transport facilities and public space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-sanskriti-choosetochallenge-we-women-must-raise-our-voices-on-issues-that-make-a-difference-to-our-lives-101615274960457.html

It was on Monday morning, when the villagers spotted her body and raised an alarm, following which, a team of forest department officials and local police reached the spot.The locals staged a protest demanding the animal be caught. They said this was the third such incident in the area when a leopard killed a human being. Earlier a middle aged woman was killed by a leopard while she was returning home after collecting dry grass from the nearby jungle.

Chagan Kanwar, wife of Mahendra Singh and Kailash Bai, wife of Nepal Singh crossed over to India on Monday through Wagah-Attari border along with some family members. They were welcomed by their waiting husbands at the border.After crossing the border they passed through a security check and a Covid-19 test. Nepal’s wife Kailash came to India along with her mother and brother while Mahendra’s wife Chagan Kanwar arrived with her father.Nepal Singh told HT that he was very happy to meet his wife but at the same time was also upset since his younger brother’s wife could not get a visa. “I am thankful to Union minister Kailash Choudhary who helped us at every stage and extended his full support in getting visa to my wife.” He further said that initially his wife was allowed entry only through the air route but since they could not afford the air travel, the Union minister again helped in getting permission for her to cross through Wagah-Attari road route. His brother Vikram Singh’s wife, Pakistani girl Nirmala Bai, was denied visa by the consulate on the grounds that her passport was blacklisted, said officials.Mahendra Singh said that after his wife was denied a visa, he ran from pillar to post but his plight was ignored. “I am very thankful to Kailash Choudhary, who not only understands our plight but helped us in every possible manner,” said Singh.27-year-old Nepal Singh Bhati and his 25-year-old sibling Vikarm Singh Bhati, residents of Baiyaa in Jaisalmer district, last January got married into Pakistani Hindu families, living across the border. After the marriage, both stayed in Pakistan for a while before returning to India without their brides as the Indian consulate denied visas to them on technical grounds.Nepal got married to the daughter of Ranjeet Singh Sodha on January 22, 2019, while Vikarm wed the daughter of Taneraj Singh Sodha on January 25, 2019. Post marriage, they stayed with their in-laws for about three months before returning to India without their spouses. In December, last year, Vikarm’s wife delivered a baby boy.Mahendra, a resident of Khejad Ka Paar in Barmer, got married to a Pakistan girl in April 2017. Both have been living apart since Chagan Kanwar was denied a visa by the Indian consulate. Kanwar is from Sinoi village in Amarkot district of Sindh. Mahendra’s story is more interesting as it is full of twists.Also Read: On Women's Day, Gehlot honours young girl; offers post of police sub-inspectorMahendra’s marriage with Chagan was earlier scheduled for March 8, 2019. But it was deferred due to the tension between the two countries following the Indian Air Force’s air strike on a terrorist hideout in Pakistan’s Balakot. Later, Mahendra went to Pakistan in April 2019 and got married on April 25, 2019. However, he had to return alone without his Chagan since the Indian consulate denied visa to her wife on technical grounds.For the past two years these couples were forced to live separately on the two sides of the border. They recently approached Union minister of state for agriculture and BJP MP from Barmer, Kailash Choudhary, who intervened on their behalf, making the external affairs ministry swing into action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/2-pakistani-brides-cross-wagah-border-to-reunite-with-their-indian-husbands-101615270134603.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC asks Centre to help fund treatment of minor suffering from rare disease||The Delhi high court has asked the Centre to look into the issue of funding the treatment of a five-year-old girl, who is one of the two persons in the country suffering from one of the rarest diseases Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTRBGD), “a rare genetic disorder which may be recorded in human history”.The disorder manifests itself with varied neurological manifestations, the early identification and treatment of which prevents associated mortality and morbidity.Justice Najmi Waziri, on March 4, took note of the submission by the child’s mother who had contended that there is some hope for treatment of her child in the United States of America, where ameliorative treatment has been administered to some patients similarly afflicted.Also Read | Delhi HC to hear plea challenging new rules to regulate internet contentShe told the court that the treatment involves multiple operations on the brain, over a period of 6 months but for medical reasons, it can be performed only upon a person over 7 years of age. She informed Justice Waziri that the expense in this regard would run into crores of rupees, which she cannot afford.According to the mother, the child has to be kept on a ventilator for approximately 10 to 12 hours a day. For this purpose, a trained nurse was engaged and hence expenses increased. She also told the court that as per an earlier order of Justice Waziri on August 31, 2018, the Delhi government was paying her ₹12,000 for the trained nurse, however the expense had risen to ₹50,000.On August 31, 2018, the court had directed the Delhi government to bear the medical and nursing expenses of the child, considering the circumstances of the case. While hearing a matrimonial dispute between the parents of the girl, the court had asked the Delhi government to step in and extend a helping hand. Considering it was not feasible for the mother to pay the high cost of the treatment, it had asked the Delhi government to offer all possible assistance taking in account the high cost of medicines and expenses towards engaging of a nurse and other specialised, trained staff.The mother had then informed the court that the child had to be kept in a sanitised environment in the house at Sarojini Nagar and attended by competent doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).On March 4, during a hearing of a contempt petition against the husband for the disbursal of maintenance, the woman told the court that the child required some more immediate assistance such as a portable ventilator, tubes and filters, etc in addition to the assistance offered by the Delhi government.She said that the child responds to her mother, her grandmother and a few other persons whom she recognises, and her physical health had has improved with the help of the Delhi government.The court asked advocate Satyakam, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, to consider the mother’s request compassionately and supply the requisite medical equipment to the mother before the next date in wake of the unprecedented nature of affliction and the uniqueness of the case.It also said that the Centre should step in and “consider this rare case for treatment of its most needy citizen”. The judge issued notice to the Centre, represented by standing counsel Gaurang Kanth, and the Delhi government, seeking to know their stand on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-centre-to-help-fund-treatment-of-minor-suffering-from-rare-disease-101615270280726.html

Health officials said the state recorded 1,736 new infections last week as against 1,054 new infections the week before from February 22-28. The continued increase in viral infections after a prolonged spell of decline however has not led to an increase in the sample positivity rate. The cumulative positivity rate which was 4.8% last week further reduced to 4.7%. Officials said the recovery rate was 98.6% and the mortality rate was 1.1%. Inoculation touches 4-lakh mark The vaccination coverage touched the 4-lakh mark (including the second dose to health care workers) on Monday.

And 99% of the sampling was done using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits, the gold standard test for detecting Covid-19,’’ he said. The ACS, health said total vaccination coverage of health care workers and frontline workers was 326250 and this included the second dose administered to health care workers. “We inoculated 22535 elderly from the 60 plus category on Monday alone. Our total vaccine coverage of those in 60 plus bracket and those in the 45-59 age-group with comorbidities is about 72,000,’’ he said.

The bodies could not be identified. It was suspected that one of them could be the Eastern Railway's deputy chief commercial manager Partha Sarathi Mondal who had been missing since evening.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had also announced compensation and offered assistance from the state government."Money cannot compensate for loss of life but the state government will stand by these familes.

Soon after, party leaders claimed, chief minister Nitish Kumar congratulated both for taking the vaccine.This has set the political circles agog with now certain merger of the RLSP with the JD(U). The RLSP has convened a meeting of party office-bearers on March 13 and 14 to take the final call. A senior RLSP leader said that Kushwaha held a meeting with his party leaders on Monday as many RLSP leaders left the party after talk of Kushwaha’s growing ‘proximity’ with JD(U) started.Singh, one of the senior most JD (U) leaders, has been negotiating with Kushwaha for the possible merger of the party. Kushwaha had a series of meetings with chief minister Kumar in the last three months, the last one being two days back in which CM, Kushwaha and Singh were present.Several RLSP and JD(U) leaders said on condition of anonymity that the modalities of merger along with Kushwaha’s new role has been decided. Kushwaha may also be given a seat in the legislative council, they added.“Very soon he will come. Let us assume that he is with us from today. He was, is and will remain close to us,” said Singh of Kushwaha, while talking to the media.Kushwaha, on his part, did not say anything on merger but recalled his association with Singh and Kumar. “I have an old association with dada (as Singh is fondly called in political circles).

09-03-2021||Delhi||Lockdown improved city’s air, experts say time to think local||The pollution levels in Delhi last year were the lowest since 2014, according to the economic survey report released on Monday. The outcome budget, also presented on Monday, showed that 79% of government projects, to tackle pollution levels in the national capital and improve the environment, are on track.Experts, however, attributed the reduction to the “unprecedented conditions” brought about by the Covid-19 lockdown and called for reforms to curb pollution by local and regional factors.The government data also showed that the average levels of major pollutants, including that of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres), PM2.5 (ultra-fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and nitrogen dioxide, have been decreasing steadily over the years.The annual average concentrations of PM2.5 decreased from 149 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) in 2014 to 101 ug/m3 in 2020, the survey report tabled by finance minister Manish Sisodia on Monday showed.The economic survey also said the annual average PM10 level also dropped from 324ug/m3 in 2014, to 187ug/m3 in 2020.In India, the acceptable standard for PM 2.5 is 60ug/m3 and for PM10 it is 100ug/m3. The annual average for PM2.5 and PM10, at all monitoring locations in Delhi, exceeded the prescribed standards, the report said.In the outcome budget, only around 15% of the projects to tackle pollution were behind schedule, a finding that bodes well for a city that has been plagued by rising pollution for long, especially during winter months.“All 26 ambient air quality monitoring stations are functional. Around 621 stack samples regarding the emission of industries, power plants, hotels etc., were tested up to December 2020, against the target of 700 samples during 2020-21,” the outcome budget report said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said, “Despite the declining trend (year-on-year basis) due to action taken over the past few years — shift to clean fuels for industry and transport, power plants, trucks, old vehicles — the winter PM2.5 concentration has bounced back, unmasking the impact of local and regional pollution. This demands quicker and more ambitious regional reforms to curb pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-improved-city-s-air-experts-say-time-to-think-local-101615243345078.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||L-G outlines govt plans, opens Budget session||Lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Monday outlined measures taken by the city government to fight the spread of Covid-19 along with the Central government during his speech at the Delhi Assembly to mark the beginning of the budget session.The L-G also noted that the economy of the Capital shrunk by 5.6% due to the pandemic. “All economies have been dented by Covid-19 and so has the economy of Delhi. Gross State Domestic Product of Delhi in real terms of constant prices is estimated to have contracted by 5.68% in 2020-21,” Baijal said.The government has undertaken various steps to handle the crisis and job losses due to the pandemic, including raising the number of hospital beds, setting up of plasma bank and allowing home isolation, Baijal said.“My government together with the Central government garnered all resources to ensure preventive and curative actions to safeguard the life of citizens of Delhi,” he said.The House on Monday paid homage to the farmers who died during the ongoing protests against the Centre’s farm laws, and the victims of natural disaster in Chamoli in Uttarakhand.Speaker Ram Niwas Goel on the occasion of International Women’s Day, invited deputy Speaker Rakhi Birla to conduct the proceedings of the House for the day.Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “It was inappropriate for the L-G to give so much credit to the AAP government for the Covid-19 management work. We condemn that. In reality, the Covid-19 situation in Delhi came under control only when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah intervened – from increasing tests to setting up the biggest Covid care centre facilities.”Baijal’s office did not respond to Bidhuri’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-outlines-govt-plans-opens-budget-session-101615242800212.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 hits Metro ridership, total vehicles in city at 11.8mn||The Covid-19 pandemic took a toll on the Delhi Metro in 2020, with its daily ridership nosediving from 5.7 million (before the lockdown in March), to one million since resuming services in the national capital on September 7, the latest economic survey for Delhi has revealed.According to the document released by the government on Monday, Delhi Metro services have been hit mainly due to the Covid-19 induced social distancing protocols. Metro services in Delhi were suspended from March 22, 2020, to September 6, due to the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the global pandemic.“While state-run buses have been allowed to carry passengers at full seating capacity, the same has not been allowed in the Metro yet. Due to social distancing norms, currently, the average daily ridership has decreased to about one million, including the ridership of the Airport Line and Rapid Metro in Gurugram,” said a Metro official, on condition of anonymity.Transport experts say the Metro ridership may have also suffered on account of the free bus rides for women scheme, launched by the Delhi government on October 29, 2019.The economic survey report stated that the free bus rides for women scheme helped women take 193.2 million trips for free till last year (2020), of which 105.8 million trips were made on Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and 87.4 million trips on cluster buses.In 2019-20, the combined ridership of DTC and cluster buses had increased to 5.1 million per day from 4.2 million in 2018-19. The report did not state the figures for 2020-21.Adding to Delhi’s pollution woes, a key component of which is automobile emissions, the economic survey indicated that the vehicular population has increased to 11,892,877 (4.4%) in 2019-20 as compared to 113,91,551 in 2018-19.The highest increase was seen in the two-wheeler segment, which now accounts for 7.9 million of the total registered vehicles in the city.As per the outcome budget, the transport department could issue only 4.7 million pollution under control (PUC) certificates instead of the targeted 7.5 million in 2020-21.KK Kapila, chairperson of the International Road Federation (IRF), said, “The only way forward is to keep increasing the number of buses in Delhi and make it so user friendly that more people give up their private vehicles and use buses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-hits-metro-ridership-total-vehicles-in-city-at-118mn-101615242470346.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Govt stays invested in students, on track to achieving targets||The per student expenditure incurred by the Delhi government has increased by around 35% in the last five years, according to the Economic Survey of Delhi 2020-21 tabled by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in the Assembly on Monday. The expenditure signifies the resources allocated to schools in accordance with their enrolment for education and learning.The Delhi government on Monday also presented its outcome budget for the last financial year, highlighting the initiatives taken to ensure continuous teaching-learning process at a time when schools were closed and classes shifted online due to Covid-19 pandemic.Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said despite the pandemic there has been no loss of days in the academic session. “The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated the schools to organise online classes for the benefit of students of government schools. Many creative initiatives were taken to reach out to the students who remained unconnected. The Delhi government has so far conducted educational activities for children for a total of 229 days in this session; a session normally is for about 220 days,” Sisodia said in his speech.According to the economic survey, the per student expenditure in Delhi has gone up to ₹78,082 in 2020-21 from ₹50,812 in 2016-17. Explaining the reason behind the increase in per student expenditure, a senior government official said, “The overall expenditure on education has been rising every year, and as a result the money spent on each student has also gone up.”According to the outcome budget, education was among the sectors where the government was able to achieve maximum targets. Delhi government’s 84% projects on education were on-track, according to the outcome budget.The outcome budget was launched by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in 2017, which basically measures the government expenditure in terms of targets achieved as well as what percentage of intended beneficiaries were reached out.Education has remained the focus of the AAP ever since they were elected to power in Delhi. The government allocated 23.2% of its total budget for education in 2020-21.“Despite Covid-19, the schools distributed textbooks to students of classes 1 to 8. Food security allowances to all eligible students were paid for the month of March 2020 to June 2020 in lieu of cooked food. For the period July to December 2020, kits of dry ration are being provided to the students in lieu of mid-day meals,” Sisodia said.Educationist Meeta Sengupta said education needs additional funding to make up for the lags in outcomes in the past decades, especially for students in government schools. “Both the quantum and quality of the investment matter. This is why transparency in outcomes should be encouraged and shared across states. Besides, increased investment in education should also be seen as an invitation to other states to join the reform story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-stays-invested-in-students-on-track-to-achieving-targets-101615242201277.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Ashram underpass gets revised June deadline||The Public Works Department (PWD) is expected to complete work on the 750-metre underpass connecting Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and CSIR Apartments at the Ashram intersection, one of the busiest stretches in the city, by June this year, missing another deadline of April, according to the economic survey report tabled by the Delhi government in Delhi assembly on Monday.In the outcome budget, which was also presented on Monday, the government said that 40% of the work on the underpass was completed until December last year.Senior PWD officials confirmed the extension of the deadline and said the new date factored in the time required for the final inauguration of the underpass. “The work might be completed 10-15 days earlier, but we have taken into account the date of inauguration after the construction work is completed,” a senior PWD official confirmed on Monday.The economic survey report also said that the extension of the Ashram flyover, for which the PWD has started placing barricades around the Ring Road, is also expected to be completed by March 2022.Ashram intersection, where around 350,000 lakh vehicles cross during peak traffic hours, is among the busiest and the most congested stretches in the capital. The stretch witnesses massive traffic snarls even during non-rush hours because of portions of Mathura Road being dug up by the construction agency.“The estimated cost of this project (underpass) is ₹77.92 crore along with shifting of services. The construction work is in progress and 40% work has been completed till December 2020. An expenditure of R 23.74 crores has been incurred till December. The work is likely to be completed by June 2021,” the economic survey report read.Professor Sewa Ram of the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said while work on many major construction projects was affected because of the Covid-19 lockdown and subsequently the non-availability of labour, the agencies could have made a dedicated plan to speed up work on the Ashram underpass, considering it gets such high volume of traffic.“The initial deadline was December 2020, after which the deadline was shifted again to April this year. Now that the agency has shifted the deadline again to June, they must ensure that resources deployed on site are increased and the road is opened for commuters earlier. Such delays not only result in increased costs but also result in hassle for commuters, which we can see on the stretch,” he said.The survey also said that nearly 56% of work on the construction of two single-carriageway underpasses, between Wazirabad and Jagatpur, and a pedestrian subway near Gandhi Vihar on the Outer Ring Road, was completed during the time the preparation of the document. Work for five foot-over bridges was also completed fully and more than 90% work has been completed for four more FOBs till December last year, the Outcome Budget read.In its last outcome budget, the Delhi government’s status report showed that of all the projects that were factored for assessing the performance of PWD, 40% were off track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ashram-underpass-gets-revised-june-deadline-101615241454139.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi among states that tested the most for Covid||Delhi was among the states that conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests in the country, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday while presenting the outcome budget in the Delhi assembly.There were 87.8 lakh Covid-19 tests conducted in the city till December 31, 2020, of which nearly 36% were done using the more accurate RT-PCR method. This ratio has further improved over the past two months, with two of every three tests being conducted using the RT-PCR method.“Just as a comparison, when Delhi was testing at the rate of 4,400 tests per million population daily, Kerala which was the second highest in tests in India (at that time), was testing at the rate of 2,300 tests per million daily. The all India average was 1,300 test per million,” Sisodia said while tabling the outcome budget.He also said the city was able to manage three waves of the dreaded infection – 8,593 cases were reported in a single day during the third wave in November – due to timely augmentation of hospital infrastructure as well as by starting home isolation.At its peak, the city had 18,718 hospital beds, 882 beds in a step-down Covid Health Centres, and 8,273 beds in Covid Care Centres, where patients who had a mild infection and had no facilities for home isolation were admitted.There were 1,463 ventilators, and 6,070 non-invasive ventilation options such as BiPaP and high flow nasal oxygen were also made available across hospitals. The Delhi government also set up a real-time app to ensure that people did not have to go from hospital to hospital in search of beds.“Responding to the surge in cases during this period, Delhi government innovated and created the world’s first home isolation programme. Home isolation meant that patients could recover in the comfort and emotional security of their homes,” he said. The government had distributed over 60,000 pulse oximeters to those in home isolation to regularly check their oxygen saturation and 3,000 oxygen concentrators were also given to those who had trouble maintaining their oxygen levels.Apart from the Covid related work, the Delhi government also opened two newly constructed hospitals in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar amid the pandemic.This was much needed, as the economic survey, also presented on Monday, showed that Delhi’s beds-to-population ratio had dipped in 2019 to 2.74 beds per 1,000 persons, as compared to 2.96 beds per 1,000 persons the year before.The World Health Organization recommends a ratio of five beds per 1,000 population. In terms of absolute numbers, the hospital beds went down to 54,321 in 2019 from 57,709 the year before.Most of this reduction happened in the private sector where the number of hospitals and nursing homes reduced to 1,151 in 2019 as compared to 1,175 the previous year.“Almost 45% to 50% of the CGHS and ECHS beneficiaries live in Delhi and avail of health-care services in city hospitals. Now, the rates for these are very low and the disbursement takes time. This has led to financial crisis in many small centres. Then, there is Ayushman Bharat which also pays less than these empanelment for almost 80% of the procedures. Plus, there is no new investment coming in. All this has led to smaller hospitals closing down,” said Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India).Dr Girish Tyagi, who recently stepped down as president of the Delhi Medical Association, said, “Covid-19 worsened the situation because for many months, there were very few patients at smaller hospitals.”The number of beds, however, went up in Delhi government hospitals from 11,770 in 2018 to 12,464 in 2019. The two hospitals in Ambedkar Nagar and Burari will add over 1,300 beds to the government’s total and the hospital in Dwarka-- which is almost complete -- will add another 1,700 beds. In addition to that, another 9,000 beds will be added to Delhi government’s tally with the remodelling of 15 of its existing hospitals, according to the economic survey.A total of 496 mohalla clinic have been set up across the city so far, according to the outcome budget presented by Sisodia on Monday. The government has almost reached the halfway mark of its target of setting up 1,000 such clinics across the city – one per every inhabited square kilometre in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-among-states-that-tested-the-most-for-covid-101615240727276.html

Two women officers who had helped these women during childbirth were also felicitated.Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava said the force wants to mark the day in two ways – one, by letting the women force take command roles and manage priority policing and, two, by felicitating women police officers who have done exceptional work in their fields.“On women’s day, major traffic junctions, PCR vehicles and police station functioning were commanded by women. Our idea is to profoundly state that with self-belief, women can and are doing marvellous work, shoulder to shoulder with men, breaking gender stereotypes,” the commissioner said.Awareness events such as a street play on ‘Good Touch-Bad Touch’ was also held.Reiterating Delhi Police’s approach towards crime against women, Shrivastava said last year, the crime against women reduced by 30% in Delhi. “Delhi Police is committed to ensuring the safety of women,” he said.He listed out the women safety measures taken up by Delhi Police such as the Sashakti self-defence programme, the launching of apps such as Himmat Plus, and implementation of Safe City project with 10,000 cameras, and assured the people that Delhi Police is continuously striving to secure and serve women better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-delhi-women-personnel-take-over-101615239349243.html

The body was sent to the mortuary of a nearby government hospital where it has been preserved for the purpose of identifying the parents of the infant.“A case of concealment of birth by secret disposal of the dead body under Indian Penal Code’s Section 318 has been registered at Parliament Street police station. Investigations in the case is being conducted to identify the newborn and circumstances that might have led to its death,” said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal.According to the DCP, a call was received at 1.40pm on Monday at the Parliament Street police station regarding the body of a child found that had been discovered behind the National Media Centre. A police team immediately rushed to the spot and found that the body had been buried in a mound of sand that had been unloaded there for construction work at the media centre.“The body was that of a newborn boy who still had a clip attached to his umbilical cord. The body was highly decomposed and seemed very old and was infested with maggots,” he said, adding that the incident spot was inspected by the district crime team.The police said that the contractor of the construction site will be asked to identify the truck that unloaded the sand and the place from where the sand had been loaded. Investigators suspect that the body of the newborn might have been buried somewhere near the Yamuna Khadar and had been dug up and transported in the process of bringing sand to the National Media Centre.“We will first identify the hospital where the child was born or had been admitted after birth. It may help us identify his parents, whose questioning may lead us to the exact circumstance under which the baby died and was buried. Our investigations in the case is on,” said a police officer associated with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/body-of-newborn-found-buried-in-sand-at-raisina-road-probe-launched-101615238824544.html

Husband and wife fought on trivial issues. Such small fights shouldn’t reach the police stations so we will start 'Nari Adalat' where women will ensure settlements out of police stations. If required, we will provide police support to these women too.”Chouhan also announced that he will write to the Supreme Court to speed up the process of ensuring capital punishment to minor rape accused.In Madhya Pradesh, as of now, a special court of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) announced capital punishment to 72 people since April 2018 but due to the slow judicial process, the matter is pending before the court, said Chouhan.The chief minister also announced to develop an 'honour fund' or ‘Samman Kosh’ worth ₹100 crore to help women make self-reliant.“We will help self-helped groups by providing work to them. They are already stitching school uniforms. Now, we will allow them to procure wheat on behalf of the state government. The SHGs will also do a different type of surveys in the village to help the government,” said the CM.“We are also making a necessary addition in the Ladli Laxmi Yojna. Now, the 37 lakhs beneficiaries of the scheme will be provided higher education free of cost by the state government,” he added.For maternal healthcare, we will develop 1,600 primary health centres and community health centres into maternity homes. Similarly, women desk will be set up across all district hospitals to deal with women health issues, said the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/nari-adalat-to-open-across-panchayats-to-resolve-family-disputes-mp-cm-101615238491370.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||JEE main result: two top scorers from capital||Two students from Delhi made it to the 100 percentile in the Paper 1 of the Joint Entrance Examination (Main), the results of which was declared by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on Monday.The two who managed perfect scores were Pravar Kataria, 17, a resident of Vikaspuri and Ranjim Prabal Das, 18, a resident of Janakpuri.Kataria said, “It was difficult to focus when the lockdown started because we had just stepped into the new academic session. There wasn’t much motivation to study but gradually, with the support of our teachers, things fell into place.”Das, on the other hand, said his interest in Mathematics led him to opt for engineering. “Since my childhood, I was interested in studying the functioning of different mechanical things like radio or remote-controlled cars. Engineering was a natural choice,” said Das, a resident of Vikaspuri, whose father is a doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jee-main-result-two-top-scorers-from-capital-101615238215147.html
09-03-2021||Patna||Bihar records highest single-day Covid-19 vaccination||Bihar created a record of sorts when it inoculated 1,73,137 people — the highest in a single day in the state — on Monday. The day was celebrated as International Women’s Day.“Women accounted for 1,00,209 of the 1,47,461 beneficiaries vaccinated in the state for the first dose on Monday,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar vaccinations.The state had mobilised “Jeevika didis” and targeted to inoculate over 1 lakh women on Monday.Bihar had decided to rope in local representatives of panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) as mobilisers and open vaccination centres up to the level of health sub-centres to encourage senior citizens and those with co-morbidities in the 45-59 years’ age bracket to get their jab against Covid-19.“We expect the cohort model to work better in Bihar. We will involve local PRI representatives, along with anganwadi sevikas, accredited social health activist (ASHA) and healthcare workers (HCWs), to boost the elderly people to get them to our health sub-centres for inoculation,” said Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary, health, after felicitating 21 women healthcare workers at the department on Monday.Health minister Mangal Pandey sang paeans to the role of women HCWs in controlling the spread of the contagion.Bihar has over 10,000 health sub-centres against a target of over 16,600.Amrit accepted that people preferred walk-in on-spot vaccination over pre-registration for vaccination on the portal.The state had so far inoculated around 1.70 per cent of the 1.25 crore target group in the first week of the third phase of the vaccination, which began on March 1, after the inoculation of the HCWs and frontline workers (FLWs).Nearly 1.55 per cent or 1.69 lakh of the 1.09 crore senior citizens (60 years and above) and 29,867 (1.86 per cent) of the 16 lakh people with any of the 20 specified co-morbidities in the 45-59 years of age group, had taken the first jab till Monday.“People, especially those in villages, are reluctant to take the vaccine, as they feel the virus is confined to the urban populace and is non-existent in rural areas. They ask our vaccination mobilisers why they need to take the vaccine shot when the virulence of the disease has ebbed to being almost non-existent in rural areas,” said Amrit.Vaccine hesitancy, he said, was more among senior citizens.“The elderly are apprehensive of adverse reaction post-immunisation though only 91 minor adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) have been reported so far out of the 8.33 lakh people vaccinated in the state so far. The elders feel they are better off without the vaccine shot, and should not take unnecessary risk,” added Amrit.The virus, which had last year spread to all 38 districts of the state, is now confined to 13 districts, with state capital Patna reporting almost 50 per cent of the state’s new Covid-19 cases.Patna accounted for 13 of the 30 new cases on March 6. Begusarai reported 3, East Champaran, Madhepura and Madhubani two each while Aurangabad, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Khagaria, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Siwan and Vaishali reported one case each.With a case recovery rate of 99.29 per cent — among the highest in India — and a mortality rate of 0.58 per cent, which was among the lowest in the country, the fear of Covid-19 among villagers is over. It was this fact, which was now weighing heavy against the vaccination in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-records-highest-single-day-covid-19-vaccination-101615237771083.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Jungle Book—in Gurugram||Baby elephant is standing on the roadside with elephant parent, their trunks raised—as if hailing the green auto parked on the pavement. Not far from them, a blue magpie is spreading her wings, about to take off. A stork is hiding behind tree leaves, perhaps fed up of dust and traffic. And a leopard is tiptoeing down a slanting tree branch.There’s a leery-looking crocodile too.No, you aren’t reading Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book. This is the real world, right in the heart of Gurugram, overlooking the national highway.It is a series of paintings on the outer side of the boundary wall of the Rose Garden, in sector 15. The mural is long, really long, decked with painting after painting. You walk along as if in an art gallery that refuses to end. Each panorama is thoughtful and arresting. Unlike modernist abstraction, where the artist interprets the scene into their own peculiar vision, here’s the old-fashioned way of depicting life, the way it exists on the surface, though with a generous addition of creative licensing. One can spend an entire day strolling along the wall, stopping in front of each work, and gazing upon it for long moments.This wall art has been here for a few years. An attendant in the area’s public toilet says it was created under the supervision of the city administration. His restroom is attached to the painted wall like a limpet. This afternoon, he is sitting on a chair in front of the aforementioned leopard. His white shirt is hanging from a hook pinned just above the leopard’s tail.Further ahead, the theme on the wall changes from wildlife to its sister concern, climate change. One haunting panel shows a bottle floating aimlessly in the sea—the bottle has a tree inside, with its root intact. Another panel shows a pair of hands delicately holding a glass bowl that contains a tree, as if it were the last tree alive. This leafy tree is painted at the top of the wall, but the tree doesn’t seem to end there. Instead, you see it growing into a real leafy tree, which is actually standing just behind the wall.Wall art isn’t a novel concept—check out central Delhi’s Lodhi Colony. But on this stretch everything else is so bleak, so polluted, that this beautifully executed vision in colours gets overwhelming.The most moving panel depicts the famous Chipko Movement. A group of women are possessively gathered around a tree, holding hands, their backs to the trunk.Now a man in mask comes and stares over this painting, looking bewitched. Just the stuff art gallery experience is made of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-jungle-book-in-gurugram-101615237774662.html

Twenty-five-year-old Vasundhara Chauhan averted goons' attempt to free their accomplice, a hardcore criminal, from the police custody in Dholpur on March 3.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot decided to directly offer an appointment to the young lady as a step towards promoting women empowerment and as a mark of honour to the girl for showing courage, virility and presence of mind which defeated the perpetrators of crime. The goons were planning on fleeing with a hardcore criminal who was already convicted for life.On March 5, five-armed people intercepted a roadways bus midway from Dholpur to Bharatpur and attacked the police challani guards carrying the convicted criminal named Dharmendra aka Lukka, an official release from CM’s office stated.They stormed into the bus, fired in the air and threw chilli-powder in the eyes of the police guards. As the criminals attempted to snatch away the firearms of the policemen, young passenger Vasundhara and another RAC constable Kamar Singh, who was also travelling in the bus, gathered courage and took on the criminals head-on. She caught hold of the two of them and pushed them in the bus one by one.Her direct fight encouraged others in the bus, including the passengers, crew members and the police guards, to take on the criminals, who then fled away.Previously, the state government gave a Letter of Appreciation to Vasundhara and declared an 'Out of Turn' promotion to RAC personnel Kamar Singh as head constable for their show of bravery.CM Gehlot has also decided to honour the Dholpur resident girl on the occasion of International Women's Day by offering her the post of sub-inspector in Rajasthan Police.

09-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Budget: Populism at play as Capt govt rolls out doles ahead of polls||Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Monday announced a string of sops in a please-all budget, giving a major push to the populist pitch of Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government ahead of the assembly elections due early next year. Even as the economy of the border state has been badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic with revenue deficit rising to ₹20,730 crore (revised estimates 2020-21), the budget promises significant increase in capital expenditure, and focus on social security net, agri sector, farmers welfare, women, weaker sections and education. Unveiling a ₹1.68 lakh crore budget with no new taxes and levies, the finance minister lavishly opened the purse strings of the debt-choked government in a bid to reach out to almost every section of the electorate. From farmers to employees and school going students to elderly population, the budget has something for all. Dedicating the state budget to farmers protesting against Centre’s three new agri laws, Manpreet announced the next phase of the ‘crop loan waiver scheme’. An allocation of ₹1,712 crore has been made for the purpose. Loans of ₹1,186 crore of 1.13 lakh farmers and ₹526 crore of landless farm workers will be waived, he said. Already, the state government has given a debt relief of ₹4,624 crore to 5.83 lakh small and marginal growers. To improve the income of farmers, Badal also announced a new scheme ‘Kamyaab Kisan Khushaal Punjab’. The other major budget proposal is implementation of sixth pay commission’s recommendations for the government employees from July. Expecting the submission of the report of the pay commission soon, Badal said the recommendations of the pay panel will be implemented from July 1 this year. “I also announce to pay the arrears, if any, in a staggered manner of which the first installment shall be paid in October 2021 and second installment in January 2022,” said Badal in his speech. The government promised to continue free power to over 14 lakh farmers that will cost ₹7,180 crore in coming financial year. With a speech that lasted 105 minutes and was laced with some couplets, Badal also announced a free travel facility for women in the state-owned undertaking buses. In line with its poll promise, financial assistance under ashirwad scheme (to SC girls, daughters of widows of any caste at the time of wedding and to SC widows/divorcees at the time of re-marriage) was increased from ₹21,000 to ₹51,000. Last year, there were near 60,000 beneficiaries of this policy. In what will directly touch nearly 30 lakh people, including 13 lakh from Scheduled Castes, the budget proposes to increase monthly pension of elderly, widows, orphan and people with disability to ₹1,500, up from ₹750. Badal said ₹4,000 crore (72% increase over last year) have been allocated to fund social security pension. Not just this, in what Badal said “tribute to our freedom fighters”, the monthly pension has been hiked from ₹7,500 to ₹9,400. The budget has also tried to boost holistic development the urban sector with ₹7,192 crore allocation (an increase of 68% over 2020-21). A sum of ₹3,822 crore has been set aside for strengthening the health infrastructure, said Badal adding the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has only underscored the importance of health infrastructure and related services. Manpreet also gave a push to the promotion of Punjabi language as he proposed to double the award money of Punjabi Sahit ratan and Shiromani award from ₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh and from ₹5 lakh to 10 lakh, respectively. Though the budgetary proposals will bring smiles on a sizeable section of the electorate, there are numerous financial challenges that can’t be overlooked. For example, the outstanding debt is set to rise to ₹2.82 lakh crore in next fiscal and the burden of committed financial liabilities has been mounting. As per the bulky 101-pages budget that Badal “dedicated to the farmers”, the government expenditure is ballooning and the revenue receipts are dwindling leading to revenue deficit. The FM has projected ₹8,622 crore revenue deficit in the coming fiscal. “Punjab’s economy is today stronger and more stable because this government had the courage to confront the problems and take difficult decisions,” said Badal, who presented fifth consecutive budget and held previous Akali Dal-BJP government responsible for having “ bankrupted” Punjab. “Our government took responsible decisions, shunned short -term fixes and pursued a long term economic plan,” he said amid applause from the treasury benches. While 10 SAD legislators had been suspended earlier, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were present, who were all ears. As per the budget document, the interest payments alone will consume 17% of the total expenditure, salaries and wages (24%), pension and other retirement benefits (10%), power subsidy (9%), while 12% will be spent on creation of assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-budget-populism-at-play-as-capt-govt-rolls-out-doles-ahead-of-polls-101615235599688.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Why keen on arresting Eknath Khadse, Bombay HC asks ED||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday sought to know from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as to why the apprehension of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse of being arrested was not unfounded. Khadse submitted that though he was not an accused as per the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) in the Bhosari land deal case, his refusal to answer may become grounds for his arrest.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing Khadse’s petition, was informed by senior advocate Aabad Ponda that ED’s argument about maintainability of the petition was not valid as the summons did not mention about any scheduled offences. Ponda submitted that there was an abuse of process by ED.Ponda then referred to Supreme Court judgements which prohibited investigating agencies from summoning anyone for answers and asking them for incriminating material. He added that unlike show-cause notices, there were no provisions against summons; hence he needed to be protected not only against the proceedings arising out of the summons issued by the ED but also future summons.Khade in the petition stated, “I may not be an accused in the current proceedings qua the ECIR, but the subject matter in the FIR and the ECIR is same and asking me questions which will implicate me in the FIR, will be against my rights under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.”After hearing the submissions, justice Shinde asked ED, which was represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh, why arrest was necessary when someone was cooperating. “What happens if you take a ground that he is to be arrested?” asked the bench. The bench added that the apprehension was that the arrest would be made without giving him an opportunity to respond to the proceedings against him.The ASG responded saying that there were separate, independent offences and added that investigation was at a preliminary stage.Justice Shinde then said that as per previous judgements, the accused was to be informed of the offences before arresting him. ASG Singh replied that the summons were issued as they were yet at the stage of collecting evidence.Due to paucity of time, the matter has been adjourned to Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-keen-on-arresting-eknath-khadse-bombay-hc-asks-ed-101615232598760.html

Pawar had allegedly told relatives that her husband was injured in a road accident. However, family members suspected foul play as Lokesh had stab wounds and his bike was safely parked. Pawar and Lokesh had met through work and got married in 2013 and have a child together. Lokesh was allegedly alcoholic and would often return home drunk, leading to daily fights. The incident took place during one such fight on Sunday when Neha in a fit of rage picked up a knife and stabbed Lokesh multiple times, said a police officer. After the incident, Neha called a few relatives and told them Lokesh met with an accident and was in a critical condition. A cousin reached their home soon and suspected foul play as Lokesh had stab wounds, there was no blood trail from outside, and the bike was parked safely. The cousin then called the police. Police officers have sent the body for post-mortem and are waiting for the report. The police are also trying to ascertain if Lokesh was drunk at the time. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the couple used to live separately for four years. They had recently started living together again and had frequent fights.“We arrested Neha under section 302 for murder and seized the kitchen knife which she had hidden inside the room. We produced her before the Vasai court on Monday which has remanded her in police custody till March 11,” the police officer said, adding that they are probing the case further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-arrested-for-stabbing-husband-to-death-near-mumbai-101615232538690.html
09-03-2021||Bangalore||'Big budget, bigger debts': Yediyurappa's show of Karnataka's finances||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday presented a revenue deficit budget with higher borrowings in what appears to be an attempt to mitigate the deepening distress, depleting resources and rising debt to try and manage expectations of the calamity-prone and pandemic-impacted state.Yediyurappa, who seized power in 2019 by engineering the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or the JD(S)-Congress government with borrowed support, is now also forced to run the remainder of his two-years on higher borrowings.At 2,46,207 crore, the state registered a 7 per cent growth as against ₹2,29,925 crore (revised estimates) presented by the Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in 2020.Also read: Congress terms Karnataka budget as 'hollow'However, Karnataka's Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) contracted by 2.6 per cent, according to government data.“I have presented a development-oriented budget today without increasing any of the increasing tax rates,” Yediyurappa told reporters at a post-budget press conference on Monday in Bengaluru. Yediyurappa has presented eight budgets so far and termed this one that was one of the most challenging given the circumstances.While the government continued to cite the lack of revenue inflows due to Covid-19, borrowings have more than made up for the shortcomings even though the burden of loans continue to pile up in Karnataka.The fiscal deficit is expected to be ₹59,240 crores in 2021-22 or 3.48 per cent of the GSDP as against ₹46,072 crores in the corresponding year or 2.55 per cent.The revenue deficit was estimated to be ₹15,134 crore in 2021-22 as against a surplus of ₹143 crores in the corresponding year.The total liabilities saw a sharp increase from ₹3,68,692 crore or 20.42 per cent at the end of 2020-21 to ₹4,57,899 crore or 26.9 per cent, registering a 24.19 per cent increase in liabilities. The liabilities stood at 26.9 per cent that is well above the cap to maintain fiscal discipline.“Suitable amendment will be brought to the Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act 2002 in this regard,” Yediyurappa said in his budget speech.The state is also expected to borrow ₹71,332 crore this year.Under immense pressure to show some semblance of performance for his two-year-old government that has made more news for internal dissent, bickering and the recent sex-scandal, Yediyurappa presented a budget that is high on allocations but may fall short on delivery since a significant chunk of the funds are expected to come from a cash-starved Union government.Expenditure for the previous budget stood at around 94 per cent.Yediyurappa clarified that there would be no slashing of funds for any of the programmes announced last year.The budget has been broadly classified into six categories: Agriculture and allied activities, welfare and inclusive growth, stimulating economic growth, comprehensive development of Bengaluru, conservation of culture, heritage and natural resources, administrative reforms and public service delivery.Karnataka’s principal opposition party, the Congress, staged a walkout with black armbands in protest of the presentation of the budget.“This budget lacks transparency,” Siddaramaiah, the Congress’s leader of the opposition said in Bengaluru. He said that Yediyurappa had clubbed 34 departments into six broad sectors and has not provided details of allocations.“This budget is anti-people, anti-development, presented to bankrupt the state and without any vision,” Siddaramaiah, who has presented record 13 budgets in Karnataka said.Yeddyurappa has allocated ₹52,529 crore for stimulating economic growth which lists out projects in water, construction of roads and airports, ₹3,000 crore to rectify the regional imbalance, setting up clusters like bulk drugs, research and textile as well as tweaking policies to attract investments among others.“The budget seems to be full of promises but that which is not backed by the capacity to fulfil those promises. The government does not seem willing to bite the bullet as there are no visible measures to bring in some regulation or austerity measures within the government to control expenditure,” said Sandeep Shastri, a Bengaluru-based political analyst and national coordinator for Lokniti, a political research organisation.Shastri added that the revenue deficit is likely to create an alarming effect which is likely to spill over to the next budget as well.At a time of distress, Yediyurappa has proposed to build a guest house in Ayodhya for ₹10 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/big-budget-bigger-debts-yediyurappa-s-show-of-karnataka-s-finances-101615229759701.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||JEE Mains results out: Student from Maharashtra gets 100 percentile||The National Testing Agency (NTA) late on Monday declared results of Join Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains. Siddhant Mukherjee from Maharashtra was among the top six students to have scored a 100 percentile. Mukherjee is also the state topper. The female topper from the state is Pranita Vasudeva Rao with 99.98 percentile. Arnav Jaideep Kalgutkar from the state was among one of the top scorers under persons with disability (PwD) category.The other five students with 100 percentile are Saket Jha from Rajasthan, Pravar Kataria and Ranjim Prabal Das from Delhi, Guramrit Singh from Chandigarh. A total of 620,000 candidates appeared for the first phase of JEE Mains held in six shifts between February 24 and 26.Late on Sunday, NTA also released the final answer key for JEE Mains, bringing cheer to students. The updated answer key was released barely days after JEE examinees challenged several responses in the previous answer key released last week. According to the final answer key, NTA has accepted some of the changes. This means that the students stand to gain anywhere between four and 12 marks in the final marks, depending on the examination date and session they attended.“Once the answer key was released last week, the errors were reported and we are glad NTA accepted the same,” said Raju Kapadia, an expert and a trainer at a coaching centre.Earlier this year, the Union government decided to conduct JEE Mains in four cycles between February and May. The decision was taken in order to ensure that students do not miss out on the entrance exam if the date clashes with other competitive exams. The first of the sessions was conducted in the last week of February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jee-mains-results-out-student-from-maharashtra-gets-100-percentile-101615232299806.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maha budget: Concession in stamp duty for women, special SRPF battalion||On International Women’s Day, the Maharashtra government unleashed a slew of measures for women’s welfare in its annual budget, including concessions in stamp duty for property registration, free travel for girls in rural areas, special buses for women in urban pockets and establishment of a first women battalion of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF).State finance minister Ajit Pawar unveiled the Rajmata Jijau Griha-Swamini Yojna, that ensures concessions of 1% in stamp duty if the registration of the house will be done in the name of a woman. Currently, the homebuyer has to pay up to 4% of agreement value of the property as stamp duty. Manju Yagnik, vice-chairperson, Nahar group, said the move will play a vital role in empowerment of women. “It is actually the females who play a vital role in choosing the property. She knows what is needed for her family. When it comes to registration, it is mainly the man who gets preference. However ,now we are seeing many cases of joint ownership. This step will help many women be the sole owners of property,” said Yagnik.Meanwhile, the Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule scheme will allow free travel for girl students in rural areas, from their villages to the schools, via Maharashtra State Transport buses. The state will also make provisions to provide 1,500 environment-friendly CNG and hybrid buses to the State Transport Corporation on a priority basis.Another important scheme is additional buses for the “Tejasvini Yojna” scheme for easy and safe travel of women in metro cities. Pawar said that he has proposed to reserve 3% funds from the District Plan for women and children.He also announced the formation of the first women battalion of the SRPF.Dr Nandita Shah, co-director of Akshara centre, a non-profit organisation (NGO), working for the rights of women, welcomed the initiatives. “For years, women were never given so much importance and if the state is taking steps for their welfare, then it is a welcome move. The issue of mobility is very important from a safety point of view and also families are not ready to shell money for women,” said Shah. She further said that instead of just raising a separate women battalion in SRPF, women should be included in every walk of life. She, however, said that at least 4.50 % of the funds should be allocated to women and children, instead of the proposed 3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-budget-concession-in-stamp-duty-for-women-special-srpf-battalion-101615232298782.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maha budget: Liquor prices all set to increase as govt hikes VAT||The state government in its annual budget on Monday proposed to hike value added tax (VAT) on all alcoholic beverages by five percentage points.Finance minister Ajit Pawar, in his speech, said, “VAT on the sale of liquor as prescribed in Schedule-B of Value Added Tax Act has increased from the existing 60% to 65%. Similarly, VAT on the sale of liquor as prescribed in Section 41(5) of the Value Added Tax Act has increased from the existing 35% to 40%.” This effectively means that manufacturers will have to pay 65% as VAT, up from the existing 60% if they take into account their manufacturing cost, or else they will need to pay 40%, which is based on MRP.Hotel and restaurant owners have condemned the hike, saying it will only make things worse as their businesses are already reeling from the pandemic and any such hike would only drive away consumers. “We hardly have 40% of our pre-Covid-19 businesses now and the surge in cases from last month has reduced our earnings substantially. This hike will aggravate things further,” rued Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR. He said in such cases, people tend to move to lower-quality brands.The state also proposed to increase the state excise duty on liquor. Country liquor will be classified into two categories — branded and non-branded — and state excise duty will be levied at 220% of manufacturing cost or ₹187 per litre, whichever is higher, only on branded country liquor. Wine shop owners said the hike was expected. “Since the Government is fighting Covid-19 virus and have very few avenues of revenue, we expected it would hike taxes on liquor,” said Arvind Miskin, president, Association of Progressive Retail Liquor Vendors, a body of wine-shop owners.Savio D’sa, who is a hospitality consultant, said, “Maharashtra levies the highest taxes on liquor and this is impacting business negatively. People are now preferring to drink at home rather than in restaurants. This is also discouraging young entrepreneurs from setting up hotels,” said D’sa. Government needs to understand that lowering of taxes will spur businesses and garner more money for its exchequer,” said D’sa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-budget-liquor-prices-all-set-to-increase-as-govt-hikes-vat-101615232238089.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maha budget: Unprecedented revenue shortfall, decline in growth rate||A huge deficit in revenue, projection of decline in growth and debt of over ₹6 lakh crore – the state is staring at a bleak financial future, if the economy is not revived in a short period. Maharashtra’s economy, which is projected to register -8% growth in the current financial year, is staring at a drop of upto ₹1 lakh crore in its revenue. This has badly affected the spending on development projects and people-centric funds, forcing the government to reduce the expenditure.To make it worse, the debt on the state has mounted to ₹6,15,170 crore in 2021-22, from ₹5,38,304 crore in 2020-21. Finance minister Ajit Pawar, while presenting ₹4,37,961-crore budget for 2021-22, has projected a revenue generation of ₹3,68.987 crore. With the expenditure is expected to be ₹3,79,213 crore, the budget presented on Monday is expected to have deficit of ₹10,226 crore.The pandemic has not only resulted in drop in the revenue, but also high borrowing. With ₹87,190 crore and ₹76,866 crore to be borrowed in 2020-21 and 2021-22, the debt in two years of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government is ₹1.64 lakh crore, 27% of the total debt on the state. This has resulted in an increase in the borrowing percentage against the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). The percentage of the debt against the GSDP will stand at 20.22% in 2020-21 and may be 20.64% in 2021-22. The crisis-like situation in state finances can be imagined from the fact that the debt amount had never crossed 20% of GSDP at least in the past 10 years. The state can raise upto 25% of the GSDP as per the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act norms. It was 16.01% in 2019-20.Anticipating the slow pace of revival of the economy in next financial year, the state has projected a rise of only 6.2% in revenue generation over previous year’s target. The state generally sets the target of rise in revenue collection by 10-12% over previous year.The reduction in the revenue receipts has resulted in contraction in spending on development projects. According to the state’s website, the spending of most of the departments hovers around 50%, which is not expected to cross much in the remaining two months of the financial year. The government has already cut on the allocation done in last year’s budget. The expenditure allocation has been reduced to ₹3.36 lakh crore from the proposed ₹3.57 lakh crore.Pawar said the revenue receipts, which have been reduced by ₹57,959 crore, are expected to increase further if the central government does not release the state’s share in tax collection on time.According to state officials, Maharashtra’s outstanding with the Central government is around ₹50,000 crore. “Besides, the dues of ₹30,000 crore towards the outstanding of GST and central taxes devolution of ₹6000 crore is pending with the Centre. A total of ₹13,630 crore are yet to be released toward the centrally sponsored scheme. Of the ₹50,000 crore to be released by the Centre, not more than ₹10,000 crore are expected to be released this financial year. This will result in revenue receipts for the current financial year dropping further to ₹2.50 lakh crore,” the official said.Subodh Kumar, former finance secretary, said, “The state government should have put in great effort for resource mobilization from non-tax sources. It could have helped them in reducing the fiscal deficit to a great extent.”Former finance minister and BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar questioned why the state had not been able to spend more on development despite having proposed to raise huge loans. “They are borrowing more than ₹1.5 lakh crore in two years. Why are they not been able to spend more for general public,” he asked.For the current fiscal year, the state has revised its target of revenue receipts from all major heads. The GST generation expected in 2020-21 is now reduced to ₹88,000 crore from ₹1,07,146 crore, sales tax to ₹34,000 crore from ₹40,000 crore, excise duty to ₹15,000 crore from ₹19,225 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-budget-unprecedented-revenue-shortfall-decline-in-growth-rate-101615232178666.html
09-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s per capita income goes down to ₹3.54 lakh||Delhi’s per capita income, which has been the second highest in India after Goa’s for several years now, dropped from Rs.3,76,211 in 2019-20 to Rs.3,54,004 in 2020-21, while the state gross domestic product (SGDP) shrunk by around 5.68%, according to the economic survey tabled by the Delhi government in the assembly on Monday, which cited impact from the Covid-19 outbreak.This is the first time since 2010-11 that the per capita income in the country’s capital has shrunk, a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic survey said. The 5.7% contraction in the SGDP signals the city-state’s economy did better than the national average, which is expected to shrink in the 7-8% range for the financial year. “The contraction in GSDP in Delhi is 5.68% during 2020-21 compared to a contraction of 8% at the national level in 2020-21,” the economic survey said.“All economies have been dented by Covid-19 and so has the economy of Delhi. GSDP of Delhi in real terms at constant prices is estimated to have contracted by 5.68%,” Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal said in his speech addressing the members of the assembly marking the opening of the budget session on Monday.On Monday, the government also tabled the Outcome Budget for 2020-21. Delhi’s finance minister Manish Sisodia said, “The financial year 2020-21 started in the shadow of Covid-19 pandemic and a strict lockdown that brought all socio-economic activities to a halt. While our government put up a brave fight against the pandemic, it caused great distortion in government’s routine activities. Revenue collection nose-dived and government’s resources and efforts were focused on minimising the impact of Covid-19.”At market prices, the GSDP of Delhi for FY2021 is Rs.7,98,310 crore, which the government said represented a contraction of 3.92% over the previous year. In 2019-20, government data showed Delhi’s GSDP at market price was Rs.8,30,872 crore. The GSDP is the total value of all finished goods and services produced in a given period of time within the geographical boundaries of a state.In terms of per capita income, the economic survey projected a drop from Rs.3,76,221 in 2019-20 to Rs.3,54,004 in 2020-21 – a decrease of 5.9%. The government noted in its report that Delhi’s per capita income pegged is “almost three times the national average of Rs.127,768”.In 2011-12, Delhi’s per capita income at market price was Rs.1,85,001.According to the Delhi government, the city-state has maintained a “consistent revenue surplus” – this was Rs.7,499 crore in 2019-20 and Rs.6,261 crore in 2018-19. The upcoming budget (2021-22) document will throw light on the estimated revenue surplus for 2020-21, said a senior government official, asking not to be named.Rajat Kathuria, director and chief executive, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, said, “Incomes have declined across the country. At this point, it is extremely essential for the Delhi government to continue investing in social infrastructure – healthcare, education and public transport among other fronts. The quality of social infrastructure has to be improved by using more inclusive forms of technology. A healthy social infrastructure acts not just as a safety net but also as a stimulant that can help improve state domestic product.”Debolina Kundu, professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs, said: “Gross state domestic product and per capita incomes have witnessed declines across the country in 2020-21 with people losing jobs and livelihoods because of the Covid-19 pandemic. With incomes going down, households are likely to refrain from spending on what they consider non-essentials. The government has to intervene in the upcoming fiscal year. Enterprises have to be boosted, especially start-ups, and the government should focus on generating jobs at various levels to improve the economic condition of the state.”Avani Kapur, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said the decline in GDP and real income does appear largely to be a result of the pandemic. “The tertiary sector is a major contributor to the GSVA (Gross State Value Added) contributing over 80% to it. This includes things like trade, hotels, restaurants, real estate, etc, all of which saw a hit this year due to Covid-19. But there are some promising trends too. For instance, while we have seen GST being hit everywhere and thus national income, Delhi estimates do suggest the recovery process has started. The main worrying aspect of revenue loss is non-tax revenue, which shows a big decline.”Going forward, she said, it is going to be interesting to see how Delhi prioritises its revenues. “So far, education has been a big priority for the government and given the implications of the pandemic on learning, it is going to be interesting to see if that continues. Those details should come in the state budget tomorrow along with hopefully a plan for fiscal consolidation and recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-per-capita-income-goes-down-to-3-54-lakh-101615231355878.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records 89% rise in active Covid-19 cases||Amid the spike in daily Covid-19 cases, the number of active patients who are undergoing treatment has increased by almost 89% compared to last month. Eight civic wards including Andheri (West), Chembur, Govandi are major contributors to active case load in the city.Mumbai had recorded 1,360 new Covid-19 cases on March 7 while 1,020 patients were discharged. As on March 6, the number of active cases in the city jumped to 10,398, from only 5,500 in the first week of February. The cumulative case count of the city stands at 333,564.Three weeks ago Mumbai’s daily Covid-19 count was below 500. However, cases started increasing from February 17 when the daily count crossed the 700-mark. Lack in maintaining Covid protocols by citizens, allowing the general public to travel in local trains and opening of various commercial activities were among the reasons behind the current surge in Covid-19 cases, civic officials said.“This was expected with the relaxation in lockdown. However, the situation is better than September 2020 when the city had witnessed a similar spike in cases. The positivity rate had surged to 20% back then, while at present it still stands at 6.8%,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “Despite the rise in cases, the overall positivity rate in the city stands at 9.76%, which was around 15% in December 2020,” he added.As per the data shared by BMC, the average growth rate of Mumbai stands at 0.30%. However, eight civic wards have a higher growth rate. K-West ward, which covers Andheri (West), tops the list with 0.42% growth rate, followed by H-West ward which covers Bandra (West) at 0.41%. This is followed by F-North (Matunga), T (Mulund), M-West (Chembur), M-East (Govandi), L (Kurla), H-East (Santacruz East) and N (Ghatkopar) wards with 0.41%, 0.40%, 0.36%, 0.35%, 0.32%, 0.32% and 0.31% positivity rate, respectively.BMC officials said highest number of cases are from high-rise buildings. To bring stringent rules, in the second week of February, BMC issued an order asking societies to restrict the number of outsiders allowed to enter the society.“Your society will restrict entry of outsiders to minimum including maids/milkman etc. Measures like thermal screening to be strictly implemented. Positive cases, if any in the society, to follow strict quarantine guidelines by family for 14 days. Others in the family will get tested compulsorily as high-risk contacts. Any other symptomatic person in society to get checked for Covid-19,” the order reads.BMC has ruled out any plans to impose lockdown in Mumbai and the city has been brought under strong surveillance with BMC stepping up containment measures. So far, 2,450 floors have been sealed in buildings where Covid-19 positive patients have been diagnosed. The highest number of floors has been sealed in K-West ward with 493 floors sealed.Kakani said, “In the past six days, we have conducted over 120,000 tests across Mumbai. On March 6, we conducted 23,369 tests, which is the highest number of tests conducted in a day since the outbreak of the virus.”However, experts believe the situation is still under control as despite the surge in cases, fatality rate is still under 1%.“On Sunday, the city recorded 1,300 new Covid-19 cases after almost four months. But, only five deaths have been registered, which is around 0.38% death rate. Though active cases have increased, most symptomatic patients are mildly and moderately infected,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-89-rise-in-active-covid-19-cases-101615232118844.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maha budget: Sops for farmers, agriculture sector||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Monday announced interest-free crop loan for farmers from this financial year. The farmers will be able to get crop loans up to ₹3 lakh and the interest amount against the loan will be paid by the state, state finance minister Ajit Pawar declared while tabling the state’s budget 2021-22 in the Assembly on Monday. He also announced several measures to help farmers and upgrade agricultural infrastructure. The budget also has sops for farmers in the form of 33% concession on power bills. The state will waive ₹30,411 crore of pending power dues under the scheme, Pawar said. “Paying interest on crop loans is a problem farmers often face. To free them from interest burden, the government has decided to provide zero percent interest crop loans to farmers who take crop loans upto a limit of ₹3 lakh,” Pawar said in his budget speech in the Assembly. Agriculture is the only sector in Maharashtra that has registered a growth in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic, according to the state’s Economic Survey. Pawar announced upgrade of basic facilities at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), where farmers bring their produce for sale. “Most of the premises of the APMCs lack the necessary basic facilities for the farmers. It is imperative to provide these facilities. ₹2,000 crore scheme will be implemented for strengthening APMCs,” the finance minister announced. “It has been decided to implement a policy for providing power connection to agriculture pumps of those farmers, who have not yet been provided with power connection. It will be done either through conventional or solar power connection to the applicant farmers. The state government will give a share of capital of ₹1,500 crore every year to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) to implement the scheme,” he said. The state failed to implement two schemes announced in the last budget owing to the economic crisis that had gripped the state following months-long lockdown. It has also reduced the allocation of funds for agriculture and allied activities this year. The farmers who have been paying their loans regularly in the past three financial years were supposed to get an incentive of upto ₹50,000. It had also declared a discount of ₹2 lakh for one-time settlement against a crop loan. The finance minister clarified that they have put the schemes on hold and they will be implemented when the state’s economy will be back on track. Ajit Nawale, general secretary, Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha (AIKS) said that they welcome the number of schemes declared and underlining the role of agriculture in economic growth by the finance minister but the government should consider implementing the schemes declared in the last budget and a demand for waiver in power bills raised by the farmers. During this budget speech, Pawar said that the government intends to implement the “Maharashtra Agro Business Network Project (Magnet) for small and marginal fruit and vegetable growers by spending ₹1000 crore. It will be implemented for six years with an aim to increase farmers’ income. While presenting the budget, the finance minister also supported the ongoing agitation by the farmers against the contentious farm laws. In order to increase the productivity of agribusiness, it is necessary to focus on agricultural research. Though the previous government had announced, but now the MVA government will provide four agricultural universities ₹600 crore in three years ( ₹200 crore every year) for research, which will be useful for agricultural upliftment, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-budget-sops-for-farmers-agriculture-sector-101615232058104.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maha budget: Rs7,500 crore to upgrade health facilities over four years||In view of the crumbling of health infrastructure seen during the Covid pandemic, the state on Monday announced a slew of schemes in its budget to improve facilities across Maharashtra. The state plans to spend ₹7,500 crore for constructing and upgrading health infrastructure over the next four years. It will also spend ₹5,000 crore to improve quality of health services in tier-2 cities in the next five years. Of the total, ₹800 crore will be spent this year. State finance minister Ajit Pawar also announced the opening of new medical colleges in Sindhudurg, Osmanabad, Nashik, Raigad and Satara. In addition, medical colleges will be set up at Parbhani and Amravati. The colleges will be set up through public-private partnership (PPP) policy. This will lead to an increase of 1,990 seats for degree courses, 1,000 seats for post-graduate courses and 200 in super-specialties. “The Covid pandemic has underlined the need for health care reforms in all aspects of the health sector. A project costing about ₹7,500 crore has been prepared to provide quality health care and treatment to people by constructing and upgrading health institutions under the public health department and it will be completed in the next four years. The proposal includes construction of district hospital, psychiatric hospital, trauma care centre, primary health centre and sub-centre, upgrade and construction of taluka level hospital,” Pawar said in his budget speech. He said the government has realised the state must have modern hospitals for treatment of infectious diseases. Consequently, it has decided to set up a modern referral service hospital for infectious disease on the premises of Aundh district hospital. It has planned to set up sub-centres of these hospitals at divisional and district levels in different phases. Also, cardiac cath labs will be set up at eight central locations across the state, as patients with heart disease need angiography within 24 hours. “Considering the spread of infectious diseases, the government intends to make radical changes in the curriculum related to paramedical patient care and give priority and encouragement to branches related to nursing. For this, 11 government nursing schools affiliated to government medical colleges will be converted into nursing colleges. Also, in phases, physiotherapy and occupational therapy colleges will be established in all 17 government medical colleges,” the finance minister said. The state has allocated a fund of ₹16,839 crore for the health department, which comes to 3.48% of the budget size. It is ₹1,091 crore more compared to last year when ₹15,748 crore was allocated. However, the state spent ₹2,348 crore more than the total budgetary allocation owing to the pandemic.This also means the allocation for 2021-22 is ₹1,257 crore less that what is spent in the outgoing financial year. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health expert, said there is a big difference between public health infrastructure in rural and urban areas.“In rural areas, we have better infrastructure, but don’t have qualified doctors and health workers, whereas urban areas have more manpower but are lagging in public health infrastructure,” Pattiwar said. In addition, the state has also declared to start cancer diagnosis facility in 150 hospitals across the state, post Covid Counselling and Treatment Centres in each and every district hospital and government medical college in urban areas, following complaints of lung, liver and kidney ailments as well as mental stress among patients who recovered from the disease. The state had to develop temporary facilities including jumbo hospitals to accommodate patients following a spike in Covid-19 cases, which has gone up to 24,619 in a day on September 17. It also had to request the Kerala government to provide 50 specialist doctors and 100 nurses on temporary basis to handle the need of additional manpower required to run the temporary facilities in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-budget-rs7-500-crore-to-upgrade-health-facilities-over-four-years-101615231999903.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 task force pushes for home vaccination, 24/7 centres||The Maharashtra Covid-19 task force in a review meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday requested the state government to seek permission to initiate home vaccination for the vulnerable population. It also suggested 24x7 vaccination centres to cover maximum population in a relatively short period.The CM held the review meeting with task force members, district collectors and divisional commissioners of the state in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state.The state task force has asked the government to take permission from the Centre since the current norms by the Centre do not allow it. The task force has said that home vaccination will help in controlling the spread of Covid-19 and also bringing down fatality rate of the state.Dr Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital, Mulund who is also a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “We suggested that the vulnerable population be vaccinated as quickly as possible to control the spread. This requires us to take the vaccination drive to the doorstep of citizens. This can be done to cover those who cannot come out or those who are very old.”Dr Pandit added, “This decision of home vaccination will also help us bring down fatality. For this, the state will require the Central government’s permission, and hence we have requested them to take such permission.”The task force has also requested the state government to focus on 24x7 vaccination, which was allowed by the Central government last week. However, state officials said they are having several issues with CoWIN app, due to which they are unable to have 24x7 vaccination centres at the moment.Dr Shashank Joshi, another member of the task force, said, “Apart from home vaccination, 24x7 vaccination is something that has to be looked into aggressively to cover our vulnerable population. Also, in view of the increasing cases, we need to come back to our old drawing board that includes aggressive testing and contact tracing. Mere sealing of floors or buildings is not enough; tracing close contacts up to the ratio of 1:30 has to be activated.”The Central team that visited affected areas of the state has instructed state government to take quick measures to contain the spread of the disease. “Accordingly the chief minister has directed district administrations to earmark micro containment zones. The areas which are most affected and have high positivity rate are to increase tracing to 30 people per infection. They have also been directed to operate the vaccination centres 24/7 in such areas,” an official from health department said.State has around 70 such pockets with high positivity rate than their neighbouring areas. Meanwhile, on Monday, 90,249 general citizens were inoculated across the state. Mumbai saw a record 32,714 vaccinations for citizens that included 29,502 senior citizens and 3,212 beneficiaries aged above 45 years who have comorbidities. Further, in Mumbai on occasion of International Women’s Day on Monday, five sessions were conducted at five vaccination centres in the city exclusively for women, during which 8,092 women were vaccinated.Special centres for women on Women’s DaySeven vaccination centres were set up especially for women in Thane district on Monday to celebrate Women’s Day. Five such centres will fall under Thane Municipal Corporation jurisdiction, one in Kalyan-Dombivli and one at Thane Civil Hospital. A total of 180 women got the shot at the centre in Kalyan.An officer from TMC added, “As it was Women’s Day, we did not want women to wait and hence made provision for a separate centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-19-task-force-pushes-for-home-vaccination-24-7-centres-101615231998777.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maha budget: Boost to road, rail, Metro and air infra||In its second budget, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) made a slew of announcements to boost infrastructure in the state. The most significant announcement was the state’s plan to build a Pune-Nashik semi high-speed rail corridor that will connect the cities of Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik. “The speed of this train will be 200 km/hour. The expected cost of the project is ₹16,039 crore,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, while stating the project has been approved by the cabinet on Monday. Pawar made an allocation of ₹7,000 crore for the Nanded-Jalna Expressway connector which will connect Nanded city with the 701-km Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg (Expressway). Pawar said that 44% of the works along the expressway have been completed and a 500-km stretch between Nagpur and Shirdi will be opened for traffic from May 1. He said the new connector will provide the Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani, and Jalna districts of Marathwada. Apart from this, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) will also take up the works of a coastal highway between Rewas in Raigad and Reddy in Sindhudurg as an alternative to the Mumbai-Goa highway. The road connecting three districts of Konkan is expected to boost growth in this region with focus on tourism and horticulture. The government has proposed an outlay of Rs.12,950 crore for road development in the state. Pawar also said that land acquisition for the ₹26,000 crore Pune ring road will be undertaken this year. “A large number of passengers and goods are transported from other parts of the state as well as from Konkan, Marathwada, and North Maharashtra via Pune. This puts a huge strain on the traffic in Pune city. To avoid this, it is felt necessary to undertake the construction of a ring road around Pune in order to save fuel and time.” The MVA is also looking at starting work on a new international airport in Pune. Pawar said the technical and financial feasibility of the project is being checked. The government is also looking at setting up a greenfield airport in Solapur and services from the Chipi airport in Sindhudurg will also start soon, Pawar said. In its plans to boost cruise tourism in the state, the government is also planning to build a cruise terminal at Bhagwati port in Ratnagiri. In terms of Metro projects, the state announced a broad gauge Metro connecting Nagpur city to Wardha, Ramtek, Bhandara, and Narkhed, ₹2,100 crore Metro Neo lite in Nashik, and the recently-approved ₹7,165 crore Metro lite system in Thane. Experts said any sort of investment in infrastructure, at a time when cities are growing rapidly, would be a force multiplier. Pankaj Joshi, principal director, Urban Centre, Mumbai, said, “We are in a phase where any sort of impetus to urban infrastructure is a welcome step. Our cities are growing by the day and we need to invest in building that sort of infrastructure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-budget-boost-to-road-rail-metro-and-air-infra-101615231878608.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports 8,744 new Covid-19 cases, 22 deaths||After reporting over 10,000 fresh Covid-19 cases for two days straight, Maharashtra on Monday reported 8,744 infections, including 1,014 in Mumbai, along with 22 deaths, taking the tally to 2,228,471 and toll to 52,500. Also, a 65-year-old man died after taking the vaccine, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The death has been classified as adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI). In total, eight cases of AEFI were reported on Monday, the BMC said. The civic body vaccinated 32,714 general public on Monday.There are 97,637 active cases in the state, according to official data. The highest number of active cases in Maharashtra was 301,752 on September 17, 2020, after which the tally went down to around 50,000 in December 2020. However, it has gradually gone up since then. Around 2,077,112 citizens have recovered in the state, taking the recovery rate to 93.20%. As of Monday, Mumbai has seen 334,583 cases, including 10,779 active infections, and 11,508 deaths.

09-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra budget gives fillip to tourism||A cruise terminal at Ratnagiri in Konkan, developing a hill station at picturesque Jawhar in Palghar district, a policy to promote nature tourism and further development of popular hill stations Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani are among the initiatives announced by deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar to boost tourism in Maharashtra. The state government has allocated ₹2,369 crore as a part of its push for tourism in the state budget 2021-22. Pawar said several tourism policies, including beach shack, agro-tourism, etc, have been announced by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with an aim to generate employment and attract tourists. The budget also proposed a museum depicting the history of the state and a sugar museum in Pune.While tabling the budget for 2021-22, the finance minister announced a cruise terminal at Ratnagiri’s Bhagwati port and construction of jetty in Raigad district, among other things. “Works to develop jetty for tourism at Kashid in Raigad district’s Murud taluka and to build cruise terminal at Bhagwati Port in Ratnagiri district have been undertaken,” Pawar said. He also added, “The government has announced agri-tourism policy to give a boost to agri business as well as rural economy in the state. The state’s beach shack and caravan tourism policies have been announced to provide employment opportunities to coastal local citizens and to attract tourists. The Maharashtra state nature tourism policy will be announced soon.” There is also a plan to develop a hill station in the tribal-dominated Jawhar taluka of Palghar. “It has been decided to develop a hill station at Jawhar in the new tribal-dominated part of Palghar. We will also take up beach development works in the coastal belt of Palghar,” he said. In addition, the state has decided to develop Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani and Lonar lake, for which the development plan has been finalised and “necessary funds are being made available”.The budget also proposed a “path-breaking project” Sindhuratna Samruddha to harness the potential of nature by developing tourism, fisheries and micro industries in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. For this, ₹100 crore will be made available every year over the next three years. Bal Thackeray memorial, a proposed tourist attraction, has been given ₹400 crore.The proposed construction of an international standard tourist complex on the 14-acre site at Worli Dairy complex in Mumbai, which was announced in the last budget, was also mentioned in this year’s speech. Pawar said, “Work is in progress to transfer the site and prepare a detailed project report for the development of the tourist complex.”The cultural affairs department will undertake the construction of a museum to depict the history of Maharashtra. An outlay of ₹161 crore has been proposed for the department. The state has also proposed to construct a sugar museum in Pune at an estimated cost of ₹40 crore to showcase the development of sugar industry, sugar and allied industries. The state has also taken up the task of conservation and preservation of ancient temples in the state. In the first phase of the project, eight temples, including Adishakti Ekveera Mata mandir in Karla of Pune — the family deity of the Thackerays, will be renovated. Political analyst Hemant Desai said tourism outlays bore the stamp of Aaditya Thackeray, who heads the department. He said, “Tourism is hit the most due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the financial situation of the state, it is good that it has provided allocation to the department. It will help generate revenue and provide jobs when these projects materialise.”Subhash Goyal, member of the Assocham tourism council and general secretary of Federation of Associations in Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH), said, “Maharashtra is one of the few states that realised the multiplier effect that tourism development has in terms of job creation and revenue generation. Maharashtra has immense scope; and the tourism minister himself is very proactive in this regard. The state has 720-km coastline and can develop beaches with water sports, as adventure sport it restricted only to mountains currently. Scuba diving can also be developed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-budget-gives-fillip-to-tourism-101615231698794.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Health and infra get major share in MVA’s second budget||Struggling with paucity of funds owing to a significant shortfall in revenue caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Monday presented its second budget that aims to spur growth. Presenting a budget of ₹4,37,961 crore for financial year 2021-22 in the legislative Assembly, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar announced interest-free loans for farmers; a slew of infrastructure projects, including a semi-high speed corridor between Pune and Nashik; plans worth ₹12,500 crore for health infrastructure; and sops for women, such as free bus rides for girl students. These announcements were made even though cash crunch is expected to be a major problem for the state, with the economy yet to recover from the impact of the lockdown. Meanwhile, liquor will cost more in Maharashtra from April 1 as Pawar increased taxes on it as the only means to generate some more revenue. Revenue generation in 2020-21 in Maharashtra is expected to drop by a whopping ₹57,959 crore and could even go further up to ₹1 lakh crore if the state’s share of taxes is not released by the Centre in time, according to Pawar. Against the estimated revenue of ₹3,47,457 crore, the state now expects to generate ₹289,498 crore by the end of the ongoing financial year.“This means the shortfall in the revenue generation is  ₹57,959 and if the Centre fails to release our dues towards GST compensation, central taxes devolution and share of centrally sponsored schemes, it may mount up to ₹1 lakh crore,” Pawar said.The agriculture sector, which is expected to register a growth of 11.7% in the current financial year, got a boost in the budget. “The farmers can now avail interest-free loans up to ₹3 lakh. The existing crop loan scheme, which gives interest-free loans up to ₹1 lakh and at 2% for additional ₹2 lakh, has now been revised,” said Pawar. Of the 15 million farmers in the state, around 35% avail the crop loan every year.Pawar also announced 66% concession to farmers in their pending electricity bills under the amnesty scheme the government launched on January 26.In view of the pandemic, Pawar announced a package of ₹7,500 crore for the upgradation of health infrastructure over the next four years. Further, he announced ₹5,000 crore for improving quality of health services in tier-two cities in the next five years. These smaller cities struggled in handling the pandemic. The MVA government will be building a 235-km semi high speed train corridor connecting three major cities--Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik. The train will run at 200kmph speed and is estimated to cost ₹16,039 crore. It is also constructing a coastal highway connecting three Konkan districts--Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg — to promote industries and tourism in the region, which has been a strong support base of Shiv Sena. Also, Pawar announced free bus rides for girls travelling to schools and 1% concession in stamp duty if a new house is bought in the name of a woman. The homebuyers pay 4 percent stamp duty and charges on the agreement value while registering new property. Women buyers will have to pay 3 percent.“This would put a burden of ₹1,000 crore against the waiver,” he said.Eyeing the elections to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is ruled by the Shiv Sena for more than 25 years, finance minister referred to infra projects, tourism development projects in Mumbai. There was also announcement of a Bal Thackeray memorial worth ₹400 crore, two dedicated cycle tracks on eastern and western express highways and rejuvenation of Mithi, Dharavi, Boisar and Oshiwara rivers.State government has also proposed to build a new water transport route connecting Vasai and Kalyan —both cities are on the periphery of Mumbai — with four passenger terminals between them. The reduction in revenue, outstanding dues with the centre and expenditure incurred on fighting the Covid pandemic has forced the state government to borrow more than expected this year. The borrowing is also expected to grow because of the widening gap between the receipts the borrowing. With ₹87,190 crore and ₹76,866 crore to be borrowed in 2020-21 and 2021-22, the debt stock is ₹1.64 lakh crore, which is 27% of the total debt state raised over years. Total debt on state is estimated to be ₹6,15,170 crore in 2021-22. With little room left for the hike in taxes and duty for mobilization of the resources, the state government has proposed to high 5% value added tax on sale of liquor and rise in the state excise duty to manufacturing of the branded country liquor. Meanwhile, former finance minister and BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said, “The state has failed to give any package to the most affected sectors like construction, services sector. It gave 1% waiver in stamp duty to women if the houses are registered in their name, and gave 3% waiver to builders. Is it not discrimination? The state government should tell the people of Maharashtra, that how has it used or decided to use ₹1.75 lakh crore being borrowed in two years.”Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis criticised the budget and said it to be the jugglery of figures. “None of the sectors has got anything from the budget. Youth, farmers, women, backward classes will be disappointed from the budget. The infrastructure projects that have been referred in the budget are existing ones and under implementation via the central government funding. Many of the schemes which have been referred in the budget are ones state government does not spend a single penny on,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/health-and-infra-get-major-share-in-mva-s-second-budget-101615231522374.html
09-03-2021||Chandigarh||Passport racket: Zirakpur hub of fake addresses||Four months after a fake passport racket was busted in Zirakpur with the arrest of four people, including two policemen, it has come to light that as many as 143 passports were made using forged documents and eight people had even travelled abroad. Moreover, all these fake passports had addresses of various housing societies in Zirakpur.After getting the details, the passport office has impounded all fake passports and alerted the embassies concerned.“What was initially thought to be a minor scam is now turning out to be a major criminal operation. The special investigation team so far traced 143 passports made on forged documents. We will be arresting these people soon,” said Satinder Singh, senior superintendent of police, Mohali.Passports impounded, embassies alertedSibash Kabiraj, Regional Passport Officer, Chandigarh, confirmed that they have received the list of all fake passports from the Mohali police. “We have impounded all the passports and alerted the embassies concerned about people who have travelled abroad using fake passports. The moment anyone applies for any passport service, we will alert the police,” he said.It was in November last year when police arrested four people, including head constable Sukhwant Singh and constable Rajinder Singh, both posted at Zirakpur and assigned passport verification duties. The other two were Raman Kumar, the brains behind the racket, and Arvinder Kumar. Following this, the SSP formed an SIT comprising SP Harbir Singh Atwal, DSP Manjit Singh Aulakh and inspector Amardeep Singh to probe the racket. The four accused are presently lodged in jail.Gangsters among clients of racketeersAmong those who got the fake passports were gangster Raju Basodi of Haryana and at least 15 other criminals from Punjab.The Mohali police have already arrested Basodi, whose passport was registered under the name of one Gurveer Singh. Another fake passport was prepared for Ludhiana gangster Gopi Lamber. Ashish Kumar, who is into drug trade, also got a fake passport under the name of one Sandeep Singh of Kapurthala.Key players and modus operandiRaman Kumar, a resident of Dera Bassi, was the brains behind the racket.He was a property dealer operating in Zirakpur and Dera Bassi before he switched to passport services and opened an office in Ambala.He charged ₹50,000-1 lakh per fake passport from his clients, and used to prepare forged documents, including Aadhaar cards and voter cards.His accomplice Arvinder Kumar used to apply for passports on these forged documents in Chandigarh.Hailing from Chamba in Himachal Pradesh and residing in Ludhiana, he used to take a cut of ₹15,000-20,000 per passport.Head constable Sukhwant Singh and constable Rajinder Singh were posted at Zirakpur and assigned passport verification duties.Raman Kumar used to pay them ₹20,000 per passport to turn a blind eye to the racket and verify the fake passports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/passport-racket-zirakpur-hub-of-fake-addresses-101615231518574.html
09-03-2021||Other||Over 50K in Ludhiana have received at least one dose of vaccine so far||As many as 56,696 persons in Ludhiana have so far received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, data released by the health department has revealed.Of these, 21,636 are healthcare workers who have received the first dose of the vaccine while 13,884 have completed the inoculation process by receiving the second dose as well. Among frontline workers, 9,604 have turned up for vaccination so far and received at least one dose of the vaccine. But merely 3.2% (311) of them have got the second dose as well. In majority of the cases, it was observed that healthcare workers did not turn up for the second dose even after 40 days of receiving the first dose. The prevalence of skipping the second dose has been largely observed among Anganwari workers and Class-4 employees in the civic body.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia, who is the nodal officer of the vaccination process, said, “We have been able to give the first dose to 60% of the healthworkers in the district and they are slowly turning up for the second dose too. But rumour mongering is proving to be a hindrance.”She said, “In some cases it was observed that the healthcare workers and frontline warriors were monitoring the health condition of others who completed the inoculation process. However, it is important to note that 15 days after receiving the first dose, the body develops nearly 50% immunity against the virus, so the severity of the virus is likely to be less if they catch the virus during the vaccination process.”Encouraging response from senior citizens:She was quick to add that the enthusiasm among elderly persons in getting the vaccination is encouraging. “Senior citizens are setting an example for others. Every day, we witness over 1, 500 vaccinations among senior citizens,” said Dr Kiran. A total of 3, 012 persons received the Covid-19 vaccine on Monday. These included, 218 health workers who got the first dose and 275 who received the second dose. Similarly, 90 frontline workers received the first dose while 104 got the second dose on Monday.Besides, 1, 820 senior citizens and 504 persons between the age of 45 and 60, having comorbidities, also got the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-50k-in-ludhiana-have-received-at-least-one-dose-of-vaccine-so-far-101615231279084.html
09-03-2021||Other||Ludhiana: 171 couples reunited at mega camp for marital disputes||As many as 171 couples, caught in a matrimonial dispute, buried the hatched and decided to reunite during a mega counselling camp organised by the Ludhiana police on Monday, on the occasion of International Women’s Day. The cases of 81 couples, who were not ready for a compromise, have been forwarded to the courts for divorce. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal also ordered registration of FIRs in 31 cases.Punjab state women commission chairperson Manish Gulati, who inaugurated the camp, appreciated the efforts of Ludhiana police for resolving such disputes. She said that Punjab is much safer for women as compared to other states because of the efficient handling of such cases by the police. Citing the example of a Gujarat-based woman who had jumped into the Sabarmati river after recording a video message on her mobile phone, Gulati said that the woman was forced to take the extreme step as she lacked moral support from people around her. “If she had got some counselling or support, she would have found the courage to fight the atrocities instead of ending her life. I am glad that the Punjab police have roped in counsellors to deal with such cases,” said Gulati.When asked about the rising cases of sexual assaults on minor girls in Ludhiana’s vehras, Gulati said the women’s commission, along with the police, is working on the issue. “We will work with the factory owners to see if separate rooms can be created in the vicinity, for the children when their parents are at work,” she said. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said they will rope in NGOs to provide education to such children. Replying to a question over a woman’s allegations that the police was not taking action against Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simrajit Singh Bains against whom she had moved a rape complaint, Gulati said she has asked the police to provide her details of the case. Reunions, separations and tales of gritWhile some couples patched up, it was not such a happy ending for the others.Yudhvir Kaur and Goldenjit Singh of Chheharta were among the lucky few who were able bury the hatchet and agree to sort out their differences. The couple, who has a one-year-old daughter, had got married in 2019 but had decided to separate in October 2020 following some differences. After the couple agreed to patch-up, the women’s commission chairperson took out ₹1,000 from her pocket and gave it to them as a token of blessing. Gulati asked the couple to work out their differences and take care of their daughter. In another case, a couple in a live-in relationship separated following irreconcilable differences. Gulati asked the man to delete all pictures that he had of the girl and warned him of strict action if he made any of it public or uploaded it on social media. 45-year-old woman fights for justice for daughterIn another case, a 45-year-old woman was seen navigating the crowd at the camp to bring justice to her 24-year-old daughter, who is a domestic violence survivor. The 24-year-old woman, who had recently suffered a fracture in a road mishap, said her mother is her hero. “We are natives of Bihar. My daughter had got married to Anand Kumar Singh of Sherpur about five years ago. But he used to beat up my daughter and even threw her out of the house. I have been making multiple rounds of the police station, seeking justice for my daughter but so far, police have not even registered an FIR,” said the 45-year-old woman, who identified herself as Prabha Devi. She tried to meet the state women commission chairperson but remained unsuccessful. Police install sanitary pad dispensing machines at Saanjh Kendras in cityOn the occasion of International Women’s Day on Monday, Ludhiana police installed sanitary pad dispensing machines at 10 Saanjh Kendras in the city. With this, women visiting the Saanjh Kendras will be able to get a sanitary pad by putting a five-rupee coin into the machine.This will especially be useful for female cops, who sometimes have to remain on ground for endless hours. Inaugurating the machine at police lines during a mega camp, Punjab state women commission chairperson Manisha Gulati appreciated the efforts of the Ludhiana police, which, she said, was the first in the state to set up pad dispensing machines at Saanjh Kendras. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 1) Pragya Jain said that any woman who needs a sanitary napkin can visit the Saanjh Kendra. “The pads are of international quality but will be available for woman at a nominal price here. Some women are unable to buy costly sanitary pads sold in shops. For such women, the vending machines will be helpful,” said Jain.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said that the Ludhiana police took this initiative on their own and no help from corporates or NGOs was sought for this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-171-couples-reunited-at-mega-camp-for-marital-disputes-101615231220751.html

It is mainly due to the testing numbers not keeping pace with the increasing number of cases. In the last week of February, when cases went up by 85%, testing had increased by 17%. However, in the recent week, the number of tests went up by just 12%.In fact, Chandigarh’s weekly positivity rate is the second highest in the country after Maharashtra. Amid the surge, the Centre last week told the local authorities to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests from the current 35% to 60% and expand the vaccination drive.Meanwhile, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, has again closed its walk-in OPDs, which were opened after a gap of one year in mid- February. However, no more restrictions have been announced by the administration as of now. “People should take all precautions and follow Covid appropriate behaviour. It has become even more important as various curbs have been lifted,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department.

This was stated by the general manager of Northern Railways, Ashutosh Gangal, while he went for the annual inspection of Ambala division on Monday. Gangal said, “The purpose of this extension is to provide an alternative alignment and access to stations in Himachal Pradesh which are connected through this line.” He said there were some landholding issues which had delayed the project, but the Railways have reached out to both Punjab and Haryana governments. If the issues are resolved, officials hope that this line will be operational by next year. On a query about high fare in unreserved class trains resumed recently in the division, Gangal said the reason behind this is to reduce passenger load.“We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but to give the long-route passengers an option, we resumed 50 such trains last month. When the situation improves, we will surely reduce the fare,” he added. More trains will also originate from the city. A special rain will run from Chandigarh to Lucknow for Holi in addition to an existing one. Officials said they are also considering the request of Malayali Samajam Mohali to resume the Kerala Sampark Kranti Express and the train will restart within a week. On renovation of Chandigarh Railway Station, divisional railway manager, Ambala, Gurinder Mohan Singh, said the contract has been kept in abeyance for at least six months by the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC). It is likely that the last date for this will be pushed further after it had been extended up to December 2022, he added. Officials said not many bidders are turning up for the commercial plots towards Panchkula side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/railway-line-to-connect-chandigarh-and-mukerian-101615230258616.html

On February 25, the green Scorpio with 20 gelatin sticks, weighing up to 2.5 kgs, was found abandoned on Carmichael Road which is 600 metres away from Antilia, the residence of the Ambanis. A threat letter addressed to Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, and his wife Nita Ambani was also found in it.Soon after the investigation was launched, a man Mansukh Hiran came forward and said that the SUV was reported stolen from him and that he had reported the theft of his car on February 18. Hiren’s body was found in Kalwa creek on March 5, hours after his family reported that he was missing.Chief minister Thackeray also said that the Maharashtra police’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was investigating the matter until now, will continue to conduct its probe into Hiran’s death. He said the opposition does not have faith in the state machinery and wanted to show it doesn't function. "If that is so, why is it demanding that the state government reduce taxes on fuel?" the chief minister asked.Maharashtra’s home minister Anil Deshmukh also said in the state assembly on Monday that state police were capable of solving the case of Hiren's death and the recovery of the explosives-laden car near Ambani's residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/something-fishy-thackeray-after-nia-asked-to-take-over-ambani-bomb-threat-probe-101615213229407.html

The case was later handed over to the Central Investigation Bureau (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate and NCB were also roped in to investigate the money laundering and drugs angle.The federal drugs regulatory body has made multiple arrests in the case and has also interrogated several popular Bollywood celebrities to probe a possible drug mafia in the Mumbai based film industry.The NCB recently filed a 11,700-page charge sheet and has named the late actor’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and 32 others in it. The statements of the accused would be corroborated with other evidence such as chats, audio messages exchanged, and relevant bank account entries.The central agency has also claimed that Chakraborty took delivery of drugs at her residence, and so they were stored at her house. The actor allegedly provided funds for purchase of drugs and facilitated a channel of supply of drugs with her brother Showik’s help, the NCB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-including-one-who-provided-drugs-to-sushant-singh-rajput-arrested-by-ncb-101615190062392.html

By that time, a body was found at Mumbra and it was later confirmed that the deceased was Mansukh," he had said, adding that Hiran's mobile phone is yet to be recovered.Officials on Saturday said the autopsy report of Hiran reserved the opinion on the cause of his death and added that no visible external injuries were found on his body.The viscera of Hiran was already sent for forensic analysis, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hiren-mansukh-death-ats-registers-case-of-murder-101615146853628.html
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Autopsy report of owner of SUV found near Ambani's house 'reserved'||The visecra of Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the vehicle that was later found with explosives outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, has been sent to the forensic lab for analysis, police said on Saturday.The autopsy report of Hiran (46), who was found dead in a creek in neighbouring Thane on Friday morning, reserved the opinion on the cause of death, officials said.Hiran's body was fished out of the creek along the Mumbra-Reti Bunder road hours after his family registered a complaint about his disappearance with Thane police.The autopsy report received on Saturday mentioned that there were no visible external injuries, a police official said."The viscera has been preserved and sent for chemical analysis to the forensic sciences laboratory at Kalina in Mumbai," he said, adding that drowning was suspected to be the cause of death.After obtaining the autopsy report, senior police officials visited Hiran's residence in Naupada in Thane and convinced his family members to take possession of the body, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Avinash Ambure.The family had said earlier it would not take the body for last rites until autopsy report was available.A team of the Maharashtra's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) which has taken over the probe of the entire matter, visited the spot where Hiran's body was found.As per Thane Police, Hiran, who was in vehicle spare business, left his shop around 8.30 pm on Thursday in an autorickshaw and since then his phone was switched off. His family then lodged missing person complaint.Hiran's Scorpio with 20 gelatin sticks inside was found near 'Antilia', Ambani's multi-storey residence in South Mumbai, on February 25. Police had said it had been stolen from Airoli-Mulund Bridge on February 18.Hiran had said in the statement recorded by police that when he was on the way from his shop in Thane to Crawford Market in south Mumbai for some work on February 17, the steering got jammed.He left the car on service road in Vikhroli and took a cab, he said. After finishing work, he met a friend and returned to Thane in his car, he told police.The next day he found that the Scorpio was missing and lodged a police complaint, Hiran had told the media.Speaking in the Legislative Assembly on Friday, BJP leader and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis pointed out that Mumbai police commissioner's office is close to Crawford Market."He met a person at Crawford Market. Who is that person? The vehicle owner lives in Thane and the police official who was the first to reach the spot (near Ambani's house) also lives in Thane," Fadnavis said, seeking an NIA probe.While the police had maintained that Hiran owned the SUV, the matter got more murky on Friday when Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said in the Assembly that he was not the owner.The real owner had handed it over to Hiran for some interior work, Deshmukh said, while announcing that the probe will be transfered to the ATS.On Saturday, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil alleged that suspicious death of Hiran looked like a murder, and questioned the "seriousness of the probe".Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the matter should not be politicised, but the truth must be found to protect the Sena-NCP-Congress government's image and prestige.As to who parked the vehicle near RIL chairman Ambani's house in the early hours of February 25, the investigators have not said anything yet.Police said that CCTV footage showed that the person who drove it there left in another vehicle, an Innova, which is yet to be traced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/autopsy-report-of-owner-of-suv-found-near-ambani-s-house-reserved-101615086749132.html
09-03-2021||World||First Quad summit on March 12; bolstering cooperation, Indo-Pacific on agenda||With leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue set to hold their first summit on March 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga on Tuesday pledged to bolster cooperation with Australia and the US to tackle common challenges and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.The first virtual summit of the leaders of India, Australia, Japan and the US was announced by the external affairs ministry late on Tuesday night. It will be held about a year-and-half after the Quad was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers in September 2019, and reflects the desire of the group to present a united front to key challenges, including China’s belligerence across the region.Also Read: Ahead of Quad summit, Indian and Japanese PMs agree to bolster cooperationPM Modi will participate with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden in the “first Leaders’ Summit of the Quadrilateral Framework, being held virtually,” the ministry said in a statement.Besides discussing regional and global issues of shared interest, the leaders will “exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”.The Quad summit will be an opportunity to exchange views on “contemporary challenges such as resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, and climate change,” the statement added.The leaders will also review efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and “explore opportunities for collaboration in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region,” the statement said without giving details.Reports have suggested that the other members of the Quad could invest in India’s vaccine production capabilities to expand the delivery of doses across the region, especially to counter China’s vaccine diplomacy. India is the world’s largest producer of vaccines and has supplied almost 58 million doses to 65 countries, including 7.7 million doses provided as grants.Also Read | 'Quad summit to become feature of Indo-Pacific engagement': MorrisonChina has pledged to provide more than 460 million doses of its own vaccines to nations across the world but is yet to ramp up actual supplies.Ahead of the Quad summit, Modi and Suga had a 40-minute phone conversation and agreed to bolster cooperation both bilaterally and through the four-nation group to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.The two prime ministers also discussed defence and security cooperation and Suga expressed serious concerns about China’s actions in the area ranging from Hong Kong to the East China Sea.Modi and Suga agreed the India-Japan partnership can play a “pivotal role in addressing common challenges”, and emphasised that “their engagement with like-minded countries such as Australia and the US in the form of Quad consultations holds value and agreed that these useful discussions must continue,” the external affairs ministry said.A readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders “shared the recognition that cooperation towards realising a Free and Open Indo-Pacific is becoming increasingly important and to this end, shared the view to steadily advance both Japan-India bilateral cooperation and Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral cooperation”.Suga expressed “serious concerns regarding unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea, China’s Coast Guard Law and the situation in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,” the Japanese readout said. While exchanging views on the region, the two leaders “confirmed that they have grave concerns over the situation in Myanmar and they would closely work together in this vein,” the readout added.Suga also sought “understanding and cooperation toward the early resolution” of the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.The two leaders welcomed progress on the high-speed rail project in Maharashtra and the signing of a memorandum of cooperation for specified skilled Indian workers to be employed in Japan.They also agreed to celebrate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Japan in 2022. Modi also invited Suga to visit India at the earliest for the annual bilateral summit.The US has taken the lead in organising both the Quad summit and the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the group on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions. During their meeting, the foreign ministers reiterated the Quad’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.The Quad, formed in 2007, was revived in 2017 as a gathering of senior officials. It was upgraded to the ministerial level in 2019, reflecting the desire of the four countries to work more closely on shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and India’s growing comfort with the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-quad-summit-on-march-12-bolstering-cooperation-indo-pacific-on-agenda-101615312616202.html

09-03-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth responds to Harry and Meghan's racism accusations||Britain's Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday responded to explosive racism claims from her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, voicing deep concern and sympathising with their troubles with royal life."The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan," she said in a statement."The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.Also Read | Suicide to racism: Harry, Meghan on royal mess"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members."Buckingham Palace has come under mounting pressure to respond to the claims made in an Oprah Winfrey interview first broadcast on Sunday, which triggered a crisis unseen since the anguished days of Harry's late mother, Diana, in the 1990s.It set off a whirl of speculation about the identity of the senior royal who asked how dark their child's skin would be before he was born.Meghan, whose mother is black and father is white, also spoke about how she had suicidal thoughts, but failed to receive any support during her time in the royal family.Winfrey was left open-mouthed by the racism claim, which reportedly left the palace in turmoil and scrambling how best to address it.Prince Charles, Harry's father and the heir to the throne, earlier ignored a question about what he made of the interview, as he made his first public appearance since the row erupted.A YouGov poll of 4,656 people after the interview aired on British television on Monday indicated almost a third (32 percent) felt the couple was unfairly treated, the same proportion as those who thought the opposite.But older people were more likely to side with the royal family, the poll suggested.'Blowing up his family' Harry and Meghan's claims have been likened to a bomb being dropped on Britain's most famous family and one of the country's most revered institutions.Attempts have been made to draw in Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has himself been accused of racism during his time as a newspaper columnist.But he refused to comment, even as political calls mounted for a full inquiry and the White House and former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton spoke out.Also Read: Buckingham Palace silent, in turmoil after Meghan, Harry's tell-all interviewHowever Zac Goldsmith, a junior British foreign minister and close ally of Johnson, said former army captain Harry was "blowing up his family".Johnson's spokesman declined to say whether Goldsmith was speaking for the government.The level of controversy about the royals has not been seen since the 1990s, during the very public collapse of the marriage of Harry's parents.His mother, princess Diana, collaborated with the author Andrew Morton in a revealing 1992 biography and gave a bombshell BBC television interview in 1995.In it, she said both she and Prince Charles had been unfaithful, how he was unfit to be king, and that she felt isolated, struggling with self-harm and bulimia.Morton said Harry and Meghan's claims would "shudder down through the generations in the same way that Diana's did".But Meghan's estranged father Thomas Markle defended the royals, saying he hoped the skin tone comment was "just a dumb question"."It could just be that simple, it could be somebody asked a stupid question, rather than being a total racist," he told Britain's ITV.Millions of views Just over 17 million viewers watched Winfrey's two-hour interview with Harry and Meghan on US broadcaster CBS on Sunday night.More than 11 million people then tuned in to watch it in full on ITV in Britain, the channel said.The couple dramatically quit royal life last year and now live in California with their young son, Archie, and are expecting their second child, a daughter, this summer.Harry, 36, has admitted his mother's death in Paris in 1997 -- in a high-speed car crash as she tried to flee paparazzi photographers -- has affected his mental health and coloured his view of the media.He and Meghan, 39, have accused newspapers of racial stereotyping, particularly set against coverage of Harry's sister-in-law, Kate, who is white.But their comments about the suffocating strictures of royal life and claims of unwavering attitudes have wider implications for the monarchy itself -- and what it represents.Black Lives Matter protests last year prompted calls for a reassessment of the legacy of the British Empire headed by the queen and her ancestors.Global impact?Neither the queen, now 94, and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, made the racist comment, Winfrey told CBS.But it could still be damaging as the monarch is head of the Commonwealth, an organisation comprising 54 mainly former British colonies, many of them in Africa, and 2.4 billion people.Mass immigration has transformed Britain since the queen came to the throne in 1952, with a rising number of people who define themselves as British-Asian, black-British or of mixed race.The historian David Olusoga wrote in The Guardian that Harry and Meghan's claims were "not just a crisis for the royal family -- but for Britain itself".Harry himself used a racist slur against a former military colleague and was once pictured wearing a Nazi soldier's uniform at a fancy-dress party.But he has said meeting Meghan had made him confront the issue, and he is now championing projects to tackle racism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-responds-to-harry-and-meghan-s-racism-accusations-101615311845846.html
09-03-2021||World||Czech Republic's hospitals struggle with rising Covid cases||With record numbers of COVID-19 patients filling up intensive care units in the Czech Republic, the first patient to be moved outside of the country was transported to southern Poland on Tuesday.The 68-year old woman was moved to Raciborz in Poland from a clinic in the town of Usti nad Orlici, in the Pardubice region. Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek said six other patients from a different region should be taken to Germany.Pardubice was the first entire region of the country’s 14 to declare last week intensive care units in its five regional hospitals were overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients in serious condition and it could not take any more. The Plzen region in western Czech Republic followed suit, while a number of individual hospitals elsewhere have to transfer their patients to clinics across the country.“To work as a nurse is difficult any time,” said Jirina Spelinova, chief nurse at the neurological surgery ward in Pardubice hospital in the capital of the same-name region located 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Prague.“But it’s much more difficult during the pandemic,” Spelinova said. Besides the necessity to work in protective gear, staff "are so busy that they have no time to eat, drink, or, I’m sorry to say it, go to the toilet.”Spelinova’s ward was converted to a COVID ward, a common practice adopted by many clinics across the country to be able to treat those infected. But even those expanded capacities have reached their limits.Health Minister Jan Blatny has predicted that this week will be “the most critical” for the struggling hospitals.According to his ministry’s figures 8,478 COVID-19 patients needed hospitalization on Monday. Of those, a record high of 1,789 were in intensive care. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths has risen over the past two weeks from 1.44 per 100,000 people on Feb. 22 to 1.88 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University. That figure is the worst in the worldThe nation of 10.7 million has had over 1.3 million confirmed cases with 22,147 deaths. It currently has the highest per-capita infection rate in the EU, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.To cope with the surge attributed to a highly contagious coronavirus variant, the Czech Republic activated a plan to move dozens of its patients to hospitals in Germany, Poland and Switzerland.The three countries previously offered treatment in their hospitals, together with Austria and Slovenia.The government has also ordered medical and other university and high school students and also medical personnel at outpatient clinics to help out at the struggling hospitals.They should help reach a goal to add 100 intensive care beds and another 570 oxygen-supported ones, Blatny said.Spelinova said the nurses have to cope with a high level of distress.“When more people are dying these days, it’s extremely demanding for them," she said.Another nurse, Michaela Krehlova from the respiratory ward, said the high influx of patients makes 12-hour shifts stressful. “You feel you don't spend enough time with everyone,” she said.“It's tough to cope with more often and sometimes unexpected deaths, especially of younger patients."Meanwhile, the Statistics Office said on Tuesday that 15,900 people died in the Czech Republic in January, the highest number for that month in 70 years.According to the Health Ministry, 4,767 people died of COVID-19 in January, the second biggest death toll after November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czech-republic-s-hospitals-struggle-with-rising-covid-cases-101615310564096.html

They include Vivek Murthy, a nominee for surgeon general; Vanita Gupta, nominee for associate attorney general; and Bharat Ramamurti and Sameera Fazili, deputy directors of the president’s National Economic Council.Varghese, whose parents had moved to the US from Kerala, will head a federal agency — the way it had worked when Barack Obama was president — that provides military support for White House events and functions, including food service, presidential transportation, medical support and emergency medical services, and hospitality services. Varghese had earlier served as executive director of Biden’s inauguration committee and chief operating officer of the campaign.Varghese also goes back to the Obama-Biden administration. He was assistant to the president for management and administration and special assistant to the president and deputy director of advance.Varghese is a graduate of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the Maurice A.

09-03-2021||World||Mexico ignores efficacy concerns, signs deal for 36 mn Covid vaccines with China||Mexico announced a huge bet on Chinese vaccines Tuesday, without making public any information about their efficacy.Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the Mexican government has signed agreements for 12 million doses of the yet-unapproved Sinopharm vaccine and increased to a total of 20 million doses its contracts for the Coronavac dose made by China’s Sinovac.The total of 32 million doses, plus at least 4 million doses of the CanSino shot, would dwarf the estimated 5 million vaccine doses Mexico has acquired from other sources.However, Ebrard’s office has repeatedly refused to answer questions about the efficacy of the Chinese shots.Sinopharm has claimed its vaccine was 79% effective based on interim data from clinical trials, but like other Chinese firms, it has not publicly released its late-stage clinical trial data.Experts in Hong Kong have assessed the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine at about 51%. That shot has already been approved for use in Mexico.The CanSino vaccine has been approved in Mexico and reportedly has an efficacy rate of around 65.7%,A total of six vaccines have been approved for use in Mexico, which has received relatively small amounts of each. Mexico has administered only about 4.7 million doses of all vaccines, a tiny amount given the country’s population of 126 million.The government policy sets up the odd situation in which some Mexicans, mainly in urban areas, will receive the Pfizer vaccine, which has around 95% efficacy, while most will get one of the Chinese vaccines with a much lower effectiveness.Amid a dearth of public data on China’s vaccines, hesitations over their efficacy and safety are still pervasive in the countries depending on them.Inoculations with Chinese vaccines already have begun in more than 25 countries. None of China’s three vaccine candidates used globally have publicly released their late-stage clinical trial data.Mexico has suffered almost 190,100 confirmed deaths. However, Mexico does so little testing that government excess-death figures suggest the real toll was well above 220,000 at the start of January, when the government stopped releasing that data. Test-confirmed cases total over 2.1 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-ignores-efficacy-concerns-signs-deal-for-36-mn-covid-vaccines-with-china-101615310537524.html

I grew up as an only child.""The last time I saw her must have been at least 18 or 19 years ago. And before that, 10 years before that," she added.Following which, Samantha came ahead and denied the claims with some proof to back her up."I don't know how she can say I don't know her and she was an only child. We've got photographs over a lifespan of us together so how can she not know me?," she said in an interview.Fox News reported that Samantha showed photos featuring the two of them together at various stages of their respective upbringing, including one from Samantha's college graduation in 2008, which flies in the face of Meghan's claim that they hadn't seen each other in almost two decades.In the 200 minutes long show, the Duchess also claimed that her half-sister had changed her last name to 'Markle' in her 50s, shortly after she began dating Prince Harry.However, Samantha showed proof that her name has been Markle for a lot longer than that, including a petition for name change dated in 1997 as well as her college diploma, which clearly states her name as Markle, Fox News quoted."I was a Markle before she was. I thought that was kind of weird that she'd say I only changed my name back when she met Harry. Markle's always been my name," Samantha said.Further, she added that she had 'no sympathy' left for Meghan after her wrong claims."Depression is not an excuse for treating people like dishrags and disposing of them," she concluded referencing to both herself and her father, Thomas Markle, who both have their own complicated story with the Duchess of Sussex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-s-half-sister-questions-interview-claims-presents-evidence-101615310106258.html

In addition, Boeing put orders for 16 planes back into its backlog, indicating it is now more confident that those sales will go through.The orders could indicate that airlines are starting to feel more optimistic about a rebound in travel, which has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. In the US, the number of air travelers has been ticking up with the rollout of vaccines against Covid-19, although air travel remains far below pre-pandemic levels. Boeing suffered several months when it reported no orders, as airlines parked unneeded planes and cut costs to conserve cash.Several of the February orders had been previously announced, including a United Airlines commitment to buy another 25 Boeing 737 Max jets. Boeing said other customers that it declined to identify ordered 14 Max planes, and it reported 27 new orders for its KC-46 military refueling plane.Chicago-based Boeing said it delivered 22 commercial planes last month including 18 Max jets, led by five to Southwest Airlines and three to United.The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two crashes that killed 346 people. Regulators in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Brazil and other countries cleared the plane to resume flying after Boeing changed an automated flight-control system that played a role in the crashes.Boeing says 14 airlines around the world are now flying passengers on Max jets, including American, United and Alaska airlines. Southwest plans to resume Max flights later this week.Shares of Boeing rose more than 2% in late-morning trading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-sees-positive-net-orders-for-airplanes-for-first-time-in-15-months-101615308446667.html

A second person said that her nomination is proceeding.White House spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. Politico reported earlier that Biden had decided to nominate her for the FTC.Her selection would be another signal that the president is preparing to square off against the technology industry’s biggest companies. The people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because her nomination hasn’t been announced.Khan, whose research focuses on technology markets, previously worked as an aide to FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra as well as for the New America Foundation and its spin-off, the Open Markets Institute. In a 2017 article for the Yale Law Journal titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” she argued that current U.S. antitrust law insufficiently counters the anti-competitive effects of Amazon-type, platform-based business models.Khan “has been one of the brightest intellectual stars in the antitrust world in a generation -- broadly recognized, even by people that don’t agree with her,” Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, said in an interview.Khan also served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, which conducted a 16-month investigation into tech companies and determined that the biggest internet platforms have all abused their gatekeeper power over the digital economy. The panel is preparing to introduce legislation to reform antitrust laws.The committee’s report recommended a series of far-reaching antitrust reforms, including a measure that would prohibit a dominant tech platform from operating in competition with the firms dependent on it -- much the way banking laws once barred large lenders from acquiring insurers, real estate firms, and other non-banking companies. The committee also recommended restrictions on acquisitions by dominant firms.Khan’s selection follows the March 5 announcement that Biden would tap another Columbia law professor, Timothy Wu, to join the National Economic Council as a special assistant on technology and competition policy.Wu has been an outspoken advocate for aggressive antitrust enforcement against U.S. technology giants. His appointment elevates to a senior position in the administration a leading antitrust expert, favored by progressives, who has assailed the power of dominant tech companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. Both companies were sued by U.S. antitrust enforcers last year for allegedly abusing their monopoly power.If confirmed by the Senate, Khan would join the five-member FTC at a time when tech giants are grappling with a reckoning in Washington that could transform the industry.A lawsuit the FTC and state attorneys general brought against Facebook in December could lead to the breakup of the company, while the Justice Department’s complaint against Google targets the heart of its business -- internet search.Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations of Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.Other key and as-yet unfilled antitrust positions in Biden’s administration include a chief for the Justice Department’s antitrust division and permanent chairman for the FTC.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-likely-to-nominate-lina-khan-to-federal-trade-commission-post-101615306229911.html
09-03-2021||World||'Absurd': Russia on US charge of trying to 'discredit' Western Covid-19 vaccines||The Kremlin on Tuesday rebuffed a White House allegation that Russia's intelligence services were seeking to discredit Western COVID-19 vaccines, describing such allegations as absurd.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday that President Joe Biden's administration was monitoring efforts tied to Russia's intelligence services aimed at undermining the Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc coronavirus vaccines.The United States said it had identified three online publications that Russia was using to spread disinformation about the two vaccines, as well as international organisations, military conflicts and protests."We have always been against politicising issues related to vaccines. Russia has never participated and does not intend to participate in such campaigns against other vaccines," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters."All these statements are absurd, have no basis in fact, and we really regret that anyone would take such statements seriously," he added.Russia's own flagship Sputnik vaccine has been authorised by 46 countries, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets it abroad.It could be produced in western Europe for the first time after a deal to make it in Italy was signed by the RDIF sovereign wealth fund and Swiss-based pharmaceutical company Adienne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/absurd-russia-on-us-charge-of-trying-to-discredit-western-covid-19-vaccines-101615306235490.html
09-03-2021||World||Pak election commission to not take action on vote buying claims in Senate polls||Pakistan's top election body on Tuesday refused to take action on the allegations of vote buying in the recent Senate elections just on the basis of video clips unless those involved in offering and getting bribes were named.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) said this on a plea challenging the election of Opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement's (PDM) candidate and former premier Yusuf Raza Gilani to the Senate. The top electoral body was expected to hear the petition on March 11 but it took up the case after a request by the government.A four-member commission of ECP headed by Altaf Ibrahim Qureshi heard the petition. The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of Prime Minister Imran Khan was represented in the hearing by counsel Ali Zafar.The PTI has challenged the victory of former premier Gilani as Senator on the basis of alleged fraud, urging the ECP not to issue notification of his success.Gilani became a Senator after defeating PTI candidate Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on March 3, a big blow to Prime Minister Khan who had personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.The government's allegations are based on a video of Gilani's son Ali Haider, who is shown talking with some PTI members and telling them how a vote can be "spoiled".The PTI, in its petition, said that since seven votes were "spoiled" in the Senate elections and its candidate lost by just five votes, it showed that the PTI lawmakers in the video were bribed.Refusing to take action on allegations of vote buying in the polls just on the basis of video clips, the ECP urged the government's lawyer to make all persons involved in the video scandal a party to the case and said that if the charges of giving and receiving bribes are proven, then action should be taken against all the culprits.Government's counsel Zafar was reluctant to name those who allegedly received bribes but after initial refusal he agreed to do so after consultation with the government. The ECP asked him to file a fresh petition.In another development, the Islamabad High Court was set to hear on Wednesday a petition by PTI member Ali Nawaz in which he challenged the election of Gilani to the Senate.Chief Justice Athar Minallah will hear the petition seeking to declare his victory unconstitutional and illegal as he had won through rigging and bribery.The new challenge to Gilani came in the wake of his nomination as the Opposition's joint candidate for the Senate chairman election scheduled on March 12.PDM, an alliance of 11 parties, also nominated Maulana Ghafoor Haidri of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) for the post of deputy chairman of Senate.In an effort to sway votes in a tight competition, the government offered to support Haidri if his party supported Sadiq Sanjrani, who is supported by the government for the Senate chairman. However, Haidri rejected the offer.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Khan, addressing the Cabinet meeting, said that technology such as electronic voting machines (EVM) would be used in future to avoid voting fraud."We can't have the kind of elections which have happened in the past… We need to use EVM technology for transparent elections and I want regular updates on it," he said.After Shaikh's defeat, Prime Minister Khan had last week lashed out at the election commission, accusing it of discrediting democracy, damaging the morality of the nation and failing to stop corruption in the closely-contested Senate elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-election-commission-to-not-take-action-on-vote-buying-claims-in-senate-polls-101615305484705.html
09-03-2021||World||Meghan and Harry row divides UK along age lines: Poll||Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's explosive interview has divided public opinion in Britain, a poll showed Tuesday, with those under 25 most likely to feel they were unfairly treated.In the Oprah Winfrey interview, first aired in the United States on Sunday, the couple accused royal family members of asking how dark their baby's skin would be.Meghan, a mixed-race former television actress, said she had felt suicidal and was refused help by palace aides.A poll by YouGov taken after the interview aired in Britain on Monday evening, indicated that almost a third (32 percent) felt Meghan and Harry were unfairly treated by the royal family, while the same percentage thought their treatment was fair.But there was a clear split along age lines.The younger generation took the side of Meghan and Harry, who are both in their 30s and married in 2018, while the older generation were more likely to back the royal family led by the 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth II.Sixty-one percent of those aged 18 to 24 thought the couple were unfairly treated, while 50 percent of those over 65 thought they were fairly treated, a view only shared by 13 percent of the youngest group.Another question on whether people's general sympathies lay with Meghan and Harry or with the other royals, found that overall more British people -- 36 percent -- favoured the Queen and the royal family, while 22 percent chose Harry and Meghan.The polling agency spoke to 4,656 British adults after the show aired on ITV commercial television, with an audience of more than 11 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-and-harry-row-divides-uk-along-age-lines-poll-101615303675457.html

But we are going to have a vote as soon as we can," Democratic Representative Katherine Clark, the assistant House speaker, told CNN.The Senate, where Democrats have effective control, passed its version of the bill on Saturday after a marathon overnight session. The upper chamber of Congress eliminated or pared back some provisions in an original House bill, including an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.Now that the bill has passed the Senate, it must be approved again by the House before it can make its way to Biden's desk.The House was still awaiting the Senate version late on Monday. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that lawmakers would "take it up Wednesday morning at the latest."Democrats hold a very narrow majority in the House, meaning they cannot withstand many votes by their members against the bill.The first version of the bill passed the House without a single Republican vote. Two moderate Democrats joined Republicans in voting against that version. One of them, Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, said on Monday he would now vote for the bill with the Senate changes."My concerns remain on the size and scope of this bill but believe the Senate changes provide meaningful relief for Oregonians in need," Schrader wrote in a post on Facebook.Republicans, who broadly supported economic relief early in the coronavirus pandemic, have criticized the price tag of the Biden relief package.Some progressives in the House have criticized the Senate's changes. But Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters she thought members of her group would back the legislation.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised the legislation at a news conference on Monday, saying that while there were some changes on the margins, it represented the "core" of what Biden originally proposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-readies-final-vote-on-prez-biden-s-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-101615303654509.html

True figures are likely far higher due to under-reporting of sexual abuse, a heavily-stigmatised crime."These numbers are very shocking and really are sort of a wake-up call for governments to be doing much more to prevent this violence," report author Claudia Garcia-Moreno said.In some regions, more than half of women face violence at some point, she told Reuters, citing Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia.Countries with the highest prevalence include Kiribati, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Afghanistan, WHO data show.The lowest rates are in Europe, up to 23%, over a lifetime.Violence starts at an "alarmingly young" age, the WHO said.One in four adolescent girls aged 15-19 who have had a relationship have been subjected to either physical or sexual violence, Garcia-Moreno said."This is a very important and formative time in life. And we know that the impacts of this violence can be long-lasting and can affect physical and mental health and lead to unwanted pregnancies and other complications," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-in-3-women-endure-physical-or-sexual-violence-who-101615303188279.html

09-03-2021||World||UK businesses bought fake Google reviews from firms found in search results: Report||A consumer group has exposed a web of paid-for reviewers providing fake reviews to dozens of UK businesses listings on Google, ranging from home improvement companies to a stockbroker. The consumer group, Which?, set up a fake company and bought bogus reviews to probe how some businesses are opting for shortcuts to build a good customer rating.Notably, companies selling Google reviews in bulk were all easily found in the tech giant’s own search results, the report said. Which? created a fake business listing called Five Star Reviews and bought 20 Google reviews for around $150 from a site named Reviewr. The firm providing paid-for reviews claimed to offer “100% permanent reviews” that won’t be deleted and the investigators even got the option to choose a star rating of their liking for each review.The Google accounts, which were used to plant the fake reviews, had reviewed similar businesses all around the country. Nearly 50 companies, including a stockbroker, a dentist, a London estate agent, and a bakery in Edinburgh, had at least three reviewers in common, suggesting that these businesses paid the same company to post “glowing appraisals”.“Companies that are taking shortcuts to rise up the ranks dishonestly are in breach of Google's terms of use, and may well steal business from those operating honestly. Our investigation revealed that, in some cases, they may pose a threat to consumers, too,” the report said, elaborating on the risk of fake reviews.A stockbroker in Canary Wharf had reportedly received a lot of negative reviews as many wrote “shockingly poor customer service” and one of the reviewers claimed to have lost £27,000 worth of investment because the business acted against his wishes. Between two to four months prior to the investigation, the stockbroker received 30 five star reviews in quick succession. Which? was able to link many of the reviewers identified in the investigation.Google told Which? that it uses automatic detection systems to filter out fake reviews but admitted that the automated systems aren’t perfect. "Our policies clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences and information, and we closely monitor 24/7 for fraudulent content, using a combination of people and technology,” a Google spokesperson was quoted by the consumer group as saying.In its report, Which? has called on the competition and markets authority (CMA) to take strong action against sites that host reviews if they find that they are failing to prevent fake reviews from flooding their platforms. It has also urged the regulator to take swift and effective action to stop sites from trading or facilitating the trading of fake reviews.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-businesses-caught-buying-fake-google-reviews-for-a-turnaround-report-101615299229689.html

They often go to Delaware when the first lady's traveling, and they're adjusting to their new home," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told MSNBC in an interview, adding she had no specific details about the report.First Lady Jill Biden has said she has been trying to settle the two German Shepherds settled into their new 18-acre home in Washington, D.C. since Biden took office Jan. 20.Biden adopted Major in November 2018 from the Delaware Humane Society. Champ joined the family in 2008 when Biden was elected vice president under President Barack Obama.Jill Biden last month noted the canines have had to get used to the White House as well as its many staffers."I've been getting obsessed with getting our dogs settled because we have an old dog and we have a very young dog," she told "The Kelly Clarkson Show" in a Feb. 28 interview. "So that's what I've been obsessed with, getting everybody settled and calm."In 2008, as former President George W. Bush was winding down his second term, his Scottish Terrier Barney bit the finger of a reporter who tried to pet him, according to the Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-has-no-comment-on-biting-report-involving-biden-s-rescue-dog-101615300204303.html

"We're certainly not out of the woods yet, even on this wave."More than 120,000 people in Britain have died from Covid-19, the fifth highest official global toll, but it has also had one of the world's fastest vaccine rollouts, with more than a third of the population already receiving at least one dose.Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said it was not possible to stop all Covid-19 deaths even with a successful vaccine rollout, although the size and severity of future surges in infections could be reduced with a cautious approach."All the modelling suggests there is going to be a further surge... The ratio of cases to deaths will go right down as a result of vaccination, but not right down to zero, unfortunately," Whitty told lawmakers.Schools in England re-opened to all pupils on Monday. The next steps in lockdown easing have been pencilled in at five-week intervals but officials have said that data, rather than dates, will dictate the pace.Asked why encouraging data couldn't lead to an acceleration of that timetable, Vallance said three to four weeks were needed to generate and assess the data, and the government wanted to give one-week notice of changes to rules."I think if you truncate that you are essentially flying blind," Vallance said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-uk-offcials-urge-caution-on-easing-lockdown-restrictions-101615297517271.html
09-03-2021||World||Ahead of Quad summit, Indian and Japanese PMs agree to bolster cooperation||Ahead of a planned summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga agreed on Tuesday to bolster cooperation both bilaterally and through the four-nation group to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.During a 40-minute phone conversation, the two prime ministers also discussed defence and security cooperation and Suga expressed serious concerns about China’s actions in the area ranging from Hong Kong to East China Sea.The conversation came ahead of a planned summit of the leaders of the Quad nations – India, Australia, Japan and the US – that is expected to be held as early as Friday as part of the Biden administration’s focus on bolstering the group and countering China’s actions across the region.Modi and Suga “shared the recognition that cooperation towards realising a Free and Open Indo-Pacific is becoming increasingly important and to this end, shared the view to steadily advance both Japan-India bilateral cooperation and Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral cooperation”, said a readout from Japan’s foreign ministry.There was no official word on the conversation from the Indian side.The two prime ministers also exchanged views on bilateral relations and “concurred that they would continue their effort to materialise the ‘Japan-India Special Strategic and Global Partnership’ through cooperation in such areas as security and defence, economic relationship including digital fields and people-to-people exchanges”, the readout said.Suga expressed “serious concerns regarding unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea, China’s Coast Guard Law and the situation in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region”, the readout said. While exchanging views on the regional situation, the two leaders “confirmed that they have grave concerns over the situation in Myanmar and they would closely work together in this vein”, the readout added.Suga also sought “understanding and cooperation toward the early resolution” of the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.The two leaders welcomed progress on the high-speed rail project in Maharashtra and the signing of a memorandum of cooperation for specified skilled Indian workers to be employed in Japan.Confirmation regarding the Quad Summit came from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who told a news conference last week he had discussed the matter with US President Joe Biden, Modi and Suga in recent conversations.The US has taken the lead in organising both the summit and the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the Quad on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions. During their meeting, the four foreign ministers reiterated the Quad’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.The Quad, formed in 2007, was revived in 2017 as a gathering of senior officials of the four countries. It was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers in September 2019, reflecting the desire of the four countries to work more closely on shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and India’s comfort with the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-quad-summit-indian-and-japanese-pms-agree-to-bolster-cooperation-101615296120324.html

09-03-2021||World||France to speed up opening of secret archives on Algeria War||French President Emmanuel Macron announced a decision Tuesday to speed up the declassification of secret documents related to Algeria’s 1954-62 war of independence from France.The measure comes amid a series of steps taken by Macron to reconcile France with its colonial past and address its brutal history with Algeria, which had been under French rule for 132 years until its independence in 1962.The French presidency said in a statement that archive services will now be allowed to use a new procedure to declassify documents from 1970 and earlier that were previously being held secret for national security purposes. This includes archives related to Algeria War, the statement said.Under French laws, almost all archives of the French state, including on defense and security issues, should be made available to the public after 50 years except information that could compromise some people's security. Yet a complex and long request process was preventing researchers and academics from working on these archives.The new procedure will “significantly reduce the delay,” the French presidency said.Broadening the opening of archives on the war was part of Macron’s commitments to reckon with France’s colonial-era wrongs in Algeria.In 2018, Macron formally recognized the responsibility of the French state in the 1957 death of a dissident in Algeria, Maurice Audin, admitting for the first time the French military’s use of systematic torture during the war.Last week, Macron met with four grandchildren of an Algerian independence fighter to tell them that Ali Boumendjel had been tortured and killed by French soldiers in 1957.Macron also wants to honor Gisele Halimi, a French feminist who supported Algeria’s independence and denounced the use of torture by the French military during the war. He hopes to have her reburied at the Pantheon monument in Paris, a resting place for some of France’s most distinguished citizens.Macron also plans to attend three commemoration ceremonies by next year, which will mark the 60th anniversary of the end of Algeria's war for independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-speed-up-opening-of-secret-archives-on-algeria-war-101615290240673.html
09-03-2021||World||'Shoot me instead': Myanmar nun pleads with junta forces||Kneeling before them in the dust of a northern Myanmar city, Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng begged a group of heavily armed police officers to spare "the children" and take her life instead.The image of the Catholic nun in a simple white habit, her hands spread, pleading with the forces of the country's new junta as they prepared to crack down on a protest, has gone viral and won her praise in the majority-Buddhist country."I knelt down... begging them not to shoot and torture the children, but to shoot me and kill me instead," she told AFP on Tuesday.Her act of bravery in the city of Myitkyina on Monday came as Myanmar struggles with the chaotic aftermath of the military's February 1 ouster of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.As protests demanding the return of democracy have rolled on, the junta has steadily escalated its use of force, using tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets, and live rounds.Protesters took to the streets of Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state, on Monday wearing hard hats and carrying homemade shields.As police started massing around them, Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng and two other nuns pleaded with them to leave."The police were chasing to arrest them and I was worried for the children," she said.It was at that point that the 45-year-old nun fell to her knees.Moments later, as she was begging for restraint, the police started firing into the crowd of protesters behind her."The children panicked and ran to the front... I couldn't do anything but I was praying for God to save and help the children," she said.First she saw a man shot in the head fall dead in front of her -- then she felt the sting of tear gas."I felt like the world was crashing," she said."I'm very sad it happened as I was begging them."A local rescue team confirmed to AFP that two men were shot dead on the spot during Monday's clash, though it did not confirm whether live rounds or rubber bullets were used.On Tuesday, one of the deceased, Zin Min Htet, was laid in a glass casket and transported on a golden hearse covered in white and red flowers.Mourners raised three fingers in a symbol of resistance, as a musical ensemble of brass instrument players, drummers and a bagpiper in crisp white uniforms led the funeral procession.- 'All Myanmar is grieving' - Kachin, Myanmar's northernmost state, is home to the Kachin ethnic group, and the site of a years-long conflict between ethnic armed groups and the military.Tens of thousands have fled their homes to displacement camps across the state -- and among the organisations aiding them have been Christian groups.Monday was not Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng's first encounter with the security forces -- on February 28 she made a similar plea for mercy, walking slowly towards police in riot gear, getting on her knees and pleading for them to stop."I have thought myself dead already since February 28," she said of the day she made the decision to stand up to the armed police.On Monday, she was joined by her fellow sisters and the local bishop, who surrounded her as she pleaded for mercy for the protesters."We were there to protect our sister and our people because she had her life at risk," Sister Mary John Paul told AFP.The city has seen frequent crackdowns from authorities since the coup, including a violent dispersal of peaceful teachers last month that sent several into hiding.So far, more than 60 people have been killed in anti-coup demonstrations around the country, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group.Fear runs deep for Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng, but she said she must be brave and will continue to stand up for "the children"."I can't stand and watch without doing anything, seeing what's happening in front of my eyes while all Myanmar is grieving," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shoot-me-instead-myanmar-nun-pleads-with-junta-forces-101615289496514.html

It is so damaging. I felt physical pain," Moore-Gilbert told Sky News Australia.Moore-Gilbert, a specialist in Middle East politics at the University of Melbourne, said her mental health deteriorated after two weeks."I thought if I could, I would kill myself."After nine months imprisonment, Moore-Gilbert was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which she sought to oppose through a series of hunger strikes.In her most daring opposition, however, Moore-Gilbert said she once attempted to escape."One day I was just like, ‘You know what? I’m going to do it. I have nothing to lose’," Moore-Gilbert told Sky News."There were spikes on part of the wall, so I just took some socks with me and put them over my hands and then grabbed onto them, hoping they weren’t too sharp."Once on the roof of the prison, Moore-Gilbert said she could have scaled down the walls and made a run for a nearby town. However, she said she decided not to proceed as she was in a prison uniform, didn't speak the local language and feared the consequences of being caught.Eventually she was released in a prisoner swap and back in Australia, Moore-Gilbert said she is focused on her recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/contemplated-suicide-british-australian-academic-held-in-iran-for-2-years-101615284213429.html
09-03-2021||World||Tibet infrastructure plan: China to invest nearly $30 billion in five years||Beijing will pump in nearly $30 billion in expanding “transportation infrastructure” projects across Tibet - the Chinese province with the longest section of the border with India - over the next five years, according to an announcement made in Lhasa last week. About 190 billion yuan ($29.3 billion) will be channelised into building new expressways and upgrading existing highways and improving road connectivity in the remote and largely rural areas of Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) - the second-largest province in China - state media agency Xinhua reported, quoting TAR’s transportation department. “Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China is planning to spend about 190 billion yuan in the 2021-2025 period on transportation infrastructure projects,” the report said. “The money will be used on building new expressways, upgrading existing highways and improving the road conditions in rural areas, among other fields, according to the regional transportation department,” it said.“By 2025, the total mileage of highways in Tibet will exceed 120,000km, and that of expressways will exceed 1,300km,” TAR’s transportation department said in a statement shared in the Xinhua report.The announcement was made last week in Lhasa, the provincial capital of TAR, coinciding with the annual session of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, in Beijing.The push to boost connectivity and transport infrastructure in the massive province fits in with Beijing’s overall strategy to strengthen border security and road networks against the backdrop of the worst military standoff with India in decades.Tibet’s transportation infrastructure has seen “marked improvement” in the 2016-2020 period.“Its road network reached a total length of 118,800km at the end of last year, up over 50% from the end of 2015,” according to the regional transportation department.China has separately pumped in billions of dollars in building a rail network through a difficult terrain in south-eastern Tibet, near the border with Arunachal Pradesh.Dual-use airports, from where both military and civil aviation can operate, have also been built at strategic locations in TAR.Chinese military experts believe that building infrastructure in TAR is important for ensuring an efficient military logistics system in the remote region. China has other ambitious plans for the frontier province.On Friday, it was revealed that it was planning to build a “passageway” connecting Tibet with South Asia.China is also undertaking a massive dam project in Medog county near the border with Arunachal Pradesh. The “Yarlung Tsangpo downstream hydropower base” was listed in China’s new five-year plan last week as one of the country’s major energy development projects for the 2021-2025 period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibet-infrastructure-plan-china-to-invest-nearly-30-billion-in-five-years-101615293322589.html

EU officials have said deliveries could start in April.In an updated roll-out plan published last month, Ireland forecast that it would receive 602,000 J&J shots in the second quarter - around 15% of its total quarterly supply - and would start administering the vaccine in the first week of April."The assumption on Johnson & Johnson is about 600k over quarter two, but primarily back-ended. Smaller numbers in mid-April," Health Service Executive (HSE) chief Paul Reid told a parliamentary committee.Ireland has administered almost 525,000 vaccines among its population of 4.9 million, primarily using the Pfizer-BioNTech , vaccine. Almost 150,000 have also received the second of their two doses.Reid said Ireland expects to receive 1.1 million vaccines by the end of March, with a revised 1.2 million target for first quarter deliveries drifting into the first week of April.Between delays in supply and changes to the sequencing and prioritisation of who gets which shot, the HSE has changed its operating plan 15 to 17 times since the programme began at the start of the year, he added."Our first quarter has been an experience of high levels of frustration on supply issues, to be frank. Pfizer has been more stable but we did have one change to their supply line. Moderna , of late, unstable and certainly AstraZeneca has been unstable," he said."That has been an EU-wide issue as well. We would expect the second quarter to have a higher level of predictability."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-expects-first-doses-of-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-by-midapril-101615292590205.html

09-03-2021||World||EU says Russian disinformation campaign set Germany as its main target||Germany is the top target of Russian disinformation campaigns in the European Union, a report said on Tuesday, as ties between Moscow and the West hit new lows over the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.The EU's disinformation watchdog, which is run by the bloc's External Action Service, said in the report it had documented 700 cases of deliberately fake or misleading reporting that aimed to spread disinformation about Germany since launching a tracking database in late 2015.That compares to more than 300 cases for France, over 170 for Italy and 40 for Spain, said the watchdog, which was set up after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and aims to combat what it sees as a deliberate smear campaign by Russia."Germany is singled out as the main target for Russian disinformation efforts among European member states," said the watchdog, which is called EUvsDisinfo.EUvsDisinfo said the Kremlin was trying to portray Germany as a country driven by "irrational Russophobia" to draw attention away from Russia's violations of human rights and international law."(Russia's approach) intends to create uncertainty, sow discord, give Russian officials for manoeuvre... The Kremlin doublespeak exploits Europe's, and Germany's commitment to dialogue," the report said.SanctionsGermany was among EU countries advocating for more sanctions on Russia over the case of Navalny, who received medical treatment in Berlin and recovered in the Black Forest after being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent last year.Navalny, an anti-corruption activist, says the Kremlin was behind the attack, which Moscow denies. He was arrested after returning to Moscow from Germany in January and is now serving a new jail sentence in a Russian penal colony.The EU last month agreed to blacklist four senior Russian officials over the Navalny case, adding to economic sanctions it had earlier slapped on Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin's support of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.EUvsDisinfo said Russia had depicted Germany as instrumental in driving the new sanctions that followed a trip by the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, to Moscow in February.While Borrell called for Navalny's release, he also played up the need for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Russia in areas such as climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. During his visit, however, Moscow expelled four EU diplomats, including one from Germany.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany, has long been critical of Moscow's human rights record, but Berlin has resisted US pressure to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that would pump more Russian gas to Europe via Germany.EU leaders will discuss next steps in their troubled relationship with Russia at a summit on March 25-26.

09-03-2021||World||US sanctions on Syria challenge rapprochement, says UAE minister||Sweeping US sanctions against the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad undermine regional rapprochement efforts that could help settle the Syrian conflict, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday.In a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart in Abu Dhabi, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan pushed for “joint action with Syria,” saying that the American economic pressure campaign “as it is today makes the matter difficult.”He further pushed for the reinstatement of war-torn Syria in the 22-member Arab League and noted the government and private sector “could play a role” in returning Syria “to normal” after years of ruinous war.Sheikh Abdullah's remarks underscore shifting regional dynamics as the 10-year anniversary of Syria's civil war looms next week. The United Arab Emirates had supported the Syrian opposition during the early years of the war.But as the Syrian army recaptured most of the territory from the opposition, the UAE and other Arab countries made openings toward Assad's government. In 2018, the UAE reopened its embassy in Damascus, for the first time since the start of an organized Arab diplomatic boycott in 2011.Syria near-complete isolation has increased since the Trump administration in 2019 enacted legislation known as the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. The sanctions, which US officials said aimed to hold “accountable the Assad regime for atrocities it has committed against its own people,” target Assad, his close circle of associates and family, senior security officials and troops as well as the Central Bank and any institutions believed to have played a role in the violence in the war in Syria.While Assad may have won the military war against his opponents with the help of backers Russia and Iran, he faces an even bigger challenge of governing while more than 80% of his people live in poverty.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov did not elaborate on the Syrian conflict at the press conference beyond saying that Russia “supports a political settlement” there, as well as in war-scarred Libya and Yemen.In Libya, the UAE and Russia provided military aid to east-based Libyan commander Khalifa Hifter as his forces battled the UN-recognized government for control of the country's capital last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-on-syria-challenge-rapprochement-says-uae-minister-101615291590878.html

09-03-2021||World||UK stocks: FTSE 250 up 18%, beats major global benchmarks||Investors have done well out of the UK reopening trade. The reversal in fortune for many domestically-focused stocks has been sharp. But the easy money has probably already been made.Since Nov. 6, the last trading day before Pfizer Inc. cheered the world with positive Covid-19 vaccine results, UK stocks have performed strongly. The FTSE 250 index, traditionally seen as a better domestic indicator than the FTSE 100, is up 18%. It’s beaten most major international benchmarks in local currency terms. Across both indices, stocks with at least two-thirds of their sales coming from the UK have done even better, rising on average 25%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Within that group, cyclical sectors like financials and housebuilders have shone.The more recent gains here reflect the UK’s aggressive vaccine rollout. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a timetable for ending lockdown, starting with schools resuming in-person this week. But the upswing is mainly a reflection of just how badly the UK’s largely services economy got hit by the pandemic: The FTSE 250 was among the worst performing indices when the virus struck. The bounce-back simply puts it on par with the wider European stock market in terms of valuation and performance since late February 2020. The UK plans to lift all restrictions on social contact by late June, depending on the trajectory of infection rates. Stocks moved more in anticipation of this than after the aspiration was announced last month. Much now depends on earnings forecasts ticking higher if stock gains are to continue. Yet it remains unclear what lasting damage the pandemic will inflict on the UK economy. Frictions imposed by Brexit, currently out of the headlines, could starting creeping into corporate commentary.Also read: Sunak delivers crisis Budget to rescue Covid-hit UK economyWhat about sterling? It’s been a beneficiary of getting a Brexit deal finally done, and this has amplified recent returns on British assets for overseas investors. The stability of the currency has doubtless removed a deterrent against international investors buying UK stocks, but even amid prevailing dollar weakness, it may not be positive incentive to do so.Of course, there are still good arguments for UK equities as a whole, including the more internationally focused large-cap stocks: They remain very cheap on a relative basis. Higher government bond yields driven by global economic recovery would favor markets with weightings to so-called value sectors like the UK’s, over the more growth-oriented US, as strategists at Citigroup Inc. point out. The FTSE 100 is on 15 times forward earnings; the S&P 500 22 times. It’s a defense based largely on London’s dull “old economy” composition.But tellingly, the M&A market has so far shown little enthusiasm for pure-UK stocks. The companies that buyout firms have been picking off have some reopening appeal but generate only a minority of their revenue in their home market — mid-cap stocks like security firm G4S Plc, private jet refueller Signature Aviation Plc and Aggreko Plc, which rents out power generators for events. The revaluation of UK domestic stocks has been rapid in recent weeks. The longer term challenges they face haven’t gone away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-stocks-ftse-250-up-18-beats-major-global-benchmarks-101615281223782.html

She was freed in exchange for the release of three Iranians who were held in Thailand.“It’s extreme solitary confinement room designed to break you. Its’ psychological torture. You go completely insane. It is so damaging. I would say I felt physical pain from the psychological trauma I had in that room. It’s 2-meter by 2-meter box,” Moore-Gilbert told Sky News.“There were a few times in that early period that I felt broken. I felt if I had to endure another day of this, you know, if I could I’d just kill myself. But of course, I never tried and I never took that step,” she added.Moore-Gilbert was a Melbourne University lecturer on Middle Eastern studies when she was picked up at the Tehran airport as she tried to leave the country after attending an academic conference in 2018. She was sent to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, convicted of spying and sentenced to 10 years.

09-03-2021||World||Chinese generals urge more spending to prepare for US conflict 'trap'||China must boost military spending to prepare for a possible confrontation with the US, top generals said, in an unusual acknowledgment of the risk of a clash between the world’s two largest economies.The two generals -- members of the Central Military Commission led by President Xi Jinping -- made the comments during the annual national legislative session in Beijing. CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang, China’s top uniformed officer, said the country needed to brace for a “Thucydides Trap,” an inevitable conflict between a rising power and an established one.“Facing the ‘Thucydides Trap’ and border disturbances, the military must step up its efforts to improve its capabilities,” Xu said Friday, although the transcript wasn’t released until later. “The most important thing is internal unity and cohesion and improvement of overall capabilities. If you are strong, you will have long-term stability, as well as invincibility.”Xu’s reference to “border disturbances” may be an allusion to China’s deadly clash with India last year, as well as territorial disputes in the South and East China seas. Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, who also sits on the CMC, said separately that “containment and counter-containment will be the main tone of bilateral ties between China and US”Chinese president Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that the country’s security situation faces “relatively big instability and uncertainty” at a group discussion during the legislative session, without elaborating, state broadcaster CCTV reported. He urged the army to coordinate priorities of military construction and war preparedness, and to get ready to “face up to various kinds of complexities and difficulties at any time.”The remarks represented a rare admission from China about the growing risk of a confrontation with the US after escalating disputes under President Donald Trump over everything from trade to Taiwan. Chinese leaders have repeatedly played down the risk a Thucydides Trap, with Xi saying during 2015 a visit to the U.S. that such a conflict wasn’t inevitable so long as countries avoided strategic miscalculations.A national security strategy document released last week by US President Joe Biden affirmed Trump’s designation of China as a “strategic competitor.” The strategy seeks to put less emphasis on using the American military to resolve conflicts and pledges to work with “like-minded countries” to forge a common approach to Beijing.The “Thucydides Trap” refers to ancient Greek historian Thucydides’ explanation of the Peloponnesian War as an inevitable clash between a rising Athens and the established regional power, Sparta. The term was coined by Graham Allison, a professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, who argued that China would threaten to displace U.S. influence, possibly resulting in an unhealthy rivalry or armed conflict.Xi has vowed to make China a great military power, pledging to complete the modernization of the armed forces by 2035 and build a world-class military capable of winning wars across all theaters by 2050. China projected defense spending growth of 6.8% this year, up from 6.6% last year, the slowest pace in three decades.Wei, the defense minister, said struggles over containment efforts would “last throughout the whole process of China’s national rejuvenation.”“China’s national security has entered a phase of high risks. Tasks are mounting for the defense sector and military,” Wei said, adding China “must comprehensively strengthen training and preparedness for war and improve the strategic capability to win over strong enemies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-generals-urge-more-spending-to-prepare-for-us-conflict-trap-101615289379204.html
09-03-2021||World||China has breached all provisions of UN Genocide Convention in Xinjiang: Report||The Chinese government’s actions against Uyghurs in Xinjiang have breached every provision of the UN Genocide Convention, according to a new report by more than 50 experts in international law, genocide and war crimes. Azeem Ibrahim, co-author of the report released on Tuesday by Washington-based think tank Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said there is overwhelming evidence to support the allegation of genocide. The report estimates between 1-2 million people have been detained in some 1,400 extrajudicial internment facilities created in Xinjiang since 2014. It also details allegations of sexual assault, forcible sterilisation, psychological torture, brainwashing and an unknown number of deaths in these camps. “Uyghur detainees within the detention sites are systematically tortured, subjected to sexual violence, including rape, and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment, deprived of their basic human needs, and severely humiliated,” the report said. The report’s findings are largely in line with assessments by the US state department, which said in December 2018 that Chinese authorities had detained more than 2 million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities in internment camps since 2017. The report by Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, which was founded as a nonpartisan think tank in 2019 by Fairfax University of America, is being seen as possibly the first independent analysis of the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang. Also Read | China rakes up India’s ban on apps, FDI curbs at WTOBeijing has denied all allegations of rights abuses and defended its actions in Xinjiang as necessary to combat radicalisation and terrorism in the region following a string of attacks. Chinese officials have described the detention camps as “vocational training centres” that are part of a poverty alleviation campaign. Foreign minister Wang Yi told a news conference last week that the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang are “preposterous”. China is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948, and Article II of the convention defines genocide as acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. These acts include killing members of the group, causing bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group “conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”, imposing measures to prevent births within the group, and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. The Newslines Institute’s report, which was prepared in cooperation with the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, concluded that the evidence available shows “China is responsible for breaches of each provision of Article II of the [Genocide] Convention”. “In this context, the Head of State, President Xi [Jinping], launched a ‘People’s War on Terror’ in the region and made the Uyghur-concentrated areas the front line, arguing that extremism has taken root in Uyghur society. Camp guards reportedly follow orders to uphold the system in place until ‘Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and other Muslim nationalities, would disappear...until all Muslim nationalities would be extinct’,” the report said. “High-level officials gave orders to ‘round up everyone who should be rounded up,’ ‘wipe them out completely…destroy them root and branch,’ and ‘break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections and break their origins.’ Officials have likened the mass internment campaign to eradicating tumours and even uprooting weeds hidden among crops, which require spraying ‘chemicals to kill them all’,” the report added. The report further said: “The intent to destroy the Uyghurs as a group is further demonstrated by the comprehensive government policies and programs directed at erasing all aspects of Uyghur identity, community, and domestic life, and institutionalising Uyghur children in state-run orphanages. “Pursuant to these government campaigns, local authorities have eliminated Uyghur education, destroyed ethnically distinct Uyghur architecture and household features, and damaged or completely demolished the majority of mosques and sacred sites, while closing off other sites or converting them into commercial spaces, and destroying essential elements of Uyghur identity and communal bonds.” The report is supported by some of the world’s most respected legal authorities, such as Baroness Helena Kennedy, Irwin Cotler and ambassador David Scheffer. Ibrahim said: “This is the first independent expert legal analysis that applies the Genocide Convention to the available evidence. China’s intent to destroy the Uyghurs is more evident than previously understood based on explicit statements, state policy, directives and legal regulations originating at the highest level of State, President Xi, who has vowed to continue these policies for years to come as recently as a September 2020 conference setting the policy direction for the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-breached-provisions-of-un-genocide-convention-in-xinjiang-report-101615289722524.html
09-03-2021||World||Loyalty to CCP will decide if Hong Konger is 'patriot', says Chinese official||Loyalty to China's Communist Party will be key to deciding if a Hong Konger is a "patriot", a senior Chinese official said Tuesday, as Beijing draws up new laws to vet the finance hub's politicians.China has acted to quash dissent in semi-autonomous Hong Kong after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations swept the city for months in 2019.Its latest plan is to impose sweeping changes to Hong Kong's already limited election system, barring anyone not deemed loyal enough and reducing the influence of the small number of directly elected positions.Dubbed "patriots governing Hong Kong", Beijing says the changes are needed to restore stability and to plug loopholes that accommodate "anti-China" forces.Critics see it as another nail in the coffin for Hong Kong's democracy movement as Beijing presses ahead with a widespread campaign against dissent.China's rubber-stamp parliament is expected to give first assent to the new proposals on Thursday.As Hong Kongers wait to hear details, a senior Chinese diplomat was asked whether patriotism would be defined as loyalty to the Communist Party, like it is on the mainland."When we talk about patriotism, we are not talking about the abstraction of loving a cultural or historical China, but rather loving the currently existing People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party," Song Ru'an, the Deputy Commissioner of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, told reporters."Patriots should respect the Chinese Communist Party," he said."We'll review whether candidates meet that criteria."Also read: Hong Kong minister warns citizens against ‘oblivious’ criticism of China- What is a patriot? -China promised Hong Kong could maintain some autonomy and freedoms under a "One Country, Two Systems" model ahead of its handover from British rule in 1997.The city has its own partially elected legislature, independent courts and free speech protections -- democratic elements not seen on the authoritarian mainland.When they are allowed to vote, Hong Kongers tend to cast ballots for candidates pushing greater democracy or who are critical of Beijing.Song's comments reflect a shift in how China expects Hong Kong politicians to act.The term "patriots governing Hong Kong" was coined in 1984 by China's then reformist leader Deng Xiaoping as a way to calm fears ahead of the handover that the city's political pluralism would be quashed.Patriots, Deng argued, must accept Hong Kong is part of China and support its future prosperity -- but they need not be party loyalists."Those who meet these requirements are patriots, whether they believe in capitalism or feudalism or even slavery," Deng said. "We don't demand that they be in favour of China's socialist system; we only ask them to love the motherland and Hong Kong."But under President Xi Jinping, China has taken a markedly authoritarian turn and adopted a much less flexible definition of the term "patriots".After Beijing imposed a sweeping security law on the city last year, many of Hong Kong's most prominent dissidents are in jail, face prosecution or have fled overseas.Song said China was not trying to create a "monolithic government" in Hong Kong."Hong Kong is a pluralistic society where there is a blend of Chinese and Western culture," he said."But anyone who challenges the fundamental system of the state and undermines Hong Kong's constitutional order does not count as a true patriot," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loyalty-to-ccp-will-decide-if-hong-konger-is-patriot-says-chinese-official-101615281027363.html

The House of Representatives must still pass the Senate version of the package for it to become law.Also read: US Senate approves $1.9 tln bill, oil prices rise on global economic recoveryBrent prices have pulled back from Monday's high above $70 per barrel. Prices rose after Yemen's Houthi forces fired drones and missiles at the heart of the Saudi oil industry, including a Saudi Aramco facility at Ras Tanura vital to petroleum exports.Riyadh said there were no casualties or loss of property.The United States expressed alarm at "genuine security threats" to Saudi Arabia from Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis and elsewhere in the region, and said it would look at improving support for Saudi defences.The attacks came after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and their oil producing allies, known as OPEC+, agreed last week agree on broadly sticking with output cuts despite rising crude prices.Also supporting prices, US crude oil and refined product stockpiles likely fell last week, with distillate inventories seen drawing down for fifth straight week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disruption-in-oil-supply-from-saudi-arabia-causes-us-oil-prices-to-fall-101615281111379.html

The issues that Meghan has raised of racism and mental health are really serious issues,” said Starmer."It is a reminder that too many people experience racism in 21st-century Britain. We have to take that very, very seriously. Nobody, but nobody, should be prejudiced (against) because of the colour of their skin or because of their mental health issues,” he said, when asked about the controversy during a visit to a school in east London.“This is bigger than the royal family. For too many years we have been too dismissive and too willing to put these issues to one side," he added.Asked by Oprah Winfrey whether there were concerns among royals that her child would be "too brown" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: "If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."Harry and Meghan refused to name individuals behind the alleged racist comments but Winfrey later told CBS, the US network which broadcast the interview, that off camera Harry had stressed that “neither his grandmother [Queen] nor grandfather [Prince Philip] was part of that conversation”.The allegations have prompted widespread speculation over which royal may have made the comments.In the two-hour interview shot near Harry and Meghan’s new home in California, Winfrey asked them about their decision to step back as frontline royals and whether they have any regrets about moving away.While Harry said he felt relieved that he had been able to protect his wife and children, as the couple await the birth of a baby girl in the coming months, Meghan said she regretted that she had trusted the “institution” of the monarchy when they had assured her that they would protect her from false media attacks.The former actress’ revelations about her mental health struggles, which involved thoughts about not wanting to be “alive anymore”, have attracted the maximum reaction on social media and other channels."It's vital that when people reach out for support or share their experiences of ill mental health that they are treated with dignity, respect and empathy," mental health charity Mind said, in response to attacks on Meghan’s interview.Prince Harry expressed hurt that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan about the "colonial undertones" of news headlines and articles."No one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts," he said.Meghan also told Winfrey she felt betrayed by her father Thomas Markle's conduct in the run up to their wedding in 2018.Thomas Markle told ITV on Tuesday that the interview was the first time he had heard his daughter speak for several years."I'm very disappointed about it. I've apologised about this thing, what happened, at least 100 times or so," he said.Opinion among the general public in the UK following the interview has been mixed. A new YouGov poll, carried out before the show was aired in full on British television, asked people whether they thought the interview was appropriate or inappropriate. Around 47% said it was inappropriate, while 21% said it was appropriate and 31% didn't know.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buckingham-palace-silent-in-turmoil-after-meghan-harry-s-tell-all-interview-101615287908200.html

09-03-2021||World||'Could mean end of democracy': Critics decry Hong Kong voting system||Beijing's plans to change Hong Kong's electoral system will protect the city's international role, a senior Chinese official said on Tuesday, as critics decry the move as an end of democratic hopes in the former British colony.Deputy Commissioner of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong Song Ru'an told reporters the proposed changes were an internal matter for China and were needed to "close obvious loopholes and deficiencies" in the city's political system.China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is expected to approve on Thursday a resolution that will reduce democratic representation in Hong Kong institutions and vet any candidates for "patriotism".The measures will tweak the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislature and the electoral committee selecting the chief executive further in favour of pro-Beijing figures. The committee will also be given powers to select many legislators.It was "solely China’s internal affair on how to design and improve the system," Song said, adding "destabilising forces" had taken advantage of "loopholes" in the past.Critics have decried Beijing's moves as the end of democratic dreams in the former British colony, whose mini-constitution states universal suffrage as its goal.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Also read: Hong Kong minister warns citizens against ‘oblivious’ criticism of ChinaOnly half of its legislature is currently picked through democratic vote, a proportion which will shrink under the new system. Other seats in the legislature and the electoral committee taken by lower-level, democratically elected district council officials, are expected to be scrapped.The changes to the electoral system follow a series of moves by Beijing to reassert its control over China's most restive city and set it on an increasingly authoritarian path.China imposed a sweeping national security law in June 2020 and authorities have since arrested most high-profile opposition politicians and activists for offences under the new law or related to the 2019 protests.Song said China wanted to create a new "democratic" electoral system, which will "fully respect" the public's democratic rights.

09-03-2021||World||Hong Kong minister warns against ‘Oblivious’ criticism of china||Hong Kong’s top legal official warned residents to steer clear of criticisms of the government that stray too far from the facts, as officials defend Beijing’s plan to overhaul the city’s elections.Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng said in an interview Tuesday that opinions were “no more than an utterance of no value” if the facts weren’t established. Cheng was answering a question about what kind of criticism would be legal in the former British colony as Beijing implements a range of legal changes including a national security law and the electoral overhaul.“Some of the statements that are sometimes uttered, that we hear, are actually not based on facts, or perhaps oblivious of the facts that exist,” Cheng told Bloomberg Television. “And I think that is what one has to be very careful not to embark upon.”@EngleTV asks Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng on @BloombergTV.'One must not use fake news and an opinion that is not fact-based,' she says. Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong are fanning out to defend the most significant changes to the city’s political system since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Chinese lawmakers are expected to approve a sweeping electoral overhaul later this week that will require future candidates for elected office to be “patriots” and secure nominations from a pro-Beijing committee.An official in China’s Foreign Ministry office in Hong Kong provided the clearest definition yet of what that quality entails, saying: “Patriots should respect the Chinese Communist Party.”“Anyone who challenges the fundamental system of the state and undermines Hong Kong’s constitutional order does not count as a true patriot,” said Song Ru’an, a deputy commissioner in the office.Beijing’s moves, including its imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong outlawing speech deemed subversive or secessionist, have been criticized by the US and UK as a violation of China’s treaty commitment to maintain the city’s “high degree of autonomy.” On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, including Senators Ed Markey and Mitt Romney, called on the Biden administration to work with allies and partners to support the people of Hong Kong.Cheng, who was among senior officials sanctioned by the US Treasury in August on allegations of “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy,” on Tuesday reiterated the government’s argument that the security law had restored stability. “Please look at the actual facts and then see what’s happening in Hong Kong,” she said in response to the lawmakers’ statement.Hong Kong authorities have so far arrested 100 people on allegations of violating the security law, with most accused of participating in some form of political activity, such as displaying banners or posting in support of the city’s independence. The total includes 47 opposition figures charged last week with “conspiracy to commit subversion” over their aborted “35-plus” election campaign last year to win a majority on the Legislative Council and force Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign by voting down her budget.The electoral overhaul would go further by making it harder to for such opposition politicians to seek and win office, effectively ending the only open elections under Beijing’s rule. Lam said Monday that the proposal being drafted behind closed doors in Beijing would be locally enacted without the usual public consultation process.“The political structure is no longer ensuring the governance of the -- the efficacy of -- of the whole administration into a proper efficient way that serves the people in Hong Kong,” Cheng said. “And it is for that reason that the National People’s Congress sees the pressing need for that to be taken.”Cheng, who sits on the security committee established by the law, declined to explain why “35-plus” campaign constituted subversion, saying she couldn’t comment on specific cases. “We should move away from this topic and talk about other things, because we cannot talk about a case,” Cheng said.She also rejected as “totally absurd” criticism that the national security law had undermined the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary. “There is no threat on the judicial independence -- and I say it loud and clear and with confidence,” Cheng said.In December, the Communist Party’s People Daily newspaper published a commentary warning that the government could transfer media tycoon Jimmy Lai’s foreign collusion case to mainland courts after a decision to grant him bail. Lai was later sent back to jail after Hong Kong’s highest court affirmed a higher standards for releasing security law suspects before trial.The security law lets Cheng issue certificates requiring some cases to be tried without a jury, a power that local media including the South China Morning Post say she exercised to prosecute an activist accused of driving a motorcycle into a group of police officers in July. Cheng said the power would be “exercised independently and fairly and without any interference” and that a three-judge panel would uphold defendants’ rights.“One talks about ‘no jury’ as if it’s something that is such a big, worrying thing,” Cheng said. “We’re going to write down the reasons, and the, and the findings of fact and the legal basis upon which the conclusion of the verdict -- be it convict or acquit -- is going to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-minister-warns-against-oblivious-criticism-of-china-101615287537039.html

The government said that 316 of the injured have been discharged and 299 remain in care in various hospitals in the city.More than 60 people were also rescued from under the rubble by the civil protection corps and fire service, the government said.President Teodoro Obiang Nguema said the government will hold an emergency meeting to look into how victims can quickly receive aid from Equatorial Guinea before international aid arrives.Investigations into the blast have begun, he said in a Tuesday statement.The president initially the explosion was due to the “negligent handling of dynamite” in the military barracks and the impact damaged almost all the homes and buildings in Bata.The vice president, who is also charged with defense and security, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, said Tuesday that investigations so far showed the fire may have begun when a farmer set fire to his plot to prepare it for food production and a breeze spread the flames to the nearby barracks where the high-caliber ammunition was stored.Images shown on state TV showed plumes of smoke rising above the explosion site as crowds fled. Roofs of houses were ripped off.Equatorial Guinea, an oil-rich West African country of 1.3 million people located south of Cameroon, was a colony of Spain until it gained its independence in 1968.

It said on February 27 it was reducing its presence in the country amid concerns about violence and would pull its offshore exploration team - just one week after saying drilling would not be affected.This week, fashion giant H&M, which has around 45 direct suppliers in Myanmar and is also a signatory to the statement, said it had paused new orders from the country due to transport and manufacturing disruptions.H&M is not, however, taking any immediate decision on its long-term future in Myanmar."We fully recognise the complexities ... in balancing different aspects to ensure that the people in Myanmar are not negatively affected," said Serkan Tanka, Myanmar country manager at H&M.One large global firm has already made a dramatic exit. Kirin Holdings Co is winding up a beer alliance with a military-linked company after coming under pressure from activist groups.Escalating violence, which has seen more than 50 protesters killed, is only adding to the uncertainty facing companies anxious about reputational risk."If this goes on for months, more would probably just totally leave," said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.RISKY BUSINESSOperating in Myanmar has long been a wrestle between high risk and potential high reward for foreign business.The opening up of one of Asia's last frontier markets in 2011 after half a century of military rule led to a surge in foreign direct investment. Net inflows peaked at $4.7 billion in 2017 compared with $900 million in 2010, according to the World Bank.But even before the coup, firms were grappling with crumbling infrastructure, constant power disruptions, legal uncertainty and an economy controlled in large parts by the military.While all foreign firms will be assessing and will be assessed over their next moves, energy companies - some of the longest standing foreign investors in Myanmar - are particularly likely to come under further pressure.The United Nation's human rights investigator on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a report last week that countries should impose sanctions on Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is now controlled by the military and represents its largest source of revenue.Total, which has been in Myanmar since 1992, and Chevron have a large offshore gas project in partnership with MOGE. A Chevron spokesperson said it will comply with all applicable laws and sanctions. Total declined comment on the threat of sanctions.Telecom and internet companies too are in a difficult position as they deal with intermittent shutdowns of services and new amendments to cyber laws that threaten human rights.Norway's Telenor, which has a mobile licence in Myanmar, said on Monday that the amendments broaden the powers of the military and reduce civil liberties, calling for the restoration of a sound legal framework in Myanmar.Facebook on Feb. 2 banned the Myanmar military from using its Facebook and Instagram platforms.Just how corporates should respond to Myanmar's challenges is a matter of hot debate.Chris Sidoti, an expert on Myanmar who was part of a UN-led fact-finding mission in 2019, says all foreign firms should suspend their businesses in Myanmar because the military has taken over every facet of government.Rights group Burma Campaign UK has called on Western brands to be diligent with who they work with but not to abandon Myanmar workers. Nearly half a million people in Myanmar are employed in factories producing textiles for retailers like H&M, Adidas, Gap and Zara.John Bray, director at business consultancy Control Risks, said that pressure on firms in Myanmar needed to be guided by an assessment of "complicity"."If you are providing a service for the Myanmar people, which they are paid for and which promotes the development of the economy, I don't think you're complicit in what is going on in the streets," said Bray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-land-of-promise-to-pariah-state-myanmar-coup-rattles-foreign-firms-101615286342862.html

EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations with a vaccine maker if at least four member countries request it.Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets Sputnik V abroad, told Italian television on Sunday it was collaborating with pharmaceutical company Adienne to produce the vaccine in Italy.The Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce later said there were plans for production to start in Italy in June and that the deal paved the way to create the first Sputnik V production facility in Europe.EMA earlier this month said it would review data from ongoing trials of the vaccine until there was enough evidence for a formal marketing authorisation application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developers-of-sputnik-v-question-neutrality-of-eu-regulator-demand-apology-101615286121844.html

Emergency Service arrived on the scene after the school administrative body dialled 911. "The school was immediately evacuated and students were transferred to the bus garage," the tweet read.All Newaygo County schools went into lockdown in compliance with the county's emergency operations plan until authorities determined there were no further threats to students, CNN further stated.Michigan State Police spokesperson Michelle Robinson, told the CNN reporters that their initial investigation said the student had no ill intent and did not intend to detonate the device.The 16-year-old was rushed to the hospital for moderate to severe injuries, while the four other students were taken to the hospital by their parents for minor injuries. The classroom teacher also went to the hospital, as the explosion involved smoke and there was concern about the chemicals potentially used in the device, Robinson said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms were on scene to assist with identifying what kind of material was involved in the explosion and the circumstances contributing, tweeted the state police.The incident is being investigated by the Newaygo Police Department and the Michigan State Police Hart Post with the full assistance of Newaygo Public School staff. An update of the ongoing investigation will be provided on the same tweet, promised the Michigan State Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-16-year-old-student-accidentally-detonates-explosive-in-class-5-injured-101615283514484.html
09-03-2021||World||EU to go ahead with tech tax with or without Joe Biden||European Union leaders are poised to affirm their commitment to a unilateral tax on tech giants if they fail to agree on a global framework with partners, including Joe Biden’s US administration, by the middle of this year.Over a summit later this month, leaders will “stress the need to urgently address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy to ensure fairness and effectiveness,” according to an early draft of a joint communique seen by Bloomberg. While vowing to work on “a consensus-based solution by mid-2021,” leaders will “confirm readiness to move forward if a global solution is not forthcoming,” according to the draft, which is still subject to change.Frustrated by the slow progress in international negotiations on rules of taxing profits, several EU countries already implemented or planned levies on the revenue of companies such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the jurisdictions where they operate. Those so-called digital services taxes sparked a dispute with former President Donald Trump‘s administration, which lined up retaliatory sanctions.Past efforts to reach consensus on similar levies have failed in the EU, where unanimity is required among all 27 members states. Some countries have insisted the bloc should first give more time to the global negotiations on tax rules at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Signs of progress emerged last month when the US dropped a key demand in negotiations, lifting a barrier that raised transatlantic trade tensions and prevented an international deal.US ConcessionIn a video summit in February, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told her counterparts at a meeting of financial officials from the Group of 20 that the US is no longer insisting on a so-called safe harbor rule that would allow US companies to opt out of new tax rules.Despite the move by Biden’s administration, there is still some distance to go to get a global deal on how to tax global tech giants. Beyond the issue of safe harbor, the US and Europe have long been at odds over the scope of any new rules and how they should be enforced.The EU’s executive arm is due to present it’s plans for a digital tax as soon as next month with the proceeds going to the bloc’s budget, including repayments on the jointly backed debt issued to fund the Covid economic recovery plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-go-ahead-with-tech-tax-with-or-without-joe-biden-101615283268673.html

EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations with a vaccine maker if at least four member countries request it.The Italian-Russian chamber of commerce said in a statement issued on Monday, a public holiday in Russia, that the move paved the way for the creation of the first Sputnik V production facility in Europe.It said there were plans for Italian production to begin in June and that it hoped that 10 million doses of Sputnik V could be produced there by the end of the year."This agreement is the first of its kind with a European partner," Vincenzo Trani, head of the chamber, said in the statement. "It can be called a historic event, which is proof of the good state of relations between our countries and shows that Italian companies can see beyond political differences."The Lugano-based Adienne Pharma & Biotech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kirill Dmitriev, head of the RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets Sputnik V internationally, told Italy's RAI 3 television channel on Sunday that many Italian regions were keen to produce the vaccine and that RDIF had struck an agreement with Adienne to produce Sputnik in Italy."...What we are offering is a true production partnership that will create jobs in Italy, and you can control the product, because it will be produced in Italy, and this product can not only save many lives in Italy, but it can be exported," he said.A senior European Medicines Agency (EMA) official urged European Union members last week to refrain from approving Sputnik V at the national level while the agency was still reviewing it, prompting the vaccine's developers to demand a public apology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-vaccine-could-be-made-in-europe-for-first-time-after-italy-deal-101615281977265.html

I don't think the British are racist, I think Los Angeles is racist, California is a racist, but I don't think the Brits are," Markle told ITV."The thing about what colour will the baby be or how dark will the baby be. I'm guessing and hoping it's just a dumb question from somebody, you know, it could just be that simple. It could be somebody asked a stupid question. Rather than being a total racist."Thomas Markle said though that the comment should be investigated.

09-03-2021||World||Hong Kong minister warns citizens against ‘oblivious’ criticism of China||Hong Kong’s top legal official warned residents to steer clear of criticisms of the government that stray too far from the facts, as officials defend Beijing’s plan to overhaul the city’s elections.Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng said in an interview on Tuesday that opinions were “no more than an utterance of no value” if the facts weren’t established. Cheng was answering a question about what kind of criticism would be legal in the former British colony as Beijing implements a range of legal changes including a national security law and the electoral overhaul.“Some of the statements that are sometimes uttered, that we hear, are actually not based on facts, or perhaps oblivious of the facts that exist,” Cheng told Bloomberg Television. “And I think that is what one has to be very careful not to embark upon.”Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong are fanning out to defend the most significant changes to the city’s political system since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Chinese lawmakers are expected to approve a sweeping electoral overhaul later this week that will require future candidates for elected office to be “patriots” and secure nominations from a pro-Beijing committee.The moves, including Beijing’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong outlawing speech deemed subversive or secessionist, have been criticized by the U.S. and U.K. as a violation of China’s treaty commitment to maintaining the city’s “high degree of autonomy.”On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, including Senators Ed Markey and Mitt Romney, called on the Biden administration to work with allies and partners to support the people of Hong Kong.Cheng, who was among senior officials sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in August on allegations of “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy,” on Tuesday reiterated the government’s argument that the security law had restored stability. “Please look at the actual facts and then see what’s happening in Hong Kong,” she said in response to the lawmakers’ statement.Hong Kong authorities have so far arrested 100 people on allegations of violating the security law, with most accused of participating in some form of political activity, such as displaying banners or posting in support of the city’s independence. The total includes 47 opposition figures charged last week with “conspiracy to commit subversion” over their aborted “35-plus” election campaign last year to win a majority on the Legislative Council and force Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign by voting down her budget.The electoral overhaul would go further by making it harder to for such opposition politicians to seek and win office, effectively ending the only open elections under Beijing’s rule. Lam said Monday that the proposal being drafted behind closed doors in Beijing would be locally enacted without the usual public consultation process.“The political structure is no longer ensuring the governance of the -- the efficacy of -- of the whole administration into a proper efficient way that serves the people in Hong Kong,” Cheng said. “And it is for that reason that the National People’s Congress sees the pressing need for that to be taken.”Cheng, who sits on the security committee established by the law, declined to explain why “35-plus” campaign constituted subversion, saying she couldn’t comment on specific cases. “We should move away from this topic and talk about other things, because we cannot talk about a case,” Cheng said.She also rejected as “totally absurd” criticism that the national security law had undermined the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary. “There is no threat on the judicial independence -- and I say it loud and clear and with confidence,” Cheng said.In December, the Communist Party’s People Daily newspaper published a commentary warning that the government could transfer media tycoon Jimmy Lai’s foreign collusion case to mainland courts after a decision to grant him bail. Lai was later sent back to jail after Hong Kong’s highest court affirmed a higher standards for releasing security law suspects before trial.The security law lets Cheng issue certificates requiring some cases to be tried without a jury, a power that local media including the South China Morning Post say she exercised to prosecute an activist accused of driving a motorcycle into a group of police officers in July. Cheng said the power would be “exercised independently and fairly and without any interference” and that a three-judge panel would uphold defendants’ rights.“One talks about ‘no jury’ as if it’s something that is such a big, worrying thing,” Cheng said. “We’re going to write down the reasons, and the, and the findings of fact and the legal basis upon which the conclusion of the verdict -- be it convict or acquit -- is going to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-minister-warns-residents-against-oblivious-criticism-of-china-101615275739936.html

The bullet struck near her left eye, went through her neck and lodged in her shoulder.She recovered after months of treatment at home and abroad before co-writing a best-selling memoir titled "I am Malala", which drew even more international attention.Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as a 17-year-old in 2014, sharing the award with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India.She graduated from Britain's Oxford University last year and has since created a digital publication for girls and women, and formed her own TV production company."I believe in the power of stories to bring families together, forge friendships, build movements, and inspire children to dream," she was quoted as saying in Monday's statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malala-signs-deal-with-apple-tv-to-produce-documentaries-on-women-children-101615273016986.html
09-03-2021||World||Texas attorney journal contests Trump ban, Twitter files lawsuit||Twitter has filed a lawsuit against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, claiming the Republican used his office to retaliate against it for banning the account of former President Donald Trump following the riot at the US Capitol.Days after the deadly January insurrection, Paxton announced an investigation into Twitter and four other major technology companies for what he called “the seemingly coordinated de-platforming of the President.” The attorney general's office demanded that the companies produce a variety of records related to their content moderation policies and troves of internal communications.Twitter responded Monday with a federal lawsuit alleging Paxton is seeking to punish it for taking Trump's account offline — a decision the social media company says is protected free speech. It asks a judge to declare the decision to be under the ambit of the First Amendment and to, in essence, halt Paxton's investigation.“Paxton made clear that he will use the full weight of his office, including his expansive investigatory powers, to retaliate against Twitter for having made editorial decisions with which he disagrees,” lawyers for the company wrote in the suit filed in a Northern California court.Also read: 10 US states, including Texas, sue Google for ‘anti-competitive’ online ad salesSpokespersons for Paxton's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening.Twitter’s counterpunch comes as states, in addition to federal lawmakers and governments outside the US, are cracking down on tech companies they see as having amassed too much power in the past decade. This includes antitrust and anti-monopoly regulation, internet privacy laws as well as attempts to regulate how platforms like Twitter, Facebook and others moderate their sites.In December, Paxton led 10 Republican attorneys general in suing Google for allegedly running an illegal digital-advertising monopoly in cahoots with Facebook.GOP politicians in roughly two dozen states have also introduced bills that would allow for civil lawsuits against platforms for what they call the “censorship” of posts. Almost always, this means what they view as the censorship of conservative or Christian religious viewpoints.While there is no evidence that tech companies are biased against conservatives, the narrative has been popular with Republicans since before President Trump was elected and only grew louder throughout his term. Trump getting banned for life from Twitter and suspended temporarily from Facebook after inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riots only reinforced it.In launching his investigation, Paxton cited the First Amendment when he says tech companies’ banishment of Trump “chills free speech” and “wholly silences” those who disagree with them.However, Twitter — as well as the other companies Paxton targeted, including Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon — is a private firm, so the First Amendment does not apply to its decisions on what material to allow on its services. Unlike the government, Twitter is allowed to silence people. The company had long given Trump and other world leaders broad exemptions from its rules against personal attacks, hate speech and other behaviours. But after five people were killed at the Capitol riot, the company said Trump's tweets amounted to glorification of violence while plans were circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.Twitter's suit comes as Paxton is facing other legal challenges, including an FBI investigation into claims that he used his office to benefit a wealthy donor.He is also awaiting trial on unrelated securities fraud charges dating back to 2015. Paxton pleaded not guilty and the case has been stalled for years over legal challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-attorney-journal-contests-trump-ban-twitter-files-lawsuit-101615263504104.html

Justin Riemer said in a letter to Trump’s Save America Political Action Committee in response to Trump’s demanding his name not be used.That includes using his name in materials for its upcoming donor retreat at a hotel near Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach where Trump is expected to participate, Riemer said.Lawyers for Trump have demanded that the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee immediately stop using his “name, image and/or likeness in all fundraising, persuasion, and/or issue speech.”The RNC pushed back a little, saying the party “has every right to refer to public figures as it engages in core, First Amendment-protected political speech, and it will continue to do so” in pursuit of common goals of electing Republican candidates and advancing conservative policies, Riemer said in the letter.A Trump spokesman, Jason Miller, didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Trump has vowed to defeat the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him in January and to help elect GOP candidates in 2022. The demand letter suggests, however, that assistance will be provided on his terms. He has made it clear he wants contributions for those efforts to go to his Save America political action committee and other entities he controls.Also read: US to accept new visa applications by those denied due to Trump 'Muslim ban'The former president issued a statement Monday night saying contributions should be made to Save America and not be given to what many on the right label Rinos, or Republicans in name only.“No more money for Rinos,” Trump said in the statement issued through his PAC. “They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base—they will never lead us to Greatness.”Representatives of the NRCC and NRSC didn’t respond to requests for comment, but the NRSC sent out a fund-raising email on Sunday asking donors to become “Official Trump Defenders” if they “care about protecting President Trump’s legacy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rnc-says-trump-will-allow-his-name-to-be-used-in-fundraising-101615263470184.html
09-03-2021||World||Night raid on Myanmar protesters draws international alarm||Myanmar authorities cordoned off part of the commercial capital of Yangon on Monday night while searching for student protesters, drawing international condemnation as crowds defied a curfew to resist the crackdown.Embassies of the US, UK, Canada, Germany and others sent tweets late on Monday warning that security forces had surrounded a group of young people in the Sanchaung neighborhood of Yangon. People in surrounding areas swarmed the streets as videos of the situation spread on social media.By midnight, there were no reports of deaths from the standoff, the Associated Press reported. Security forces chased crowds, fired stun grenades and harassed residents watching from their windows, it said. Myanmar has regularly shut down the internet in the early-morning hours, making it difficult to get information.Residents said security forces used sound bombs, slingshots, tear gas shells and fired warning shots to disperse several hundred peaceful protesters in the Sanchaung area.“They blocked all the four main roads so these protesters had nowhere to go but to run into nearby apartments and hide inside the apartments with the support of house owners,” said Zaw Moe Aung, a resident. “They were raising their voices very peacefully, chanting to release detained leaders and immediately end the military dictatorship.”The troops, who stayed in the neighborhood late into the night, also threatened to enter home and buildings to search for the demonstrators, according to Myo Win Maung, who witnessed the scenes but eventually left after locals and people from other Yangon neighborhoods poured into the streets to protect the protesters.Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy issued a statement in support of the protesters and decried the violence against them. “We warn against such efforts which must end soonest,” the statement said.“The Embassy is very concerned about reports of many young people being trapped in Sanchaung and other parts of Yangon,” the German Embassy in Yangon said. “We urgently appeal to the security forces to abstain from the use of force and detentions against residents and others, and to let all peaceful protesters return to their homes immediately.”Myanmar’s military government also moved to shutter five local media outlets reporting on the protests. An order from the junta-appointed information minister revoked the licenses of Mizzima, DVB, 7Day News, Myanmar Now and Khit Thit Media, banning them from publishing any content.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing accused media outlets of misleading the international community, saying that security authorities used minimal force against protesters. He put the death toll at 34, about half of the figures reported by local media outlets, according to a broadcast on state-run MRTV.The general also said the detention of Sean Turnell, an Australian economic adviser to detained former leader Aung San Suu Kyi, had revealed some state economic secrets. “We managed to detain Sean Turnell in time when he’s about to leave the country,” Min Aung Hlaing was quoted as saying.Australia, which suspended defense cooperation with Myanmar after the coup, has demanded Turnell’s release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/night-raid-on-myanmar-protesters-draws-international-alarm-101615266976871.html

Only 56% made profits in 2020, the least since the question was polled 19 years ago, with a fifth suffering losses.“With China leading in economic recovery and the new U.S. administration in place, our members are cautiously optimistic regarding business growth in China,” Gilligan wrote in the report.Global business travel disruptions, the inability for expatriate staff to return to China due to government entry restrictions, and uncertainty around business decision-making were the biggest ways in which the pandemic impacted American companies’ operations in China.Despite emerging optimism, bilateral tensions were still seen as the companies’ biggest business challenge, followed by increasing labor costs, competition from private local companies, and inconsistent regulatory interpretation and unclear laws and enforcement.Ensuring a level playing field is the top action Beijing could take to help foreign businesses, the survey shows. Meanwhile, Washington could help by refraining from aggressive rhetoric and tit-for-tat actions. The survey was conducted between October and November last year.Other highlights:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-firms-in-china-see-growth-improved-ties-after-covid-19-pandemic-101615266362833.html
09-03-2021||World||A quick swab and a boarding pass: Israel's El Al launches check-in Covid-19 test||Israel's El Al airlines launched a pilot programme at its Tel Aviv airport check-in counters on Monday to test unvaccinated passengers for Covid-19 before allowing them to board a non-stop flight to New York.Just before stepping up to the counters, 112 of the 280 passengers on flight 003 were required by El Al to undergo a nose swab - a rapid antigen test, with results within 15 to 20 minutes, that detects protein fragments specific to the coronavirus. All 112 passed the test.Airlines have for months been lobbying governments for such measures to prevent people from having to go into quarantine on arrival.With some 40 percent of Israelis over the age of 16 already fully vaccinated after their second dose of Pfizer /BioNTech's vaccine, most of those tested at the airport were children, who under current health guidelines are not given the shots."He was good. He only cried for a second," said the mother of a 10-month-old after the nose swab by a medical team stationed in front of the check-in desk.For 5-year-old Hili Lazarof, the test was "okay".The aim of the test was to ensure no one on the plane carried the coronavirus or could infect others. But masks were still mandatory for the duration of the 12-hour flight."What we are trying to do in this concept is basically taking three layers of protection for the passengers," El Al Chief Executive Avigal Soreq told Reuters.He was referring to government-issued vaccination certificates issued in Israel's world-leading inoculation rollout, PCR tests which all Ben Gurion airport passengers must take up to 72 hours before takeoff, and the rapid-result swab.Such testing could reduce social distancing that limits turnover at airports and cramps passenger comfort, and allow business as usual for duty-free shops and restaurants, said Leehu Hacohen, El Al's vice president for operations."Today's flight is, I think, the first in the world where you will know that you have verified that everyone onboard is certainly clean and non-coronavirus contagious," he told Israel's Army Radio.Some passengers were annoyed they had to have another test after a negative result in their PCR swab, grumbling to ticket agents about a wait that took a bit longer than the promised 15 minutes.But Hodaya Meshita, 27, from Savannah, Georgia said about her rapid test: "It's uncomfortable for a few seconds." She has had only one dose of a two-shot vaccine so far.Soreq said El Al would likely carry out similar swabbing in New York next week and then see whether to add the process to other flights as the airline and Israel's tourism industry struggle to recover from the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-quick-swab-and-a-boarding-pass-israel-s-el-al-launches-check-in-covid-19-test-101615265497771.html
09-03-2021||World||China lays out ambitious five-year targets at National People's Congress||China’s economic planners are used to setting ambitious targets, and its latest five-year plan running to 2025 is no exception. Here are some of the most impressive numbers outlined by the government at its annual National People’s Congress, which kicked off Friday.Research Spending to Rival USChina’s leadership is worried about US sanctions cutting off access to core technologies, and wants to make the economy more dependent on innovation as traditional growth engines like urbanization are slowing. A top priority is increasing spending on research and development, which covers basic scientific research and spending by companies on the development of new products.The government is targeting 7% annual growth in R&D spending through 2025, which would bring its total spending to 3.76 trillion yuan ($580 billion) by the end of the period. That’s more than the $548 billion the US spent in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available.10 Million New Urban Residents a YearChina wants 65% of its population to live in towns and cities by 2025, up from 60.6% in 2019. As the population will stay roughly constant at 1.4 billion over that period, that means about 50 million people will need to move permanently from rural to urban areas over the next five years.Read more: Here’s Everything You Need to Know About China’s NPC So Far84,000 New Doctors a YearThe public health care system is underfunded by developed-world standards. Beijing is targeting a ratio of 3.2 doctors per 1,000 people by 2025, up from 2.9 today. Due to China’s vast population, that means about 420,000 extra physicians need to be trained by then. The government has a pool of more than 9 million new college graduates each year to recruit from.20 New Nuclear ReactorsChina is backing nuclear power as part of its drive to cut carbon emissions. The government aims to have 70 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity by 2025 from about 50 gigawatts at the end of last year. That would equate to about 20 new reactors.New Forests Larger Than South KoreaAs part of its environmental aims, Beijing wants to increase the size of the nation’s forests. Trees soak up carbon dioxide, absorb water and help reduce the flooding that plagues large parts of the country. Huge tree-planting schemes have been common for over a decade, although some are criticized because of their lack of biodiversity.The plan is for forests to cover 24.1% of the country’s total land area by 2025, up from 23.2% in 2019. As China is the world’s third-largest country by area -- being roughly the same size as the US that will mean planting more than 11 million hectares of new forests by 2025, about the same size as the US state of Ohio, and larger than South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lays-out-ambitious-five-year-targets-at-national-people-s-congress-101615255565121.html
09-03-2021||World||Lawyers probing Cuomo have dealt political figures in high profile cases||The lawyers tapped to investigate sexual harassment allegations against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo both have experience handling high-profile cases involving men accused of abusing their power.One of the attorneys, Joon Kim, was a federal prosecutor who directed investigations that sent one of Cuomo's top aides to prison on a bribery conviction and led to the conviction of another on charges connected to a massive economic development project that Cuomo championed.The other investigator, Anne L. Clark, is an employment lawyer who once represented a woman in sexual harassment lawsuit filed against a powerful New Jersey politician.New York Attorney General Letitia James appointed Clark and Kim on Monday to look into accusations against the Democratic governor made by several women, including three former staffers in his administration.“These are serious allegations that demand a rigorous and impartial investigation. We will act judiciously and follow the facts wherever they lead,” Kim said in a statement released by James' office.The allegations include asking questions about the women's love lives and discussing his own, making inappropriate comments about their appearance and, in some cases, subjecting them to unwanted kisses or too-intimate hugs.Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately, and said some of the allegations are false. But he has apologised for engaging in what he called office “banter” that some women “misinterpreted” as flirting. He has said he didn't realize he was making anyone uncomfortable.“The people of New York deserve an exhaustive and independent investigation into these allegations, and I am committed to seeing it through,” Clark said in a statement via James' office. The Associated Press left messages with both Clark and Kim seeking further comment.Kim served as acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York for 10 months in 2017 and 2018, taking over after his predecessor, Preet Bharara, was abruptly fired by President Donald Trump.The office would later be deeply involved in investigating members of Trump's inner circle, including his lawyer Michael Cohen and political strategist Steve Bannon. But during Kim's tenure, its highest-profile cases involved public corruption.Kim held various top posts in the office while it investigated Joseph Percoco, a longtime Cuomo friend and aide whom the governor once likened to a brother.Percoco was convicted in 2018 and is serving a six-year sentence for accepting more than USD 300,000 from companies that wanted to gain influence with Cuomo's administration.Cuomo wasn't accused of wrongdoing, but testimony presented an unflattering picture of his office's inner workings.After Percoco's conviction, Cuomo said there's “no tolerance for any violation of the public trust.” His opponents, meanwhile, said the case showed the governor hadn't done enough to address chronic corruption in state government.Kim also was a key figure in the US attorney's office while it investigated the state's Buffalo Billion high-tech construction project, a probe that led to the conspiracy and wire fraud conviction of a man whom Cuomo once called his “economic guru” — Alain Kaloyeros, a former head of the State University of New York's Polytechnic Institute. He was sentenced in 2018 to 3 1/2 years in prison but has remained free while his case is appealed.Days into his tenure as the acting US attorney, Kim announced prosecutors wouldn't seek criminal charges against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, after investigating whether his administration solicited campaign contributions from people seeking official favors from the city.Kim, who has been in private practice for the last three years, was known in the US attorney's office as being detail-oriented while also having a good sense of humour that people didn't always recognise.Clark is a New York City law firm partner who has handled sexual harassment, disability discrimination and equal pay cases.Among her past clients is a woman who sued former New Jersey state Assembly Speaker Garabed “Chuck” Haytaian, accusing him of repeatedly kissing and groping her against her wishes while she worked for the Assembly in the mid-1990s. Haytaian denied the allegations.The state eventually paid the woman USD 175,000 to settle the case. Haytaian, who also chaired the state Republican Party for a time, later retired from political life.Earlier in Clark's career, she worked for what was then the National Organisation for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund; it's now called Legal Momentum.She was periodically quoted in the media — including about a 1993 Supreme Court case that hinged on whether a Tennessee-based forklift rental company president's sexual innuendos and sexist remarks, which he said were jokes, amounted to an abusive work environment.A lower court had said no, reasoning that the executive's conduct was offensive but wouldn't have been expected to “seriously affect” an employee's psychological well-being.Clark, who wasn't involved in the case, saw it differently: “You shouldn't have to suffer a nervous breakdown before you can make a claim,” USA Today quoted her as saying.The Supreme Court ultimately also disagreed and sent the case back to the lower court to proceed.

09-03-2021||World||Fully vaccinated people can gather without masks, CDC says||Fully vaccinated Americans can gather with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing a mask or social distancing, according to long-awaited guidance from federal health officials.The recommendations also say that vaccinated people can come together in the same way — in a single household — with people considered at low-risk for severe disease, such as in the case of vaccinated grandparents visiting healthy children and grandchildren.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the guidance Monday.The guidance is designed to address a growing demand, as more adults have been getting vaccinated and wondering if it gives them greater freedom to visit family members, travel, or do other things like they did before the Covid-19 pandemic swept the world last year.“With more and more people vaccinated each day, we are starting to turn a corner,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.During a press briefing Monday, she called the guidance a “first step” toward restoring normalcy in how people come together. She said more activities would be ok'd for vaccinated individuals once caseloads and deaths decline, more Americans are vaccinated, and as more science emerges on the ability of those who have been vaccinated to get and spread the virus.The CDC is continuing to recommend that fully vaccinated people still wear well-fitted masks, avoid large gatherings, and physically distance themselves from others when out in public. The CDC also advised vaccinated people to get tested if they develop symptoms that could be related to Covid-19.The CDC guidance did not speak to people who may have gained some level of immunity from being infected, and recovering from, the coronavirus.Officials say a person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of vaccine. About 31 million Americans — or only about 9% of the US population — have been fully vaccinated with a federally authorized Covid-19 vaccine so far, according to the CDC.Authorized vaccine doses first became available in December, and they were products that required two doses spaced weeks apart. But since January, a small but growing number of Americans have been fully vaccinated, and have been asking questions like: Do I still have to wear a mask? Can I go to a bar now? Can I finally see my grandchildren?The guidance was “welcome news to a nation that is understandably tired of the pandemic and longs to safely resume normal activities,” said Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the CDC.“I hope that this new guidance provides the momentum for everyone to get vaccinated when they can and gives states the patience to follow the public health roadmap needed to reopen their economies and communities safely,” said Besser, in a statement.But some said the guidance is too cautious.Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska College of Public Health, said the guidance is reasonable in many respects — with the exception of travel.The CDC did not change its recommendations on travel, which discourages unnecessary travel and calls for getting tested within a few days of the trip. That could seem confusing to vaccinated people hoping to visit family across the country or abroad.“They need to relax travel for those vaccinated” and to immediately publish electronic standards for documents that show whether a person is fully vaccinated, said Khan, who formerly was a leading CDC disease detective.The new guidance also says nothing about going to restaurants or other places, even though governors are lifting restrictions on businesses, said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who formerly was Baltimore’s health commissioner.Wen has said the CDC should have had some kind of post-vaccination guidance ready in January, when some people first began to finish their second doses. And she called the guidance that came out Monday “far too cautious.”“The CDC is missing a major opportunity to tie vaccination status with reopening guidance. By coming out with such limited guidance, they are missing the window to influence state and national policy,” Wen said, in an email.But some people who are fully vaccinated were pleased by Monday's news.Ruth Michienzi was among those receiving her second and final vaccine dose at a pharmacy inside a Stop and Shop supermarket in Woburn, Massachusetts on Monday morning.The 91-year-old resident of nearby Burlington said she’s fine with having to still wear a facemask in public and follow other safety guidelines even after being fully vaccinated.But Michienzi also said she’s excited to finally be able to take off her mask in front of her three great grandchildren. She’s seen them in person since receiving her first shot about a month ago, but has kept her mask on.“I hope they remember me,” she said.“I’ve been doing all of that for a year, and I don’t want that year to be wasted,” Michienzi said of the safety regulations. “I think it’s smart to wait.”A pair of customers, who weren’t in line to receive shots, though, openly groused about the continued restrictions and voiced fears that stricter mandates on travel and socializing would follow, even as more are vaccinated.Grace McShane, 61, of Melrose, also received her second dose Monday at the same supermarket.She says she qualified for the vaccine because she’s high risk, including suffering a heart attack last year. The in-home caregiver said she too was fine with the continued restrictions even after being vaccinated.“Even if you’re vaccinated, it’s better to be safe than sorry. This is the new normal. This is part of life and you just have to adapt to it,” McShane said.She said she’s looking forward to hugging her three grandchildren without having to wear a mask. Her grown children have also been vaccinated as essential workers, she said.“Just cuddle and give them hugs,” McShane said. “That’s all I want to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-people-can-gather-without-masks-cdc-says-101615250241193.html

"It is time we translate our noble commitments into concrete action."She said the United States would take a leading role to combat sexual and gender-based violence around the world and to push for more women to be included in peace talks globally.Under former US President Donald Trump's administration, the United States led a push at the United Nations against the promotion of women's sexual and reproductive rights and health because it sees that as code for abortion. It has opposed such language in UN resolutions.In May, the Trump administration accused the United Nations of using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to promote access to abortion through its humanitarian response to the deadly global outbreak. The United Nations rejected the accusation.The Trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) because it said it "supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization." The United Nations said that was an inaccurate perception.U.S. President Joe Biden intends to restore UNFPA funding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-make-un-debut-as-us-vp-at-gender-equality-meeting-101615249329580.html
09-03-2021||World||Myanmar protesters defy curfew; media outlets ordered shut||Demonstrators in Myanmar’s biggest city came out Monday night for their first mass protests in defiance of an 8 pm curfew, seeking to show support for an estimated 200 students trapped by security forces in a small area of one neighborhood.The students and other civilians earlier took part in one of the many daily protests across the country against the military’s seizure of power last month that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.The military government also placed a major curb on media coverage of the crisis. It announced that the licenses of five local media outlets — Mizzima, DVB, Khit Thit Media, Myanmar Now and 7Day News — have been canceled.“These media companies are no longer allowed to broadcast or write or give information by using any kind of media platform or using any media technology,” it said on state broadcaster MRTV.All five had been offering extensive coverage of the protests, often with livestreaming video online. The offices of Myanmar Now were raided by the authorities Monday before the measure was announced. The government has detained dozens of journalists since the coup, including a Myanmar Now reporter and Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, both of whom have been charged under a public order law that carried a penalty of up to three years in prison.The night's street protests began after police cordoned off part of Yangon’s Sanchaung neighborhood and were believed to be conducting door-to-door searches for those who fled attacks by security forces to seek shelter in the homes of sympathetic strangers.News of their plight spread quickly on social media, and people poured into the streets in neighborhoods all over the city to show solidarity and in hopes of drawing some of the pressure off the hunted protesters. On some streets, they constructed makeshift barricades with whatever was at hand.In the Insein district, they spread across road junctions, singing songs, chanting pro-democracy slogans and banging objects together.The diplomatic missions of the United States, Britain, Canada and the European Union all issued statements urging the security forces to allow the trapped people to return safely to their homes. Although all have been sharply critical of the Feb. 1 coup and police violence, it is unusual for such diplomatic statements to be issued in connection with a specific, ongoing incident.“There is heightened tension caused by security forces surrounding Kyun Taw Road in Sanchaung Township, Yangon. We call on those security forces to withdraw and allow people to go home safely,” said the U.S. Embassy's statement.By midnight Myanmar time, there had been no reports of clashes between police and protesters, although security forces chased crowds, harassed residents watching from windows, and fired stun grenades. They also were some reports of injuries from rubber bullets.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is following developments in the Sanchaung district where “many of those trapped are women, who were peacefully marching in commemoration of International Women’s Day,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.“He calls for maximum restraint and urges for the safe release of all without violence or arrests,” Dujarric said, and for respect of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression for peaceful demonstrators voicing “their hopes and desires for the future of their country."Guterres also called the occupation of a number of public hospitals in Myanmar by security forces “completely unacceptable,” the U.N. spokesman said.The nighttime hours have become increasingly dangerous in Myanmar. Police and army units routinely range through neighborhoods, shooting randomly to intimidate residents and disrupt their sleep, and making targeted arrests.Security forces shot and killed two people in northern Myanmar during the day, local media reported.The Irrawaddy online newspaper said the victims were shot in the head during anti-coup protests in Myitkyina in Kachin State. Graphic video on social media showed protesters backing away from tear gas, responding with rocks and then fleeing after a fusillade of what seemed to be automatic gunfire.Demonstrators hurriedly carried away the injured, including one apparent fatality, a person with a severe head wound. A second body was seen later on a stretcher, his head covered with a cloth.Another shooting death took place in Pyapon, a city about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Yangon.To date, the government's violent crackdown has left more than 50 protesters dead. At least 18 people were fatally shot Feb. 28 and 38 on Wednesday, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office.Security forces also clamped down on anti-coup protesters elsewhere Monday, firing tear gas to break up a crowd of about 1,000 people demonstrating in Pyinmana, a satellite town of the capital, Naypyitaw. The protesters deployed fire extinguishers to create a smokescreen as they fled from authorities.Thousands of protesters who marched in Mandalay, the second-largest city, dispersed on their own amid fears that soldiers and police were planning to break up their demonstration with force.Meanwhile, an armed force from one of Myanmar’s ethnic groups was deployed to protect anti-coup marchers in the wake of a brutal crackdown by the junta.The unit from the Karen National Police Force arrived shortly after dawn to accompany about 2,000 protesters near Myitta in Tanintharyi Region in southeastern Myanmar. They carried an assortment of firearms including assault rifles as they marched ahead of the column down dusty rural roads.The Karen police force is under the control of the Karen National Union, one of many ethnic organizations that have been fighting for greater autonomy from the central government for decades. The KNU employs both political and, through its armed wing, military means to achieve its aims.Large-scale protests have occurred daily in many cities and towns since Myanmar’s military seized power, and security forces have responded with ever greater use of lethal force and mass arrests.On Sunday, police occupied hospitals and universities and reportedly arrested hundreds of people involved in protesting the military takeover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-defy-curfew-media-outlets-ordered-shut-101615249234962.html
09-03-2021||World||In draft deal for Afghan peace, US wants Taliban in interim govt||A draft peace agreement proposed by the US to “jump-start” the peace talks in Afghanistan envisages the formation of a transitional government with the Taliban and includes provisions to prevent terror-related activities on Afghan soil.The draft “Afghanistan Peace Agreement” is the second key document related to the Biden administration’s efforts to push the peace process in Afghanistan that has leaked in recent days, following US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s letter to President Ashraf Ghani on the next steps envisaged by Washington.The draft agreement includes three elements – guiding principles for a new constitution and a new state structure; terms for a transitional government involving the Taliban; and terms for a permanent ceasefire. It includes “options for power-sharing” to facilitate a settlement.Blinken’s letter to Ghani included four elements - asking the UN to convene a meeting of India, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and the US to discuss a unified approach on Afghanistan, asking Turkey to convene a meeting of the Afghan side and the Taliban, getting the Afghan side and the Taliban to agree on ways to speed up discussions on a settlement, and a plan to reduce violence.There was no official word from the Indian side, but people familiar with developments said New Delhi will stick to its position on backing an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process. India wants any eventual outcome to ensure that Afghan soil isn’t used for terror activities, the people said.The US proposal states that a “transitional peace government of Afghanistan” will be formed once the peace agreement is signed and this formation will exist until it “transfers power to a permanent government following the adoption of a new constitution and national elections”.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said, “It is a fraught process, but it also the best possible solution in the available circumstances. There is no real possibility of taking weapons away from the Taliban, and one can look at buying their loyalty to bring them into the mainstream. Variations of this solution have been paraded by other US administrations, but there really is no other solution without economic development,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-draft-deal-for-afghan-peace-us-wants-taliban-in-interim-govt-101615247735379.html
09-03-2021||World||Suicide to racism: Harry, Meghan on royal mess||Prince Harry and his wife Meghan alleged in an explosive interview on Sunday that they encountered racist attitudes and a lack of support that drove the Duchess of Sussex to thoughts of suicide.In a two-hour tell-all interview by Oprah Winfrey, the legendary talk show host, the former royal couple painted a deeply unflattering picture of life inside the royal household, depicting a cold, uncaring institution that they had to flee to save their lives.Meghan told Winfrey that at one point “I just didn’t want to be alive anymore”. She said she sought help through the palace’s human resources department but was told there was nothing it could do. Meghan, 39, admitted that she was naive at the start of her relationship with Harry and unprepared for the strictures of royal life.The former television star, who is biracial, said that when she was pregnant with son, Archie, there were “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born”. Markle clarified she had not heard this conversation herself. “That was relayed to me from Harry from the conversations the family had with him,” she told Winfrey.Harry confirmed the conversation, saying: “I was a bit shocked.” He said he would not reveal who made the comment, though Winfrey said he told her it was not either of his grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II or Prince Philip. Markle said she was told that her son would not be granted a royal title or security even before he was born.“The allegation that there were discussions in the palace about how dark Meghan’s first baby might be is a devastating one,” Jonny Dymond, BBC’s royal correspondent, noted.Harry said he had lived in fear of a repeat of the fate of his mother, Princess Diana, who was covered constantly by the press and died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Harry revealed he currently has a poor relationship with William and said things got so bad with his father that at one point Prince Charles stopped taking his calls. “There is a lot to work through there,” Harry said about his father.Harry and Meghan, known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced they were quitting royal duties last year. The interview was widely seen as their first opportunity to explain their decision.In a rare positive moment in the interview, though, the couple revealed their second child, due in the summer, would be a girl.The palace has not responded to the interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-to-racism-harry-meghan-on-royal-mess-101615246997911.html
09-03-2021||India||CM files nomination from Majuli seat for 1st phase of Assam polls||GUWAHATI The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition alliance led by the Congress are yet to announce their chief ministerial candidates in the elections to the Assam assembly to be held in three phases, starting March 27. The BJP usually names its sitting chief minister as the candidate (something that hasn’t happened only once in recent years), but it hasn’t done so in the case of Sarbananda Sonowal. And all indications are that it is an open field. On Monday, senior party leader Himanta Biswa Sarma, considered a candidate for the top post by some, said the chief minister will be picked by the legislators. On Sunday, state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass said the decision would be taken by the BJP parliamentary board after the election.“ We announce a CM candidate in states where we are not in power, but in those where we are in government, we don’t do that. We will abide by whatever decision the party takes on this,” Dass said. Interestingly, the BJP usually does not announce candidates in states where it is not in power. The BJP announced Manohar Lal Khattar and Devendra Fadavanis as chief ministerial candidates in Haryana and Maharashtra, respectively, for the assembly polls in November-December 2019 (both were sitting chief ministers). In 2018, it announced incumbent Vasundhara Raje as its CM candidate for Rajasthan.Only in the case of Jharkhand in XXXX, did it not announce incumbent Raghbar Das as its chief ministerial candidate. On Friday, when the BJP’s first list of 70 candidates was announced in New Delhi, national general secretary Arun Singh too said a decision on the chief ministerial candidate would be taken by the party’s parliamentary board after the election. The BJP, which came to power in Assam for the first time in 2016, is contesting the polls in alliance with old ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which is contesting 26 seats, and new ally United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL), which will put up candidates in eight constituencies.Sarma had earlier declared that he was not interested in contesting the assembly polls and had intimated his decision to the party leadership. As a caveat, he added that any decision on him contesting would be taken by the party and he would abide by it. When the candidates were announced, his name was on the list, as was Sonowal’s. While Sonowal would be contesting again from Majuli , Sarma will continue with his home constituency of Jalukbari. There is buzz that if Sonowal continues as chief minister for another term, Sarma could be given a place in the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre, or that if Sarma is given charge, Sonowal could head to Delhi. Meanwhile, the Congress-led grand alliance which comprises the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), three Left parties and a newly formed regional party has also decided not to put forward the name of a chief ministerial candidate. Party leaders said there is no unanimity within the Congress, leave alone the larger alliance on a candidate. “Having a CM face is not the issue. We are fighting together to defeat the BJP and provide good governance,” said a senior Congress leader who asked not to be named. The party’s posters feature photographs of Gaurav Gogoi, Sushmita Dev, leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Debabrata Saikia and state Congress chief Ripum Bora , to project a united front.The regional alliance of the Raijor Dal and the Assam Jatiya Parishad, formed last year as an outcome of the violent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in December 2019, have also refrained from naming a CM candidate. While the AJP is headed by Lurinjyoti Gogoi, jailed activist Akhil Gogoi is president of the Raijor Dal.Polling in Assam will be held in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6. Filing of nominations for the first phase on March 27 started on Monday. “There is a tussle between Sonowal and Sarma for the CM’s post and the BJP doesn’t want to risk its election campaign by projecting one or the other as the face for the top post at present. Though the party is quiet on this tug of war between both leaders, it is clearly becoming clear that Sarma is increasingly being projected as someone who can lead the campaign as well as take charge after polls, if required,” said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, political columnist and professor of political science at Gauhati University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-files-nomination-from-majuli-seat-for-1st-phase-of-assam-polls-101615314083527.html

The central agency registered two cases a few weeks back to investigate money laundering, the first on the basis of a transborder drug smuggling network unearthed in Fazilka, Punjab, in 2015, in which 1,800g heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards were seized by police; and the second pertaining to a fake passport racket being run in Delhi. Nine smugglers were sentenced in the Fazilka case in October 2017, including Gurdev Singh, Manjit Singh, Harbans Singh and Subhash Chander, raided by the ED on Tuesday.Khaira, who was present at his Sector 5 bungalow in Chandigarh during the ED raid, denied any wrongdoing. “Those who speak against the government are often targeted by them. It has not happened for the first time. My father and I have been fighting injustice throughout our lives and my crusade continues,” said Khaira, adding that those supporting the farmers’ protest and speaking against the central government were being targeted by the Centre. “There is no question of any money laundering. In fact, I am under debt. I have taken an agriculture loan of ₹2 crore, for which I am paying ₹22 lakh as annual interest,” he said.Khaira was elected to the state assembly in 2017 on an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket but later quit the party and launched his own political outfit. Khaira’s name cropped up in the case in 2017. Although not named in the Punjab police charge sheet, Khaira was issued summons by a Fazilka court on November 30, 2017. He was Punjab’s leader of the opposition as an AAP legislator at that time. However, the Supreme Court granted him relief by quashing the proceedings against him. An ED official, requesting anonymity, said: “Sukhpal Singh Khaira was actively aiding and supporting the gang of international smugglers and enjoying the proceeds of crime”. The lawmaker is likely to be called for questioning at the agency’s Delhi office. After the raids, Punjab MLAs cutting across party lines raised the issue in the state assembly and described the move as “political intimidation” by the Centre.Rebel Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa accused the Centre of using the ED as its “tool against those who speak against it”. Punjab minister Charanjit Singh Channi termed the action as completely wrong and sought a House resolution to condemn it.Rebel AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu dubbed the raid as “unfortunate” and said it amounted to interference in the functioning of the House as raids were conducted without taking the Speaker and the state government into confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-punjab-mla-8-others-over-links-with-drug-syndicate-101615313964075.html
09-03-2021||India||Rajasthan, Centre at odds over supply of Covid-19 vaccine||Jaipur: The Union health ministry on Tuesday said Rajasthan has enough Covid-19 vaccines to continue its vaccination drive hours after the state’s health minister said it has vaccines only for two more days. On Monday, the state health department is believed to have written to the Union health ministry on the same. Rajasthan, which is vaccinating 2.5 lakh people per day, currently is left with only two days of stock, said state health minister Raghu Sharma. Sharma on Tuesday said that the Centre has given the state around 3 million vaccine doses till now and estimated that around 6.7 million people will need to be vaccinated in Phase 2. “We have the vaccine for two days, if we don’t get vaccines, the drive will stop mid-way,” he said. Meanwhile, the Union health ministry clarified that there is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in Rajasthan“There have been some news reports suggesting impending shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses in Rajasthan. The factual position is that there is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccine with the state at present. Rajasthan has been supplied 3.761 million doses and has consumed only 2.428 million doses till yesterday night,” the ministry said in an official release. Sharma said that the state originally received 3 million doses, of which it has used around 2.4 million with around a lakh being wasted. The state has around 5 lakh doses, enough for two more days, he added.He admitted that the state received 85,000 more doses on Tuesday and expects to receive around 670000 doses on Wednesday (that will take the number up to the 3.761 million in the Union ministry’s statement). To be sure, all vaccine sourcing is being managed by the Centre, and doses are sent in tranches to the states. Sharma pointed out that frontline and health care workers vaccinated in Phase 1 will now need second doses and recommended that the “Centre provide the state with buffer stock. We have cold chains and the required infrastructure.” He added that the state is “performing well in vaccination but need vaccines to continue with the momentum”. “I have spoken union minister Harsh Vardhan and apprised him of the situation. He has assured me that he will look into it,” said the health minister.The state has requested the Centre for the supply of 6 million additional Covid-19 vaccines. The Union health ministry added in its statement that it is closely monitoring the Covid-19 vaccine supply of all states and union territories (UTs). The central government has been providing vaccine doses to all the states and UTs as per their requirement and consumption pattern, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-centre-at-odds-over-supply-of-covid-19-vaccine-101615313724024.html
09-03-2021||India||Quad leaders to hold first summit on March 12||New Delhi With leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue set to hold their first summit on March 12, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga on Tuesday pledged to bolster cooperation with Australia and the US to tackle common challenges and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The first virtual summit of the leaders of India, Australia, Japan and the US was announced by the external affairs ministry late on Tuesday night. It will be held about a year-and-half after the Quad was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers in September 2019, and reflects the desire of the group to present a united front to key challenges, including China’s belligerence across the region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden in the “first Leaders’ Summit of the Quadrilateral Framework, being held virtually”, the ministry said in a statement. Besides discussing regional and global issues of shared interest, the leaders will “exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”. The Quad Summit will be an opportunity to exchange views on “contemporary challenges such as resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, and climate change”, the statement added. The leaders will also review efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and “explore opportunities for collaboration in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region”, the statement said without giving details. Reports have suggested that the other members of Quad could invest in India’s vaccine production capabilities to expand the delivery of doses across the region, especially to counter China’s vaccine diplomacy. India is the world’s largest producer of vaccines and has supplied almost 58 million doses to 65 countries, including 7.7 million doses provided as grants. China has pledged to provide more than 460 million doses of its own vaccines to nations across the world but is yet to ramp up actual supplies. Ahead of the Quad Summit, Modi and Suga had a 40-minute phone conversation and agreed to bolster cooperation both bilaterally and through the four-nation group to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The two prime ministers also discussed defence and security cooperation and Suga expressed serious concerns about China’s actions in the area ranging from Hong Kong to East China Sea. Modi and Suga agreed the India-Japan partnership can play a “pivotal role in addressing common challenges”, and emphasised that “their engagement with like-minded countries such as Australia and the US in the form of Quad consultations holds value and agreed that these useful discussions must continue”, the external affairs ministry said. A readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders “shared the recognition that cooperation towards realising a Free and Open Indo-Pacific is becoming increasingly important and to this end, shared the view to steadily advance both Japan-India bilateral cooperation and Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral cooperation”. Suga expressed “serious concerns regarding unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea, China’s Coast Guard Law and the situation in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region”, the Japanese readout said. While exchanging views on the region, the two leaders “confirmed that they have grave concerns over the situation in Myanmar and they would closely work together in this vein”, the readout added. Suga also sought “understanding and cooperation toward the early resolution” of the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. The two leaders welcomed progress on the high-speed rail project in Maharashtra and the signing of a memorandum of cooperation for specified skilled Indian workers to be employed in Japan. They also agreed to celebrate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Japan in 2022, and Modi invited Suga to visit India at the earliest for the annual bilateral summit. The US has taken the lead in organising both the Quad summit and the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the group on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions. During their meeting, the foreign ministers reiterated the Quad’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. The Quad, formed in 2007, was revived in 2017 as a gathering of senior officials. It was upgraded to the ministerial level in 2019, reflecting the desire of the four countries to work more closely on shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and India’s growing comfort with the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-leaders-to-hold-first-summit-on-march-12-101615313603461.html

The country started its vaccination drive from January 16 with priority given to all healthcare and frontline workers in the first phase. The second phase started from March 1 where doses are being administered to people above the age of 60 and those between 45 and 59 years with specific comorbidities.Earlier in the day, Dr PK Mishra, the principal secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chaired a high-level meeting to review the status and progress of the vaccination drives across all states and Union Territories (UTs) in which the states and UTs were asked to take the drive a notch higher by going all out in increasing registration, administration of doses etc.The meeting was attended by the chief secretaries and the officers involved in the vaccination effort in states and UTs, secretaries to the Centre from ministries/ department of health, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, health research, Member (Health), NITI Aayog and the chief executive officer (CEO) of the National Health Authority (NHA), the release added.Mishra lauded all the government officials at the central and state level for playing an important role in the successful rollout of the vaccination drive in India — which is the largest in the world but also pointed out that this progress had to be continued in a sustained manner. The chief secretaries of states and UTs along with senior officials gave details about the progress of vaccinating beneficiaries in their respective regions. During the meeting, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba advised states to ramp up the pace of vaccination and cover as many beneficiaries as possible in a short duration due to the country’s large population. He further told them to prepare a plan for the coming three months to achieve the same.As the total doses administered are nearing 2.5 crore, here are the seven instructions that the Centre gave to states and UTs during the meeting:> States and UTs were asked to expand the capacity of their vaccination drive for both public and private sector, by on-boarding and operationalising as many health facilities and vaccination centres as possible.> The Centre said that equitable and easy access for Covid-19 vaccines should be given all across the country- states, districts, towns and villages and especially towards identifying existing geographical dark-zones through geospatial analysis.> States and UTs should ensure that maximum vaccination centres are operating on a daily basis. Capacity utilisation should be enhanced in these centres and wastage should be minimised.> The Centre asked states and UTs to open vaccination session for registration on the Co-Win app for at least four weeks in advance. States and UTs were also asked to optimise centre-level planning with appropriate provisions made for crowd management, drinking water and other facilities for citizens. “Ensuring real-time authentication and certification as much as possible for the convenience of the citizen as well as a check against misuse,” the Centre added.> The Centre said that registrations should be encouraged for vaccination over ‘walk-in’ mode and the entire process of facilitating it should be made convenient for all citizens. Authorities should also be given a ‘forward’ view with regard to expected demand so that they can plan properly and further avoid the overcrowding of beneficiaries.> “Optimising the supply chain down to the vaccination centre through efficient and equitable distribution while preventing any stock-piling or hoarding, with the assurance of there being no shortage of vaccine doses in the future,” the Centre said.> The Centre pointed out that the progress of the drive to administer vaccine doses to beneficiaries should be reviewed on a real-time basis till the district and block level and leveraging the end-to-end data integration of the Co-WIN app to ensure continuous, customised management.On Monday, the Rajasthan government asked the Centre for additional doses, but the Union healministry on Tuesday clarified that there was no shortage in the state. This is the first time that private hospitals have been made a part of the vaccination drive and the ministry has also allowed 24X7 vaccination for maximising the number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-in-india-nears-2-5-cr-doses-centre-gives-7-point-agenda-to-states-101615310445006.html

The 103-year-old did not report any side effect after the vaccine was administered, reports said. She was accompanied by her 77-year-old son who also got vaccinated at Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road.Senior citizens are more vulnerable to Covid-19 infection hence they are being prioritised in the ongoing session of vaccination. Apart from them, people who are aged between 45 years and 59 years and have some co-morbidities are also eligible for vaccination.Before Kameshwari J, Mumbai's Shashikala Joshi was the oldest woman to get vaccinated. 100-year-old Joshi took her first jab on March 5 along with her daughter who is 75-year-old.On Tuesday, another 103-year-old man took his first dose of vaccine in Noida.

09-03-2021||India||ADR moves Supreme Court to stop sale of electoral bonds||Ahead of the Assembly elections in four states and a union territory, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) filed an application in the Supreme Court on Tuesday to stop sale of electoral bonds till the validity of these bonds which is under examination by the top court, is finally decided.The ADR’s application was filed in a pending petition on this issue by the same organization.The petition filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan said, “There is a serious apprehension that any further sale of Electoral Bonds before the upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies. Thus, the petitioner seeks a direction that no further opening of window for the sale of electoral bonds be allowed during the pendency of the instant writ petition.”The petitioner pointed out that the petition challenging electoral bonds is pending in the Supreme Court since September 2017. The matter was last heard on January 20 last year following which ADR had requested the Court in October last year to list the matter ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar. However, the matter was not listed.The ADR in its PIL had sought that the amendments carried out to the Finance Act that were passed as Money Bills which provided an anonymous route for political parties to receive corporate funding through electoral bonds be struck down. This lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties was cited as the ground by ADR to oppose this scheme. These donations enjoy 100 per cent tax exemption as they need not be reported to the Income Tax Department as well, the petition added.“The Electoral Bonds Scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” the application filed by ADR stated, adding that the Finance Act of 2017 exempts use of electoral bonds from disclosure under the Representation of Peoples Act.The ADR moved applications in March 2019 and again in November 2019 to stay the implementation of the Electoral Bond Scheme but the same was not granted. In April 2019, the Supreme Court inan interim order asked political parties to disclose to the Election Commission in sealed covers details of donations received by way of electoral bonds.In the same order, the top court had observed that the matter of electoral bonds gives rise to “weighty issues which have a tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country” which require an in-depth hearing.The application on Tuesday went on to say, “As per data on Electoral Bonds declared by political parties in their audit reports for the FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19, the ruling party had received more than 60 percent of the total electoral bonds issued till date.”So far more than Rs. 6,500 crore worth of electoral bonds have been sold with the majority of donations going to the ruling party, the ADR claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adr-moves-supreme-court-to-stop-sale-of-electoral-bonds-101615307340284.html

09-03-2021||India||India summons British envoy over debate in UK Parliament on farmers' protest||India on Tuesday summoned British envoy Alex Ellis to lodge a protest against what it said was an “unwarranted and tendentious” debate in the UK Parliament that saw lawmakers criticising the Indian government’s handling of the farmers’ protest.The debate was held on Monday in response to a public petition that garnered more than 115,000 signatures, and witnessed Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democratic and Scottish National Party lawmakers calling on the Boris Johnson government to raise their concerns about the handling of the protest and media freedoms with the Indian government.Most of the British MPs acknowledged the Indian government’s agricultural reforms were a domestic matter but noted their constituents had strong links with India’s farm sector and were upset by what they described as the use of force against protesting farmers. Conservative MP Theresa Villiers was the only one of about 20 lawmakers who joined the debate to defend the Indian government’s actions.Ellis was summoned by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation that conveyed India’s “strong opposition to the unwarranted and tendentious discussion on agricultural reforms in India in the British Parliament”, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry.Shringla made it clear that the debate “represented a gross interference in the politics of another democratic country”, and he “advised that British MPs should refrain from practising vote bank politics by misrepresenting events, especially in relation to another fellow democracy”.Earlier, a statement from the Indian mission in London described the debate as a “distinctly one-sided discussion”. It said: “We deeply regret that rather than a balanced debate, false assertions – without substantiation or facts – were made, casting aspersions on the largest functioning democracy in the world and its institutions.”India’s independent democratic institutions are addressing issues raised by the British MPs, and it was a matter of concern that “comments were made to mislead the British Indian community” and raise doubts about the treatment of minorities, the statement said.Nigel Adams, the UK minister of state for Asia, while responding on behalf of the British government, said London will continue to monitor the farmers’ protest “incredibly closely”. He added, “Where we have concerns, we will continue to raise them with the Indian government while respecting the fact that these agricultural reforms are an internal matter.”Adams acknowledged the “strong feelings” about the farmers’ protest and press freedom in India and noted these issues had caused “alarm among UK citizens with ties to India”. He added, “We look to the government of India to uphold the freedoms and rights guaranteed to its people by its Constitution and by the international instruments to which India is party.”Though there is “great ambition” for the UK’s relationship with India and both sides are on shared priorities in trade, investment, defence, health and climate change that will “help fix global problems”, this doesn’t hinder London from raising difficult issues with New Delhi, he said.Prime Minister Boris John’s upcoming visit to India will be an opportunity to “discuss a range of bilateral issues where we have serious and specific concerns”, Adams said. “We will raise them directly with the Indian government as you’d expect of a friend,” he added.Several Indian-origin British MPs such as Virendra Sharma, Nadia Whittome and Seema Malhotra expressed concern about the use of force against protesting farmers. Labour Party MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, who has been at the forefront of efforts to raise the protests in Britain, said human rights are a universal issue and criticised the arrest of civil society activists and journalists.Former Labour chief Jeremy Corbyn described the farmers’ protest as the “biggest ever industrial dispute” in history while Labour MP Tahir Ali, who has his roots in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, called on the UK government to consider imposing sanctions on the Indian prime minister and government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-summons-british-envoy-over-debate-in-uk-parliament-on-farmers-protest-101615304427521.html

He was then posted as inspector in Syana kotwali.Bhardwaj said after Singh’s death no one objected to the closure report and the court accepted it after recording the statement of the policeman who submitted the death report of the inspector in the court.A case under sections 420,153A, 120B of IPC and 66 of IT Act was registered against Som and 200 others who liked the video, allegedly uploaded by the MLA after the killing of two brothers in Kawal village of Muzaffarnagar.It is said that the video, a fake one allegedly of the killing of two persons in Afghanistan, was described as the video of the Kawal incident and shared in social media, which triggered fierce communal riots in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli district in September 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-court-closes-case-against-bjp-mla-sangeet-som-in-muzaffarnagar-riots-101615300986263.html

Rawat met the BJP top brass in the national capital on Monday amid complaints by several Uttarakhand BJP MLAs over his ‘style of governance.’ Addressing a press conference after resigning, he thanked the party for giving him an opportunity to serve as chief minister, adding that his successor would be announced after a BJP legislature party meet at 10am on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rawats-resignation-not-enough-congress-accuses-bjp-of-escape-routes-101615298177122.html
09-03-2021||India||India condemns UK parliament debate on farm stir, says it's 'vote bank politics'||India on Tuesday summoned the British high commissioner to convey its strong objection to British parliamentarians debating the three farm laws enacted last year. The ministry of external affairs said in a statement foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla made it clear that the discussion in the UK parliament represented a gross interference in the politics of another country. Shringla called the debate "vote bank politics" and also highlighted that there was a misrepresentation of events."Foreign Secretary summoned the British High Commissioner and conveyed strong opposition to the unwarranted and tendentious discussion on agricultural reforms in India in the British Parliament," the statement said.A group of British MPs debated "use of force" in farmers protest in India drawing flak from the High Commission of India in London. The Indian mission said the discussion was one-sided and as British media were also present at farmers' protest site in India for reporting, the "question of lack of freedom of the media in India does not arise".Taking part in the debate which Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Nigel Adams noted that India has maintained that agricultural reforms were a domestic matter. "Whilst this is an exciting time for the UK-India partnership, it does not hinder us from raising difficult issues,” the minister said and also added that the issue might feature in a candid discussion between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian PM Narendra Modi when they meet in the future.The debate saw the participation of several cross-party British MPs. Opposition Labour MP for Ealing Southall in west London Virendra Sharma said, "Both sides need to step back and recognise the need to come to an agreement… I hope the government will commit to helping that cause and offer British skills in negotiation and compromise to help both sides to bring this issue to a close."The farmers' protest which has been going on at Delhi's border for over 100 days now has gained international attention primarily after Red Fort violence when protesters had a face-off with Delhi police leading to the death of one protester. In the aftermath of the incident, internet services were snapped at a few places in the Capital.India has reacted sharply to the US State Department's comment on farmers protest. In its response to the US statement, India compared the Red Fort incident with that of Capitol Hill. The Centre also objected to international celebrities like climate activist Greta Thunberg, pop star Rihanna tweeting on farmers' protest and said the action was irresponsible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-reforms-discussion-in-uk-parliament-tendentious-says-india-101615296249540.html

On Tuesday morning, the protesters laid siege to the administrative block of the RINL and refused to allow senior officials from entering the premises.They gheraoed director (finance) of RINL Varanasi Venkata Venugopal Rao and held him captive for nearly six hours, refusing to allow him into the office. They freed him only at around 3 pm after the intervention of the police and the trade union leaders who held talks with the top management, which assured to take up their demands with the Centre.“We shall intensify our agitation. There is no question of allowing the steel plant to be sold out to the private parties at a throwaway price. It is a question of do-or-die battle for the workers,” said J Ayodhya Ramu, president of Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the recognised union of the RINL.On Monday, the Union finance minister, replying to questions raised by Visakhapatnam MP M V V Satyanarayana and Araku MP Goddeti Madhavi, asserted that the Centre would go in for 100 per cent disinvestment of Government of India’s shares in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). The Centre would also withdraw RINL’s stakes in other joint ventures through strategic disinvestment.“While deciding conditions for strategic sale of RINL, concerns of employees and other stakeholders will be suitably addressed through share purchase agreement,’’ she said.Sitaraman also said the Andhra Pradesh government did not have any equity in the RINL, but the Centre was consulting the state government in specific matters as and when needed and would solicit its support in the matters that required its intervention.Stating that the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant was linked to the sentiments of the people of Andhra Pradesh, the chief minister recalled that in his previous letter to the Prime Minister on February 6, he had made a few suggestions to revive the plant.He said the steel plant would definitely turn a profitable venture given some support from the government of India instead of taking the disinvestment route by implementing some turnaround measures such as allotting captive iron ore mines to bring down the input costs, swapping high-cost debt with low-cost debt, converting debt into equity through equity conversion and monetization of vacant land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-steel-plant-workers-rise-in-protest-as-centre-firm-on-privatisation-101615295941253.html
09-03-2021||India||'Expectations are high...': BJP national general secy on Rawat's resignation||Trivendra Singh Rawat, who resigned as the chief minister of Uttarakhand on Tuesday, will be given a role at the central level said the Bharatiya Janata party’s national general secretary Dushyant Gautam.While there is speculation that Rawat was nudged to submit his resignation following unrest in the party unit in the state that goes to polls in 2022, the BJP central leadership wants to downplay his removal from the top job.Gautam, who was one of the central observers sent to Uttarakhand last week, asserted that the change in the leadership in the state should not be read as an indication of his failure as an administrator.Also read: Trivendra Singh Rawat resigns as Uttarakhand CM, day after meeting BJP top brass“The party decides who will work where. In his case, since he has the experience and has worked at the Center before, the party thought it would be more beneficial for the party to have him work at the central level,” Gautam said.Though media reports suggest that Gautam, along with the other observers such as BJP vice president Raman Singh, had heard the grievances of the party MLAs and other functionaries in Uttarakhand. Gautam denied that there was any anger against the CM.“In an election year, expectations are high as are aspirations. There is no anger against the CM; he did good work and even during the corona pandemic he ensured administrative work did not suffer,” Gautam said.Rawat's inability to forge relations with the cadre in the state unit and address the concerns of the legislators were cited as the reasons why he could not retain his job. The slow pace of work, especially when the state was preparing for the upcoming Kumbh was also listed as a reason for discontent.According to a senior party functionary, Rawat was seen to be a centre’s appointee who did not have the support of a majority of the party. What exacerbated the friction between him and the state unit was his style of functioning, his frequent visits to the capital and the decision to set up a new division in Gairsain, the summer capital of Uttarakhand.“There are several instances of friction between the state units and the CM. But in this case, he could not make peace,” said the functionary.A former RSS Pracharak, Rawat has served as the state unit chief in Uttarakhand and as the state agriculture minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expectations-are-high-bjp-national-general-secy-on-rawat-s-resignation-101615295309674.html
09-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand CM’s resignation is failure of 4 years of BJP govt, says Congress||The Congress unit in Uttarakhand said Tuesday that the change of guard in the BJP government a year ahead of elections shows that the saffron party’s reign of 4 years so far has been a failure.The Congress broadside came shortly after Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned as chief minister Tuesday afternoon after returning from New Delhi where he had met the BJP top brass.Harish Rawat, senior Congress leader and former chief minister said these political developments in the BJP are making it clearly evident that four years of Trivendra Singh Rawat’s government were a failure and that Congress would return to power in the 2022 assembly elections in the state.“Even the BJP leadership realised that he has failed. This change shows now nothing can stop the Congress from coming to power in the state. He disrespected Mahakumbh by shortening its tenure to one month. He didn’t do much for the employment of youth in the state, for the farmers, who continue to struggle in the hill state”, he said.Suryakant Dhasmana, state Congress vice president said the development shows that The BJP was not happy with the performance of Trivendra Singh Rawat.“BJP has cheated the people of the state and people will give a befitting reply in 2022 elections by electing Congress to power. In a way it is not the failure of Rawat, but of PM Narendra Modi who had made many promises to the people of the state during his election rallies in 2017”.Dhasmana wondered what message the BJP was trying to convey by changing the CM at this juncture.“These developments clearly show how BJP is in disarray in the state and all this has come to the surface now with Trivendra Singh Rawat’s removal from the post of CM. With such conflict in the party, you can well imagine their focus. People and even their own legislators were not happy with the way the government was functioning,” he saidThe Aam Aadmi Party which recently launched a massive membership drive in Uttarakhand, also said the BJP’s days in the state are numbered.AAP’s Uttarakhand unit chief SS Kaler claimed that the party would capture power in the assembly election and said that they have been saying for many months that the BJP government has failed to fulfill the promises it had made to the people of the state.“Our stand has now been vindicated as the BJP central leadership also felt that the CM needs to be changed and that too, a year before the elections. They have betrayed the trust of people and in the 2022 elections and the people will give a befitting reply by electing the AAP government in the state. This change makes our way clear for making strong inroads in Uttarakhand and give people a better model of governance,” he saidDevendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson, said that traditionally important decisions in the party are taken by the party high command.“The party after taking into consideration all aspects took this decision and it is acceptable to us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-s-resignation-is-failure-of-4-years-of-bjp-govt-says-congress-101615293817720.html

And there is no match for his commitment and dedication towards the nation.

09-03-2021||India||Assam assembly elections: All set for 1st phase; biggies including CM in fray||With filing of nominations coming to a close on Tuesday, battle lines for the first phase of Assam assembly polls on March 27 have been drawn. The crucial phase, where 47 seats in 11 districts, especially in upper Assam go for polls, would see many political bigwigs including chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in fray.On Tuesday, Sonowal filed nomination papers from Majuli, the world’s largest river island, which he represented in 2016 as well. The CM was accompanied by Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) president Atul Bora, state BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and other dignitaries.“We all want peace, security and development. And the BJP-led coalition has been able to provide all that successfully in the past five years. I thank you all for your blessings and seek your support again,” Sonowal said at a rally later.Besides the CM, the first phase will also have AGP chief Atul Bora in fray from Bokakhat and state Congress chief Ripun Bora from Gohpur. Chiefs of two newly formed parties, Lurinjyoti Gogoi of Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Akhil Gogoi of Raijor Dal, are also contesting on March 27.“Grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support of people, who joined me during the filing of nomination. Congress will win all the seats, we are contesting,” Ripun Bora said on Monday.Lurinjyoti will be contesting from Duliajana and Naharkatiya, while Akhi, who’s under arrest since December 2019 for his role in anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, filed his nomination papers from Guwahati Medical College Hospital for Sivasagar and Mariani seats.The seats in the first phase would be important for BJP, if they have to achieve their target of winning over 100 of the total 126 seats in the assembly. In 2016, the BJP-AGP combine had won 35 of these 47 seats, helping the saffron party to come to power for the first time in Assam.“Congress will not be able to win a single seat in upper Assam in the first phase. In 2016, we had won 27 of these seats. This time we will win seven more seats,” state BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass said.Constituencies in the first phase fall in the tea-rich belt and both BJP and Congress have tried their best to woo the tea-tribe community whose votes play a decisive role in about 35-40 seats in the first phase.Besides several schemes for the community launched by the state government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also addressed his first public meeting in Sivasagar in January. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also addressed a rally at Sivasagar and promised to increase daily wages of tea garden workers to ₹365 if the party comes to power.Also Read: Assam polls: 125 all-women polling booths in Kamrup metropolitanThe first phase would witness a battle of turncoats in Golaghat, where former Congress minister Ajanta Neog, who joined BJP recently, would face her former saffron party rival Bitupan Saikia, who joined Congress a few days back after being denied a ticket.Another seat in focus would be Titabar, which was represented by former CM Tarun Gogoi, who passed away in November. This time Congress has given ticket from this seat to businessman-cum-tea grower Bhaskar Jyoti Hazarika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-assembly-elections-all-set-for-1st-phase-biggies-including-cm-in-fray-101615293119201.html
09-03-2021||India||No plan to aid gas-based power plants at this juncture, says Power Minister||The government has decided to not provide support to gas-based power plants that are stranded or running at a sub-optimal level in view of the states' reluctance to give any concession to these projects and rise in capacity utilisation of these plants, Parliament was informed on Tuesday."In the light of the reluctance of the States to give any waiver/ concession and the fact that gas-based power generation grew without any support, it was decided that there may not be any need to have any policy on providing support to the gas-based power plants at this juncture," Power Minister RK Singh said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.The minister told the House that the gas prices were falling since last year and in 2019-20 the plant load factor (PLF or capacity utilisation) of gas-based generating stations was 22.15% and until August 2020, despite lower demand due to Covid-19, the PLF of gas-based power plants had risen to 26.64%.This has happened without any support due to lower LNG price, the minister added.According to the reply, the proposal to revive the e-RLNG (gas subsidy) scheme to provide support to the gas-based plants was examined. The views of the states regarding waivers and concessions of state government taxes and levies were sought.The minister said, "State Governments are of the view that the proposed concession/waivers for the revival of gas-based plants are not feasible/viable in current scenarios and they are not in favour of exemption of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on transportation of the scheme gas".In order to revive and improve the utilisation of gas-based capacity in the country, the government had sanctioned a scheme for utilisation of gas-based power generation capacity for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17.The scheme envisaged supply of imported spot Re-gasified Liquified Natural Gas (RLNG) to the stranded gas-based plants as well as plants receiving domestic gas, selected through a reverse e-bidding process.The scheme also envisaged sacrifices to be made collectively by all stakeholders and support from Power System Development Fund (PSDF). The scheme ended on March 31, 2017.The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) monitors gas supply position in respect of 2,3902 MW capacity of gas-based power plants in the country on a monthly basis. During the year 2020-2021 (up to January 2021) out of the total capacity of 2,3902 MW, only 5,438.50 MW capacity has nil generation due to non-availability of gas, Singh told the House.In a separate reply, the minister said the hydropower generation in the country is projected to be higher at 150.01 billion units (BU) compared to the planned 140.35 BU in 2020-21.Hydropower generation in the country is recorded at 141.28 BU till February 26, 2021 (this fiscal) from 46.20GW installed generation capacity as on February 28, 2021.In another reply to the House, Singh stated that the power consumption in the country fell 3.2% to 1,046.77 BU during April-January this fiscal from 1,081.67 BU in the same period in 2019-20. The power consumption or energy supplied in 2019-20 was 1,284.44 BU."In the current year 2020-21 (up to January 2021), there was a slight contraction in demand of electric energy in the first quarter due to Covid-19 pandemic, which has again picked up since the month of September 2020," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-aid-gas-based-power-plants-at-this-juncture-says-power-minister-101615292169628.html
09-03-2021||India||Explained: What led Uttarakhand chief minister Rawat to resign from his post||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat submitted his resignation to Governor Baby Rani Maurya on Tuesday. "The party took a collective decision that someone else should be given a chance as Uttarakhand chief minister," Rawat said after meeting the governor. Prior to their meeting, it was widely reported that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader might resign from his post.Rawat’s resignation came hours after he returned to Dehradun on Tuesday morning after meeting senior BJP leaders in Delhi. Up until Monday, the BJP denied speculations about any leadership change in the state. “CM Rawat would discuss the events on March 18 to mark the completion of four years of this government and the election strategy for upcoming state assembly elections to be held in 2022,” BJP’s state president Bansidhar Bhagat said on Monday.When did speculations of CM Rawat resigning start?The speculations started after a sudden core committee meeting of the BJP took place on Saturday. The meeting is said to be called upon by central observers, including former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh and the state unit in-charge Gautam, which was attended by 45 party MLAs. It has been reported that a section of the leaders of the state was not happy with Rawat’s leadership and believed that he may not be able to lead the party to success in the elections due in February 2022. After the meeting, chief minister Rawat left for Delhi to meet the BJP’s central leadership on Monday morning.What happened during Rawat’s visit to Delhi?Rawat met BJP national president JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and party general secretary BL Santhosh. After the visit, Rawat returned to Uttarakhand on Tuesday morning.How has the Congress reacted to the issue?Senior Congress leader Harish Rawat said it does not matter who is replaced by Rawat as the BJP is set to lose in the assembly elections due in 2022. "I can see a change in power happening. Even the BJP's central leadership has admitted that its present government in the state could not do much. No matter who they bring now they will not come back to power in 2022," Rawat, who is a former chief minister of the hill state, said.Who are the probable contenders for the chief minister’s post?Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj are said to be among the probable front runners for the position. State minister Dhan Singh Rawat and senior leaders Ajay Bhatt and Anil Baluni could also be considered for the top post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-what-led-uttarakhand-chief-minister-rawat-to-resign-from-his-post-101615284880456.html

But as Scindia chose a different path and left the party to become a backbencher on the BJP, now he can never become the chief minister."Write it down, he will never become Chief Minister there. He will have to come back here for that," Rahul said.In March last year, Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP leading to the fall of the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. Senior Congress leader of the state Digvijaya Singh had said Scindia was offered the post of the deputy CM but he turned it down and wanted to place someone else, which was rejected by Kamal Nath. In his defence, Scindia at that time said that he refused the post as he wanted to work for the people.The episode saw a near re-run in Rajasthan after Congress leader Sachin Pilot turned into a rebel but was later placated by the Ashok Gehlot government.Rahul Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia's association goes back a long way and after Scindia left the party, Rahul said they went to the college together and his doors were always open for Scindia. "Jyotiraditya is the only one who can walk into my house anytime... He was with me in college," Rahul had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jyotiradityas-reply-to-rahul-s-backbencher-jibe-had-he-been-this-worried-101615290626365.html

Following persecution in their country, many of them entered India illegally through Bangladesh and took shelter in Jammu and other parts of the country.Many political parties and social organisations in Jammu have urged the Centre to take immediate steps for the deportation of Rohingyas and Bangladeshi nationals, alleging that their presence is a "conspiracy to alter the demographic character" in the region and a "threat to peace".More than 13,700 foreigners, including Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshi nationals, are settled in Jammu and Samba districts of Jammu and Kashmir, where their population has increased by over 6,000 between 2008 and 2016, according to government data.“The decision of Jammu and Kashmir authorities to send at least 168 Rohingya refugees to a holding center needs a review as the issue needs to be seen through humanitarian angle rather than political,” the CPI(M) leader said in a statement here.Kesar said following persecution in their country, thousands of Rohingyas entered India through Bangladesh and some of them took shelter in Jammu also.“They were forced to leave their country and take temporary shelter in India and other countries to save their lives. Once the situation improves in their homeland, they must be asked to go back,” he said.However, he said as of now the situation has not improved in their homeland and forcing them to go back at this juncture would be “injustice” to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rohingya-refugees-issue-must-be-seen-through-humanitarian-angle-cpim-101615288346564.html

We immediately shifted her to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad, where she died on Tuesday morning,” Alladurg sub-inspector of police A Mohan Reddy said.Initially, the police suspected that Sathli Bai was attacked with acid, but later it was revealed that the accused poured petrol over her and set her ablaze. “Based on a statement from Sathli Bai in the hospital, we picked up a person for questioning. We shall reveal further details later,” the SI said.According to the police, the woman and her two daughters had been staying with her parents at Malkapur for the last couple of years, after her husband was killed in a family dispute. She had been earning her livelihood by working as an agricultural labourer.On Sunday evening, Sathli Bai left for the market in the nearby Jogipet town to buy some groceries, but did not return home till late in the night. The following morning, some villagers of Gadipeddapur noticed her lying on the outskirts of the village with severe burn injuries and informed the police.“We took her first to Jogipet area hospital and after first aid, we moved her to Osmania Hospital in Hyderabad,” Mohan Reddy said.

If I had got scared, I could have done something about it," Jarkiholi said, addressing the media formally for the first time since the sex-scandal rocked the BS Yediyurappa-led Karnataka government."I got a call 26 hours in advance from the high command, from my well wishers that your CD will be released by 5-6 pm the next day. They asked me to take precautionary legal action but I still did not do it. This is a major political conspiracy," he added, almost choking on words.The former minister said that he resigned by himself and was never asked to step down from the cabinet. He said that it was more important for him to get back the lost respect of his family."No matter how much it costs or how powerful they (alleged conspirators) are, will not spare them until we jail them," said the former minister.The withdrawal of the complaint by social activist Dinesh Kalahalli has given the BJP legislator confidence to counter the charges.Since the complaint by Kalahalli, the Gokak MLA was forced to resign from his post in the cabinet.Kalahalli had alleged that Jarkiholi had sexually exploited an unnamed woman on the false promise of getting her a job in the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL).Jarkiholi has called the video fake. His brother Balachandra Jarkiholi on Sunday said that the conspirators spent over ₹15 crore to upload the video in Russia.Ramesh added to the theory, stating that the entire conspiracy was hatched in two apartments around Yeshwantpur area of Bengaluru. He said that there are two main conspirators and at least seven more behind them who hatched the plan. He refused to divulge any more details.Ramesh was one of the first of at least 17 legislators to defect from the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government in 2019.Ramesh thanked Kumaraswamy and his family for standing by him during the entire episode.Kumaraswamy had alleged that a "deal" of ₹5 crore was struck in the case.Six other ministers who defected from the JD(S) have also approached the courts, seeking an injunction on any future publishing or broadcasting of any defamatory content against them.The Karnataka government is also drafting a legislation that aims to check and punish those who try to defame eminent personalities and politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conspiracy-fake-videos-bjp-s-ramesh-jarkiholi-on-alleged-sex-tape-row-101615289322182.html

If the plane has already taken off, the judge ordered action should be taken against delinquent passengers that could include permanently barring them from flying.Justice C Hari Shankar also told airlines to amend their inflight announcement. The judge said they should not only remind passengers that they must properly wear their masks, which they already do, but should also underline the penal action that will follow if they don’t adhere to the protocol.Justice Shankar had travelled on a flight from Kolkata to Delhi on 5 March (Friday) and was appalled by the lack of compliance to the Covid-19 protocol; primarily the rule that requires passengers to wear a mask covering their nose and mouth at all times. Once he reached home, the judge tried looking for the official orders for flyers but had trouble locating them on the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) website.He did find some news reports on the rule allowing airlines to put flyers who do not wear masks on a no-fly list.On Monday, the judge took suo motu notice of his experience and initiated a case that is being treated as public interest litigation by the high court.“It was noticed that, though all the passengers had worn masks, many passengers had worn the masks below their chin and were exhibiting a stubborn reluctance to wear their masks properly,” the judge wrote in his eight-page order, detailing his experience.“It was only on repeated entreaties made (by me) to the offending passengers that they condescended to wear their masks properly,” the judge said, pointing that when he asked the cabin crew why they didn’t enforce the rule, they claimed that they were helpless.This situation, the judge said, was "completely unconscionable" at a time when the country is seeing a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. "Passengers in a flight are in a closed air-conditioned environment, and, even if one of the passengers suffers from Covid, the effect on other passengers could be cataclysmic”.The high court issued a set of seven guidelines for airlines, passengers and the aviation regulator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-was-appalled-by-what-he-saw-on-kolkata-delhi-flight-issues-7-point-order-101615284850650.html

09-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand crisis: BJP may bring in 'CM-deputy CM' system as Rawat resigns||As Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned on Tuesday, putting an end to speculations of a change in the political leadership of the state, the BJP has already drafted its new blueprint in which there will be a deputy chief minister — a tested model of BJP governance.News agency PTI reported that the deputy CM post may go to Khatime constituency MLA Pushkar Singh Dhami.For the CM post, three names have emerged — Dhan Singh Rawat, the education minister of the state, and Parliament members Ajay Bhatt and Anil Baluni.The state will be going to the elections in 2022. With one year left in his term, what triggered this political crisis in the state, apart from a few MLAs' disapproval of Rawat's style of government is not clear. In 2017, the party came to power winning 57 out of 70 seats.The crisis came to the fore when the central BJP leadership sent two observers, party vice president Raman Singh and general secretary Dushyant Kumar Gautam, to Uttarakhand to get feedback from the party's core group in the state amid reports of discontent against the chief minister.Raman Singh talked to each member of Uttarakhand BJP's core committee, which includes Rajya Sabha member Naresh Bansal, Tehri MP Mala Rajya Lakshmi Shah, former chief minister Vijay Bahuguna, Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt, cabinet minister Madan Kaushik, minister of state Dhan Singh Rawat, state BJP general secretary Ajeya Kumar, among others.Till Monday, the BJP leadership was trying to paper over the developments as the visit of the observers was termed as a visit ahead of the government's four-year anniversary which is on March 18. On Tuesday, however, Trivendra Singh Rawat announced that he would be meeting the Governor in the evening.After his resignation, Rawat said, "I have been in politics for a long time starting with the RSS. For the last four years, I am been serving as the CM of Uttarakhand. This has been a golden opportunity for me. I am from a small village, where only seven-eight families today."

If a passenger, despite being reminded more than once in flight, refuses to follow this protocol, action should be taken against the passenger in accordance with the guidelines issued by the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation] or Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, including placing the passenger on a ‘no-fly’ regimen, either permanently or for a stipulated, sufficiently long, period,” justice Hari Shankar said. He cited “the stubbornness of the fellow passengers in wearing masks below their chins” on the flight.Also Read | Plea to delay judicial exam till lawyers get vaccinated transferred to new benchThe court asked the DGCA to put up on its website the guidelines and protocols for the passengers and cabin crew. It directed all airlines to ensure written instructions regarding the protocol to be followed be given to passengers along with the boarding passes. The court added the instructions should include the measures that could be taken against passengers in case of violations of the protocol. It said the passengers should be sensitised regarding their responsibility.Shankar said the in-flight crew shall carry out periodical checks of the aircraft to ensure all passengers are complying with the protocol, especially regarding masks. “...masks should be worn as directed by governmental instructions, covering the nose and mouth, and not worn merely covering the mouth or below the chin.”The court said the resurgence of Covid-19 cases after they showed signs of ebbing is completely unconscionable. “Passengers in a flight are in a closed air-conditioned environment, and, even if one of the passengers suffers from Covid, the effect on other passengers could be cataclysmic,” it said. “It is a matter of common knowledge that being within arm’s length distance of a Covid carrier, even if he is asymptomatic and is merely speaking, is more than sufficient to transmit the virus.”Shankar said there may be a medical necessity for some passengers for not wearing the mask and such cases must be the exception after due and strict assessment. He directed the airlines to ensure such passengers are isolated and kept at a safe distance from others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-can-take-action-against-passengers-not-wearing-masks-delhi-hc-101615285701771.html

With the connectivity, there will be an increase in economic opportunities of people of both the countries," Modi said while inaugurating the bridge through video conference.The Maitri bridge will now facilitate access to Bangladesh's Chittagong port, only 80 kilometres away from Sabroom.Besides the bridge, Modi laid foundation stones for different infrastructure projects in Tripura that included of Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Sabroom in South district, national highway 208 connecting Unakoti and Khowai district headquarters, state highways, district roads, 40,978 houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Integrated Command and Control Centre under Agartala Smart City Mission, multi-level car parking and commercial complex, widening of a double lane road to four lanes.Prior the 2018 assembly polls, Modi had promised to give the state development in the form of HIRA- Highways, I-ways, Railways and Airways.“All these projects are part of HIRA. And the waterways have also been added to it. Tripura today has received the rural roads, expansion of highways, bridge, infrastructural projects as gifts," he said.He also congratulated the BJP government on completing three years in power, Modi said that the state witnessed series of developments in different sectors due to “double-engine government” – a term used to define the Centre and the state governments where the same party is in power.Modi said that Tripura now has ease of doing business after moving out of the “hartal culture” of the past."Tripura people have scripted a new era three years back. Now, they can feel the comparison between 30 years of the previous government and BJP's three years government. Earlier, no work was possible without commission and corruption and now, all the government benefits reach to beneficiary through their personal bank accounts. The employees are now getting salary as per Seventh Pay Commission, the MNREGA wages per day have been hiked from ₹135 to ₹205," he said.“Tripura was allotted ₹350 crore for implementation of different centrally-sponsored schemes between 2009-2014. And in our government’s period since 2014 Tripura received over ₹12,000 crores. Tripura has set an example of having double-engine government," said Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maitri-bridge-will-be-new-indo-bangla-trade-corridor-says-pm-modi-101615284618781.html

The administration may also reasonably restrict so as to avoid mass gatherings," he said."As large congregation on the occasion of Mahashivratri has a large potential of spreading Covid-19 infections, Collectors and Municipal Commissioners may restrict congregations/ gatherings to such number as may be felt appropriate considering the situation there and space available within such temples and its premises to gather, strictly adhering to the Covid-19 protocols," Jena said.He said that any person found violating the order shall be punishable under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and other relevant laws.Major Shiv Peeths or temples such as that of Shree Lingaraj in Bhubaneswar and Baba Akandalamani in Bahdark have restricted night-gathering and mass diya burning during Mahashivratri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-asks-districts-to-ensure-covid-guidelines-on-mahashivratri-101615284357768.html
09-03-2021||India||‘Reservation in jobs for locals in Haryana contradicts RSS’s stance’||Haryana’s decision to bring in a law to reserve of 75% of private-sector jobs with a salary cap of ₹50,000 monthly for locals contradicts the “one nation, one people” stance of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fount of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said an RSS functionary, familiar with the organisation’s thinking on the matter. The Sangh’s position assumes importance given that it is a BJP-led government, which has brought in the legislation. The RSS functionary blamed political expediency for the move even as the BJP-Jannayak Janta Party government, which faces a no-confidence motion on Wednesday, has called it a fulfilment of a key election promise. “You cannot stop the migration of people for jobs. Such decisions have a fallout. Take the example of Bihar, where the ban on consumption of alcohol has not been effective on the ground. A similar experiment was done in Haryana by Bansi Lal when he banned alcohol [consumption] but the results on the ground showed that illegal liquor stores had sprung up all across the state,” said the RSS functionary, referring to the 1996 prohibition that was rolled back two years later under public pressure.The functionary pointed out Haryana would end up losing revenue if the decision is not revoked. “Companies will find a way around the law, but it is the state that will lose revenue.”Also Read | Is Haryana’s new reservation law constitutionally tenable?BJP leaders refused to comment on the Sangh functionary’s view, but on the merit of the issue, a BJP leader cited similar moves in other states and added they can be viewed as affirmative steps. “There are provisions in the law that give the state powers to take steps for positive discrimination in favour of those who are deprived or neglected. In several states, reservation for local residents in the private sector has been announced,” the leader said, requesting anonymity. He was referring to the laws in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, which have been challenged in court. Legal experts, however, believe that the law will find it hard to meet the constitutional test of equality and non discrimination.A second BJP leader acknowledged queries from industrialists and manufacturers on how the policy will be implemented on the ground. “There are some concerns, especially now that Haryana is seen as an industrial production destination. There are fears that the workforce needed will not be available. But the government has assured that it will address concerns,” said the second leader, who did not want to be named. The leader added a large percentage of those employed in the salary band of under ₹50,000 are migrant workers.Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said the state government held eight rounds of meeting with industry associations before finalising the reservation. “After consultations, if we have to incorporate some technical things in the rules, will do that so that industry comes to our state in an even bigger way,” he said.As per the 2011 census, Haryana, along with Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, is home to 50% of the country’s interstate migrants. In 2020, when Haryana launched a portal to facilitate the movement of migrant workers to their states in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, 800,000 people registered to move out.Welcoming the Sangh’s intervention on the issue, Professor Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said, “I am happy if the Sangh parivar has decided to take up the issue of discrimination in jobs based on place of origin. Such reservations that are borne out of political compulsions are against the Indian constitution and against the inter state migrant act,” Kundu said. He added that states such as Haryana that have significant inbound migrant population should think about the repercussions of the law. “Even states such as Madhya Pradesh, which have a high out- migration population and have announced similar reservation, should consider how their people will be treated in other states,” Kundu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reservation-in-jobs-for-locals-in-haryana-contradicts-rss-s-stance-101615284441690.html

Side-effects were observed in 10-12% of participants, which is six times less than other Covid-19 vaccines in use.Also, the phase 1 study follow-up showed durable antibody and T-cell response for three months post-vaccination.The phase 1 trial results published in The Lancet in January showed the vaccine was well tolerated in all dose groups with no related serious adverse events.For phase 2 trials, two intramuscular doses were administered four weeks apart to 380 participants across nine hospitals in nine states in a double-blind, randomised, and multicentre manner to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Covaxin.Also Read | Covid-19: Pilots, cabin crew won’t fly for 48 hours after getting jabBharat Biotech has developed the whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBV152) in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The virus strain (NIV-2020-770) containing the Asp614Gly mutation, isolated from a Covid-19 patient who came in from Wuhan (China), and sequenced at the ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), was provided to Bharat Biotech in May last year.The vaccine was approved for use in India on January 3 based on its safety and immunogenicity results and also efficacy shown in animal studies.

09-03-2021||India||New India-Bangladesh bridge boosts access to Chattogram port||A new bridge between India and Bangladesh opened on Tuesday will boost trade and connectivity and make Agartala, the capital of the northeastern state of Tripura, the Indian city closest to an international sea port. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 1.9-km bridge over Feni river, built at a cost of ₹133 crore, during a video conference. His Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina said in a video message the bridge will be a “trading lifeline” for northeastern India as it cuts the distance between Agartala and Chattogram port to less than 100 km. The Maitri Setu or “friendship bridge” was inaugurated a little more than a fortnight before Modi’s visit to Dhaka to join celebrations marking the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s independence and 50 years of diplomatic ties. It is the latest in a slew of connectivity initiatives aimed at linking India’s landlocked northeastern states to new markets. Modi said connectivity is strengthening friendship between the two sides and the region is being developed as a trade corridor between northeast India and Bangladesh. Rail and water connectivity projects completed in recent years will be strengthened by the bridge, he said. “Due to this bridge over Feni river, Agartala will become the Indian city that is nearest to an international sea port,” Modi said. Also Read | PM Modi to travel to Bangladesh on March 26, his first visit abroad in 15 monthsNoting that the bridge’s foundation stone was laid during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015, Modi thanked Hasina and her government for helping to complete the project. Besides Tripura, the bridge will improve connectivity for south Assam, Mizoram and Manipur and boost economic opportunities within Bangladesh, he added. The construction of a ₹232-crore integrated check post (ICP) at Sabroom, which will be a logistics hub with parking lot, warehousing and container trans-shipment facilities, will further boost trade, while the widening of National Highways 8 and 208 will facilitate the movement of local produce to new markets across the border, Modi said. In her video message, Hasina said: “The opening of Feni bridge is testimony to the Bangladesh government’s continued commitment to support our neighbour India in strengthening connectivity in the region, particularly for the northeast of India.” She added, “This bridge will be a trading lifeline for the northeast of India. As you all know, Bangladesh has already allowed the use of Chattogram and Mongla ports for the movement of goods to and from India.” Earlier, the nearest sea port for Agartala was Kolkata, located at a distance of more than 1,600 km, whereas the new bridge will reduce the distance between Agartala and Chattogram to less than 100 km, Hasina pointed out. At the same time, Hasina outlined her expectations for Indian support to help Bangladesh trade with other regional countries. “We are creating a new era in South Asia through providing connectivity to India. We are in a region which has remained conservative in opening up and where inter-regional trade is far below potential,” she said. “I believe political boundaries should not become physical barriers to trade. We expect the framework that we are inaugurating today will also help Bangladesh to trade more easily not only with India but also with Nepal and Bhutan,” she added. Bangladesh wants to maximise the advantages accruing from its location to become a connectivity hub between South and Southeast Asia, and the cross-border transport system being developed with India will enable her country to play an important role in regional trade, Hasina said. She also highlighted India’s role in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971. Switching to Bengali, she said: “We haven’t forgotten how, in 1971, you sheltered our people and supported us and cooperated with us so that we became victorious in our war of independence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-india-bangladesh-bridge-boosts-access-to-chattogram-port-101615283183726.html

The restrictive measures can be a partial lockdown or night curfew or a complete lockdown, or just amping up testing etc., the minister said. But the decision will be entirely of the local administration."In Mumbai, cases are a bit higher. The Chief Minister has instructed all administration officers to take a decision on whatever is necessary; be it imposing a partial lockdown, increasing testing, or go for a complete lockdown," Shaikh said.All districts of Maharashtra are seeing an uptick in the number of daily infections since mid-February. Starting from the Vidarbha region, the spike has spread to Marathwada and now Mumbai, as well. For the last six days, Mumbai has been reporting over 1,000 new cases daily.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, at this moment, is concentrating more on tightening surveillance. Residential buildings with more than five active Covid-19 patients are being sealed; nightclubs, wedding venues are on the radar; marshals are penalising people found without masks or flouting Covid-19 norms.But if these measures fail, then sea beaches, the Gateway of India might have to be shut. Night clubs might also be closed down as several of them have been found violating social distancing norms in the last few days. As far as people's movement is concerned, the decision rests with the local authority, the minister said.Authorities were also mulling whether to bring back restrictions on Mumbai local trains, which expanded its services since February 1, just before the spike was noticed. No decision has been taken in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-covid-19-spike-local-authorities-can-impose-restrictions-lockdown-101615281353236.html

As per the guidelines, the pilots and other crew members will be considered "temporarily unfit for flying" for 48 days after receiving each dose of the vaccine. They will be monitored for 30 minutes at the vaccination centre for any "anaphylactic or idiosyncratic" reaction.The aircrew will be allowed to resume their "unrestricted flying duties" after they fail to show any concerning symptoms within the said period, the guidelines further said.In case the aircrew experiences any symptoms after 48 hours of the vaccination, a physician or company doctor will review their condition. "Such pilots can be declared fit for flying duties provided they are asymptomatic without any medications and a medical cure certificate to this effect to be obtained," the DGCA stated.In case the medical unfitness period post-vaccination continues for more than 14 days, then a 'Special Medical Examination' will be required to ascertain fitness for flying.India rolled out a massive vaccination drive in the country on January 16. Since then it has inoculated more than 20 million people. During the first phase of the drive, only health workers and frontline workers were allowed to be administered the vaccine.The second phase commenced on March 1 during which the government allowed those above 60 to be vaccinated. People are above 45 and below 60 can also get themselves vaccinated after presenting a specified co-morbidity certificate.So far, the government is vaccinating people for free of cost. People also have an option of private vaccination centres where they get the jab at their own convenience. They will have to ₹250 to get the vaccine at private centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-issues-post-vaccination-guidelines-for-aircrew-101615281262776.html

Earlier today, he returned to Dehradun after meeting the BJP leadership yesterday in Delhi amid complaints by a section of party MLas over his “style of governance”.The CM has called a press meet, where he may announce his resignation before meeting with governor Baby Rani Maurya.Upon his return, the CM was welcomed by his supporters at the state capital's Jolly Grant Airport. During his Delhi visit, he met BJP national president JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and party general secretary BL Santhosh.Dhan Singh Rawat is reportedly flying to the state capital via private chopper amid buzz around leadership change.Earlier, amid the soaring tension over the leadership issue, the CM had attended an urgent core committee meeting called upon by central observers including former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and state unit in-charge Gautam on Saturday. Forty-five party MLAs also flew down to Dehradun from Gairsain in an abrupt manner on Saturday in the core committee meeting which was called after a section of party MLAs expressed resentment over the CM's leadership style."The reports of Rawat being replaced as the CM is wrong. He will remain the CM of the state and under him the party will contest the next assembly elections in 2022," said state president Bansidhar Bhagat, adding that the CM had gone to Delhi to discuss the preparations for the events to mark the completion of four years of the BJP government on March 18.State unit in-charge Gautam too refuted the reports of leadership change while speaking to mediapersons and said "there is no reason to replace him.""Why would the party replace him? There are no corruption charges against him. He has brought many significant public welfare programmes like providing water connection at Re 1 and making the state the first one in the country to give Atal Ayushmann health card to all for free treatment up to ₹5 lakh in any hospital of the state," said Gautam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trivendra-rawat-back-in-uttarakhand-after-delhi-visit-amid-removal-reports-101615280996624.html

According to the roster, all the PILs are to be listed before the bench headed by the chief justice. Let it be listed before Division Bench-I on March 12," the court said.The court was hearing a petition filed by one of the candidates who is going to appear for the examination.In the plea, the petitioner said he is suffering from severe medical conditions, leaving him at risk of serious and life-threatening complications if he contracts coronavirus.Senior advocate Malhotra, representing the petitioner, said all the candidates are in the age group of 32 to 47 years and mostly suffering from blood pressure and diabetes problems, and let the lawyers get vaccinated then the exam can be held after a month."It is a serious issue. Everyone's safety is important,” he said.On being asked by the court if the petition was in the nature of PIL, the counsel said it can be treated as a PIL as it was affecting everyone.The petition, filed through advocates Aditya Kapoor, Kushal Kumar, Harsh Ahuja and Akash Deep Gupta, sought quashing of February 18 notification issued by the Delhi High Court notifying the schedule of the examinations on March 13 and 14.The petitioner said he is a meritorious and middle-aged person who is suffering from severe health problems of cancer and had undergone radiation therapy with administration of chemotherapy doses and is currently having an extremely weak immunity.He said he is at a higher risk of severe complications from contracting coronavirus.The plea claimed that the notice is violative of the fundamental rights by forcing the candidates, like the petitioner, to risk their health and safety in the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.It said many states, including Delhi, are witnessing a rise in COVID-19 cases and there are more than 1,701 active cases in the national capital as of March 4, 2021, and around 240 new cases per day are getting detected on a daily basis."In view of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many states, including Delhi, the conduct of main exams in the month of March 2021 would unjustly expose the candidates, including the petitioner to the high risks of contracting coronavirus."It is also submitted that many candidates, including the petitioner for the exam, are of matured age and most of them also have compromised immunity due to various ailments,” the petition submitted.It also referred to recent suo moto cognisance taken by the high court on the demand for vaccinating judges, court staff and lawyers on a priority basis and said it might be possible that the issue of vaccination is decided by the central government soon and it would allow lawyers to get vaccinated and thereby diminishing the risk of contracting the virus."The absence of any urgency to conduct the main examinations and presence of the risks involved in conducting the examinations thus call for the postponement of the main examinations," the petition said.The result of the preliminary examinations was declared on February 13 last year, wherein 280 candidates were shortlisted to appear for the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Main Examination (Written)-2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-to-delay-judicial-exam-till-lawyers-get-vaccinated-transferred-to-new-bench-101615280736542.html

Lancet also said that efficacy cannot be determined by phase 2 trials. “We report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28,” the report published on Monday said.Covaxin induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination in the Phase 1 trial, it said. “In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial,” it said.Also watch | ‘Covaxin has 81% efficacy’: Bharat Biotech phase 3 trial results“BBV152 (developed using a well established manufacturing platform) was safe, immunogenic (persisting for 3 months), and can be stored at 2–8°C, which is compatible with the immunisation cold chain requirements of most countries. Follow-up studies to assess efficacy and immune responses in older adults and in people with comorbidities are underway,” it added.The Lancet study enrolled a small number of participants aged 12-18 years and 55-65 years. “Follow-on studies are required to establish immunogenicity in children and in those aged 65 years and older,” it said noting the study population lacked ethnic, racial, and gender diversity, “further underscoring the importance of evaluating BBV152 in other populations.”Also read | Covaxin demonstrates prowess of Atmanirbhar Bharat, says ICMR chiefThe Lancet report says the results reported in the study of phase 2 results do not permit efficacy assessments and the “evaluation of safety outcomes requires extensive phase 3 clinical trials.” "We were unable to assess other immune responses (ie, binding antibody and cell-mediated responses) in convalescent serum samples due to the low quantity. Furthermore, no additional data on the age of the participant or the severity of disease from symptomatic individuals were obtained. Comparisons between phase 1 and 2 trials were not done in a randomised set of participants, and no adjustments on baseline parameters were made. Conclusions are to be considered as post-hoc analyses," it said.Bharat Biotech announced earlier this month that preliminary results show Covaxin has an efficacy of 81% in phase 3 clinical trial amid months of speculations to rest. “Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus disease. With today’s results from our phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our Covid-19 vaccine from phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants.

He added more importance needs to be given to those who are “Congress at heart”, indicating more commitment to the party’s ideology.The comments assume significance as Gandhi is widely speculated to take charge of the party in June when the organisational elections take place. Party insiders believe that his comments might be a signal that Gandhi’s priorities and even his core team might see more people with stronger ideological binding with Congress’s values.Gandhi, who started his political career in 2004, has earned a reputation for promoting youth in the party by giving them tickets, key portfolios, and responsibilities in the organisation.Also Read | Help raise voice of the weak: Rahul to cadresIn his address to the IYC leaders, he hailed the workers as the party’s “real power”. “Mahatma Gandhi used to say that politics means trust, and today the country needs that trust and belief.”He asked IYC leaders to stay committed to the party’s ideology. Gandhi added that those, who stick to the party, will be rewarded in the long run. He added the Congress cannot shut the door if anyone wants to return to its fold. Gandhi likened Congress to an ocean and added anyone wanting return can be allowed to do so. But he added the positions of power must always go to those who stayed behind and remained committed to the party’s ideology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/commitment-to-party-ideology-important-rahul-gandhi-to-indian-youth-congress-101615278621279.html
09-03-2021||India||SC puts in abeyance arrest warrant against West Bengal BJP candidate Bharati Ghosh||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed that the non-bailable arrest warrant against BJP candidate and former IPS officer Bharati Ghosh in connection with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls violence case be kept in abeyance till the conclusion of the assembly polls in West Bengal.Ghosh is contesting from Derba constituency in the state against Trinamool Congress candidate Humayun Kabir, also a former IPS officer.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, S Abdul Nazeer and Hemant Gupta said no further coercive action should be taken against Ghosh in the case. The top court listed the matter for further hearing after two months.During the hearing, senior advocate Nieeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for Ghosh, said the court had been protecting the highly decorated former IPS officer. However, multiple cases were filed against her after she resigned from West Bengal's ruling TMC, he said.He said the top court had in 2019 protected her against the might of the state by saying she will be interrogated after the conclusion of the Lok Sabha polls.According to Kaul, in one case, she was proceeded against in an alleged assault case along with the CISF officials protecting her, without even taking prior consent.Since 2019, she has been called for questioning in connection with various FIRs lodged against her, he said, adding that even her husband was made accused in one of the cases in which the top court had granted him relief.Kaul sought complete hearing on her plea for quashing of the FIR. In the meantime, he said, she should be protected from any coercive action and be allowed to file her nomination and campaign in the state assembly polls.The bench then asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the West Bengal government, why the state wanted to arrest her when the apex court had granted her protection in some cases.Luthra said Ghosh had chosen not to appear in one of the cases before the trial court and she should be going there to seek cancelation of the warrant.He said she had never been arrested during the investigation and the coercive process had been issued against her by the court and not the police.The bench observed that she should not be arrested till the election process is over in connection with the FIR lodged in relation to the alleged violence in the last Lok Sabha polls.The top court allowed Ghosh's plea for protection from arrest and said the non-bailable arrest warrant issued against her should be kept in abeyance till the assembly polls end.The former IPS officer had moved the top court on Monday seeking a stay of the arrest warrant and quashing of the FIR lodged against her in connection with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls violence case.She had said in her intervention application that she has been implicated in new cases out of political vendetta despite the top court granting her relief of “no coercive action” in a series of “false cases” lodged against her on February 19, 2019.“Petitioner submits that such FIRs are kept secret as long as possible only to emerge suddenly to harass the applicant/petitioner and to keep her entangled in Court proceedings at every moment and, consequentially, to prevent her from pursuing her political career,” her plea said.Ghosh said she was a BJP candidate from Ghatal Parliamentary constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and alleged that she was attacked by TMC goons at every polling booth and police remained mute spectators.On February 19, 2019, the top court had provided her relief by granting her protection from arrest in all the cases registered against her.Ghosh, once considered close to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, claimed the police has registered over dozen FIRs against her, including a case of alleged extortion and illegal exchange of banned notes for gold.The top court had earlier granted her protection from arrest in a case of alleged extortion and illegal exchange of banned notes for gold.The West Bengal government had earlier opposed the plea of Ghosh and said she wants a stay of arrest on a writ petition, which cannot be done.On February 4, 2019, Ghosh joined the BJP in the presence of Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and senior party leader Kailash Vijayvargiya.Ghosh, who was the West Midnapore Superintendent of Police for more than six years, was transferred as commandant of the third battalion of the state armed police on December 26, 2017. She resigned from service two days later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-puts-in-abeyance-arrest-warrant-against-west-bengal-bjp-candidate-bharati-ghosh-101615276715836.html

The Congress has alleged that their members were put under pressure to quit the party, a charge rejected by the party rebels.Last week, president municipal council Anantnag, Hilal Shah joined the Apni party along with 21 councillors. Shah and 16 of these councillors had won the local bodies elections in 2018 on a Congress ticket. Hilal Shah had contested several elections as a Congress party member in the past.Apni party president, Altaf Bukhari welcomed him in the party at a function in Srinagar and said it will help make the party strong in south Kashmir, considered a bastion of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP)."My workers took the decision to join the Apni party for the sake of development of our areas, after we met the Apni party leadership, we found that the party is more people friendly than others," said Shah.Shah joined Congress in 2009 and unsuccessfully contested against former chief minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in 2014 assembly elections. "I am a common man; I don’t have any political background. I contested my first election in 2007 as an independent candidate and joined the Congress two years later. My workers are only concerned about the development of Anantnag and nothing else," he added.With Shah’s entry, the Apni party now has a foothold in south Kashmir's urban areas of Anantnag town. Earlier, municipal council president, Baramulla, Omar Azhar Kakroo, who belonged to the family of old Congress loyalists, joined Apni party along with nine councillors. Now, Congress which had 10 members in Baramulla Municipal Council is left with a lone member.Omar Azhar Kakroo said he and his associates left the Congress because of its local leadership. "The party didn’t have any strong leader so we were forced to leave the party." He said there was no pressure on him or others from any quarter to join the Apni party.Also Read: ‘Behave humanely with Rohingyas’, Farooq Abdullah tells CentreApni Party senior leader, Shoaib Lone said that Congress was now a defunct party. "People were leaving the party as its leadership was in disarray and fighting with each other." Lone, a former legislator who resigned from Congress last year, said that for these municipal leaders, the Apni party was the natural choice. "Our party president is accessible and is always aware of the problems of party workers. The councillors who joined our party wanted to work for their people, so they decided to join us."Congress J&K president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir said the party lost control over two municipal councils in Baramulla and Anantnag. "The councillors and presidents were given threats by various agencies and forced to join the Apni party. Very big people intervened and forced our members to join the new party." Mir said that time will prove that Congress members were forcibly made to join the Apni party on the pretext of security, government accommodation and protection from false cases. “This has become a routine in the country," he claimed.Mir said the Congress still controls half a dozen councils in Kashmir.

Our government has decided that Delhi residents will continuously be provided for free in government hospitals. Soon, per day vaccination capacity will be increased to 60,000 from 45,000,” Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said while presenting the budget financial year 2021-22 in the Delhi assembly.Private hospitals charge ₹250 for each dose for immunising those over the age of 60 and those between the ages of 45 and 59 with comorbidities. As Sisodia presented a ₹69,000 crore budget, he allocated ₹9934 crore or 14% of the total budget to health."For people to get freedom from Covid-19, a person can go to a private hospital and pay ₹250 and get a vaccine shot. But there are many who have to think about whether they should spend money to get ration for the family or on vaccines. In the 75th year of Independence, this question should not arise in their minds. So, we have decided that vaccines at our hospitals will continue to be given for free to people," he said.Sisodia said the outlay of ₹50 crore has been made under the 'Aam Aadmi Nishulk Covid Vaccine Yojana'. “While taking a lesson from our Covid-19 management, ₹1,293 has been set aside for expansion of healthcare services, including opening of new hospitals, renovating old ones and augmenting beds in them,” he added.On Monday, Sisodia said that Delhi was among the states that conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests in the country.

09-03-2021||India||DRDO develops AIP technology, Indian subs to be more silent and lethal||A day before INS Karanj attack submarine is inducted into Indian Navy, the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) conducted the final development test of Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) in Mumbai on Monday night, a major step that will make Indian submarines more lethal. AIP allows a submarine to be submerged for longer periods under water and makes the sub-surface platform more deadly by making it quieter than a nuclear submarine.The Indian Navy now plans to retrofit all its Kalvari class non-nuclear attack with AIP during their first upgrade, expected around 2023. The 1615 tonne Kalvari class submarine is being built by Mazagon Dockyards Limited in collaboration with French Naval Group and is based on Scorpene design. INS Karanj, third of the class, is expected to be commissioned tomorrow.The development of AIP technology is a major boost for the Atma Nirbhar Bharat campaign since only the US, France, China, UK and Russia have this key technology. The DRDO’s AIP technology is based on a Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell and the last two Kalvari class submarines will be powered by it. The AIP design was tested on land in Mumbai on Monday night, the last of a series of tests.Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh has congratulated @DRDO_India , @indiannavy and the Industry for this significant achievement. https://t.co/4zsFBa8bO5The AIP or marine propulsion technology allows non-nuclear submarines to operate without access to atmospheric oxygen (through snorkel or surfacing) and augments the diesel-electric propulsion system of attack submarines. This means that the AIP fitted submarine does not have to surface for charging its batteries and remains underwater for long periods. The AIP is retrofitted into existing submarine hulls by adding an additional hull section. The AIP equipped submarines are identified as SSP while classic diesel attack submarines carry the SSK classification.While the nuclear submarine generates noise due to the ship’s reactor constantly pumping coolant to maintain temperatures of the engine, the AIP-equipped submarine maintains a lethal silence. The new technology will add to lethality of Indian submarines, which also take advantage of internal refraction in equatorial waters due to differences in temperatures on the surface and within the ocean.The DRDO’s AIP technology has also got a pat in the back from the French, who were in touch with the Indians in the context of Kalvari class manufacturing. Despite urgent requests, the French have decided not to upgrade the Pakistani Agosta 90 B submarines with AIP technology, forcing Islamabad to either go to China or Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-develops-technology-that-makes-indian-submarines-quieter-lethal-101615270359062.html

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The H-4 visa is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status in the US.A group of such Indian women over the weekend organised a protest march in San Jose, California on the occasion of International Women’s Day to highlight the suffering of tens of thousands of immigrant women being forced out of their livelihoods, organisers of the event SaveH4EAD said.Spouses of Indian professionals on H-1B visas, mostly women, are the biggest beneficiary of the Obama-era rule that gave employment authorisation cards.“We are here to reiterate that this is our home, this is where we have spent the last many years of our lives, raised families and contributed positively to the society and economy as skilled legal immigrants,” said Pratima Joglekar, California chapter lead volunteer and organiser of the event.The group has sought the Biden administration’s attention to end these arbitrary policies that are disproportionately oppressing women of colour and robbing them of their livelihood.A week after his inauguration on January 20, US President Joe Biden withdrew a Trump-era rule rescinding work authorisation for H-4 visa holders, who are spouses of those possessing H-1B work visas, with majority being highly-skilled Indian women.“My wife’s H-4 renewal is pending for 5 months. We’re going through a very difficult time in paying her residency tuition as she’s not being allowed to work as a Teaching Assistant. I’m the only earning member and it has been extremely stressful for our family,” said Sreenidhi Krishnamoorthy, whose wife is currently a student at San Jose State University.Participants of the march alleged that USCIS has delayed the processing of H-4 and H4EAD ((Employment Authorisation Document) applications excessively, to the point that it is effectively killing the programme.“These delays have led to a serious humanitarian crisis causing havoc in the lives of thousands of skilled legal immigrant women across the US. They’re losing their jobs and health insurances during this pandemic, are unable to renew driver’s license and state ID, unable to travel to their home country or elsewhere, facing grave financial distress, going through severe mental health issues, deep impact on family and kids, among other issues,” a media release said.Many of these are essential workers, healthcare workers, small business owners, researchers, engineers, and more, they said.The Obama era rule to provide work permits to certain categories of spouses of H-1B visas has benefited approximately 100,000 H-4 spouses their basic right to work, be financially independent and contribute positively to the American economy. Over 95 per cent of the H4EAD recipients are highly-skilled women from diverse fields of work, it said.In a statement, SaveH4EAD group attributes the current astronomical processing delays by the USCIS to two main factors: the additional biometric requirements implemented by the previous administration through Executive Order 13780, and the delays due to Covid-related restrictions.The group hoped that the Biden administration will provide immediate relief by removing the additional biometrics requirements since the guiding Executive Order 13780 has already been revoked by President Biden on Day 1, and allowing anyone who has filed for H-4 and H-4 EAD application to use their receipt notice as proof of employment authorisation until USCIS is able to adjudicate the application.The group urged the administration to make it a policy to allow for concurrent processing of H-1B/H-4 applications when filed together, implement premium processing for H-4 and H-4 EAD applications as soon as possible through H.R.8337 - Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act.They are also seeking auto-extension of H-4 EAD for 180-240 days while the renewal application is pending and codifying H-4 EAD into law as either a stand-alone immigration bill or as part of United States Citizenship Act 2021, or any other smaller immigration bill.As of December 2017, USCIS had approved 1,26,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa holders. According to a 2018 report by Congressional Research Service (CRS) 93 per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India, and 5 were issued to individuals born in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inordinate-delay-in-processing-of-h-4-work-authorisation-say-spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders-101615269402985.html
09-03-2021||India||Ministries to highlight CVC role while approaching UPSC to discipline officers||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has asked all Union ministries and departments to highlight its role while approaching Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to seek advice on the quantum of penalty in disciplinary proceedings against Group ‘A’ officers and officers of All India Services. The practice of referring to CVC’s opinion while approaching UPSC had been done away with in December 2012 to avoid “difference of opinion” and “delay due to duality of authority”. The apex vigilance body is consulted at two stages in vigilance cases/disciplinary proceedings, which involves “first-stage advice” on the investigation reports, and “second-stage advice” before a final decision is taken at the conclusion of proceedings. Also Read | UPSC exam: SC says no extra chance for those who exhausted last attempt in 2020The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) had issued guidelines in 2011 asking to dispense with “second-stage advice” of CVC in disciplinary cases involving consultation with UPSC. The UPSC is consulted for the quantum of penalty against the concerned officer along with CVC, but the latter had taken a backseat for the past eight years due to DoPT guidelines. However, it was observed that the move didn’t obtain the desired result and there were considerable delays in finalisation of disciplinary proceedings in those cases as well, wherein the proceedings were initiated on the advice of the apex vigilance body. “One of the reasons noticed for delay in such cases is that while approaching UPSC for advice about quantum of penalty on the charged officer concerned, the fact that the disciplinary proceedings were initiated on the advice of CVC in that particular case, is not highlighted by the organisations,” according to a communication sent by CVC on Monday. Therefore, CVC added, it is desired that the authorities concerned, at the time of approaching UPSC for advice, with respect to such cases, “must highlight the fact that particular case was based on the First Stage Advice given by the CVC, so that the cases receives due attention with the authorities in UPSC and its advice is tendered on priority basis”. “It may be done by superscribing the file cover of cases being referred to UPSC with words ‘Vigilance Case’ on a red sticker, similar to process being followed in respect of important files pertaining to urgent/time bound parliamentary matters and Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha questions etc,” the CVC letter added. According to the CVC annual report 2019, it tendered its advice in 3,157 vigilance cases out of which 2,009 were “first-stage advice” and 453 were “second-stage advice”. Major penalty against officers were recommended in 110 cases out of 453 total cases under “second-stage advice”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-to-highlight-cvc-role-while-approaching-upsc-to-discipline-officers-101615269020751.html

The petition was filed in December last year by Mumbai-based advocate Kashif Ali Khan Deshmukh.The lawyer also included Twitter as a party in his petition and sought directions to the microblogging site to suspend Ranuat's account. It also sought directions to Twitter to bar other social media accounts that spread hatred on its platform.Deshmukh also referred to Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel's tweets in the petition where she allegedly suggested genocide of persons belonging to a minority community through her tweet. Khan stated that after Chandel's account was suspended, Ranaut came out in support of her sister through a video wherein she reiterated what Chandel had tweeted.A complaint has already been lodged with Amboli police regarding the video, but no action was taken by the police against the actor, Khan also stated in his petition.The petitioner also highlighted a recent tweet in which the actor has called farmers "terrorists" who are protesting at the Delhi border against the farm laws.Over the last few months, Kangana's tweets on farmers' protest and her colleagues in the film industry have generated controversies. In February, Twitter removed two of her tweets related to farmers' agitation after the social media site found it to be in violation of rules. "We have taken action on Tweets that were in violation of the Twitter Rules in line with our range of enforcement options," Twitter had said in an official statement.She also called Twitter 'China's puppet' following the removal of her tweets. Notably, Twitter is banned in China.Recently, Ranaut hinted at quitting Twitter which is a US-based company and said she might join the 'homegrown' app, Koo.

09-03-2021||India||Time to review 50% cap on quota? Supreme Court asks states||The Supreme Court on Monday said the issue of whether it is time to scrap the 50% ceiling on reservations in educational institutions and jobs needs to be answered in the context of the “changed social dynamics of the society” and recent constitutional amendments, and sought the views of the states — a radical departure from the legal precedent that has, for three decades now, held the ceiling as inviolable.Any attempt to increase the ceiling is loaded with political significance — various states (ruled by governments of varying hues) have sought, in vain until now, to do this to address the grievances of one politically important constituency or other. The court’s observation itself, came in a case where a reservation for Marathas in Maharashtra caused a breach in the ceiling.Almost 30 years after a nine-judge bench in the Indra Sawhney case (famously known as the Mandal Commission case) imposed the ceiling of 50% on total reservation, a five-judge bench agreed to examine whether the 1992 ruling should be reconsidered in the wake of various states providing for quota exceeding 50% and the central government framing a law in 2018 for reservation to economically and socially backward classes.Terming it a matter of “seminal importance”, the five-judge bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, issued notices to all states and sought their views on review of the mandate laid down in the Indra Sawhney case, which ruled that “reservation should not exceed 50%, barring certain extraordinary situations.” Further, the 1992 judgment barred reservation solely on economic criterion.If the five-judge bench accepts that the judgment in Indra Sawhney case should be modified, the case will have to be referred to an 11-judge bench because only a bench of larger composition can modify a previous judgment of the Supreme Court.The court’s move was endorsed by voices from across the political spectrum.Former minister in the Bihar state cabinet and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Prem Kumar supported the idea of revisiting the 1992 judgement in “the larger social interest.” Nalin Kohli, national spokesperson of BJP and a Supreme Court lawyer, said: “Being an issue of significance, the apex court has in its wisdom deemed it fit to implead the states as the outcome of the final judgment may have far reaching implications across the country.”The Rashtriya Janata Dal’s chief spokesperson and Bihar MLA Bhai Birendra said that quota should be increased in proportion to the increased share of the backward communities in the population while Janata Dal (United) leader Neeraj Kumar said that the reservation facility should be aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of the marginalised in keeping with their standing in the caste-based census.Spearheading the demand for Jat reservation in Haryana, Yashpal Malik, national president of the All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS), said: “The Supreme Court hearing will also have a direct impact on long pending demands for Jat reservation under the Other Backward Classes category in Haryana, which has been stayed by the Punjab and Haryana high court.”On Monday, the bench, which also comprised justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, framed a total of six questions, including the one on review of the 50% ceiling, while considering the constitutional validity of a 2018 Maharashtra law that sought to provide reservation to the Maratha community in jobs and admissions, a move that would take total reservations in the state in excess of 50%. .Based on a report by the Maharashtra State Backward Commission and using the window of “extraordinary situations” in the Indra Sawhney case, the state law provided 16% reservation to the Maratha community in addition to the existing 50% quota. But the Bombay High Court, by its judgment in June 2019, brought down the reservation to 12%in admissions to educational institutions and 13% in jobs.The high court judgment was challenged in the Supreme Court in a clutch of petitions, which said the Maratha quota law should be struck down since it transgressed the judicially-fixed ceiling of 50%. In September 2020, the implementation of the Maratha quota was stayed by the apex court through an interim order after highlighting that the Maharashtra government had breached the 50% ceiling on reservation by its new law.Apart from the issue of total reservation, the five-judge bench has decided to also examine whether the Backward Commission’s report meets the criterion of “extraordinary situations” under the Indra Sawhney ruling in giving quota benefits to the Maratha community.The apex court also agreed to ascertain whether states could add any community in the reservation after the central government’s 102nd constitutional amendment, by which Article 342A was inserted to authorise the President for specifying the “socially and educationally backward classes” (SEBCs) in all states and union territories after consultation with the Governor concerned. This virtually empowered the central government to identify SEBCs even in states and UTs.“Whether, Article 342A of the Constitution abrogates states’ power to legislate or classify in respect of “any backward class of citizens” and thereby affects the federal policy / structure of the Constitution of India?” read one of the questions framed by the bench.On this point, attorney general KK Venugopal, representing the Centre, and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Maharashtra government, submitted that since interpretation of Article 342A will affect all states, they should also be heard.Agreeing with this, the bench said it will begin hearing all states, starting March 15, and wrap up the arguments, preferably, by March 25.In addition to Maharashtra, there are three other states, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Chhattisgarh, which have passed similar laws, causing them to exceed the 50% reservation mark. Those decisions are also under challenge in the Supreme Court. Three days ago, the top court said it will take up the challenge to Tamil Nadu’s 69% quota law after deciding the Maratha quota case. The 69% quota in the state pre-dates the Indra Sawhney judgement, one reason why it is extant.The bunch of cases on the Maratha quota was referred to a five-judge bench in September 2020 when the top court also stayed the implementation of the state law in jobs and education. The Maharashtra government later filed an application before the five-judge bench, seeking vacation of the stay on implementation of the quota but the court said that its order would continue until the issues are finally decided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-to-review-50-cap-on-quota-supreme-court-asks-states-101615265491260.html

09-03-2021||India||India condemns one-sided false assertions in UK parliamentary debate over farmers' protest||The High Commission of India in London has condemned false assertions in a "distinctly one-sided discussion" among a group of British parliamentarians on Monday on the issue of peaceful protests and press freedoms in India, amidst the ongoing farmers' stir against three new laws on agricultural reforms.The Indian mission pointed out that foreign media, including British media, had been present and witnessed the events surrounding the farmers' protests in India first-hand and therefore any "question of lack of freedom of the media in India does not arise”."We deeply regret that rather than a balanced debate, false assertions – without substantiation or facts – were made, casting aspersions on the largest functioning democracy in the world and its institutions,” a statement issued by the high commission said, following the debate which stemmed from an e-petition that attracted over 100,000 signatures on the parliamentary website.The mission said it would normally refrain from commenting on an internal discussion involving a small group of honourable parliamentarians in a limited quorum."However, when aspersions are cast on India by anyone, irrespective of their claims of friendship and love for India or domestic political compulsions, there is a need to set the record straight," the statement said.It said that a false narrative over farmers’ protest was sought to be developed even though “the High Commission of India has been, over a period of time, taking care to inform all concerned about the issues raised in the petition.”The statement followed a group of around dozen cross-party British MPs debating issues around the “use of force” against protesters opposed to agricultural reforms in India and journalists being targeted while covering the protests taking place at several border points of Delhi for over 100 days.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops.As the UK government minister deputed to respond to the debate, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Nigel Adams said the close UK-India relationship did not hinder the UK in any way from raising "difficult issues" with India, even as he reiterated the government line that agricultural reforms are a "domestic matter" for India.“This is a time of great ambition for the UK’s relationship with India. Both governments are working to advance shared priorities across trade and investment, health, sustainability and climate change and defence and security,” said Adams.“We are also working with India as a force for good in the UN Security Council and as one of the Prime Minister’s [Boris Johnson] guest countries at the G7 summit later this year in June. This cooperation will help us fix global problems and it will strengthen prosperity and wellbeing in India and the UK," he said."However, whilst this is an exciting time for the UK-India partnership, it does not hinder us from raising difficult issues,” the minister said, adding that “candid discussions” on a range of issues will form part of Boris Johnson’s planned visit to India in the coming months.While the minister acknowledged the “alarm and uncertainty” the farmers’ protests and their coverage in India had caused among British communities with family ties in India, he expressed hope that the ongoing dialogue between the Indian government and farmers’ unions will have positive results.“Both sides need to step back and recognise the need to come to an agreement… I hope the government will commit to helping that cause and offer British skills in a negotiation and compromise to help both sides to bring this issue to a close,” said Virendra Sharma, Opposition Labour MP for Ealing Southall in west London with a large Punjabi diaspora.The debate, held in a hybrid form with some MPs participating via videolink in a room at Portcullis House in London, related to the e-petition entitled “Urge the Indian Government to ensure safety of protesters & press freedom”.“We have only been able to hold the government to account today [Monday] thanks to the power of democracy. A petition started by Liberal Democrat Councillor, Gurch Singh, and signed by over 100,000 people, has forced the government to stop hiding on this important issue," said Layla Moran, Liberal Democrat MP and spokesperson for foreign affairs.From the ruling Conservative Party backbenches, Theresa Villiers noted that agricultural reform is an issue that has proved difficult across the world over the years and pointed out that the new agricultural laws in India had been postponed to allow for greater “consultation and discussion”.“I understand that protesting farmers feel insecure about their future, but Prime Minister Modi’s government has repeatedly said that a core purpose of the reforms is to make farming more profitable, to raise the incomes of people who work in farming and to promote investment in agriculture to increase yields,” she said.“I hear the concerns expressed about the response to the protests, but when thousands and thousands of people are involved in demonstrations and encampments lasting months and months, no policing response can altogether avoid controversial episodes,” she said.The Indian government has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the mandi system.Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions have not been able to resolve the deadlock.India has emphasised that the protests by farmers must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity and the Ministry of External Affairs said that some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken," it said last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-one-sided-false-assertions-in-uk-parliamentary-debate-over-farmers-protest-101615262295188.html

People who make frivolous charges should see their past also,” he said referring to Shah spending time in jail in Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi encounter cases of 2005 in Gujarat. Shah was later acquitted in the case.Vijayan said the home minister insulted the state by making unsavoury and malicious charges and Kerala would not fall for his ‘divisive’ policy.“People are yet to forget about his role in Gujarat riots. A staunch advocate of communal division and hatred, we don’t need any certificate from Shah. If he thinks that Kerala is like a north Indian state, he’s terribly mistaken,” the CM said.In reply to Shah’s questions, asked earlier, about the smuggling scandal, the CM responded with his own questions.“The case surfaced in July. What did the customs do in eight months? How some of the airports have turned into smuggling hub and why central agencies failed to nab real people who are kingpins of the thriving racket?,” he asked. He also criticised minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan.Also Read: CVoter opinion poll predicts victories for incumbents, BJP gains in BengalEarlier on Sunday, Shah had said that Vijayan had no moral right to continue in power in the light of recent developments in the smuggling case. The customs had filed an affidavit in the Kerala high court on Friday, citing the confessional statement of main accused Swapna Suresh that dollar (linked to gold smuggling case) was smuggled at the instance of the CM, three ministers and the assembly speaker.Meanwhile, a statement of a woman police officer, who escorted Swapna Suresh during interrogation, came out claiming she had seen the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials force her to take the CM’s name in the case during the questioning. But the central agency rejected the allegation, calling it her imagination and alleging that she was tutored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lesson-needed-from-amit-shah-kerala-cm-s-retort-to-home-minister-101615257702142.html

The officials, however, countered the chief minister's allegations saying officials were present at the spot."The property belongs to railways, it's their responsibility but they were unable to provide map of building. I don't want to do politics over the tragedy but no one from railways has come here," Banerjee said late on Monday night after visiting the high rise building at Kolkata's Strand Road.Also Watch: 9 killed in fire; Mamata Banerjee visits siteHowever, Manoj Joshi, general manager in the Eastern Railway refuted the claim.

The case involves the creation and sharing of a toolkit - an online document - in support of the farmers' protest.The hearing was scheduled for today, after additional session judge Dharmera Rana during March 2 hearing, gave the Delhi Police a week's time to file a detailed response on Jacob's plea. The court directed the police to hand over a copy of its reply to Jacob's bail plea to her counsel.On February 17, Bombay high court gave three-weeks transit anticipatory bail to Jacob, so that the accused could approach the court concerned in Delhi, where the case is lodged. Muluk was granted transit anticipatory bail from the Aurangabad bench on February 16 for 10 days.On February 25, the court granted protection from arrest to Muluk which ends today.Delhi Police are investigating a case related to the social media toolkit and Jacob has been accused of helping edit the document.

09-03-2021||India||Quad, France and UAE join hands in 2 naval exercises to dominate Indo-Pacific||The Indian Navy, its partners in the QUAD grouping, and, its strategic allies France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will be part of complex interoperability exercises involving carrier strike groups, anti-submarine warfare aircraft and attack submarines in April– a move aimed at projecting their dominance from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Straits.The UAE will be joining India and France for the first time in a trilateral naval exercise in the strategically important Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in late April under the Varuna banner. This is scheduled between April 25 and 27.While dates of the QUAD-plus France naval exercise has to be firmed up on paper, India, the US, Australia, and Japan (the members of QUAD), with France will showcase their naval strength and commitment to freedom of navigation in the Bay of Bengal from April 4 to 7 with missile-guided destroyers, frigates, submarines and surveillance aircraft practising complex manoeuvres under the La Perouse banner.Both La Perouse and Varuna last took place in 2019, but were cancelled due to global pandemic last year. UAE’s naval chief confirmed his country’s participation in the Varuna trilateral exercises.Analysts say Indo-French naval cooperation will further deepen when French navy ships pay a visit to Kochi port in March. This will be followed by La Perouse. Then, in late April, the French Carrier Strike Group led by aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle will enlarge its footprint in the Persian Gulf with an Indian Kolkata-class destroyer and UAE naval forces under the Varuna banner.As India’s sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya is under maintenance after a long deployment arising from India’s stand-off with China in East Ladakh, Indian destroyers, P-8I aircraft and a submarine will participate in the QUAD-plus exercise. During the naval drills, the warships will practise formation sailing, live firing, communications, search, rescue, damage control and personnel transfers. The US is also not sending its aircraft carrier to La Perouse; at least three of its carrier strike groups have been deployed throughout the year in South China Sea and Indo-Pacific.According to a former Indian Navy western commander who asked not to be named, La Perouse shows that the QUAD-plus maritime force can work together anywhere in the Indo-Pacific as there is convergence on shared values, democracy, freedom of navigation and cooperation. The aim of the QUAD-plus navies is to project dominance in the Indo-Pacific from the Gulf of Aden to the north and far Pacific, touching the western coast of US.The political substance to these exercises will be given by the meeting of QUAD leaders in a virtual summit this month followed by the visit of the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin to India later this month to renew close defence cooperation under the Biden Administration. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet French President Emmanuel Macron around EU summit in Portugal in May.According to analysts, QUAD-plus’ primary emphasis is a free Indo-Pacific – something that has become increasingly important in light of Beijing’s expansionist plans for the region.After the on-going stand-off with PLA in East Ladakh, the Indian Navy along with its partners including UAE and France has clear objectives in the Indo-Pacific. While the formidable US navy will hold the fort beyond Malacca Straits, the Indian Navy along with its key allies will be first responders in the Indian Ocean. The visit of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius this month was to ensure that Indian navy ships can call in at naval ports in these countries, thereby increasing their range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-france-and-uae-join-hands-in-2-naval-exercises-to-dominate-indopacific-101615248156836.html

Using the latest available American Community Survey data from 2019 in its latest research, the new American Economy think-tank said undocumented Indian immigrants are the top third contributor to the US economy among other undocumented immigrants. There are 4.2 million immigrants from Mexico who lack documentation. Together, they make up more than 40.8 percent of the 10.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. In 2019 alone, they earned almost USD92 billion in household income and contributed almost USD9.8 billion in federal, state and local taxes.Mexican undocumented immigrants held more than USD82.2 billion in spending power, money that often goes back into local economies as they spend on housing, consumer goods and services, the report said. In terms of the number of undocumented immigrants, Mexico is followed by El Salvador (621,000, or 6.0 percent of all undocumented immigrants), India (587,000, or 5.7 percent), Guatemala (5.4 percent, or 5.4 percent), and Honduras (416,000, or 4.0 percent).With its USD15.5 billion of spending power, India, however, holds the second position, followed by El Salvador (USD11.5 billion), Guatemala (US9.1 billion) and Honduras (USD6.4 billion).They also make significant contributions to the federal, state and local tax revenue: India (USD2.8 billion), El Salvador (USD1.4 billion), Guatemala (USD1.1 billion) and Honduras (USD778 million), the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/undocumented-indian-immigrants-hold-usd15-5-billion-in-spending-power-101615248681745.html

Gandhi also maintained that the Congress can’t shut the door if anyone wants to return to its fold.Congress is like an ocean, Gandhi said in the national executive meeting of the IYC, and if anyone wants to return can be allowed to do so.The Congress leader said that while anyone can come back, the positions of power must always go to those who stayed behind and remained committed to the party ideology.Addressing all the national officials of the Youth Congress, Gandhi hailed the workers as the “real power” of the party and said, “Mahatma Gandhi used to say that politics means trust, and today the country needs that trust and belief.”Gandhi, who is widely speculated to take the charge as the next Congress president in June after the polls are over, had started his organizational career in the Congress as the general secretary in charge of the party’s student and youth wings. His interaction with the young leaders comes at a time when the party is gearing up for the polls and many of these IYC leaders would be actively involved in campaign and other organizational work during the elections.Gandhi also reminded the workers that the duty would be to “raise the voice of every section of the weak” and fight against the “anti-people, ‘Hum Do, Humare Do Wali Sarkar’”. The IYC also passed a resolution that Gandhi should be appointed as the next president of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/help-raise-voice-of-the-weak-rahul-to-cadres-101615245807621.html
09-03-2021||India||PM to visit Bangladesh on March 26||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make an overnight visit to Bangladesh on March 26 to join celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the neighbouring country’s independence in 1971, people aware of the matter said on Monday.The two-day trip to Dhaka will be Modi’s first foreign visit in 15 months and will reflect New Delhi’s emphasis on its ties with Bangladesh which the PM has described as “an important pillar” of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy. Modi last travelled abroad in November 2019 and had to scrap his travel plans over the past year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Modi will be the chief guest at the main event organised by the Sheikh Hasina government to commemorate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s declaring the erstwhile East Pakistan as an independent country, Bangladesh, on March 26, 1971. India, which sided with Bangladesh, helped defeat Pakistani forces who eventually surrendered on December 16, 1971.Ahead of the visit, Modi will on Tuesday inaugurate the “Maitri Setu” or friendship bridge between India and Bangladesh over the Feni river via video conference. Hasina is expected to send a recorded video message marking the inauguration of the key bridge that will give Sabroom in Tripura access to Chittagong port in Bangladesh, the people cited above said.Sabroom is located just 80 km from the Bangladesh port and the name of the new bridge symbolises the growing bilateral ties. The 1.9-km bridge was built by the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation at a cost of ₹133 crore.With connectivity emerging as a key component in India-Bangladesh relations, Modi will also launch several other projects to ease the movement of goods and people between the two countries. This includes the laying of the foundation stone for a ₹232-crore integrated check post at Sabroom, which will provide new market opportunities for products from the northeastern states and help in seamless movement of passengers.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who was in Dhaka last week to prepare for the PM’s visit, described the deepening strategic ties between the two countries as a “360-degree partnership” and stressed that Modi’s visit will surely be a “very memorable” event.The visit comes at a time, Indian officials say, when there is tremendous goodwill for the Indian government and its people in Bangladesh on account of New Delhi going the extra mile to make Covid-19 vaccines available to the neighbouring country.New Delhi has supplied nine million doses of the vaccine to Dhaka, including two million as a gift from the people of India. The remaining seven million doses were sent on a commercial basis after Bangladesh decided to rely on Indian vaccines rather than those pushed by Beijing.“India has kept the promise that it had made,” a senior government official said, a reference to Modi’s assurance to Hasina during their virtual summit in December. Modi had assured her that the doses would be made available to Bangladesh as and when India produced them, and also offered a partnership in vaccine production. It was at this summit that Hasina declared that “India is our true friend”.Officials said it was on account of New Delhi delivering on its commitment that Jaishankar returned from Dhaka last week with the sense that Bangladesh’s opposition parties, which are often critical or suspicious of India, had appreciated the move on vaccines.There are no big-ticket agreements planned during the PM’s visit. The two countries signed seven agreements in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture at the Modi-Hasina summit in December.India and Japan are also looking to take up more joint development projects in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-visit-b-desh-on-march-26-101615244464852.html
09-03-2021||India||Rising fuel prices rock Parliament||Spiraling fuel prices under the Narendra Modi government rocked both Houses of Parliament when it resumed for the second half of the budget session on Monday. The Congress and other Opposition parties launched protests, demanding a debate on the issue and forcing frequent adjournments.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, who debuted as the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said, “Throughout the country, people are agitating. That is why, we are requesting you to suspend all the rules and give us a chance to speak. Ultimately, we will see what the Government is going to say on this subject. There is a rise of nearly 820 % excise duty on diesel and around 258 % excise duty on petrol after 2014.”The original plan was to have women MPs run the two Houses and for women-related issues to get priority in the proceedings to mark the International Women’s Day in Parliament. However, the protests and frequent disruptions partially derailed the plan.Leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge gave a notice under rule 267 to not take up listed business for the day and instead discuss the issue of a hike in petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices. Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu said the issue could be taken up for discussion during the discussion on the appropriation bill. Kharge however did not relent, and the opposition kept raising slogans in the house. The house was first adjourned till 11 AM and for a second time till 1 PM after the opposition continued to push for its demand. The Opposition, which has been vocal about the fuel price rise, launched protests in both Houses.Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury accused the government of diverting attention from the issue of petroleum prices and said in the Lok Sabha, “On Women’s Day, we must discuss the way the price of petrol and diesel has increased.” Chowdhury also demanded that the government must introduce women reservation bill and pass it.On Monday, several party leaders also requested Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu to curtail the session as many MPs are engaged in the election campaign in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry. With an eye on this, both Houses will return to the old schedule of working from 11 am to 6 PM from Tuesday. Both Naidu and Birla announced the change of timetable in the Houses.Under protocol put in place on account of Covid, the Rajya Sabha was working from 9 am to 2 pm and the Lok Sabha from 4 pm to 10 pm. Given the low attendance, the thinking in Parliament is that both houses can be conducted simultaneously.Senior officials said that the current 6 feet distance between the seats of MPs would be reduced to 3 feet to accommodate more MPs in the House. “Out of 238 MPs of Rajya Sabha, 180 members will sit in the chamber while others will be accommodated in the gallery. Similar arrangement would be made in the Lok Sabha as well,” a senior official said. Many women MPs, including Harsimrat Kaur Badal of SAD, also protested against the high prices of fuel.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said the low attendance of members of non-BJP and non-Congress parties in the meetings held for scrutiny of Demands for Grants was an area of concern. He said the attendance of other parties and groups had fallen to 27.60% from 40% last year. “The overall attendance in the 21 meetings this year has fallen to 42% from 48% last year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rising-fuel-prices-rock-parliament-101615244131734.html
09-03-2021||India||Batla House: Ariz Khan held guilty of killing inspector||A Delhi court on Monday held alleged Indian Mujahideen terrorist Ariz Khan guilty along with his accomplices of killing inspector Mohan Chand Sharma of the special cell in the Batla House encounter that took place in the national capital in September 2008. The court will hear arguments on the quantum of sentence on March 15.Additional sessions judge Sandeep Yadav convicted 35-year-old Khan, also known as Junaid, Salim and Anna, saying that he and his associates “intentionally” and “knowingly” committed the murder of inspector Mohan Chand Sharma of the special cell by a firearm on September 19, 2008 in furtherance of a common intention.“It has also been proved on record that on the aforesaid date, time and place accused Ariz Khan @ Junaid along with his associates... in furtherance of common intention of all of them fired gunshot on deceased Mohan Chand Sharma and his team, they all being public servant...” the court said.It held Khan guilty of murder, attempt to murder, obstructing a public servant on duty, causing grievous hurt and non-appearance despite being declared a proclaimed offender (PO). Khan was pronounced a PO in 2009 and later arrested after being on the run for 10 years.The court said in a 105-page judgment that the evidence produced by the prosecution duly proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It said Khan and his associates “voluntarily” obstructed inspector Mohan Chand Sharma and his team in discharge of their public functions.Senior public prosecutor AT Ansari said the prosecution produced 100 witnesses to substantiate the charges framed against the accused and every type of evidence, including the recovery of documents, photographs and educational papers, was taken into account.“Keeping in mind the holistic view of the matter coupled with the gravity and manner of commission of the offences, I will certainly demand death sentence for the accused,” he said.The judge noted that there was contemporaneous recovery of incriminating articles such as photographs, educational certificates pertaining to the accused from the place of occurrence. If these articles were falsely planted, the accused had to tell where from the police got those articles, he said.The shootout took place six days after five serial blasts occurred in Delhi on 13 September 2008 in which at least 30 people were killed and over 100 injured. Inspector Sharma of the special cell had got a specific tip-off about the terrorist involved in the blasts hiding in a specific flat in Batla House, Jamia Nagar.Sharma with his raiding team of officers reached the spot where a shootout broke out. While Sharma and other police officials sustained injuries, two terrorists -- Mohammad Atif Ameen and Mohammad Sajid -- were killed. Sharma succumbed to his injuries later.Ariz Khan and Shahzad Ahmad managed to flee the spot but were later nabbed by police. While Ahmad, arrested on Jan 1, 2010, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the case in July 2013, Khan was arrested on February 14, 2018 from the Indo-Nepal border and convicted on Monday.On Monday, ASJ Yadav said Khan, along with his associates assaulted and used criminal force on Sharma and his team with the intent to prevent or deter them from discharging their duty.MS Khan, counsel for the accused, said he would appeal the vedict as it was not ascertained as to who shot the bullet that killed Sharma.“It is still a mystery and even a medical board has not been able to ascertain as to who shot the bullet that killed Sharma. Besides, the testimonies of the police officers, there is no evidence on the occupancy of the flat or the escape from the said premises. Even the alleged recovery of my client’s wallet from the flat is doubtful as the IO of the case was not even informed about it,” he said.The court asked the investigating officer to conduct an inquiry to ascertain Khan and his family’s financial condition and assess their capacity to pay compensation. The judge said the enquiry would focus on the impact of the crime on the legal heirs/dependents of Sharma so that it can arrive at a just conclusion on the question of compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/batla-house-ariz-khan-held-guilty-of-killing-inspector-101615240261558.html
09-03-2021||India||Govt building ‘agri stack’ to give unique ID to every Indian farmer||The Centre is in the process of creating for the first time a “digital agri-stack”, a hi-tech national farmers’ database that could give the government and agribusinesses unprecedented insights into the rural economy, people with knowledge of the matter said.The digital repository will aid precise targeting of subsidies, services and policies, the officials added. Under the programme, each farmer of the country will get what is being called an FID, or a farmers’ ID, linked to land records to uniquely identify them. India has 140 million operational farm-land holdings.Alongside, the government is also developing a unified farmer service platform that will help digitise agricultural services delivery by the public and private sectors, officials said. “The data of 4.3 crore (43 million) farmers linked with land records have already been verified and the database will be unveiled shortly,” one of officials said on condition of anonymity.The database will connect seemingly simple data points: the number of occupational farmers who avail of subsidies, how much land they own, what they grow and which agro-climatic zones they fall in. “These data points will be triangulated by a software that will throw up a far more complex but illuminating picture of the rural and agricultural economy,” the official said. The next step would be to create a model to monetise the data, the official added.The database uses Aadhaar-based data generated from key farm sector programmes such as PM-KISAN, a cash-transfer scheme and is being built under the National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture, a programme launched in the fiscal 2010-11.“We have a longstanding problem of accurate farm-economy data. We mostly depend on periodic surveys and the agriculture census. Real-time data will connect farmers and service providers in real-time,” said Ravi Saran, the CEO of Upajak, an Indore-based farmer producer organisation.The Centre’s Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income has recommended boosting digital initiatives in the farm sector with tools such as remote-sensing, geographical information system, data analytics, cloud computing and drones. A second official said the centralised farmers’ database will be used to better target subsidies, including fertilisers, cheap crop insurance and dissemination of mobile-based crop advisories.Farm subsidies worth thousands of crores — including cheap insurance, fertilisers, credit and income transfers — still suffer from leakages because very little information about individual farmers is centrally available. For instance, although the government knows India’s annual fertiliser demand, it has no way of knowing how much fertiliser an individual farmer may actually need, which may vary widely, depending on crops and soil conditions.There is currently no limit on the number of subsidised fertilisers each farmer can buy. “So, somebody who actually needs five bags of urea may be buying 10 bags and diverting the rest to open markets,” the second official said. The Centre spends approximately ₹75,000 crore annually on fertiliser subsidy. The government plans to eventually implement “cash transfers” in place of fertiliser subsidy.According to MicroSave Consulting, which audited the fertiliser subsidy programme for the state-run think tank Niti Aayog, such cash transfers are likely to face hurdles of “accurate targeting”. Its report pointed to the need for a farmers’ database. An Aadhaar-enabled database that maps actual farm sizes, cropping patterns and agro-climatic zones can create district-level data points to save leakages of aid, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-farmers-database-on-anvil-101615237499226.html
09-03-2021||India||Prominent warnings at IGI against carrying bullets soon||Delhi police have written to all Indian air carriers operating from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport as well as to Delhi airport operator DIAL asking them to mention prominently on all boarding passes, air tickets and at terminal entry points that carrying ammunitions is a non-bailable offence and can land flyers in jail.The letter by the police came in the backdrop of 522 passengers being arrested from Delhi airport in the past five years for carrying live ammunition in their bags.Police data shows that some of the 522 passengers nabbed while carrying live bullets in their bags claimed that they had done so unknowingly. Senior officers said that since the offence was a non-bailable one, all these passengers had to be placed under arrest. While in some cases, as per a 2014 Supreme Court judgment, bail can be granted from the police station on selective grounds, the majority of passengers have to get themselves bailed out from court.The process may usually take a day or two, they said.Data shows that while last year due to the closure of air traffic, the number of passengers nabbed with live ammunition was limited to just 66, in 2019, a total of at least 107 passengers had been arrested for the same offence. In 2018, 135 passengers had been arrested for carrying live bullets in their bags.This year, till February 15, at least 16 passengers had been arrested for the offence.At present, the rear side of boarding passes do come printed with a warning that states that ammunitions were a prohibited item. In its letter to the airlines, the Delhi police have now written, “It is advised to all airlines operating at Indira Gandhi International airport to specifically mention on the front side of the tickets/boarding passes in bold letters asking passengers to ”re-check your luggage as carrying ammunition at the airport is a punishable offence and a criminal case shall be registered against the violators in which he/she can land up in jail.”The letter further says that an SMS may also be sent to passengers regarding the same after they purchase a ticket. The police have also requested the airport operator to clearly display such warnings and advisory prominently at the terminal building’s entry points.Deputy commissioner of police (Delhi airport) Rajeev Ranjan said in most such cases, it has been noticed that passengers ended up carrying the ammunitions inadvertently. “But because they are not carrying a valid licence, as per the law, we need to file an FIR (first information report) against them under the Arms Act and they have to face criminal proceedings in a court of law,” Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prominent-warnings-at-igi-against-carrying-bullets-soon-101615237168050.html
09-03-2021||India||Is the Haryana Act legal?||Haryana government’s new law to reserve 75% of private sector jobs in the state, paying Rs.50,000 or less a month, for local candidates, has triggered a controversy. But is the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2021 legal?What are the provisions in the Constitution that enable reservation/quota?Article 14 guarantees equality and equal protection of law to all. Articles 15 (1) and 15 (2) prohibit the State from discriminating any citizen on ground of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. But clauses (3) to (5) of Article 15 empower the State to positively discriminate in favour of the grossly underrepresented and neglected sections of the society in order to promote substantive equality. Article 15(3) empowers the State to make special provisions for women and children while Article 15(4) authorises the State to make special provisions for advancement of socially and educationally backward sections or SC/STs. Article 15(5) goes one step further and says the State can make reservation in admission to education institutions, whether or not aided by government.Similarly, Articles 16 (1) and 16(2) lay down that the State cannot discriminate against citizens in the matters of employment.However, clause 3 of Article 16 allows Parliament to enact a law with residence qualifications necessary for government jobs, thus introducing the domicile-based preferential treatment. Article 16(4) also allows the State to make reservation for any backward class of citizens, which in the opinion of the state is not adequately represented in services. This opens door for reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Article 16(4A) was incorporated permitting reservation in promotions but restricting the same to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST).After the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019, clauses 6 and Articles 15 and 16 were inserted to provide for a further 10% reservation in jobs and educational institutions to economically backward sections in the general category.Can courts direct the State to provide reservation to SC/ST or backward classes?No. It has been held in a body of judgments of the Supreme Court that directions cannot be issued to the State to give reservation to any class of citizens.Starting 1963, several rulings have emphasised that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are enabling provisions and do not confer any right on SC/STs, OBCs or any other group of citizens to demand reservation as a matter of right, and thus, no such directive can be issued to the State by the courts.In MR Balaji Vs State of Mysore, 1963, for instance a five-judge bench underscored: “It is necessary to emphasise that Article 15(4) like Article 16(4) is an enabling provision....” This judgement also held that caste cannot be the sole and dominant test for determining social backwardness and that reservations made under Article 15(4) should be reasonable and less than 50%. These judgments drive home the point that although the State has been given the authority to provide for reservation, such decisions are amenable to judicial review.Can a law be framed for reservation on domicile?Yes, but only by the Parliament. Article 16(3) in the Constitution empowers Parliament to provide for domicile-based reservation in public employment and jobs with local or any other authority under a state or a Union Territory.Exercising this power, in 1957, the Centre passed The Public Employment (Requirement as To Residence) Act to repeal all existing laws in a state or a Union Territory that prescribed requirements as to residence (domicile) for public employment. The Centre, however, reserved its right to lay down rules in respect of certain classes of public employment in certain areas of some states such as Manipur, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. But this power with the Central government is also not unfettered, as was made clear by a judgment of the Supreme Court in 1969 when a constitution bench of the Supreme Court in AVS Narasimha Rao Vs State of AP declared that the law enacted by Parliament under Article 16 (3), making a special provision for domicile within the Telangana region of the State of Andhra Pradesh for the purpose of public employment, was ultra vires (without power under) the Constitution. It ruled that even Parliament cannot use the power under Article 16(3) to provide for domicile-based reservation in a particular part of the state and that the entire state must be the venue for residential qualification.Do state governments have any specific power to make laws/policies for domicile-based reservation?No. When the reservations of certain percentage of seats in medical colleges in favour of candidates from rural areas was sought to be justified on economic considerations, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, in State of Uttar Pradesh Vs Pradip Tandon (1974) emphatically rejected the plea. In Dr Pradeep Jain Vs Union of India, 1984, the top court dealt specifically with the issue of domicile-based reservation, noting that to regard an individual from one state as an outsider in another state “would be to deny him his constitutional rights and to derecognise the essential unity and integrity of the country by treating it as if it were a mere conglomeration of independent States.”Can a state make it legally contingent for a private sector firm to reserve jobs for local residents?The Act mandates all private establishments in Haryana to provide 75% of new jobs to local candidates. Under Article 19(1)(g), all citizens have a fundamental right to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business as a fundamental right. By mandating private institutions to employ a certain set of candidates, the Act constricts their right to carry on their occupation freely, which will be a major basis of challenges to the law.The 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act was passed in 2005 to allow the State to make provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward class of citizens or SC/ST in matters relating to admission in private educational institutions.But this does not give power to the State to make such provisions for employment in private institutions . Private firms will likely claim that the law effectively interferes with their constitutional rights to carry on their trade freely, especially when they do not receive any sops from the government and the law also fails on constitutional touchstone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-the-haryana-act-legal-101615236355738.html
09-03-2021||India||Why reservation may fail in levelling the field||A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has agreed to re-examine the 50% ceiling on reservations in India, which was put in place by the Supreme Court itself in 1992 in the famous Indra Sawhney case. The apex court took this decision while hearing a case on the validity of 10% separate reservations for Marathas in education and employment in government jobs in Maharashtra, something that would have breached the ceiling. Reservations were originally envisaged in the constitution as a temporary provision only for social groups designated as Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST). Over time they have come to occupy a more prominent role in politics, paved the way for not just evergreening such provisions but also expanding their coverage. From applying to just SC-ST social groups, reservations have expanded to cover OBCs, economically weaker sections of all social groups, who are neither SC-ST nor OBCs, and increasingly, once dominant communities that have now fallen on hard times (such as land-owning communities dependent on agriculture). While the argument in asking for a 50% cap on reservations can be questioned on the basis that merit itself is sometimes the function of privilege, it is clear that reservations are gradually losing their ability to level the playing field. Here are three charts which explain this.Reservations apply to the public sector, which is losing its importanceWhile the scope of reservations has gradually increased in India from being for just SC-ST groups to first OBC and now economically weaker sections from other social groups as well, the size of the pie which is covered under reservations has been declining gradually. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s database shows that the share of public sector; where reservations apply, in organised employment in the country increased until the 1980s and then started declining as public sector started shrinking with the opening up of the economy. In 2011-12, the latest period for which data is available, public sector accounted for less than 60% of total organised sector jobs in the country. This includes government jobs. (Chart 1)Private sector has higher social-inequality in better paying jobsAn analysis of unit level data from the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), India’s official source of employment statistics, shows that caste-wise inequality in salaried jobs (they are the highest paying jobs in India) is greater in private sector than in public sector. The former does not have reservations, while the latter has. A 2007 Economic and Political Weekly (EPW) paper by SK Thorat and Paul Attewell was based on an experiment where identical job applications were sent by candidates with names which suggested that they were upper caste, Dalits (SC) and Muslims. The authors found that companies discriminated against candidates with SC and Muslim surnames even in terms of contacting candidates. But reservations may not be the answer. (Chart 2)Expanding reservations to private sector will not solve inequality problemThe declining share of India’s public sector employment should be read in consonance with the fact that the total number of organised sector jobs in 2011-12 was just 29.6 million, whereas the size of India’s labour force was 430 million. This statistic is the most telling reminder that even if reservations were to be expanded to the private sector, it cannot achieve much in equalizing access to quality jobs, even if the social unrest which the policy would cause, were to be set aside for a moment. A comparison of the share of salaried jobs in India during the post-reform period captures this point. The solution lies in increasing the size of the pie, not play around with the allocation of the slices.(Chart 3)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-reservation-may-fail-in-levelling-the-field-101615234934723.html
09-03-2021||India||Separated from families, uncertainty looms over deportation in Rohingya settlements||The family members of the 169 Rohingya community members who were taken to a detention centre at a prison in Jammu have now been confined to their settlement clusters in the city’s Kathua district, where many described a sense of dread since the detentions and repeated appeals to the government of India not to deport them to Myanmar.Over the weekend, police rounded up the 169 people from the city and took them to the Hiranagar jail detention centre, which officials said received more refugees recently from other districts of the union territory, such as Sambha. “We appeal Indian government not to detain us. Only we know what we survived back home in Burma and how we reached here. Our parents have been killed. Even policemen are fleeing Burma now,” said Mohammad Shahzahan (27), who came to Jammu after felling what the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.Rohingyas are a community of Muslims speaking the Bengali dialect. Since the early 1990s, more than a million of them have fled Myanmar following waves of violence. Myanmar at present is going through a new wave of strife after the military displaced the government in a coup. Dozens of anti-coup protesters have since been killed.Shahzahan, speaking from the refugee settlement cluster in Kiryani Talab in Narwal area, said that he and other Rohingya would happily go back to their country once peace returned. “But please do not treat us like militants. If our days are over here, then send us to any other country,” he added. Access to the settlement has been cut off by policemen who now guard a main access gate and a nearby Madarsa. Several of the family members left behind after the 169 people were taken include children, some as young as 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/separated-from-families-uncertainty-looms-over-deportation-in-rohingya-settlements-101615233500105.html
09-03-2021||India||Record GST collections expected in March, set to hit ₹1.30 lakh crore||India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in March 2021 is expected to touch a record high of around Rs.1.30 lakh crore on the backdrop of a rapid economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and a hard lockdown necessitated by it, two people aware of the development said.The people, who asked not to be named, attributed the enhanced collections also to stricter compliance through e-invoicing, which had made it difficult to evade tax.The revenue in March may cross the record Rs.1,19,875 crore collected in January by at least Rs.10,000 crore, the people said.The recovery in GST collections reflects the larger revival in the economy. India’s economy shrank by 24.4% in the three months ended June 30 and 7.3% in the three months ended October, before entering growth territory and expanding by 0.4% in the three months ended December 31. The government has estimated the entire year’s GDP contraction at 8%, although many experts expect it to do better.After remaining in contraction mode for six months in a row, since March 2020 — India imposed a 68-day-long hard lockdown in late March — GST collections started growing from September 2020. GST collections, which plunged to an all-time low at Rs.32,172 crore in April 2020, touched a record Rs.1,19,875 crore in January. The latest GST collection figure was Rs.1,13,143 crore for February 2021, a 7.3% year-on-year growth.Pratik Jain, partner and leader, Indirect Tax, PwC India, said: “GST collections are on an upsurge in last four-five months even without raising GST rates. This is because of tightening of compliances, increased rigours in audit /investigation and leveraging technology to widen the tax base. Besides, economy is recovering fast and that would also be reflected in the March collections.”The compulsory e-invoicing system that started in January this year has plugged business-to-business (B2B) tax evasion to a great extent as transactions above Rs.100 crore are mostly B2B, where correct invoicing is insisted upon by both buyers and sellers to avail input tax credits and avoid penalties, one of the two people cited above said.“Thus, increased use of technology has helped to ease compliance burden on the one hand and raised fear among unscrupulous elements on the other,” he added.The government made e-invoicing mandatory for businesses with an annual turnover of Rs.100 crore and above from January 1. The idea is to progressively make it compulsory for all.The second person added that no significant B2B transaction is now possible below the GST radar as e-invoices require QR codes, which are generated from the GST Network (GSTN). “GSTN has an instant record of all transactions,” he added.“There are two more reasons for the optimism that GST collections could cross Rs.1.30 lakh crore in March. One is the fiscal year closing on March 31, and the other is a temporary freeze on refunds.”The tax department usually goes slow on refunds towards the end of the financial year to make it easier to close books, this person explained.The two people said the higher GST collection in March is expected despite February being a smaller month. Official GST collection data comes with a lag because the last date for paying GST is the 20th day of the following month. Therefore, the March GST collection figure actually reflects business activities in February.MS Mani, partner at Deloitte India, said: “Despite the fewer number of working days in February and although the services sector continues to operate with restrictions, the GST collections for February [officially March figures] are expected to be robust due to the continued growth in GDP [gross domestic product] and the anti-evasion drive undertaken by the authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-gst-collections-expected-in-march-101615226194453.html

It’s expected to submit its report with the Visitor and the ministry of education by Tuesday when Tyagi’s term is ending officially.”When asked if Tyagi will have to vacate his residence allocated at the university campus, the official said, “As per the norms, he will be given six months’ time, starting from the day of his retirement, to vacate the residence.”Tyagi was suspended by the union ministry of education in October, after the Centre had pointed out several shortcomings in the functioning of the university in his tenure.The suspension was followed by a high-voltage drama when a faction led by Tyagi — who was on medical leave since July — overrode the recommendations of the executive council to appoint a new registrar and a new pro-V-C. The President of India nullified all orders and appointments made by Tyagi.DU officials said that Tyagi was the first V-C in the university’s 100-year history to be suspended.Shri Ram Oberoi, former president of Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) and a member of the DU court, said, “It’s unprecedented in the history of Delhi University. In 1969, three teachers were suspended by the governing body of Shyamlal College. The DU teachers’ association, at the time, launched a big movement and brought an amendment to DU’s ordinances. It was decided that no teacher would be suspended without prior approval of the V-C. But who will give the approval when the V-C is suspended?” he said.Oberoi said that DU’s ordinance has no provision to suspend a V-C.JL Gupta, a member of Delhi University’s executive council, backed the statement.“The DU ordinance doesn’t permit suspension of a V-C and that’s why this has never happened before,” he said.However, the University administration did not receive any communication from the office of the Visitor till Monday evening. DU registrar Vikas Gupta said, “We have not received anything from the Visitor or the ministry. We, in fact, are not aware of Tyagi’s letter to the Visitor. We got to know about it only through media reports.”Despite several attempts, Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment. Last week, Tyagi wrote to the Visitor requesting that his suspension be resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/report-on-probe-against-du-v-c-tyagi-likely-today-101615232762662.html

Congress leaders opposed the bill and called it a violation of constitutional rights. Now, the bill will be sent to governor Anandiben Patel for approval.BJP MLAs supported the bill and called it a gift for women on the occasion of Women’s Day. Party MLA Sitasharam Sharma said, “According to a 1956 report, conversions are mostly brought about under influence, misrepresentation, etc, or in other words not by conviction but by various inducements offered for proselytisation in various forms... Congress leaders believe in doing politics and the BJP believes in resolving the root cause of such issues.”Members of the minority Muslim and Christian communities said they will move court after the notification of the law.Muslim Vikas Parishad state convener Mahir Khan said, “This bill will be misused by people to target us and we will not keep silent over this. We will move court against it.”In the assembly, former minister and Congress MLA Govind Singh said, “I opposed this bill because it has been brought to suppress, harass and create a fearful environment for people from a minority...The new bill is a violation of Article 21 and Article 25 of the Constitution of India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-assembly-nod-to-anti-conversion-bill-101615232453627.html

The technology requires telecoms companies to scrub messages to verify if the text being sent has been approved and it is only being sent to someone who has consented to receive such a message. According to BloombergQuint, which cited unnamed industry officials, several banks may not have complied with the requirements fully to get their communications vetted under the new blockchain-based system. It also cited other unnamed officials as saying that in the case of one prominent private bank, only 25-30% of the OTPs were being delivered. Several people on social media websites too reported problems, saying they were not receiving messages to authorise transactions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antispam-tech-halts-otp-texts-for-some-101615230692364.html

Throughout the day, women protesters organised marches at the sites while wearing yellow and green scarves and holding the flags of various farmer union groups.Kavita Kurugunti, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha – an umbrella body comprising 40 farmer groups – said the protests on Monday were entirely managed by women. “Women arrived at the borders in tractors, cars, jeeps, tempo, buses and trains, waving mazdoor kisan flags, to protest against the three agricultural laws,” she said.From manning the stage to addressing the crowd, arrangements related to the agitation were carried out by women of all ages and professions at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur.Harpreet Kaur, 35, a farmer from Doaba in Punjab, said, “So many women have lost their family members during this three-month agitation. We have all come here so that the government takes note of our losses and scraps the new farm laws.”At Tikri, women farmers dubbed the three laws “death warrants”. “Women farmers termed the Modi government anti-women and said demands of women farmers have been completely ignored by the government,” Kurugunti said, adding that women farmers constitute a major part of the agricultural workforce in the country.“The government feels that the movement will weaken over time, but the resolve of farmers is getting stronger by the day,” farmer leader Harinder Bindu said, reiterating that farmers won’t leave Delhi’s borders unless the three farm laws are repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thousands-of-women-farmers-joined-the-ongoing-farmer-agitation-at-delhi-s-border-101615230030163.html
09-03-2021||India||Activists flag concerns over debris dumping on Yamuna floodplains||Environmental activists and some slum dwellers have raised concerns over mounds of construction debris and soil excavated during the construction of the new Parliament Building at Sansad Marg — as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project — being dumped on the Yamuna floodplains in east Delhi.Environment activists alleged that the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is undertaking the construction of the new Parliament building via private developers, has been allowing the dumping of construction waste — including debris and soil from the excavation of the site on the floodplains — in violation of an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Anyone who is found violating the order is liable to pay an environmental compensation charge of up to ₹50,000 under the “polluter pays” principle.CPWD, however, strongly denied the allegations saying that the portion of land in question is “away from the floodplain”, and that on the request of the Public Works Department, it was just levelling the earth below the Barapullah road project site.On Monday, Hindustan Times visited the portion of the Yamuna floodplains adjacent to the Noida Link Road — ranging up to the Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway till the Meerut Expressway and the Vikas Bridge — and found that the area was filled with mounds of soil and concrete waste, which had reached the height of the main road. Even though activists and the slum dwellers in the area said that this waste was being dumped late at night from the site of the new Parliament building, HT could not verify this claim.Large pieces of cement blocks, building material and rocks were also piled up on the stretch.Dev Pal, a field researcher at a citizens’ group called Housing and Land Rights Network, who had first noticed the violation, said that all the waste that was seen on the floodplains happened after February 4.“There are around two dozen huts situated on this portion of the floodplains and this dumping is happening all around those dwellings. From February 4, every night around 50-70 trucks line on the main road and dump the waste here. The mounds have become so high now that it has reached the height of the main road. This is an eco-sensitive zone and if we receive a good rainfall tomorrow, then all of these houses around these mounds will get buried in the soil,” Pal said.Pal alleged that the dumping on this portion was from the site of the new Parliament building.“We have been tracking and researching the movement of trucks and we have found that such a high volume of waste is coming only from the Parliament building site. We had reached out to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), but we got a standard response from them that the matter is being looked into,” he said.Responding to HT on Monday, CPWD denied all allegations that the waste from the Central Vista construction site was being dumped on the floodplains. “These allegations are not correct. We have filled excavated earth on PWD’s (Public Works Department) Barapullah project, within the clover leaves and slip road area. This part is away from the floodplains,” CPWD said.Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the agency that owns the floodplain, in its response said that the complaint was brought to their notice on Monday morning and officials are “looking into the matter”.Environmentalists, however, insisted that the area under question was part of the floodplains and in 2010 and 2013, when the levels of Yamuna had increased and was nearing the ‘danger’ mark, this section had to be evacuated as the water from the river had reached the edge of the Noida Link Road.Manoj Misra, the convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said that the area where waste is being dumped was originally a low-lying area and is a natural wetland, which helps in the recharge of groundwater, and is a habitat for many animals and birds apart from being home to several local farmers.“This dumping needs to be stopped. This area should be cleared and reclaimed as ordered in 2013 by the NGT,” Misra said.He also said that if immediate action is not initiated, it will lead to an eventual alteration of the morphology of the floodplains.Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator at the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, People (SANDRP), said that over the last few years such rampant construction around the Yamuna has led to several such violations.“The problem is that they do not realise that they are creating trouble for themselves. Every river follows a decadal flooding cycle, which means that every few decades, the river water rises to dangerous levels and if there are any encroachments in its flow, they get washed away. Over the years such violations also result in alterations in the flow pattern of the river,” Rawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-flag-concerns-over-debris-dumping-on-yamuna-floodplains-101615229636311.html
09-03-2021||India||9 killed in blaze at multi-storeyed building in Kolkata||Nine people including four fire fighters, one Railway Protection Force personnel, an assistant sub-inspector of the Kolkata Police and one unidentified person died while fighting a massive blaze the fire at a high rise building that houses the offices of the Eastern Railway at Kolkata's Strand Road, fire service minister Sujit Bose said late Monday night.Two more bodies were found inside a second elevator, fire brigade officials said late on Monday night. The bodies could not be identified. It was suspected that one of them could be the Eastern Railway's deputy chief commercial manager Partha Sarathi Mondal who had been missing since evening."The police commissioner told me that two more people are missing and may have died," said chief minister Mamata Banerjee after reaching the spot around 10.15 pm.Railway officials who work in the building said one of their colleagues, Sudipta Das, a technician and resident of Howrah, was missing.A senior railway official, Partha Sarathi Mondal, was missing, said members of his family who talked to the chief minister.The fire services personnel who died are Girish Deb, Gaurab Bej, Aniruddh Jana and Biman PurkaitThe Kolkata Police ASI was identified as Amit BhawalThe National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was deployed to in the search operation a little before midnight.Several fire brigade personnel were taken to hospitals such as SSKM Hospital and B R Singh Hospital. Two of them were identified as Manoranjan Mudi and Arindam Dey. Both had inhaled smoke, officials said.The name of the RPF constable could not be ascertained, said a fire services official."I am deeply shocked. The chief minister had been constantly inquiring about the fire fighters. We are with the families of the bereaved," said Bose.The building plan could have helped a lot, the fire services minister told HT.The fire had broken out at the 13th floor of the Eastern Railway’s office in the evening.The 13th floor houses the accounts office, said ER employees who evacuated the building. The person who was hurt did not sustain any major injury, they said.The fire was detected around 6.10 pm. The high rise called Koilaghata Building, is located beside the Hooghly river.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that Railway officials hadn't arrived yet. "You can see that no railway official has come here so far. It is their property and they have a responsibility," she said.Sujit Bose said one RPF personnel could be identified and one person could not be identified.The bodies were found scattered on the floor that caught fire.The Kolkata Police ASI was attached to the local police station."We should always be careful. During a fire we should not use elevators. I am sure those who went up were experts in their field. Probably they wanted to work fast. This is unfortunate," said the chief minister."Money cannot compensate for loss of life but the state government will stand by these familes. Each family will be given a job and ₹10 lakh," she said."The fire is now under control," she added."Railways have their fire-fighting team too. What happened to that? It's our men who did all the work. Not all those who died live in Kolkata. One of them live in Baranagar in north Kolkata, I was told. The families have been informed. They are coming," said the chief minister.ER chief spokesperson Kamal Deo Das said, "Online booking of tickets will start once the fire is completely doused and electricity cables are connected."Banerjee left the spot at 12.10 am. She also went to SSKM hospital to inquire about the injured."It is difficult to identify the bodies because all are badly charred. Two or three of the deceased can be identified by their colleagues. The post mortem examination, which is mandatory, can be done tonight but how can we hand the bodies to the families without identification?" Banerjee said at SSKM hospital where the seven bodies were taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-killed-in-blaze-at-multi-storeyed-building-in-kolkata-101615225559199.html
09-03-2021||India||Women deployed aboard Indian Navy warships after almost 25 years||The Indian Navy has deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years, with the service focusing on steadily opening more roles to them, people familiar with the development said on Monday. India’s only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and fleet tanker INS Shakti are the warships that have been assigned their first women crews since the late-1990s, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named. In a short-lived experiment, women from the navy’s logistics and medical branches were deployed on fleet tanker INS Jyoti in 1997. “Two women officers each have been assigned duties aboard INS Vikramaditya and INS Shakti. The numbers will only increase in the coming years with future warships having separate berthing facilities for women,” said a second official. While the aircraft carrier now has a woman air traffic controller and a logistics officer, the tanker’s crew includes a woman doctor and a logistics officer, he said. Excluding the medical wing in which women have served for decades, the navy accounts for 704 women officers who form 6.5% of the overall officer cadre. To mark Women’s Day, the navy on Monday released a video shot aboard INS Shakti with messages from the two women officers posted on the tanker. Also Watch | ‘To serve the nation’: IAF officers ask more women to join armed forces“They say women can’t have it all. But I would say dare to be different. The Indian Navy gave me the opportunity to be different and to dare,” said one of two women officers. The navy has progressively opened more roles to women over recent years. Last September, the navy announced that two women officers selected for the helicopter stream were set to become the first women in the navy’s history to operate from flight decks of warships and stay on board the vessels. The two lady officers, Sub-Lieutenants Kumudini Tyagi and Riti Singh, were among the 17 officers who were awarded wings on graduating as observers at a ceremony held in Kochi. As observers, the two women have been trained for a variety of roles including navigation, flying procedures, tactics employed in air warfare, anti-submarine warfare and airborne avionic systems. They are likely to be posted on warships by the year-end, said the second officials. They will serve on board maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare helicopters of the navy - currently Seaking choppers and later on MH-60R helicopters being bought from the United States. In 2019, Sub-Lieutenant Shivangi carved a place for herself in naval aviation history by becoming the first woman pilot in the navy. The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace, latest government figures show. There are 9,118 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament last month. One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-deployed-aboard-indian-navy-warships-after-almost-25-years-101615204097611.html

The state’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) was investigating the matter till now.The SUV was found abandoned on Carmichael Road, about 600 metres away from Antilia, the residence of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, with 20 gelatin sticks on February 25, causing a security scare. The Mumbai Police had subsequently released details of a letter found in the car, addressed to the Reliance chairman and his wife, claiming this was just “a trailer”. The SUV sported fake plates with the registration number of the lead car in the security convoy deployed for the industrialist’s wife Nita Ambani.Also Read | Autopsy report of owner of SUV found near Ambani’s house ‘reserved’The vehicle had been stolen from Vikhroli on February 17.An Innova, which was said to be following the Scorpio early February 25, is also being investigated. A self-proclaimed outfit Jaish-ul-Hind allegedly claimed responsibility for planting the explosive-laden SUV outside Ambani’s residence but security officials have rejected the presence of any such outfit in the country.A week later, the body of Hiran, the Scorpio owner, was recovered from Kalwa Creek (on March 5), hours after his family reported him missing. Hiren had reported the theft of his car on February 18.The Mumbai Police has registered a case of murder and criminal conspiracy in Hiren’s death.People cited above said the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has ordered the NIA probe as it has powers to suo motu hand over probes in scheduled offences under the Explosives Act or the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to the central agency without the consent of state government. However, it is not clear whether NIA will take over probe into the death of Hiran as well because MHA cannot suo motu hand over a murder probe to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nia-to-probe-recovery-of-explosive-laden-vehicle-outside-ambani-residence-101615201457312.html

People have doubts whether this is a murder or suicide and that doubt needs to be cleared at the earliest. Why was he murdered, for what reasons, who is responsible? The faster the home department brings out the truth about these questions it will be better for the image and reputation of this government,” Raut said.Hiran, the man who came forward to say the SUV found with some explosives near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, was a vehicle he had reported stolen on February 18, was found dead in Kalwa creek on Friday morning, hours after his family reported he was missing. Maharashtra Home minister Anil Deshmukh has transferred the case to Anti-Terrorism Squad.Raut further said that the opposition must not make the death of the man an issue to score politically over the government. “The suspicious death of a key witness in an important case is definitely shocking, especially as it happened during the legislative session. But I think it is inappropriate for the opposition to accuse the government till the investigation is over… We all want to know the entire episode.”The Sena leader backed the Mumbai Police and dismissed the demand for an investigation by the NIA. “The opposition has demanded that the probe must be handed over the NIA. But it is not that only they can uncover the truth. Mumbai Police is more than capable. Home minister Anil Deshmukh has handed over the probe to Anti-Terrorism Squad and all the officers in it are equipped to handle such cases.”On leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis’ allegation that Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze was connected with the case, Raut said, “I do not think it is appropriate to take the name of an officer and speak on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-capable-of-probing-mansukh-hiren-s-death-says-shiv-sena-101615013135244.html
