23-03-2021||Lucknow||Now, govt recognition mandatory for pre-primary schools in UP||There has been a big change in the rules of operation of pre-primary schools in Uttar Pradesh. Under this, all pre-primary schools running across the state must compulsorily get recognition from the Uttar Pradesh government for their functioning. The government has taken this step to clamp down on the hefty fees charged in the schools. As of now, no such recognition was needed to run any pre-primary or play school in Uttar Pradesh.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday has issued directives for the formation of a pre-primary unit under the ‘Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan’ to recognise the pre-primary schools and prepare a set of rules for pre-primary education. Apart from this, from the new academic session, pre-primary education will also be introduced in all the government Anganwadi centres and they will also be developed on the lines of pre-primary and playschools.Acting on the chief minister’s order, the department of basic education is now preparing a list of guidelines for all pre-primary schools.The government is aiming to curb the unethical practice of charging hefty fees ranging from ₹2500 to ₹1000 in more than 2000 play or pre-primary schools that are being operated in the state’s capital city Lucknow alone. Many localities have opened playschools in their houses or are taking classes in just two to three rooms and are demanding heavy fees from the parents. Besides, under the guidelines of the National Education Policy (NEP), the accountability of schools will also be fixed for the safety of children.Formation of a Pre-Primary UnitA pre-primary unit has been formed under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan to recognise pre-primary schools and frame a set of rules for the same. This committee will decide on standards and schemes related to pre-primary level education. Under the new rules, the government will include children from three to six years of age in formal education. Currently, children up to the age of 6 years are included in formal education from class one, an official said.Like council schools, Anganwadi centres for young children will be developed like playschools. For this, Anganwadi workers will also be trained by March 31. Private institutions will have to seek recognition from the Basic Education Council to open playschools. Around 1.89 lakh Anganwadi centres are being operated in 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh where children aged 6 years will be given education along with proper nutrition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-govt-recognition-mandatory-for-pre-primary-schools-in-up-101616521136842.html
23-03-2021||Gurugram||DHBVN’s grievance forum to be shifted from Hisar to Gurugram: Officials||The Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) has decided to shift the permanent office of the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam’s (DHBVN) grievance forum from Hisar to Gurugram, according to the officials.This move would help the electricity consumers in the city and neighbouring Faridabad, particularly those who have grievances related to the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN). One HERC spokesperson said that Gurugram and Faridabad have the maximum numbers of consumers, and the number of grievances were high. So, it was decided that the records and data of the Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum (CGRF) will be shifted to the city permanently, said the spokesperson.The grievance forum resolves the complaints of the electricity consumers, pertaining to bills, meters, connections, voltage fluctuations, and other issues related to power supply and more.The DHBVN has more than 3.7 million power connections, and the maximum consumers are located in Gurugram (570,000) and Faridabad (579,000). Given the large number of grievances, it was prudent to have a permanent office in Gurugram rather than having it in Hisar, said the HERC spokesperson, adding that the DHBVN also supplies electricity to Palwal, Rewari and Narnaul districts — that are also contiguous to Gurugram.The CGRF hearings used to take place in Gurugram, but for the benefit of the consumers, it was decided that the records will be shifted and based in the city permanently. “The maximum number of consumers are from here, so are the complaints lodged,” the spokesperson added.The entire record has been shifted to the permanent CGRF office in sector 16, the commission said.The forum will not only hear the complaints at its office but will also visit various circles under the jurisdiction of the DHBVN areas to redress issues raised by the residents.During the coronavirus-induced lockdown, a lot of residents had approached the forum regarding issues over delayed and inflated bills, particularly raised by the DHBVN . The large number of problems arising out of the recently launched digital electricity meters have also been submitted to the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dhbvns-grievance-forum-to-be-shifted-from-hisar-to-gurugram-officials-101616521076698.html
23-03-2021||Gurugram||Most meat shops shut, violators let off with warning||Officials said that 120 of the 129 meat shops remained closed during checks on Tuesday, as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) started to enforce the House decision to shut meat shops on Tuesdays.“Almost all the licensed meat shops operating in the city were found to be closed during our inspections. There were nine such shops which were found to be open, all in areas located in the vicinity of Sadar Bazar. Owners of such shops were let off with a warning this time and their shops were closed immediately. From next week, any violator will be immediately penalised,” said Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, the official responsible for issuing licences and penalties to meat shops in the city and ensuring norms compliance.Around 70 teams of the MCG and around 300 Gurugram police personnel scanned the city for open meat shops, officials said, and upon finding open ones near Sadar Bazar, alerted senior officials.According to MCG officials, the owners of all nine open meat shops were aware of the MCG’s direction. However, they had opened their shops hoping there would be no spot check or penalties.During an MCG House meeting on March 18, the civic body decided to close meat shops on Tuesdays after two councillors had floated the proposal citing religious sentiments. Despite the MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh stating that eating meat is a “personal choice” and the House should consider this before coming to a decision, the MCG approved the proposal as per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation by-laws, 2008, which permits the shutdown of meat shops on one day of the week.During last week’s House meeting, MCG officials also approved a proposal for increasing the fines for meat shop violations by 10 times, from ₹500 to ₹5,000 and permanently sealing a meat shop, if the owner commits three violations. MCG officials said that before next Tuesday, they will be issuing a notification regarding the change in the fine amount and then start sealing meat shops.Usha Kundu, the assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), Gurugram, said that around 300 personnel were deputed for the task, but did not find any open meat shop.“Our teams carried out inspections till the afternoon, especially in areas such as Jacobpura, Khandsa, Chakkarpur, and Badshahpur that have a sizeable number of meat shops. However, no meat shop was found to be operational. We also did not receive any receive report of any ruckus or complaints on the matter,” said Kundu.The MCG and Gurugram police were operating independently on the matter.“Across the city, almost all the meat shop owners complied with the MCG’s direction. The MCG needs to realise that more than 80% of the city’s meat shops are owned by local businessmen who operate their shops on a low scale. Their income and survival depend on the daily sale of meat. On Tuesdays, they had a sizeable amount of business and the MCG’s direction has put them under immense financial duress,” said Pritam Bhagat, president, Jacobpura meat shops’ association, adding that such small-scale owners do not have the wealth or the expertise to pursue the matter legally against the MCG.“I complied with the direction of the MCG, as I did not want me or my employees to face any trouble. Our business has been hit by the coronavirus and more recently, by bird flu. The MCG’s direction has only made things worse for us,” said Aftab Khan, a meat shop owner in Sector 12.MCG officials also clarified that only physical shops will remain closed while online meat delivery portals can continue to operate. On Tuesdays, such portals were found to be operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/most-meat-shops-shut-violators-let-off-with-warning-101616521018444.html
23-03-2021||Gurugram||Farmers’ protest enters Day 100||The farmers’ protest at Shahjahanpur-Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border continued for the 100th day on Tuesday. Protesting farmers’ groups said that they would be marking the completion of 100 days by thanking locals and other stakeholders, and will be observing a “Gratitude Day” on Wednesday. Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farmers’ unions protesting at Delhi borders, and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers would be marking the completion of 100 days of the ongoing agitation by expressing their gratitude for various people who had supported the protest in various capacities. “Our protest has received support from various quarters. We will be thanking locals from villages in the vicinity that pitch in with support whenever required. People who have their shops on this stretch have also extended cooperation in the past 100 days. We will be expressing our gratitude by garlanding them and giving a certificate to thank them,” said Madhav. Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September last year. Farmers fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Farmers from Rajasthan and Haryana started a sit-in protest at the Haryana-Rajasthan border on December 13, when they were stopped by the Haryana police from entering the state. Madhav said that protesting farmers will be thanking all allies and participants on Wednesday for sustaining the movement. “Our movement has received public support over the past several months. From Good Samaritans who pitch in with support through grocery and other essential requirements to local villagers and workers, people from different sections of the society have joined forces with us. Their contributions are invaluable,” said Madhav. He also shared that farmers camping at the site were preparing for Bharat Bandh that is scheduled for March 26. He said that the strength at the protest site would increase by leaps in April, after Holi. “The call for Bharat Bandh will once again mobilise people from different states and we expect the protest to get further intensified from thereon,” said Madhav. Protesting farmers also marked the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev on the occasion of Shaheedi Diwas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-protest-enters-day-100-101616521019072.html

The cases were registered at the Sector 10 police station.The DTCP, in its complaint, had said that the suspects were carving out an illegal colony in Sadhrana village in violation of various sections of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975, according to the police.

Also, subdividing the land is prohibited without approval, Bhath said, adding that the land on which the illegal colony was developed falls within the urban area limit of Sadrana village. As per the norms in such cases, a police officer, not below the rank of a sub-inspector, has the power to arrest the offenders, he said. “We have requested the police to keep vigil in this area and surrounding areas and bring instances of unauthorised colonisation to the notice of the department,” Bhath added. On February 24, 2021, the police had registered two cases against 18 landowners for allegedly developing an illegal colony in Farrukhnagar after a complaint was filed by the officials of the DTCP’s enforcement wing.Police commissioner KK Rao said, “Two cases were registered.

23-03-2021||Gurugram||1,000 EWS flats constructed in 2011 likely to be allotted in April||Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has initiated the process to renovate over 1,000 flats that were built under the Ashiyana Scheme in Sector 47 and have been lying vacant for almost a decade.The move comes after a direction from the chief administrator, HSVP, who has asked administrators across the state to ensure that flats built under the Ashiyana scheme are made ready by April 5 for allotment to beneficiaries. HSVP officials said that it is likely that the Haryana government will launch a statewide programme to allot these houses to eligible applicants by next month.HSVP had constructed 1,080 flats for economically weaker sections (EWS) and below poverty line (BPL) residents of the states, and the project was completed in February 2011. However, these houses have been lying vacant as they could not be allotted to eligible applicants due to discrepancies over allotment criteria and identifying allottees.As a result of the delay in allotments, HSVP officials admitted that the condition of these flats is bad and a major renovation drive is being planned so that these flats can be handed over to allottees. At present, the HSVP is working along with the district administration to identify allottees as well.As per the directions issued by the chief administrator, the flats need to be renovated by March 31, the allotment process completed by April 5 and details of successful applicants to be shared with the headquarters in Chandigarh by April 8, as it is likely the state government plans to launch this allotment scheme by the middle of the month, said authority officials.Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, said that the authority has already started working on identifying the eligible applicants and a lot of work in this regard has already been completed. “I have already visited the flats in Sector 47 and though the condition is not very good, the engineering cell has been asked to prepare an estimate on priority for renovating these flats. The work of identifying the eligible applicants is also the final stages,” he said.Yadav also said that similar flats built in Rewari will also be allotted and work is also on to renovate them. “The contractor who built the flats will be asked to renovate these houses. The project in Rewari is in far better condition,” he said.Under the ‘Housing for All’ campaign, the Haryana government has planned to launch several housing projects in the affordable category and for EWS and BPL category residents of the state as well as migrants.In January, the government had announced that it would build low-cost flats for those living in slum clusters and chose Gurugram and Faridabad districts for the pilot project. The government also launched a new rental policy whereby affordable housing projects can be developed to be rented to migrant and industrial workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/1000-ews-flats-constructed-in-2011-likely-to-be-allotted-in-april-101616521016732.html
23-03-2021||Gurugram||42-year-old man held for raping 14-year-old daughter||A 42-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping his 14-year-old daughter over the last year, the police said, on a complaint lodged by the girl’s mother.The accused, who works as a cab driver, would sexually assault his daughter whenever he found her alone at their rented accommodation in Sector 81. His wife worked in residential societies and used to return home late after cooking meals. The girl is the eldest of three siblings, said police.The girl’s mother, upon returning home late on Monday, found her daughter crying and after a while came to know of the repeated sexual assaults, as her daughter decided to confide in her, the police said.The accused is suspected to have raped the girl at least 15 times over the last year, according to the girl’s statement to the police on Tuesday.“The girl’s mother lodged a complaint against her husband on Monday following which we arrested him. He has been booked for rape and unnatural offences along with other relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,” said Krishan Kant, station house officer of Kherki Daula police station.The mother told the police that when she returned home from work on Monday night, she found her daughter crying. She could not muster up the courage to complain against her father but eventually told her. The accused also allegedly threatened her life and used to beat her as well, including on Monday, which left her in tears.According to the police, the girl asked her mother to move to another city as she did not want to live with the father anymore, fearing that he might sexually abuse her two younger sisters. “He was produced before the district and sessions court and has been sent to 14-day judicial custody,” said Kant.The police said that the man worked with a cab aggregator, mostly during the night.Sonia Yadav, a member of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), said that the girl is in trauma and requires several counselling sessions. “We counselled her on Tuesday and she was taken to Civil Hospital for a medical check-up.

23-03-2021||Gurugram||Mass antigen testing starts as Covid-19 cases continue to mount||The health department started mass screening for Covid-19 infections, using antigen tests, to identify locations where the Covid-19 infection is spreading fast, as Gurugram recorded 188 new infections on Tuesday, officials familiar with the developments said.“The current positivity rate – total confirmed positives out of the samples tested – of the district is less than 5%. Considering the rapid increase in Covid-19 infection, the department has started antigen testing camps under different urban primary health centres (UPHC) to identify locations where the infection has been prevalent,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. According to the health department bulletin, the overall count of active cases reached 1,088, the highest caseload in the last three months, leading to an immediate prioritising of mass testing. The overall tally of infections now stands at 61, 016. An antigen test is a speedy testing strategy that delivers results in 30 minutes. It easily detects cases having a high load of SARS-CoV-2 virus, but due to specificity issues, it misses infections with low viral levels. It, however, helps in telling or identifying areas where the virus is present in high concentration and more people are likely to get infected. Antigen camps will be organised at more than 115 sites till April 5 and on Tuesday, about 230 antigen tests were done, said officials, attributing the low number to a government leave, on the occasion of Martyrs’ Day. Since the beginning of March, the district has been reporting a constant uptick in coronavirus cases. From 343 active cases until March 1, the count has ballooned to at least 1,088, showing almost three times the rise in the infection. The spike has also added to the Covid-19 burden of Haryana. The active case count of the state reached 5,698 on Monday, which, until the first week of March, was around 1,200. To control the surge, testing has already been raised by 19% in the district. Data shows that almost 27, 554 tests have been administered from March 17 to 23, while at least 22, 316 were done from March 10 to 16. According to officials, over 14 contacts are traced and tested for every positive case. Data shows that about 75 people with moderate to severe illness have been admitted to hospitals, while nearly 925 active cases are in home isolated. The death toll remains at 361. Under each UPHC, camps will be held in different densely populated locations on different days. For instance, at Sector 31, camps will be held from March 27 to 29 at Chikitsa Charitable dispensary, Housing Board Colony and HSIIDC Apartment. Under Wazirabad UPHC, camps will be held at health department subcentres in Jharsa, Chakkarpur and the community centre in Sector 46. A large number of camps will also be held at Farrukhnagar, Sohna and old Gurugram areas of Mullahera, Basai, Kasan and Badshahpur, among others, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mass-antigen-testing-starts-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-mount-101616520897530.html
23-03-2021||Gurugram||Over 7,700 vaccinated across session sites, condominiums||On Tuesday, over 7,777 Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered at various vaccination sites, including condominiums, taking the overall count of vaccinated people in the district to 116,341. Officials said that vaccination will intensify from April 1 as the central government has permitted all citizens above the age of 45 to take the vaccine shot. “Until now, only those aged between 45 and 59 years with an existing illness were given vaccine shots. But as the vaccination will open for everyone above 45 years of age from April 1, the vaccination process will gain pace. For this, more session sites will have to be created in the district to cover people,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. He said that guidelines are still awaited from the state health department. In the district, footfall for vaccination at private hospitals has already declined. Only 1,974 (25.3% ) of the 7,777 took the vaccine jab at private hospitals, while 5,803 turned up for vaccination at government sites. On Monday too, of the 25,000-odd inoculations, more than 80% was at government facilities. To increase the coverage, the health department and private hospitals also set up vaccination camps at various condominiums. At Ardee City in Sector 52, Medanta Hospital registered around 100 people for vaccination at its clinic located on the premises. “People were registered with the hospital a day before the camp. It helped in streamlining the payment process at the site. But many people walked in directly at the centre and were registered at the spot,” said Dr Mehjwooba, internal medicine, Medanta, who was present at the site. Besides the vaccination staff, doctors were also stationed at camps to sign medical certificates for people above 45 years of age with existing illnesses. “Many people have come with diseases that are not in the list of illnesses mentioned in the medical certificate, such as neurogenic tumours. In that case, we mention the name of the disease in the certificate and vaccinate people. Only those people who are on anti-coagulant medicines have to get the certificate signed by their regular physician,” said Dr Mehjwooba. At The Palm Springs on Golf Course Road, a vaccination camp was set up by the health department and a doctor was stationed by a charitable trust, All India Human Development Council, to sign medical certificates at the site. Vishal Sinha, a resident of The Palm Springs, said, “A vaccination camp within the condominium is the easiest way to take the vaccine shot. The real benefit has been that you don’t have to visit a hospital for vaccination.” By 1pm, at least 18 people were vaccinated at the centre set up in the condominium club. Drives were also held at Silver Oaks in DLF-Phase 1, Maple Heights in Sector 43, The Pinnacle in DLF-5, and Vatika India Next in Sector 84. Citing a government holiday on Tuesday, on account of Martyrs’ Day, the health department did not release information on the overall footfall at these condominiums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-7-700-vaccinated-across-session-sites-condominiums-101616520896801.html

In case of any violation of conditions of Personal Home Licence, action may be taken against the licensee under relevant sections of United Provinces Excise Act,1910 and Indian Penal Code, he added.Mixed reactions from liquor sellersThe cap on home stock has evoked mixed reactions from liquor sellers.“I think the move will help generate revenue besides discouraging hoarding of liquor from states where it is cheaper,” said Kanhaiyalal Maurya, general secretary of Liquor Seller Welfare Association.“There are connoisseurs who love to stock up their bars with choicest liquor. The decision would hit us as people would be wary of purchasing for home. Moreover, the decision could always be misused to target people,” said a prominent liquor seller on condition of anonymity.“It’s like making people feel guilty or nervous while purchasing liquor,” said another seller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-fixes-limit-for-stocking-liquor-at-home-101616520356854.html

The ultra, identified as Krishna Yadav, was a member of extremist outfit People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI). He was on a two-day remand with Latehar police following his arrest. Latehar superintendent of police (SP) Prashant Anand said, “This is gross negligence and we will conduct a thorough probe into the incident to identify the culprits. We will also ensure exemplary disciplinary action against those found involved in this incident.”The incident has shocked people and brought security arrangements under scanner as the Balumath police station, from where the ultra escaped, is surrounded by wired fence and has a security guard at its only exit point round-the-clock.According to officials, the Latehar police brought Krishna, who was highly active in areas under Chanho and Khelari police stations in Ranchi as well as Chandwa and Balumath police stations in Latehar, to Balumath police station for interrogation. “After his two-day remand period ended, he was to be sent to jail on Tuesday,” informed a police officer.The PLFI ultra managed to escape when he was being taken by a security guard to the washroom.The SP, who was out of the district headquarters area to carry out anti-Maoist offensive in different parts of the district for past two days, said, “Several teams are conducting raids at all possible hideouts of the fleeing Maoist. We expected to nab him again very soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plfi-area-commander-in-police-remand-escapes-101616517896308.html
23-03-2021||Ranchi||Over 1 million people inoculated in state||Jharkhand on Tuesday achieved the feat of inoculating over one million people with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to the state health department’s bulletin. The milestone was achieved 67 days after the launching of the nationwide mass vaccination programme.The state recently ramped up pace of Covid-19 vaccination by organising special vaccination drives in three phases at the panchayat level this month. On Tuesday, the second phase of the two-day special vaccination drive was launched in every panchayat across the state.As many as 122, 262 people took their first jab on Tuesday, taking the tally of total number beneficiaries to 1.07 million (1,070,204), according to the health department’s bulletin of March 23.The state has so far inoculated 403,593 health care workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW), 546,026 senior citizens and 120,585 people aged between 45-59 years and having comorbidities. Out of the total HCWs and FLWs inoculated, as many as 224,934 have also taken their second dose.Since the beginning of the first phase of the nationwide mass vaccination drive on January 16 till February 26, the state vaccinated as many as 304,194 beneficiaries, that included only HCWs and FLWs.The vaccination exercise was kept suspended for two days on February 27 and 28 in order to prepare for the launch of the second phase, under which certain priority groups were included for inoculation.The second phase, that was launched across the nation on March 1, targeted citizens aged 60 years and above, and those aged 45 years and above with comorbidities, besides HCWs and FLWs. According to a a rough estimate, Jharkhand has to inoculate 35 lakh people in this phase.However, the Centre recently showed its dissatisfaction over slow pace of vaccination in Jharkhand, and asked state authorities to pull up their socks.Following this, Jharkhand chief secretary held a review meeting with various departments and others on March 10. It was decided that the state will now vaccinate 50,000 beneficiaries daily on an average.In order to achieve the target, the state health department decided to launch the three-phase special vaccination drive on March 20-21, March 23-24 and March 26-27 at the panchayat level.In the first phase, as many as 263,291 beneficiaries were given their first shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/over-1-million-people-inoculated-in-state-101616517596292.html
23-03-2021||Ranchi||Select Committee to review Bill reserving job in private sector for locals||The Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2021, which proposes to reserve 75% jobs in the private sector for locals, was on Tuesday sent to Select Committee of the Assembly for further review, as a number of legislators sought amendments to the proposal. The decision to send the Bill, which was introduced in the House by labour welfare minister Satyanand Bhokta, to the Select Committee was announced by chief minister, as six legislators, including two from the treasury bench, brought in amendment motions. “This bill is related to empowerment of locals and we are very concerned about it. I can see that 22 amendment proposals have been brought altogether from both sides. We are sending this bill to the Select Committee,” said Soren. The bill proposes to reserve 75% jobs in private establishments against such posts where the gross monthly salary or wages are not more than ₹30,000 or as notified by the government from time to time. Soon after the minister tabled the Bill, legislator Pradeep Yadav, who joined ruling Congress after split in his former party JVM(P), and CPI (ML) legislator Binod Singh, who is supporting the government from outside, jointly brought a motion, requesting the House to send it to the Select Committee. Singh argued that the copy of the proposed bill was provided to the legislators merely a day before and hence, they needed to review it as according to him, “it’s better to make adequate amendments than regret later”. Yadav, on other hand, objected to some clauses, including inclusion of certain technical aspects, exemption clause for private entities on certain grounds, besides ensuing that local social demography is taken care of in recruitment, as reservation for Scheduled Caste groups can’t be applied in a private entity. “Section 5 of the bill mentions exemptions that could be sought by companies with permission from the deputy commissioner concerned. This can be misused by companies. Besides, there needs to be a mechanism that representation of different social groups is maintained in recruitment, as the employer can employ persons from his or her own caste,” said Yadav. However, the motion was turned down by the House, as the Treasury bench was not impressed. BJP’s Amit Mandal proposed to include all companies including public sector undertakings in the ambit of the Bill. “Companies like ECL, BCL and and NTPC have major stakes. They should be brought into it,” he said. As other legislators continued with their amendment motions, CM Soren intervened and announced that the Bill was being sent to the Select Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/select-committee-to-review-bill-reserving-job-in-private-sector-for-locals-101616517476244.html
23-03-2021||Ranchi||State hikes age limit for tobacco consumption to 21 years||The state government has hiked the legal age for consumption of tobacco products to 21 years, besides banning hookah bars. This came after the state Assembly recently on Monday passed the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) (Jharkhand Amendment) Bill 2021, introducing amendments in the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003.Earlier, the legal age for consumption of tobacco products was 18 years, according to the Centre’s COTPA, 2003.The government also increased the fine for spitting in public to ₹1,000 from the existing ₹200, besides extending the ban on sale of tobacco products outside educational institutions to ban on sale of these products within a 100 metre radius of public places such as hospitals, health institutions, public offices and courts and educational institutions.Arguing in favour of the amendments, the Bill states that usage of tobacco products caused six out of every eight deaths in the state. It also said that around 40% of non-communicable diseases were a direct result of consumption of tobacco products.As per Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS-2017), atleast 59.7% of males, 17% females and 38.9% adults in Jharkhand either smoke or consume other tobacco products.In order to ensure complete ban on hookah bars in the state, the new Act, once notified, aims to impose a minimum fine of ₹50,000 and maximum up to ₹1 lakh, besides slapping a jail term up to three years and not less than one year. However, the offence will be bailable in nature.AJSU Party legislator Lambodar Mahto introduced an amendment, suggesting the government to increase fine for spitting in public to ₹10,000 and offence for opening hookah bars as a non-bailable one. However, the treasury bench turned down the suggestion and went ahead and passed the Bill as tabled.“Jharkhand is a poor tribal state. We have already increased the fine from ₹200 to ₹1,000. Slapping such a heavy fine will not be prudent,” health minister Banna Gupta said in the Assembly in response to Mahto’s suggestion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-hikes-age-limit-for-tobacco-consumption-to-21-years-101616517356302.html

Similar gaps were found in expenditure and capital expenditure too.“The finance department should rationalise budget preparation exercise so that the gap between budget estimates and actual is bridged,” the report has recommended. Similarly, the CAG has taken strong exception to non-reconciliation of balance in personal deposit ( PD) accounts, which are accounts opened in treasury where any special purpose vehicle, board, authority, agency, society constituted by state government could receive money in any form be it grant or loan.“Non-reconciliation of balances in PD accounts periodically and not transferring the unspent balances to consolidated fund of the state before the closure of financial year entails the risk of misuse of public funds, fraud and misappropriation,” the report has said.The CAG has, however, given credit to the state government for keeping the ratio of fiscal deficit to GSDP ( gross state domestic product) to 2.48% which was well within the prescribed limit of BFRBM (Bihar Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management act and 14th finance commission for the year 2018-19.On medical education in Bihar, the central audit body has given a thumbs-down to the government, observing that vacancies for physicians, Ayush doctors, dentists and nurses, were as high as 92 per cent, going by their numbers peer one lakh population.The audit observed that against the construction of 12 medical colleges (including a dental college) taken up during 2006-07 to 2016-17,only two medical colleges became functional till 2018. Construction of only two nursing institutes could be completed till 2018 against the planned 61. “Government of Bihar did not make effective efforts to increase seats of existing medical colleges,” CAG report has said. The audit body has also said that the shortage of teaching and non-teaching staff in all streams of medical education ranged from six to 56 per cent and eight to 70 per cent, respectively.Deficiencies have also been found in infrastructure of medical institutions, which also face shortage of medical equipment in 20 departments in test-checked five medical colleges (GMC Bettiah, DMCH-Darbhanga, IGIMS, Patna, NMCH Patna, PMCH ,Patna).Lastly, the CAG report on PSUs has pulled up the Bihar State Financial Corporation and Bihar State Warehousing Corporation for not placing the spate audit report to state legislature for one year and Bihar State Road Transport Corporation for last 32 years. The audit body has also detected shortcomings in the claims by DISCOMs of 100 per cent electrification in rural households by October 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cag-raps-state-for-loose-budget-control-ailing-medical-education-101616517176278.html

Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who also hit the street and courted arrest along with brother Tej Pratap Yadav, accused the state government of “murdering democracy” after police used water cannons and batons on protesting RJD workers.The RJD had given a call to protest across the state against unemployment, inflation, fuel price hike and problems being faced by the people due to the pandemic. Speaking to reporters during the protest, Tejashwi Yadav said, “Democracy is being murdered. The police used water cannons and lathis us and our workers on the orders of Nitish Kumar.”“Today, we remember Ram Manohar Lohia and Shaheed Bhagat Singh on their death anniversary. Lohiaji had said if streets remain empty then the government becomes rogue.Today, this dictator government lathi-charges us when we ask for jobs, arrests protesters. The government is fully corrupt.” Trouble began when demonstrators insisted on walking right up to the Assembly from JP roundabout near Gandhi Maidan. Police said RJD workers removed barricades between the JP Roundabout and Dak Bungalow and pelted stones on the police team, besides damaging windscreens of several vehicles.The police resorted to use of water cannons and fired tear gas to disperse the agitators. The clashes disrupted the traffic for nearly three hours, police said, adding that normalcy was restored after protesters were detained.The injured protesters were hospitalised and a few were rounded up for questioning, the police said.Patna’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Upendra Sharma said, “RJD workers were asked not to proceed towards the Vidhan Sabha because of Covid-19 restrictions and because the Bihar Assembly is in restricted area. But they resorted to violence and attacked the police.” RJD had sought permission from the district administration for the demonstration, but it was declined.“Don’t stop, don’t hold on or bend in front of autocratic government,” Tejashwi Yadav had tweeted on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjdworkers-clash-with-cops-tejashwi-tej-pratap-court-arrest-101616517056224.html
23-03-2021||Other||Bihar Special Armed Police Bill passed: Oppn runs riot, cops walk in to evict members||PATNABihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, was on Tuesday passed by the state’s Legislative Assembly without any debate amid unprecedented scenes during which police had to be called in to evict protesting members of the Opposition, which termed it as a “black bill”, ransacked tables and surrounded the Speaker’s chair.After over half a dozen adjournments, when the House resumed around 7.30 pm, in-charge home minister Bijendra Prasad spoke on the Bill and described the Opposition protests unfounded and the scenes in the House unwarranted. “There is nothing in the Bill that is not there. It is just to reduce dependence of central paramilitary force and create state’s own specialised force, which will also create job opportunities for youth,” he said.Later, chief minister Nitish Kumar, who also holds the portfolio of home, expressed his displeasure over whatever happened by “an uninformed Opposition bent upon creating misunderstanding about the Bill”.“Just the name of the Bihar Military Police (BMP) has been changed to Bihar Special Armed Police in keeping with its new role and changing requirements, which has also been done in many states. I would have been happy to hear the Opposition’s point of view and replied to their concerns, but this is not the way, especially the way they tried to disrupt the House and ransack the tables and chairs. They even prevented you (Speaker) from coming here. Still, I thank you for sticking to the day’s business despite such unprecedented scenes,” he said.“The bomb blast in Mahabodhi Temple premises is known to all. Now BMP is guarding it. More installations will be handed over to the force, but they also need powers to discharge their duty. After arresting anyone, they have to hand over the person to the police station, as is the case with police. A lot of wrong publicity has been done about it. I was a member of the Assembly in 1985 for the first time and I have never seen what happened in the House today, especially the role of new comers. They need training about legislative procedures,” he said.Earlier, as the standoff continued well past the scheduled time of 5 pm and the government was firm on getting the Bill passed, police and auxiliary police used force to bodily lift many of the members to take them out. Woman police was also called to whisk away protesting woman legislators from near the Speaker’s dais to clear the area.This angered leader of opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav, who even had an argument with the city SP over forcible removal of the Opposition leaders. He also got on to the dais arguing with police. Later, the police swarmed the well, set the chairs and table, but protests continued by the Opposition. The Speaker’s chair was surrounded at 7.32 pm, not by marshals but by police, a first in the Bihar Assembly.The Opposition later staged a walkout, while the Bill was passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-special-armed-police-bill-passed-oppn-runs-riot-cops-walk-in-to-evict-members-101616516936112.html

A poacher was arrested in Shahjahanpur on Tuesday and a rapid response team was set up in nearby Pilibhit district to target poachers. The accused identified as Luv Kumar was booked under anti-poaching laws and was the first case lodged in the district concerning Dudhwa Tiger reserve in Shahajahnpur since 2018, police said. Superintendent of Police (SP) of Shahjahanpur S Anand confirmed Luv’s arrest. “We recovered two black cobras and endangered tortoise from Luv Kumar’s possession. The arrest was made in a joint operation by forest officials and intelligence sources. The accused has confessed that the snakes recovered from him were endangered and were caught from bordering Dudhwa Tiger reserve. He said, he was planning to sell them to buyers.” Anand said. Meanwhile, officials at nearby Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) formed a dedicated team to act against poaching activities in reserve. The action came after death of five big cats in Dudhwa and Pilibhit Tiger reserve this year. Of these five tiger deaths, poaching activities might have led to the death of at least two tigers, officials said. They said the most recent death was reported from Kishangarh Wildlife Sanctuary in Dudhwa forest reserve on Sunday. The carcass has been sent for post-mortem investigation, but forest officials have not ruled out foul play. In PTR, a tigress died after being caught in a snare placed by poachers on March 11. The forest officials lodged an FIR of poaching at Jehanabad police station against a dozen people. According to experts the recent spike in poaching activities near the reserve are being seen after a gap of at least two years. “In PTR the last poaching incident was recorded in 2017 while in Dudhwa it was last reported in 2019,” said Zafar Iqbal an environmental activist. “The poachers take advantage of the very narrow, nearly non-existent buffer zone of the reserve that allows them to easily reach the core area and poach animals,” he added. Forest officials have now decided to put in place measures against poaching activities in the area. Divisional forest officer, PTR (social forestry) Sanjeev Kumar said, “We are working closely with local police and animal rights groups to identify possible poaching activities in the area. We have also sought help of the local intelligence units in identifying poachers who are active in nearby districts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poachers-on-forest-dept-s-radar-after-spike-in-tiger-deaths-101616515796002.html

Permission given earlier for such events also stands cancelled. The decision is part of the UP government’s measures for the containment of Covid ahead of the Panchayat elections and Holi, said officials. Officials stated that no processions will be taken out without prior permission and Covid test of all those coming in from high-incidence states will be mandatory. As per the guidelines applicable across UP, the responsibility of implementing precautionary measures like maintaining social distancing and wearing of masks by people participating in programmes will be on the organisers. Organisers (of public events granted permission) will not allow people above 60 or below 10 years of age or those with co-morbidities in such events, as per the guidelines issued by UP chief secretary RK Tiwari a day after the chief minister held a high-level meeting to discuss anti-Covid measures. The fresh directives mandate Covid tests of passengers at railway stations, bus stations and airports besides reactivating Covid helpdesks, running dedicated Covid hospitals in all districts and keeping other hospitals ready for any future needs. There is emphasis on identifying suspected cases with the help of thermometers and oximeters. The order also includes the announcement by the chief minister on Monday regarding schools. All divisional and district officials have been asked to declare Holi holidays in all private, government, and semi-government schools from March 24 to March 31. Holi holidays have also been declared in other educational institutions (barring medical and nursing colleges), and those places where exams are on. The chief secretary also directed that a nodal officer be deployed for every gram panchayat in villages and each municipal ward in cities. This nodal officer will coordinate with the nigrani samitis (vigilance committees) so that people coming outside get tested and stay home till test reports come. Tiwari also directed the state administration to ensure that there is no crowding at public places and asked the police to take all necessary measures. He also specified a guideline for jails, saying whenever a jail inmate goes out or returns, all protocols including social distancing be followed, and when an inmate returns, he or she should undergo Covid test first.

The court of Jagdeep Singh, special CBI judge, also imposed a fine of ₹1 lakh on the convict, who is currently posted as deputy director general in the Union department of telecommunications in New Delhi.He has been convicted under Sections 7, 13(1) (D) with 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.Alleging that Chandra Shekhar had sought a bribe from his firm, Hare Krishna Hare Rama, Gurgaon, for approving tenders for the laying of underground cables in Tosham and Kalanaur area of Haryana, complainant, Shiv Raj Khatana, had approached the CBI. A trap was laid and on June 3, 2004, the CBI had caught the BSNL official red-handed while accepting a bribe of ₹25,000. Another case of disproportionate assets was registered against him after ₹45 lakh more was recovered from his house. On Monday, the BSNL official pleaded for leniency, stating that he has never been convicted before and that his wife has cancer and is bed-ridden because of a fracture in the foot. However, special public prosecutor Jitender Kumar argued for maximum punishment.The judge observed: “No doubt corruption is a menace to the society and this menace is eating into the vitals of our society. In fact, it is the most serious internal threat to our nation.”He added: “The tentacles of corruption have spread far and wide and moral values amongst public servants have touched nadir. A corrupt public servant is the worst violator of the constitution of India. Corruption by public servants not only upsets the balance of society, but also works against aspirations of the people of India.”The judge awarded rigorous imprisonment of four years and fine of ₹1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2004-graft-case-rohtak-then-bsnl-general-manager-gets-4-yr-ri-for-accepting-bribe-of-rs-25000-101616514655923.html

Two students sustained minor injuries in the incident of brick-batting from both sides during the Holi revelry. However, the situation was under control, they said, adding that police force has been deployed on the campus to avoid further escalation of tension, they said. According to police, a student informed that that the inmates of both the hostels celebrated Holi, hurled ‘gulal’ and smeared colours on each other faces. However, the situation turned tense when an inmate of Birla hostel beat up an inmate of the LBS hostel in the afternoon. A senior police officer, who did not wish to be quoted, said that as students of LBS hostel came to know about the incident, they raised voice against the act of Birla hostel inmates which led to exchange of arguments. In the meantime, heavy stone pelting began from both sides. Two students suffered minor injuries in the incident, he added. On being informed, police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control. BHU proctorial board team along with BHU security guards also reached there and asked the hostellers to vacate the hostels in view of rising number of Covid-19 cases. “The attempt to create ruckus on the campus by some students is completely inappropriate,” said a member of the proctorial board. “Students have already been asked to vacate the hostels in view of rising cases of coronavirus,” said Rajesh Singh, public relation officer, BHU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhu-hostellers-clash-during-holi-revelry-101616513215844.html

The action follows complaints related to bogus registration at some of the sub registrar offices during the past two years. The property documents from 17 sub registrar offices of the total 27 have been checked and verified after the state revenue department issued an order to the effect. Considering the voluminous nature of documents to be scrutinised, the deadline to submit the report to the government has been extended from January 31 to March 31. The IGR officials investigating the case have laid focus on whether the builders who engaged in registration of property have Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) number, permission to construct from government authority and whether a plot of land was divided and sold off. During the early 2020, complaints were made to the Mantralaya alleging illegal registrations taking place in Pune in connivance with officials. The then Inspector-General of Registration and Controller of Stamps, Pune (IGR) Omprakash Deshmukh had stated that there were complaints regarding registration of properties of unauthorised constructions and illegal plotting. The IGR office formed squads to probe the case. Despite repeated attempts, IGR Shravan Hardikar did not respond to calls/messages. The office of state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat is yet to respond to queries. Earlier, the state government had received complaints, especially 1,000 of bogus registrations at the sub-registrar office, Hadapsar on a single day, in violation of the Real Estate Regulation and Development (RERA) Act, 2016.

Delhiites welcome new legal drinking age of 21||The Delhi government’s move to reduce the legal drinking age from 25 to 21 years has got glasses clinking in the Capital, as young Delhiites as well as restaurateurs feel the move has been long in the making. “Delhi was one of few states that had the higher benchmark of 25. Lowering the age to 21 is progressive and pragmatic. We had been requesting for this reduction for a long time and we are grateful to the state government which finally made this happen. This move will bring more footfall and revenue to Delhi and also compensate for the losses that the hospitality industry suffered during the last year,” says Delhi-based restaurateur Priyank Sukhija. Restaurateur Saurabh Khanijo concurs with Sukhija and adds, “This is a very welcome change which was a must. When the eligible age to get married is 21 then why should the age for drinking be 25? The idea that individuals need to drink responsibly applies to everyone at all times. Restaurants have to ensure responsible drinking for people above 25, and with the age now at 21, our responsibility remains the same. Besides, this is in line with the rules world over, where drinking age is even lower than 21.”Youngsters in the Capital are also elated at the news, and feel this will allow them to drink responsibly. “We can now enjoy our parties without any guilt! This move will help people buy liquor from stores instead of paying someone more money to buy it illegally. Also, I believe those under 25, who may be addicted to alcohol, can now seek help at various deaddiction centres without any fear,” opines Dhruv Barak, a final year Philosophy honours student at Delhi University. Anysha Kumar, another BA Programme final year student at St Stephen’s college in DU says, “It’s about time.

Following a call from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the farmer outfit observed the martyrdom day of the martyrs at Delhi’s Tikri border where thousands of farmers including women and youths paid tribute to the freedom fighters. Kalan added that the struggle against the three ‘black laws’ will continue till these were not repealed. “The youth and farmers have failed the nefarious moves of the Modi government to defeat the farmer struggle. The Centre tried to create a rift in the farmer struggle and then associating it only with a specific religion and finally unleashing a wave of police repression. All of such oppressive methods have been of no use,” he added.Union state vice-president Jaswinder Singh Longowal said that the Modi government was following the “divide and rule” policy of the country’s erstwhile ‘British masters’, against whom the martyrs launched a struggle and even sacrificed their lives.State general secretary of Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union, Laxhman Singh Sewewala said the country has been facing the problems of poverty, hunger, inflation, unemployment, debt and suicide, even after 74 years of transfer of power to Indian rulers.

"It was a part of the racket and completely illegal, hence a raid was conducted and arrests were made," said Fadnavis, who had held Home portfolio when he was the chief minister."Commissioner of Intelligence, Rashmi Shukla, had come to know about a similar activity and sought proper permissions from then ACS (additional Chief Secretary), Home, and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politicians," the BJP leader said.According to Fadnavis, the Commissioner of Intelligence had sent a report in August 2020 of intercepted suspicious calls to be involved in the transfer racket to DG Maharashtra. The report was later forwarded to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who "expressed concern but took no action"."When the DG inquired about the report, he got to know that it was sent to the Home Minister (Anil Deshmukh). No action was taken against the people involved but the action was taken against COI Rashmi Shukla who prepared the report.

23-03-2021||Chandigarh||In HP, Kaza woman pradhan takes on gamblers, litterbugs||At 12,500 ft, Kaza village in Himachal Pradesh’s tribal Lahaul and Spiti district is scaling new heights thanks to the initiatives of the local panchayat, led by a young and feisty woman pradhan (head) Sonam Dolma, to fight social evils such as gambling, littering and drinking in public places. Cracking the whip on gamblers and litterbugs, the gram sabha led by the 31-year-old pradhan recently imposed a fine of ₹40,000 for gambling and ₹1,000 for littering and open defecation. Besides, the panchayat has written to the administration to relocate two liquor vends outside the village and barred schoolchildren from whiling away their time at snooker parlours. “Gambling and card games had become a major problem in our area, so we needed to deal with it urgently. We decided to fine each violator ₹40,000,” said Dolma, who headed the Kaza Mahila Mandal before being elected to the panchayat. Last June, the Mahila Mandal made headlines for spearheading the movement in Spiti, banning the entry of outsiders in the tribal valley amid the Covid-19 lockdown. She along with women members stopped state agriculture minister Ram Lal Markanda from entering Kaza. The cases registered against them only strengthened their resolve till the government backed down. On the panchayat’s resolution to relocate liquor vends from the village, Kaza additional district magistrate Gian Sagar Negi said: “The request has been forwarded to the excise and taxation department for consideration.” Snooker parlours to be open from 10am to 6pm Kaza, which is the headquarters of Spiti valley, is a big draw with tourists. With brawls and fights on the rise at such parlours, the gram sabha set new timings. “Snooker parlours run till late at night in the area and mostly schoolchildren play there. Often, they pick up fights,” Dolma said, “so it’s been decided that the snooker palours will remain open only between 10am and 6pm.” The entry of schoolchildren will be banned at such parlours. “If a minor is still caught playing snooker, the operator will be fined ₹5,000,” she said.

23-03-2021||Mumbai||SC to hear tomorrow Param Bir Singh’s plea seeking CBI probe against Anil Deshmukh||The Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear a petition filed by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh whom he has accused of running an 'extortion racket.'Also Read | Param Bir Singh moves Supreme Court for CBI probe against Anil DeshmukhA two-judge bench of the top court, comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhash Reddy will take up the plea filed by Singh, who was transferred last week by the Maharashtra government to the Home Guards, for "mishandling" the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case.In his petition, filed on Monday, the senior police official also sought a stay on his transfer. Singh has alleged that he was transferred to the "low-key" post in the Home Guards "immediately after" he brought Deshmukh's alleged corrupt practices to the notice of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders of the state government."The petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court to seek unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of Government of Maharashtra, before the evidence are destroyed," Singh's writ petition, filed through advocate Abhinay, said.In his letter to Thackeray, mailed on March 20, the senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer had alleged that Deshmukh had directed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore per month from hotels, bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Singh had mentioned meeting Deshmukh and Vaze "in and around mid-February and thereafter" at the home minister's residence. It was at these meetings, the officer alleged, that Vaze was tasked with collecting the money.Vaze is currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which is handling the Ambani bomb scare probe and the related Mansukh Hiran death case.Both Deshmukh and his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have denied Singh's allegations, with the minister even threatening to file a defamation case against him. Both have cited Deshmukh's Covid-19 diagnosis in February to counter Singh's claims.Besides the NCP, Maharashtra's ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprises the Shiv Sena and the Congress. NCP chief Sharad Pawar held press conferences on Sunday and Monday, backing his party colleague Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-to-hear-tomorrow-param-bir-singh-s-plea-seeking-cbi-probe-against-deshmukh-101616502963484.html
23-03-2021||Delhi||Will Delhi’s excise reform end the theka raj?||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia likened liquor shops to jails as he announced sweeping changes to the excise policy on Monday that will allow the private sector to fully take over liquor retailing in Delhi. The policy, among other things, envisages new super-premium liquor shops for high-value products.“When you go to a shop, there is a grille and people rush and throw money to buy liquor. There is no dignity. It will no longer be like that.”A government report on the policy, a copy of which HT has seen, refers to a slew of measures to ensure this. It seeks to improve the buying experience and includes a rule that will need any liquor shop in the city to be at least 500 square feet in size. The shops have to be spacious to allow customers a walk-in experience. The report says the shops cannot have counters facing towards roads. Shop owners will have to ensure that liquor sale and pick-up takes place properly inside the shop premises and there is a proper order outside.Also Read | Delhi reduces age bar in major liquor reform“The retail shopping experience for an average customer in Delhi is very pathetic. The scene outside any government vend resembles a zone of a mob craving liquor. The customer has no choice to choose any product and large-scale brand pushing and extra charging happen rampantly. The customers are made to feel like criminals,” the report says.Brand pushing refers to a practice of suppressing certain brands and pushing others, often at the behest of colluding manufacturers and retailers.The government seeks to end the current environment around liquor shops which is particularly bad for women.“The super-premium vends can set up a tasting room within the premise which will have to be an enclosed area, not visible from the rest of the store. This room can only hold training and tasting sessions. The licensee is permitted to have a shop-in-shop concept for exclusive display of various brands in exclusive shelves so that the customers can walk-in into the display for their selection of products,” says the report.Ankita Kumar, who works with an event management firm, said the new policy if implemented will bring changes to the retail experience of alcohol purchase and also help to gradually reduce the stigma attached. “Currently, the whole environment near a liquor shop is very masculine. I often start doubting if I have come to a place I am not supposed to be in. It is quite unsafe as well. I have been a victim of stalking once when I went to a liquor store in my locality to purchase a few bottles with a friend,” she said.Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, said the rules would mean all the government liquor shops would go and new private ones will be opened instead.“The government has to ensure that the demand-supply chain is not affected during the transition to full privatisation of the liquor retail sector. The proposed rules also suggest that mostly the big players will be able to get ownership of retail vends even as manufacturers have been strictly asked to stay away from the retail business,” he said.Officials said keeping big players in retailing will ensure that quality liquor is sold, and the store standards are not compromised with.The rules seek to end the entire ecosystem that automatically comes up when a liquor shop is opened. “If you see the city’s liquor shops now, invariably they are lined with tiny shops selling snacks, cold drinks, plastic glasses, cigarettes among other things. This leads to crowding of a particular gender [men] around liquor vends and ruins the entire experience, especially for women and even the passer-by,” said an official, requesting anonymity.“…[there is] an additional condition that the licensee will have to ensure no dry snacks or cooked food outlet gets opened right outside the shop, which encourages people to drink and loiter around,” the official said.The report says that retail shops can be opened in any of the markets, malls, commercial roads/areas, local shopping complexes, etc as long as the standard rules and regulations of opening a new vend are followed. This includes restrictions on opening vends within a specified distance of schools, religious institutions.A second official pointed out the entire system of a “theka” will not completely go away.“These reforms do not mean that country liquor is being banned in Delhi. The government is preparing a separate report on the operational models for the sale of country liquor in the city which will be completed in a few weeks.” The second official said basically, the reforms imply that by and a large majority of the liquor stores in Delhi are set to become bigger and more welcoming in their appeal. “…a few stores selling country liquor shall remain across the city. We hope this will boost not just the liquor and food and beverage industry, but also the excise revenue of the government by ₹1,500-2,000 crore.”The population-to-vend ratio in Delhi is one of the lowest in the country. Delhi has 849 liquor shops. Yet around 58% of Delhi is either unserved or underserved. Only 8% area of the city is normally served.“Equitable distribution will ensure less crowding and easy access which will automatically improve customer experience. To make liquor more accessible to people, it is proposed that Delhi will be distributed into 32 pre-defined zones and each zone will have three categories of liquor stores depending on high, medium, and low sales,” the second official said.Each zone will mandatory have at least two vends in every allocated ward. The remaining will be categorised as freehold, This means that they could be set up in any of the wards under that zone. For clarity, a zone with 27 vends allocated across nine wards will imply that each ward will need to have two vends mandatory. It would make 18 vends as mandatory vends and the remaining nine vends freehold, the report says.A former excise commissioner, who did not wish to be named, said the proposed rules will potentially overhaul the excise sector of Delhi completely. “…the government’s plans appear to have a holistic approach addressing the loopholes in the liquor business of Delhi. In the past, there were a few attempts by the excise department to exit the retail business, but the government at that time had apprehensions about completely letting go of its control from the sector,” the former commissioner. “Another aspect that is interesting is that the government has allowed liquor retailers and wholesalers to offer discounts. This is something which a few excise commissioners had rooted for in the past, while most others had rejected it saying it would result in revenue losses to the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-delhi-s-excise-reform-end-the-theka-raj-101616503015759.html

23-03-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: Of hostage negotiators in city markets||Hostage negotiators would have a hard time in Bangalore, because folks here upend the whole logic of negotiation with their bargaining. In any negotiation, goes the business saying, you have to create a win-win situation for everyone. That is anathema to the folks on Avenue Road in Bangalore, whose idea of bargaining is more like a sumo wrestler bringing his opponent to heel. The goal is to pummel the opponent, who in this case, happens to be a hapless shopkeeper.Do you know how to bargain — for vegetables, clothes, jewels or electronics? If you are under 20, I would wager not.Some of the reasons why this generation is entirely without bargaining skills have to do with the speed of transactions and the way the shopping experience is set up. Either you shop exclusively online as we all have done last year. Or you go to the mall, zip through several stores, and pay what they ask. It’s fast, efficient, and it works. So why waste time haggling?This particular argument holds no merit for compulsive bargainers like my aunt, Lily. To them, bargaining is not a transaction, a means to an end. It is like drinking Horlicks after doing your homework. It is a way to add sweetness to a chore. The actual money involved is almost beside the point. This was what I found out at a jewellery shop on Commercial Street.Also Read | Bangalore Talkies: The art of negotiation—Commercial Street editionThere is a cost, of course. Shopping with Lily Aunty takes four hours longer than usual and usually ends up in a cloud of insults combined with an ingestion of antacid upon return to the house.So when I called Lily Aunty to help me buy a beautiful silver dinner set, I imposed a set of rules. She couldn’t feign heart attacks. This was the time of Covid and it wasn’t fair to do this to people. Second, she claimed to be related to Shilpa Shetty, Aishwarya Rai, or Deepika Padukone. She was a Bunt from Mangalore but that didn’t make her a movie star. Third, she had to open negotiations at 50 per cent of the asking price, not 5 per cent, as is her wont. Fourth, she had to stop cursing in Konkani. This was the best jewellery store in Bangalore, I said, not some Mangalore fish market where she had cut her bargaining teeth.Lily Aunty looked wounded at the last phrase. “What do you know about buying fish, you vegetarian?” she ground out from between clenched teeth. “It is harder to buy quality fish in Mangalore than it is to buy silver in Bangalore.”“Aunty, I mean it this time,” I warned just before we entered. “This shop is not some cottage emporium, okay. I don’t want them to blacklist me because of your behaviour.”“Look how you are standing,” Aunty scolded. “Like some foreigner.”It was true. My stance was defensive. I protected my space, rather than aggressively hogging it. My tone was matter-of-fact rather than truculent, outraged, or ideally, a combination of both. My attitude indicated my willingness to negotiate.“Negotiation has no place in shopping,” pronounced Aunty. “Negotiation means compromise. We want to bend them to our will.”I had unleashed the serpent, I realised. What now?“Understand one thing,” said Lily Aunty. “Words are cheap, particularly in India. People don’t say what they mean, and nothing is what it seems.”This I knew from a previous experience. When we were wedding shopping for a cousin, Lily aunty entered a saree store in Chikpete. She ran a practised eye over the silk sarees behind the glass counter, pronounced them to be “rubbish” and demanded to be taken to the back room where the “real stuff” was. The weird thing was that the salesmen gave her more respect after her rudeness, brought her soda and kolbada and fussed over her like she was Saroja Devi or Bharati Vishnuvardhan.When I attempted such assertiveness, my statements came out like a croak and I was asked to take my business elsewhere.So we walked in. And there was the silver dinner set that I had kept on hold. The shopkeeper took one look at Aunty, squared his shoulders, and smiled wanly. He had met a worthy match.Egged on by her hot breath on my shoulder, I took a deep breath and simulated the light-headed feeling that comes at the tail end of a 16-hour long intermittent fast.“Eshtu?” I drawled, flicking a dismissive finger at the sparkling offerings I coveted. “How much is this set worth?”“One lakh,” said the shopkeeper without blinking.Lily Aunty snorted. I glared at her and pretended to laugh derisively, like Kannada superstar Yash does in the movie, M.rand Mrs Ramachari.“Ree (which is the Kannada equivalent of ji), don’t joke, ree,” I said.“Would I lie to you, Akka?” He had called me his sister. Game on.“This is an heirloom set. Custom piece. Only one in entire Bangalore. I would happily give it to you for free, but my boss will kill me.”“And my mother will kill me if I buy it for anything more than ₹30,000,” I said.“Nanjudeshwara!” he said, throwing up his arms prayerfully. “How you joke, sister? Do you know what this is? Silver. Not stainless steel.”I ended up paying ₹70,000 for the set. Lily Aunty insisted that I had overpaid by ₹50,000, but I was jubilant. In my mind, I had found a bargain.“Go back to Ulsoor market,” said Lily Aunty witheringly. “Start with vegetables. That is the nursery school for bargaining. Then work your way up to silver.”As we paid, Lily Aunty delivered the final verdict. She stared scornfully at the shopkeeper. “You made a mistake, my friend,” she said. “If you had given a good price, this silly girl would have bought a set for 12 people.

23-03-2021||Mumbai||‘What did Param Bir Singh, Sachin Vaze discuss for 3 hours before arrest?’: NCP||Adding to the war of words between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s corruption charges against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, minister Nawab Malik on Tuesday questioned why the top cop met Sachin Vaze before his arrest in the Mansukh Hiran death case.“What did Singh discuss with Sachin Vaze for three hours before he was arrested in the Hiran case?” Malik asked soon after BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis’s press conference in which the former chief minister further raked up the “discrepancy” in NCPs statements on the matter.Fadnavis was referring to NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s statements on Monday which implied that Deshmukh was in Nagpur between February 5 and February 27 after he tested Covid-19 positive. However, in a video message earlier in the day the state home minister said he flew to Mumbai for home quarantine from February 15 onwards.Also Read: Anil Deshmukh reiterates Sharad Pawar’s remark on quarantine, one detail changedThe confusion comes in the backdrop of a letter by Param Bir Singh, who was recently removed from his post, to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging Deshmukh met Vaze in February regarding the extortion of ₹100 crore a month from Mumbai’s restaurants and bars. Vaze has been suspended after his arrest.On Deshmukh’s February meeting with Vaze as claimed by Singh, Fadnavis produced police records of the minister’s movement when he was reportedly under home quarantine. “Sharad Pawar saheb yesterday said that Deshmukh was home quarantined from February 15 till the end of the month. But the police records show that he attended meetings at Sahyadri guest house on February 17 and 24. Pawar saheb has been given wrong information and thus, his attempts to shield Deshmukh have failed,” he said.Fadnavis also claimed that Thackeray overlooked a “very sensitive and explosive” report regarding the alleged corruption in transfers of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers submitted by the director general of police (DGP). He told reporters that the then commissioner of intelligence, Rashmi Shukla, reportedly intercepted some phone calls pertaining to police transfers and submitted a report to then DGP Subodh Jaiswal who subsequently sent it to the state government on August 25, 2020.Following this, Malik alleged that Shukla was illegally tapping the phones of certain people and said that 80% of police officers mentioned in her report were not transferred. He asserted that police transfers are done as per recommendations of DGP and a police establishment board.The minister accused Fadnavis and BJP of trying “other methods to pull down the Maha Vikas Aghadi government since they failed to lure our MLAs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/what-did-param-bir-singh-sachin-vaze-discuss-for-3-hours-before-arrest-ncp-101616490199611.html

Experts are of the opinion that the government of India should focus more and more on vaccination.Public will be safe from corona only with maximum vaccination,” he said in a series of tweets.Gehlot said that everyone should be vaccinated by removing age restriction.Referring to the opinion of Dr Devi Shetty of Bengaluru, the chief minister said it seems reasonable that people in the age group of 24 to 45 years should also be vaccinated soon as these people step out of home for work and can become super spreaders.“India also has a large number of vaccine production capacities that should be used,” he added.The chief minister appealed to the Centre to provide more vaccines to the states so that the second wave of corona infection can be controlled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/remove-age-restriction-for-covid-19-vaccination-says-ashok-gehlot-to-centre-101616490145658.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||NCP counters Fadnavis’ corruption claims, alleges illegal phone tapping||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) countered the allegations of corruption in police personnel transfer made by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis citing a report of former DGP Subodh Jaiswal and phone call records. The ruling party claimed that transfer of 80% of the police officers mentioned in the report didn’t take place and former intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla illegally tapped the phones of people. He also said that Shukla was tapping the phones of all the political leaders even when the state was facing a crisis over government formation in 2019 after the state assembly elections.NCP chief spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik also alleged that both Shukla and Jaiswal were working for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the erstwhile BJP-Shiv Sena government. He said the party is trying other methods to pull down the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government since they failed to lure the coalition’s MLAs.Also Read | Fadnavis demands CBI probe in alleged corruption in police transfersMalik was responding to the allegations made by the former chief minister.Malik, who is also minority affairs minister, clarified that police personnel are transferred as per recommendations of two boards of police establishment, one headed by additional chief secretary, home, and another by the DGP himself. The first board looks after the transfer of senior officers and second of the junior officers.“BJP pulled down governments in Karnataka, Uttarakhand, northeast India and Madhya Pradesh, but it failed to pull down the MVA government by luring our MLAs in the state. Now they are trying to bring down the MVA government by defaming [us] and creating sensation with false allegations,” Malik said.“According to Jaiswal’s report, there was corruption in police personnel transfers, but transfer of 80% of the police officers mentioned in the report didn’t take place at all. Rashhmi Shukla, who prepared this report also tapped phones of the people involved in the alleged racket with permission from ACS, home, according to Fadnavis. Here again, it is not right as she didn’t obtain permission and tapped phone records illegally, which is a crime,” Malik said.“This is not the first time she was tapping phones. We have information that she was tapping phone calls of all the political leaders when the state was facing a crisis over government formation (in 2019),” Malik alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-counters-fadnavis-corruption-claims-alleges-illegal-phone-tapping-101616490174898.html
23-03-2021||Chandigarh||81% of 401 samples from Punjab show UK variant: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||With 81% of the latest 401 samples sent by the state for genome sequencing turning up positive for the new UK Covid variant, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday appealed to the people to get themselves vaccinated, even as he urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to widen the vaccination ambit to cover those younger than 60 since this mutant has been found to be infecting young people more.Expressing concern over the emerging situation, the chief minister stressed on the need for the central government to urgently open up the vaccination for a bigger section of the population. The process needs to be expedited, he said, pointing to the fact that experts had found the existing Covishield vaccine to be equally effective against the UK variant, B.1.1.7. It was essential to vaccinate more and more people to break the chain of transmission, he said.Also read: India’s Covid-19 infections, deaths, active cases: Today’s data decodedCapt appeals to people to adhere to safety protocols Captain Amarinder also urged the people to strictly adhere to all Covid safety protocols, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. The state government, which has already announced fresh restrictions, would be forced to impose more curbs if the people do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, he warned.The appeal from the chief minister came after the state’s Covid expert committee head, Dr KK Talwar, apprised him of the developments on the new variant in the state, which has been witnessing a surge in the number of Covid-19 positive cases during the last few weeks.More infectious yet not more virulent The state health department had sent 478 Covid positive samples to NIB, IGIB, and NCDC for genome sequencing, of which the results of 90 samples were received and those showed only two samples for N440K variant.Subsequently, a team from the ministry of health and family welfare, Government of India, visited the state to review the increase in positivity. The team was informed about the pending results of genome sequencing.Thereafter, 401 more samples, collected between January 1, 2021, to March 10, 2021, were sent to NCDC for genome sequencing. The result of these samples was worrying as it showed the presence of B.1.1.7 variant in 326 Covid samples, said Dr Talwar.The Chief Minister said he had been informed by Dr Talwar that though this UK variant, B.1.1.7, is more infectious yet not more virulent. Further, the Oxford (Covishield) vaccine is equally effective against this new UK variant.The B.1.1.7 variant is now spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, representing 98% of the new cases in the UK and 90% in Spain. The UK authorities have suggested it is up to 70% more transmissible than the original virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/81-of-punjab-covid-samples-show-uk-variant-101616487894624.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Stan Swamy part of organisation that wanted to create unrest: NIA court||The special NIA court on Monday rejected Father Stan Swamy’s bail plea, observing that he was a member of an organisation that “hatched a serious conspiracy to create unrest in the entire country and to overpower the government.”Father Swamy was arrested on October 8 last year for allegedly being part of a conspiracy in connection with Bhima Koregaon case. He had moved a bail plea in November claiming he had been falsely implicated due to the nature of his writings about the caste and land struggles of the people in India and research on undertrial adivasis.While rejecting the bail plea, the special judge DE Kothalikar said, “The material placed on record thus prima facie denotes that the applicant was not only the member of banned organisation Communist Party of India (Maoist) but he was carrying out activities further in the objective of the organisation which is nothing but to overthrow the democracy of the nation.Therefore, I do not find merit in the submissions made by the learned advocate for the applicant that only because of membership of banned organisation the applicant cannot be detained in jail, is not acceptable.”Also Read | NIA says Mehbooba Mufti key player in terror funding caseThe prosecution, while objecting to the bail, cited around 140 emails and letters exchanged between Father Swamy and other accused persons such as Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha. The NIA also claimed that Father Swamy was a “staunch supporter of the activities of the organisation, which is a frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist).”Father Swamy denied his role in the conspiracy and also cited his age and ailments as grounds for bail.The court discarded the plea of his old age observing, “The collective interest of the community would outweigh the right of personal liberty of the applicant and as such the old age and/or alleged sickness of the applicant would not go in his favour, so that the discretion to release the applicant can be exercised in his favour.”The court refused to refer to a report from a Massachusetts-based digital forensics firm, Arsenal Consulting, which claimed that just a few hours before arrest of one of the accused Rona Wilson, his computer was tampered with. The court said “such extraneous material is not required to be considered while deciding the application for bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stan-swamy-part-of-organisation-that-wanted-to-create-unrest-nia-court-101616485554433.html

The retired armyman, identified as Mukesh, was singing songs with his friends in an agricultural field when the assailants arrived, asked them about a person, and then opened fire at him. At least five bullets were fired, of which three hit Mukesh, killing him on the spot, the police said. Police suspect the murder of Mukesh could be a case of mistaken identify and the real target of the assailants may be his brother, who has a criminal past. “There is a possibility that the assailants had come looking for Mukesh’s brother but they ended up killing Mukesh,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena.

23-03-2021||Mumbai||Will ex-top cop Sanjiv Bhatt’s allegations against Modi be probed: Shiv Sena||Pushed into a corner over allegations against the Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, the ruling Shiv Sena went into an offensive on Tuesday against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying that former Gujarat IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt made serious allegations against then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and asked if the law ministry will take action based on the letter now. “If a letter from a police officer is used to seek a government’s dismissal or home minister or chief minister, then I ask those who created the ruckus, BJP and Ravi Shankar Prasad, the law minister, Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS officer and one other officer, has repeatedly written such ‘letter bombs’ against the Gujarat government. Are you going to take action against then chief minister and current chief minister based on the letter? The allegations made by Sanjiv Bhatt were even more serious than Param Bir Singh’s. But you have put Bhatt behind bars,” Raut told reporters in New Delhi.Former policeman Sanjiv Bhatt accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, of complicity in the 2002 communal riots, and was jailed for life on June 20, 2019 for the death of a man in custody in 1990. Meanwhile, Singh was recently removed as the Mumbai police commissioner over alleged mishandling of a bomb scare case near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. Singh wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray a few days ago, alleging that Deshmukh asked Sachin Vaze, a suspended policeman who has been arrested in connection with the case, to collect ₹100 crore from various establishments in Mumbai. The bomb scare case is being handled by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Deshmukh said that the former Mumbai top cop is trying to save himself.Also Read | SC likely to hear ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s petition on March 26Raut said that the letters written by Bhatt should be brought out and discussed. He said that the Sena has the letter and asked if Ravi Shankar Prasad will take action. “The letter should be excavated by them or we will provide them the letter. We have the letter [by Bhatt] and will send it to the law minister, he should study it.” Ravi Shankar Prasad had addressed a press conference on Singh’s allegations in Bihar two days ago and said that there must be a fair probe into the allegations by an outside agency.A day after Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said that there was no need to seek Anil Deshmukh’s resignation, Raut said that Pawar spoke based on information and his assessment was “logical”. “There are no different [stands] of either the Shiv Sena or NCP. It is a government decision. If Pawar saheb has put forward some point, then I believe that it is the government’s stand,” Raut said.On Singh’s move to approach the Supreme Court and seek a probe into his allegations by a central agency, Raut cited former Chief Justice of India and Rajya Sabha member Ranjan Gogoi’s statements that the Supreme Court works under pressure and is used like Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation. “It is good that Param Bir Singh has gone to the Supreme Court. Retired Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who is a Rajya Sabha member, had said that nobody gets justice in Supreme Court and it works under pressure. If Singh wants to get his work done through this pressure, he can do so,” he said.When asked if the state government will order a probe into Singh’s letter, Raut said that the government will decide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-ex-top-cop-sanjiv-bhatt-s-allegations-against-modi-be-probed-shiv-sena-101616482554287.html
23-03-2021||Chandigarh||Rain, strong winds leave wheat, kinnow growers in Punjab worried||Rain accompanied with strong winds on Tuesday flattened wheat crop nearing maturity and caused damage in kinnow orchards where trees are in the flowering stage in south Punjab, leaving growers worried. Farm experts say irrigated wheat fields may suffer up to 10% drop in yield and losses are feared only if the crop witnesses heavy rain or hailstorm. According to the Punjab Agricultural University’s observatory at the Bathinda-based regional research centre, south Malwa witnessed winds with a velocity of 40-45km/hour early on Tuesday. “Most parts of the region experienced light showers. South Punjab may witness winds with 20km/hour velocity and another spell of showers is forecast by Tuesday night,” said Raj Kumar, an agrometeorology scientist at PAU. Wheat farmers want crop loss assessed Farmers such as Tejinder Singh of Gobindpura village in Bathinda district have expressed the fear of a comprehensive loss of his wheat crop sown on seven acres. “I was hoping for a good wheat harvest, but the winds have led to lodging of the crop,” he said. Another wheat grower, Hakam Singh, said the government should initiate crop loss assessment to support farmers ahead of the harvesting season. “Inclement weather will lead to a loss of more than 25% of the produce. Grains were in the final stage of maturity and harvesting is expected to begin in a fortnight,” said the elderly farmer. Can regain position if weather stays clear now: Kinnow grower Abohar-based orchardist Arvind Setia said the sudden change in weather had affected the kinnow trees. “The citrus orchards are at the flowering stage and stormy weather for more than three hours past midnight has done considerable damage to the crop that is at the initial stage. Kinnow plants have another week of flowering. We can regain the position if the weather does not get rough again,” Setia said. GP Singh, the director of the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, an Indian Council of Agricultural Research laboratory, in Karnal, said the present climatic condition is not hostile to wheat. “Irrigating wheat fields at a time when harvesting is less than three weeks away, is not recommended. Limited crop loss may be recorded in the waterlogged fields but overall, the ongoing climatic conditions are highly conducive. We expect a record pan-India production of 112 million metric tonnes of wheat,” said GP Singh. Farmers told to drain out water from fields to reduce damageFarmers of Majha region fear the lodging of wheat in Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts due to rain and strong winds on Tuesday may reduce the crop yield.Teams of the state agriculture department are conducting a survey to ascertain the damage.Amritsar chief agricultural officer Kuljit Singh Saini, who holds the additional charge of Tarn Taran, said, “I’ve visited the affected areas. The rain and winds have definitely damaged the crop because it was close to maturity. Farmers are advised to drain out water from fields to lessen the damage.”Wheat has been sown on 1.84 lakh hectares in Tarn Taran and almost the same area in Amritsar district.Pargat Singh, a farmer of Loharka village in Amritsar, said, “We are at the mercy of the weather.”(With inputs from HTC, Amritsar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-strong-winds-leave-wheat-kinnow-growers-in-punjab-worried-101616480874677.html

To do so, the civic body has demanded 1 million units of indigenous vaccine, Covaxin.BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal has set a target to vaccinate 4.5 million people in the next 45 days. This means that the city’s 95 vaccination centres will have to collectively vaccinate one lakh people everyday. To achieve the target, BMC will require more number of vaccine doses.“We want to fasten the process, so we have demanded 1 million doses of Covaxin. As per the preliminary instruction, we will get the consignment this week,” said an officer.Also Read | Centre wants gap in Covishield jabs widened to 4-8 weeks: All you need to knowIn the second week of March, BMC received 63,000 doses of Covaxin. The vaccine uses an inactivated virus paired with an adjuvant – a chemical that boosts immune response. When administered, immune cells recognise the dead virus which prompts the immune system in the body to make antibodies against the pandemic virus.Recently, its manufacturer, Bharat Biotech claimed that the vaccine has demonstrated an interim clinical efficacy of 81% in the phase 3 clinical trial.Soon, the civic body will also start providing Covaxin to private hospitals. Already, some names have been shortlisted.To assist people in their registration on the centralised Co-Win app, BMC will also set up camps, especially in slums like Dharavi.“People who are willing to get vaccinated can approach these champs. There will be a help desk. The trained volunteers will help them to get registered on the Co-Win app. Following this, they can go to their nearby vaccination centere antime and get inoculated,” said Kiran Dighavkar, ward officer, G-North that covers Dharavi.The civic body is also collaborating with local non-government organisations (NGOs) to sensitise people about the need for vaccination.“They will go from door-to-door to encourage people, especially those above 60 years, to get the jab which will provide them protection against the virus. The volunteers will also answer to their queries about the vaccines,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-municipal-body-places-demand-for-1-million-doses-of-covaxin-101616477395096.html

Singh has accused Deshmukh, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, of corruption.In a video message shared on Twitter, Deshmukh said that he was in a hospital in Nagpur between February 5 and February 15 as he had tested positive for Covid-19. “Over the past few days, false reports are doing rounds in media... I was discharged on February 15 and was under home quarantine for 10 days. On February 15, I came to Mumbai in a private plane,” the state home minister said in Marathi.Also Read: Why NCP chief Sharad Pawar didn’t sack Maharashtra home minister Anil DeshmukhDeshmukh’s clarification comes after Singh wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last Saturday suggesting the home minister’s involvement in corruption. In his letter, Singh has stated Deshmukh told Vaze to collect ₹100 crore a month from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants. The NCP leader has denied the claims saying was Singh was trying to save himself as his involvement in the cases related to bomb scare at Ambani’s home was becoming clearer.The minister said he was hurt by the attempts made by some people to spread wrong information about his meetings and visits when he was infected with the virus. He clarified that he stepped out of his home for the first time on February 28 for official work. “I am sharing all this so that people are not misguided,” he added.Also Read: Holes in NCP defence as Sharad Pawar backs Anil DeshmukhAbout his meetings during the period when he was infected with Covid-19, Deshmukh said, “As per doctor's advice, I used to visit park late at night for pranayama. I attended few virtual meetings from the Nagpur hospital and later from my official Mumbai residence during quarantine. Several officials met me at official residence for briefings ahead of the budget session that started from March 1.”Deshmukh’s video message came a day after NCP’s chief Sharad Pawar made similar comments on the issue except for one detail. “Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his letter stated that Sachin Vaze met the home minister in mid-February whereas the hospital certificate clearly states that he was hospitalised for Covid-19 treatment between February 5 and 15 in Nagpur. Later, he was home quarantined in Nagpur,” Pawar said on Monday.Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis accused Pawar of diverting the matter. "It seems Sharad Pawar ji is not briefed properly on Parambir Singh letter. In this letter only, the SMS evidence shows that the meeting date was mentioned as end of February. Now who is diverting issue?" Fadnavis said in a tweet and also shared a video of the home minister addressing a press conference on February 15.Singh, meanwhile, has approached the Supreme Court demanding a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/on-param-bir-singh-s-charges-deshmukh-says-false-reports-was-in-quarantine-101616475069873.html

23-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Brother-sister duo turns passion for strawberries into profitable business||During the Covid lockdown, many of us made the resolution to follow our passions, but a lot of us couldn’t stick to it. However, a brother-sister duo from Chandigarh, turned their hobby of growing strawberries into a commercial venture in the last year. “Freshville” started as a hobby for Vritti, 25, and Parth Narula, 20, when they were at home while the lockdown brought the world to a standstill. “Our father was always interested in growing strawberries and we have a few acres of land in New Chandigarh where we started growing them on a small scale,” says Vritti, who works as a jewellery designer and was born and brought up in Chandigarh along with her brother Parth. They are both lifers at Vivek High School in Sector 38-B.“Earlier, we were growing strawberries on half an acre and selling them to our friends through WhatsApp. But now, we have expanded it to over four acres of land and started an Instagram page from where we take orders. We make around 80 deliveries per day,” Vritti adds.While Parth primarily concentrates on growing the fruits and planting them, Vritti works on marketing the venture, dealing with clients and running operations.Talking about how the strawberries are grown, Parth, a final-year student of Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) in Mumbai, said, “Earlier, we started with two varieties, but now we are up to six, which we hope will bear fruit till May. The mother plant that we use has been imported from California while we get runners from places like Himachal Pradesh. It’s completely organic and no chemicals or pesticides are used at all.”There are around 11 employees that help them pick strawberries and after picking in the morning, they get them back to their house in the city to pack them and they hire three riders on a per day basis to deliver the orders. “We are the only venture here that provides fresh strawberries,” he added.The duo has now also started making and selling strawberry products like jam, crush, slush, sugar-free jam and ginger ale. “We started making jam based on our mother’s recipe. The response was positive, so, we recently diversified to other products. The crush and ginger ale are especially popular.”Talking about their future plans, Vritti said they are exploring tie-ups with various supermarkets in the city and expanding to other cities. “We have received queries from places as far as Kanpur and Bangalore. Even now, we supply orders as far as Gurdaspur and Ludhiana. By next year, we plan to start a venture in Delhi,” she added.The strawberries can be purchased through their Instagram page, its freshville, starting at ₹200 per kilo. They are graded into three categories based on size and the A+ grade with the biggest strawberries sells for ₹400 per kg. “All grades sell equally well and for people who want to make jams or smoothies, we suggest they go for the smaller ones,” Vritti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-brother-sister-duo-turns-passion-for-strawberries-into-profitable-business-101616453633563.html
23-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Man held for floating ponzi scheme, duping over 500 of ₹8 lakh||Delhi Police on Monday claimed to have arrested a 45-year-old man for allegedly running a ponzi scheme and cheating more than 500 people on the pretext of providing them rations for a period of 15 months. Senior police officers said the suspected con man collected ₹1,500 from each person to fraudulently enrol them as a member of an NGO named “Target Welfare Association” to avail of rations and later fled with the money. Till date, over 500 people have been duped of more than ₹8 lakh cumulatively, police said. Police have identified the arrested man as Rajesh Kumar Bhartiya. Senior police officers said the forgery came to light when multiple complaints were received against the “NGO Target Welfare Association” that despite paying ₹1,500 and enrolling for free distribution of ration -- flour, rice, sugar, and refined oil etc -- for 15 months, the NGO did not give any ration. Deputy commissioner of police (economic offences wing) Mohammad Ali said preliminary probe revealed that the NGO is run by one Rajesh Kumar Bhartiya and his associates. “It was also found that the same NGO was running similar schemes in the areas of Jhandewalan, Pratap Nagar, Manakpura, Kishanganj, Mukundpur, Dabri etc. Complainants further alleged that the NGO is neither supplying the ration nor answering the phone since the membership amount was paid. A case of cheating was registered, and investigation was taken up,” Ali said. The DCP said during investigation, it was established that Bhartiya is the key accused who is running the ponzi scheme and he is also the beneficiary of the money duped from people. “When our teams tried to contact him, he never joined the investigation and frequently changed his address. With the help of technical surveillance, our teams managed to zero in on him in Nangloi and he was arrested on Friday following a search,” the officer said. During questioning, police found that Bhartiya and his associates have cheated at least 535 persons so far by enrolling them in their NGO. “They initially used to distribute some ration but later would flee with the membership amount and change their contact details,” a police office said, adding that efforts were on to arrest the remaining suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiman-held-for-floating-ponzi-scheme-duping-over-500-of-8-lakh-101616445412130.html
23-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Three men arrested, juvenile apprehended for series of crimes||Police on Monday said they had arrested three men and apprehended a juvenile for allegedly committing nearly a dozen cases of armed robberies, snatchings, attempts to murder and vehicle thefts. Within three hours on March 12, the minor boy and his partner allegedly stole two motorcycles from Jahangirpuri and Bharat Nagar and used them in two robberies in Shalimar Bagh and Majnu Ka Tila in north Delhi, the police said.In both robberies, the suspects had fired shots. A 12-year-old had sustained a bullet injury in his arm when he along and his father and seven to eight labourers tried to nab the robbers who had snatched the mobile phone of the driver of a goods vehicle in Shalimar Bagh village. A man suffered two bullet injuries in his legs when he resisted the robbery. The suspects had fled with his mobile phone, the police said. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said the gang is infamous as “Pagal (mad) gang” among criminal circles because of the aggressive behaviour of its members, who often fire during robberies. One pistol, three cartridges and five stolen motorcycles were recovered from the arrested persons, said the DCP.On March 12 around 5am, Alphonse said one Saurabh Sharma from Pitampura was waiting for a bus to Jaipur near Majnu Ka Tila, when two persons arrived on two separate motorcycles and robbed him of his mobile phone at gunpoint. When they tried to snatch Sharma’s bag, he resisted and overpowered one of them. The other suspect fired two bullets that hit Sharma in the leg. The suspects fled leaving behind one motorcycle that later turned out to be stolen from Jahangirpuri area, just a few hours before the crime, he said.On March 18, the juvenile and his associate, identified as Akash alias Bhalla,22, were caught from Civil Lines area with a pistol and three bullets. Their questioning led to the recovery of three bikes that they had stolen from Usmanpur, Paharganj and Jafarabad. Two other members of the gang, identified as Sahil alias Ajaz24, and Sahil alias Fazal,21, were arrested from near Kashmere Gate bus terminal on March 20.During the questioning, the DCP said, it was revealed that after March 11 midnight, Akash and the juvenile first stole a motorcycle from Jahangirpuri and used it to rob the mobile phone from goods tempo driver in Shalimar Bagh. They had fired a bullet when some people tried to overpower them. The bullet went through the left arm of a 12-year-old boy. After the robbery and firing, the duo stole another bike from Bharat Nagar area and used both the bikes while robbing Sharma at Majnu Ka Tila, the officer said.“Three brothers of the apprehended juvenile are also into crime and presently in jail for various crimes including murder. The juvenile came into contact with Aakash through a common friend,” said Alphonse, adding that Ajaz and Fazal were involved in 37 and 20 crimes, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-three-men-arrested-juvenile-apprehended-for-series-of-crimes-101616445411582.html

The police’s response comes on a plea by Kismatun, mother of Faizan, who had sought an SIT probe into her son’s death, who along with four other Muslim men, was seen in the video allegedly being assaulted by police officers and forced to sing the national anthem on February 24, 2020.According to the plea by Faizan’s mother, through advocate Soutik Banerjee, the police had illegally detained her son and denied him critical health care as a result of which he succumbed to injuries on February 26. She said her son was mercilessly beaten by the police on February 24 which is evident from the video of the alleged incident that had gone viral back then.On the last date, the court had asked the police to file an affidavit with info about CCTV cameras functioning in the relevant month along with relevant documents. It also asked the police to file an affidavit about preservation of relevant documents.In response, the police affidavit stated that apart from the service report about the repair of cameras, a report has also been obtained from the office of station house officer, Jyoti Nagar police station, north-east district, confirming that on the date and time of the incident, the CCTV Cameras on the premises of the police station were not functional -- the issue was got rectified only on March 4, 2020.Earlier, the police had told the court that it had pinpointed a probable police officer who could have shot a viral video wherein police officers were seen assaulting the youth and forcing him to sing the national anthem in his injured state.The police had also said they have not been able to identify the police officers in the video footage as they were wearing helmets and did not have name plates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-cctv-cams-of-police-station-not-working-when-man-assaulted-forced-to-sing-national-anthem-was-detained-101616445351556.html

In the scheme, people will get a thali (food plate) at a subsidised rate of ₹15. The idea was proposed in SDMC’s final budget presentation in February this year. The SDMC had in 2018-19 implemented the step on a pilot basis by opening five kiosks but the project was put on hold after the coronavirus pandemic struck the country. Senior SDMC officials said nearly 40 kiosks will be established at different places in south Delhi. The outlets will prominently cater to the lower-income groups as due to financial constraints, they mostly partake of unhygienic food, risking their health.“Initially, 10 kiosks with inbuilt kitchen mobile vans (IKMV) will be placed in each of the four zones and later, their number will increased or decreased, depending upon the requirement (in each zone). SDMC will provide bare spaces of 5X3 metres on a “as in wherein basis“ to the bidder who will be allowed to construct eco-friendly kiosks with no permanent structure. The bidder will bid considering the revenue potential and SDMC will not be responsible for losses,” stated the proposal which was approved by the standing committee. It will now be placed before the house meeting for a final nod.A senior SDMC official said the outlets will sell breakfast from 8am to 11am and lunch from noon to 3pm. “The maximum rate for breakfast would be ₹10 and lunch would ₹15. The menu will include puri and stuffed paratha in breakfast and rice, dal, raita, and roti in lunch,” said the official.The proposal also mentioned that a bidder can apply for a maximum of five sites at a time. Officials said chairs or temporary structures, which may hinder the movement of pedestrians, will not be allowed at these kiosks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-approves-proposal-to-provide-a-plateful-of-food-for-15-40-kiosks-to-be-set-up-101616445352070.html

23-03-2021||Delhi||Drugs kingpin Kishan Singh extradited from UK in connection with 2017 meow meow seizure in Delhi||Alleged drugs syndicate kingpin Kishan Singh, a British citizen, has been extradited to India from the UK, Delhi Police said on Monday. Singh was wanted by the Delhi Police in a case from 2017, wherein 25 kilos of mephedrone (commonly known as meow meow), estimated to be worth about ₹50 crore, was recovered from his three associates. Police said Singh runs an international drugs syndicate that deals in meow meow. Senior Delhi Police officers said that this is the first and only case so far of extraditing a UK-based international drugs kingpin to India. Police said the extradition process against Singh, 39, was initiated in June 2018 when the proposal was sent to the UK through Interpol. Singh was living in Hayes, London, from where he has been extradited to India. Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said Singh was engaged in procuring high-quality psychotropic substances for the United Kingdom through his network in India. “The meow meow drug that Singh deals in, originates in the African subcontinent from where it reaches Mumbai via shipments. Singh has a chain of associates in Mumbai. Once the consignment reaches Mumbai, he coordinates with agents in Delhi and Mumbai to fetch the consignments and subsequently transport them further to the USA, the UK, the UAE, Malaysia and other countries,” Yadav said. The DCP said Singh was wanted in a case of 2017. “On February 15, 2017, three drug traffickers – Amandeep Singh, Harpreet Singh and Harnish Sarpal -- were arrested in Delhi and 25.852 kilos of meow meow, worth ₹50 crore, was recovered from them. During interrogation, the trio had disclosed that they work for Singh who is based in the UK. During further investigation, Singh was declared a proclaimed offender and a non-bailable warrant was obtained against him. The extradition proceedings were initiated against him in June 2018,” the DCP said. Singh was born in Nagaur, Rajasthan, and migrated to the UK in 2009. There, initially, he tried to start a business and in 2015, acquired British citizenship, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/drugs-kingpin-kishan-singh-extradited-from-uk-in-connection-with-2017-meow-meow-seizure-in-delhi-101616444931480.html
23-03-2021||Delhi||Nearly 218 people die each year in Delhi from thermal power plant fumes: Study||Every year, nearly 218 people die in Delhi from exposure to a toxic cocktail of fumes from the 12 thermal power plants located in a 300km radius of the national capital, an estimate by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) showed.Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at CREA and the primary author of ”Health and economic impacts of unabated coal power generation in Delhi-NCR”, said the study estimated that the operation of the 12 power plants around the capital resulted in 218 deaths annually in Delhi, and 682 across Delhi-NCR, and more than 4,800 deaths across the country at 55% plant load factor—the ratio of average power generated by the plant to the maximum power that could have been generated in a given time—and more than 8,200 deaths at 100% PLF.“The installation of emission control technologies would prevent 62% of these deaths across the country, which would translate to around 2,976 to 5,084 lives saved annually,” Dahiya said.To arrive at the estimates of annual deaths caused by power plant pollution, researchers took the actual emissions from these 12 power plants in 2018 and assessed their impact on a city’s population. Meteorological conditions were also taken into consideration, CREA said.The findings also highlighted that pollution from the 12 plants had economic impacts far beyond Delhi-NCR. The state-wise distribution of economic impacts of power plant operation in Delhi-NCR suggests that the highest cost burden was faced by Uttar Pradesh ( ₹2,301 crore) followed by Rajasthan ( ₹1,125 crore), Madhya Pradesh ( ₹1,100 crore), Haryana ( ₹395 crore), Gujarat ( ₹362 crore), Delhi ( ₹292 crore) and Punjab ( ₹242 crore).Experts pointed out that while pollution had become a conversation starter in the national capital, which forced governments to act on controlling various pollution sources, there was still a lack of awareness about how exposure to power plant emissions impacts health.The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), in 2015, had notified emission norms for particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, which had to be complied with by power stations in 2017.However, the industry pushed back and committed before the Supreme Court that it will comply with norms by 2022. In January this year, the power ministry asked the environment ministry to dilute norms for SO2 emissions from coal-fired thermal power plants citing “unachievable deadlines and unnecessary norms”. There was also a proposal to extend the deadline for complying with the emission norms from 2022 to 2024.A recent compliance report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) showed that out of the 12 power plants located around Delhi, SO2 control technology was available only in two plants. It was observed that in six of these power plants, work on the control of SO2 emissions was underway, while in the remaining four plants, the work progress was slow.“In India, 58% of the thermal power plants are still not complying or haven’t put out tenders to comply with 2015 emission standard notification. Whether it is a state power plant, state discom or private power plant, nothing is being done to resolve issues. Non-compliance has to be taken seriously, and the onus is as much on the state governments as on the Centre, where there is a need for enhanced transparency,” said Nivit Kumar Yadav, programme director (industrial pollution unit), CSE.Yadav further said, “Old power plants need to be phased out at the earliest as their harmful emissions impact everyone’s health.”They said the only significant work to control the pollution from thermal power plants in the Delhi-NCR was the closure of the Badarpur Thermal Power Station in 2018.“My concern about compliance is that the standards keep changing continuously. We may press for various standards, but the coal plant operators can get the standards changed. What’s worse, the deadline to install emission control technologies seems to be further extended biannually,” said environment lawyer Ritwick Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nearly-218-people-die-each-year-in-delhi-from-thermal-power-plant-emissions-finds-study-101616444932048.html

He was targeted around 11.30pm on Friday while walking home from work.The two suspects, identified by the police by their first names as Manish and Vicky, allegedly intercepted him and the pillion rider approached him with a brick and thrashed him until he fell on the road. Mishra would later learn that the brick attack had fractured his legThe robbers then fled with his phone and a gym bag which contained some cash and a tiffin box.Later, the police registered a case of robbery and learnt from Mishra the last four digits of the suspects’ motorcycle registration number.The DCP said with the information that Mishra supplied, the police were able to zero in on an Apache motorcycle that was registered in Sangam Vihar.Luckily for the police, the suspects had used a motorcycle owned by Manish, rather than a stolen one, to carry out the crime. Having identified the house where the motorcycle owner lived, the police waited patiently before nabbing Manish, 25, on Sunday. At his instance, his associate Vicky, 28, was also nabbed.While Manish has no criminal record, Vicky has seven previous cases of theft, robbery and snatching against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/robbers-use-brick-to-smash-man-s-leg-then-snatch-his-phone-and-bag-two-suspects-held-101616444871487.html
23-03-2021||Chandigarh||Glaciers have reduced from 25% to 17% in J&K: Sinha||Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Monday underlined reconciliatory measures to recharge the rapidly depleting water resources in Jammu and Kashmir. Sinha said climate change has impacted J&K as well where glaciers have reduced from 25% to 17%. “Out of 208 hydrograph stations that were monitored, the water level in 171 wells has decreased. The water level has increased in only 37 wells in Jammu division,” he said. Sinha said the water-level in Kathua, Samba, Jammu and Udhampur districts has also gone down and efforts need to be made to recharge them with the active support of the people. “It is high time that we work out an integrated strategy to increase the receding water level in the wells before it is too late,” he said. He, however, expressed satisfaction that the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has kept all 20 districts of the UT in ‘safe category’. “But it has also asked us to be cautious because climate change is also affecting J&K,” said Sinha. The L-G said 90% of the water bodies, including ponds in J&K, remained ignored. In this context, he cited a report of the Survey of India in 1911 regarding Wullar Lake in Kashmir valley. “As per the report, Asia’s largest freshwater lake today has shrunk to 75.82 sq km from 91.29 sq km open area. I have cited just one instance. There are many such lakes and ponds,” said the LG. In Udhampur district, he said, there were 26 lakes and water bodies which have now been reduced to only 19. He called for active participation of elected representatives and people of J&K in rainwater harvesting and water conservation activities On the occasion, he also inaugurates and laid foundation for various water supply schemes, irrigation schemes and projects worth ₹117.49 crores. He also underlined the need of supplying potable water through pipes to every household in the UT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/glaciers-have-reduced-from-25-to-17-in-jksinha-101616444812096.html

While RPVVs only have classes from 6 to 12, the medium of instruction in SoEs is English.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had announced setting up of 100 schools of excellence in the state budget earlier this month. On Monday, he said the schools would provide the “right platform” to students to hone their skills in their area of interest.“..These new Schools of Specialised Excellence will nurture specialisations among children having special aptitude and interest in the four domains [STEM, Performing and Visual Arts, Humanities, and skill education],” the education minister said.In order to enable students to achieve their highest potential, the schools will aim to provide holistic and experiential learning opportunities through good infrastructure, creativity and problem-solving focused learning and teaching, strong partnerships with universities and industry leaders, mentorship schemes and easy access to role models.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-nod-for-setting-up-100-schools-of-specialised-excellence-101616444751482.html
23-03-2021||Chandigarh||Olive component effective against Parkinson’s disease: PU study||A study carried out by the researchers at Panjab University (PU) has found that a component in olives is effective in treating Parkinson’s disease.Hydroxytyrosol (HXT), a phenolic compound present in olives, was evaluated in the pre-clinical studies, and the results were published in an international journal, Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy, last week. The study was conducted by a PhD student of PU’s biochemistry department, Anjana Pathania, under the supervision of professor Rajat Sandhir.Affecting 10 million people worldwide, Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s, in which a part of the brain progressively damages over the years. It is a type of movement disorder caused due to the loss of a chemical called Dopamine that sends signals and controls body movement. The study found that hydroxytyrosol works by targeting an enzyme that is responsible for dopamine loss.Anjana Pathania said, “The study evaluated the potential of hydroxytyrosol as an anti-Parkinsonian molecule in terms of its ability to maintain dopamine (DA) levels in the patients of Parkinson’s.”Results and benefitsAccording to the results of the study, hydroxytyrosol has the potential to be a future treatment as it successfully reduces motor abnormalities by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. It also preserves neurons, which are damaged due to Parkinson’s.Professor Sandhir said, “The findings of the study are of high interest to the pharmaceutical industry because of various beneficial properties, and are expected to provide a new therapeutic approach against Parkinson’s that affects millions worldwide. However, clinical studies would be required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/olive-component-effective-against-parkinson-s-disease-pu-study-101616444632585.html

We want to give the allottees a chance to clear their dues. The defaulters who failed to clear their dues in the last four years stand eligible under this policy.”He further said that most of the defaulters were those who were successful in buying the properties during the draw of lots.By way of draws of lots and auctions, GMADA in the last five years has sold properties including built-up booths, showroom sites, institutional sites and residential projects in Aerocity, Knowledge City and IT City, also close to the airport; and Eco City-1 and 2, Edu City and Medi City, all in New Chandigarh.As per the norms, if a successful allottee does not pay the required amount within the stipulated period of time, the property is resumed by the estate office.Shailander Anand, former chairman of Mohali Property Consultants Association (MPCA), said, “We have requested GMADA to consider the demand of the allottees to allow them to pay the outstanding amounts in installments. Also, the authority should slash the interest amount from 18% to around 12%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gmadas-new-policy-to-give-relief-to-400-property-defaulters-101616443852094.html
23-03-2021||Other||PSPCL paid ₹5,400 cr to pvt plants for power it did not draw||‘Power Surplus Punjab’ has cost the state a fortune, while also taking a huge toll on consumers’ pocket. The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has been paying fixed costs to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) for its failure to draw power from these. This is as per Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with the IPPs and this deal was done to make sure the state has surplus power. These charges are ultimately passed on to consumers. The clause, however, has proved counterproductive for the PSPCL as it has shelled ₹5,400 crore to these private thermal power plants, since they came on-stream. The opposition has demanded a white paper on the PPAs, with the issue likely to snowball into a poll issue as payments have risen manifold over the years. In a recent review meeting of Power Corporation Management, it has come out to fore that the power surrender cost to the IPPs has been increasing. The Nabha Power Plant and Talwandi Sabo Power Plants are the biggest beneficiaries of PPA clause of paying for fixed cost. “We are in shock. Since 2013 onwards, PSPCL has paid ₹5,400 crore as fixed cost for not drawing power as per capacity of the IPPs. It was a poor policy decision taken in 2009. Things are going to worsen, as we anticipate a cost of ₹1,400 crore per year for the next three years. With this amount, PSPCL could have set up its own new plant of 1,400 MW,” said an engineer, who was part of the deliberation. As per PSPCL’s calculations of amount paid for surrendered power, Talwandi Sabo Power Plant has got ₹2,729 crore in last six fiscals, Nabha Power Plant has got ₹1,811 crore for seven fiscals, and GVK Talwandi Sabo got ₹887 crore over the past four fiscals as fixed cost in lieu of PSPCL not drawing power.In the past PSPCL has tried to avoid paying for fixed charges by keeping its own plants shut for eight months is a year. This is another disadvantage as PSPCL is paying salaries to power generation staff without using them full time. The utility has also been trying its best to decrease the burden of surrendered power by selling power through exchange. “Surplus power has became a big problem. Peak demand remains is only four months. Punjab has planned IPPs by assuming power demand as per peak demand. Policy makers should have done PPAs as per Gujarat, which seeks power only for peak demand months, and have made no provision of paying fixed cost for remaining months. It could have saved several thousands crores of rupees,” said a PSPCL functionary. “As this malaise looks incurable, the state government and the PSPCL should take the burden of such expenses. Consumers must not be burdened,” said Vijay Bansal, a businessman. All India Power Engineers Association (AIPEF) spokesman VK Gupta said they had raised this issue with the PSPCL and the government a number of times. “PPAs are faulty. It has now been proved that power demand was inflated and wrong figures were used to bring IPPs into the state.”WORKING TO REDUCE THIS BURDEN: PSPCL CMDPSPCL chairman and managing director (CMD) A Venu Parsad said the corporation was paying fixed cost, as per the provisions of the PPA. “To reduce this burden, the PSPCL aggressively sold surplus power during winter, apart from banking of power with other states, which the utility draws during summer.” He added that the bill of the fixed cost appeared to be high, as the PSPCL has brought cheaper from the power grid over the past two years, which was more economical than all Punjab-based generation stations, government or private. “PSPCL takes purchase decisions on merit, considering that whether power is cheaper from the grid or from own resources,” he said, claiming that power purchase cost has reduced over the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pspcl-paid-5-400-cr-to-pvt-plants-for-power-it-did-not-draw-101616443793071.html

Ludhiana district has 130 marriage palaces.Amarjit Singh, president of the local marriage palace owners’ welfare association, said they have to pay salaries of the staff and maintain the facility as well.He said theatres are allowed to operate with 50% occupancy, while marriage palaces are way bigger than multiplexes and theatres. “Marriage palaces have big halls and lawns. Some of them have a capacity of accommodating 1,500 to 2,000 guests,” he added.“Such decisions should be practical. We should be allowed to hold functions and parties as we have a lot of space to maintain social distancing,” said Amarjit.“At least 200 families are being directly affected by the curbs. Waiters, cooks, photographers, dancers, DJs, security guards, florists, and vendors are directly dependent on weddings.

The accused, Arfat Ahmed Khan, was working as a computer science lecturer at a government higher secondary school Jakyas in Doda. He is a resident of Baland Pur in Assar tehsil of Doda. “The accused was arrested under Sections 465 (house-trespass),468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (uses as genuine a fraudulent record) of the Indian Penal Code for his involvement in issuing forged and fictitious appointment and transfer/posting orders in the school education department. The accused was not cooperating and was constantly on the run. He kept changing his location from one place to another in both Jammu and Srinagar to evade arrest,” said a spokesman. Crime Branch Jammu vigorously contested the anticipatory bail application of the accused, which led to his application being rejected. “The case owes its origin to a communication made by director school education, Jammu, alleging that while scrutinising records, some fake and forged transfer orders of lecturers were detected and reported,” he said. On this, the crime branch, Jammu initiated a preliminary enquiry and involvement of Arafat Ahmed Khan (lecturer) was prima facie established. Besides issuing fake and fictitious orders of appointment and transfers to others, he had also issued a similar transfer order shifting himself from government higher secondary school Jakyas to Kishtwar. “The accused has been arrested and produced before a court. Police remand has been sought for further investigation of the case,” said a spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-lecturer-held-for-issuing-fake-appointment-transfer-orders-101616443011860.html

Your barefaced lies will be exposed again, just as they were in 2017,” said the CM, in response to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener’s criticism of his government during a rally in Moga on Sunday. The AAP leader had said his party will give 20 lakh jobs to the youths if voted to power in Punjab in 2022. Amarinder said it was ridiculous to compare his government’s track record of implementation of over 84% promises with fulfilling less than 25% of the promises AAP made in the election manifesto. “If this is the Delhi model you (Kejriwal) are promising, then people of Punjab are better off without it. Instead of indulging in claims and taking revenge, Kejriwal should focus on Delhi as he had fulfilled only 11 of his party’s 70 promises. The voters in Punjab will not be deceived by hyperbole,” Amarinder addedAmarinder pointed out that as per a report on periodic labour force survey (2018-19) released by the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation, Punjab has 7.2% unemployment against Delhi’s 8.0%, even lower than the national average. “The AAP government in Delhi failed to show its progress on its 8-lakh jobs promise made in 2015. In contrast, our government in Punjab provided 16.29 lakh jobs/self-employment opportunities under the Ghar Ghar Rozgar Mission, and 58,709 jobs alone in the government sector,” said Amarinder. The Punjab CM also lambasted Kejriwal for not ensuring Covid-19 protocol during the Moga rally, as many AAP leaders were seen without masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-dismisses-kejriwal-s-claim-of-not-keeping-a-single-poll-promise-101616442175616.html

The entire matter is being looked into,” said the DC.Baghapurana deputy superintendent of police Jasbinder Singh said no action is being taken as the police have not received any complaint against violation of guidelines issued by the administration.Following assessment by the team of health experts, the Punjab government had rated Moga as one of the 11 districts worst-hit by the surge in pandemic outbreak.Official sources said after AAP leadership violated official instructions, onus lies with the district administration to take action. “But it is highly unlikely that the state government will approve any punitive action to be taken against the AAP or farmer unions who have been constantly holding rallies for the last several months amid pandemic outbreak. District authorities face an administrative dilemma to justify imposing fines on a common man but turn blind eye on violations committed by the political fronts and trade unions,” said a senior functionary posted in a district.On Sunday, a large posse of the police deployed at the Moga rally did not intervene when pandemic rules were breached.On March 12, the Moga district authorities granted a permission to AAP to hold a public gathering at new grain market with conditions of strict compliance of Covid-19 rules.As per the administration’s instructions, AAP had deployed volunteers with hand sanitisers at different entry points.But hardly anyone was spotted with face covers among the gathering and several AAP leaders sharing dais with Kejriwal were also spotted without masks.There were no chairs for the public and distancing was not arranged for all those squatted at the rally venue.Galleries reserved for the media and others were thrown open by the organisers for its activists and the enclosures were overcrowded and chaotic. Some journalists had to step out of the pandal as the police and AAP organisers allowed free movement of public who were not followingNo appeal was made from in this regard from the dais that was occupied by Delhi CM, Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann and several AAP legislators.In the presence of Kejriwal, several AAP leaders mocked Covid guidelines as a conspiracy to derail their Moga rally.State media coordinator of AAP Manjit Sidhu said the party did its best to follow guidelines but the state government did not extend any support to those who had come to attend a rally that had an official sanction.“We distributed nearly 75,000 face masks and all buses and venue were thoroughly sanitised.

They met Karnal SP seeking action against those who “pushed the victim to take the extreme step”.SP Ganga Ram Punia said police have started investigation and action will be taken as per findings of the probe and statement of the coloniser.As of now, no written complaint has been made with the police, he said.Meanwhile, the Karnal district town planner has denied the claims and said that the allegations are baseless.He said that Praveen has set up three colonies, including one in Taraori town of Karnal, and the department had demolished the colony six months ago as it did not fulfill the criteria as per government guidelines.He said that this is internal matter of the coloniser and the stake holders and they are trying to implicate him by leveling false allegations against him.The DTP said that he did not meet the victim and take the any bribe from him for approval of his colony.“I am ready for any police investigation but action against unauthorised colonies will continue in future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/karnal-coloniser-attempts-suicide-accuses-dtp-of-harassment-101616441151986.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Active Covid-19 cases up by 142% since March 1, 53% beds vacant||According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the number of active cases of Covid-19 in the city has increased by 142% since March 1. However, 53% of hospital beds reserved for Covid remain vacant as 70% of the current Covid cases are asymptomatic. The city’s Covid fatality rate remains below 1%. On March 1, Mumbai had 9,690 active cases of Covid-19, which surged to 23,448 on March 21. The number of Covid patients in hospitals has also seen a sharp rise. For instance, the civic-run Rajawadi Hospital admitted around 10 Covid patients daily in January and now is admitting 30 patients daily. At the jumbo Covid centre in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) on January 31, there were 120 patients receiving treatment. As of the afternoon of March 23, the centre had 920 patients. “Last week alone, we admitted 520 Covid-19 patients. The footfall of patients has increased considerably compared to January. But thankfully, most of the newly-infected patients are mildly symptomatic,” said Dr Rajesh Dere, in-charge of BKC jumbo centre. BMC’s data shows that 70% of the current Covid cases are asymptomatic. Dr Samrat Shah, consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital said, “We are observing that the virus in the second wave is easily transmissible but less virulent hence infectivity rate is high but hospital admissions and fatalities are far less in comparison to the beginning of 2020.”Doctors say the high number of asymptomatic cases has helped prevent hospital bed shortages. At the start of the pandemic in March last year, when the number of active cases started rising, citizens reported a shortage of hospital beds for Covid patients. According to BMC, 12,694 beds in hospitals are reserved for Covid-19 patients and 5,916 of these are vacant at present. In government-run hospitals, 10,198 beds are reserved for Covid cases and 5,005 of these are vacant. There are 2,496 reserved beds in private hospitals of which 1,585 are occupied. Of 1,539 beds in intensive care units for Covid patients, 61.8% (952) are occupied. Out of 8,461 oxygen beds, 48.3% (4,087) are being used. Almost 68% of the 966 ventilator beds (for severe cases of Covid) are vacant and 657 are occupied. In BMC-run Covid care centres-1 (CCC-1), for close contacts of Covid patients, there are 12,353 beds of which 554 are occupied. Mumbai’s doubling rate fell from 174 on March 1 to 106 on March 20. With BMC conducting more than 24,000 tests daily, officials say the daily positivity rate is around 17% and likely to rise further. “The only way to stop the second wave is through testing and vaccination. We have been given a target to do 45,000 rapid antigen tests in malls and other crowded places. This will increase the daily overall testing to almost 65,000. With this, we will identify more Covid-19 patients. But gradually, with early isolation and treatment, the chain of infection would stop,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. At present, the daily fatality rate remains below 1%. “It has been seen that the fatality rate in second waves is low, like in Europe. The infection is more transmissible but milder. However, it is too early to comment anything with certainty,” said Dr Avinash Supe, in-charge of the Covid-19 death committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-active-covid-19-cases-up-by-142-since-march-1-53-beds-vacant-101616441091840.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s daily Covid cases may reach 6,000: BMC||For the third time this month, the city saw over 3,000 new cases of Covid-19 when on Monday, 3,262 new cases were recorded. The total number of Covid cases stands at 365,937, of which 23,671 are active. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) anticipates the daily caseload could go up to 6,000 in coming days as it plans to double the number of tests conducted daily. However, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has said another lockdown was not expected in Mumbai as the situation is manageable since the majority of the new cases are asymptomatic. After reporting the highest daily caseload since the beginning of the outbreak — 3,779 new cases — on Sunday, Mumbai recorded 3,262 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday. The city’s recovery rate has slipped to 90% from 95% in February. The overall growth rate of Covid-19 has shot up to 0.69% compared to 0.20% - 0.25% recorded in February and early March. The doubling rate is down to 97 days, compared to 455 days recorded in mid-February. Chahal said on Monday, “Logically, we can predict that the number of cases per day will double as the number of tests done per day is doubled. As of today, BMC has no plans to impose a lockdown in Mumbai as the situation is under control. Even today, about 86% of the 3,200-odd patients in Mumbai are asymptomatic. Among the remaining, 50% are mildly symptomatic and do not need to go to hospitals for treatment, but are quarantined at home. So at a time, not more than 1,000 hospital beds will be occupied even if we have 6,000 cases in a day.” On Monday, BMC started conducting rapid antigen tests at malls, shopping centres and markets by randomly selecting visitors. The civic body plans to increase the number of tests conducted daily from 25,000 to 50,000 approximately. So far, Mumbai has conducted 3,730,450 tests, of which 19,347 were conducted on Sunday. On Monday, Mumbai reported 10 deaths from Covid-19, taking the toll to 11,569, with a case fatality rate of 3.1%. The daily positivity rate has jumped to 16.8%, compared to 12% on the weekend and 4-5% in early March.Suresh Kakani, additional civic chief and in charge of BMC’s public health department, on Sunday said, “We can sustain this spike in cases because of our available medical infrastructure. Lockdown is not being planned in Mumbai as it brings all activities to a complete halt. We are going to increase the city’s bed capacity. Testing is being scaled up and vaccination is being accelerated.” On Friday, BMC asked private hospitals to reactivate all beds reserved for Covid-19 beds. At present, there are 2,496 beds reserved for Covid patients in private hospitals. This number will be increased to approximately 4,800. Kakani said, “As a majority of cases are from residential buildings, patients prefer to get admitted to a private hospital instead of a municipal hospital. Our municipal hospitals have already activated their Covid-19 beds, but these will also be increased.” There are currently 10,198 beds reserved for Covid cases in municipal hospitals. Of the total 12,694 hospital beds for Covid patients, 820 are for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases; 1,539 are beds in intensive care units (ICU); 966 are ventilator beds; and 8,461 beds are equipped with oxygen points. Kakani said the number of hospital beds for Covid patients will increase to 16,000 in the next two days and within a week, it will go up to approximately 20,000. On Monday, 42,420 people were vaccinated in Mumbai across 100 vaccination centres. Of those vaccinated on Monday, 22,185 are senior citizens and 4,975 are above 45 years of age with comorbidities. While 35,232 beneficiaries received their first dose, 7,188 received the second. Of the 10,579 frontline workers who were vaccinated, 5,537 received their second dose. Of the 4,681 healthcare workers who were vaccinated, 1,651 received their second shot. A total of 902,077 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in the city, of which 420,303 are senior citizens and 66,258 are above 45 years old with comorbidities. Meanwhile, the first vaccination centre in Dharavi started on Monday at Urban Health Centre with 68 people getting vaccinated.

23-03-2021||Mumbai||‘Sachin Vaze stayed at five-star hotel using forged Aadhaar card’||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday conducted a search in a five star hotel in South Mumbai where suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, arrested for his alleged role in planting the explosive-laden Mahindra Scorpio found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month, was staying recently.NIA officials said that a team conducted a search in a room in the Trident hotel at Nariman Point where Vaze reportedly resided from February 16 to February 20. Vaze reportedly booked the hotel room with a forged Aadhar card using his photograph with fictitious name, said an NIA official.A senior official said that documents and CCTV footage have been recovered from the hotel.“The case is being investigated by NIA and anti–terrorism squad (ATS). The probe is ongoing and we are extending our fullest cooperation,” a spokesperson of the hotel said.A Mumbai Police officer said that those dates coincided with the time when Vaze was part of a team that raided various establishments in Mumbai at night for violations of licence conditions such staying open at night beyond allowed hours, among other reasons.Vaze also reported for work at the crime intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch during those dates.The NIA team seized some documents from the hotel room, but it is not clear what the documents pertain to as yet. The team has also seized the CCTV footage from the hotel to probe who all met Vaze at the hotel.On March 13, Vaze, who was the lead investigator in the case, was arrested by NIA which took over the probe earlier this month. Vaze has also been named prime accused in the murder of Mansukh Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane businessman who was linked to the Scorpio.An NIA team visited Hiran’s home to record the statements of his wife Vimala and other family members.The Union home ministry had transferred the murder probe, currently being conducted by the Maharashtra ATS, to NIA on March 20. “The NIA had come home to explain us the status of their investigation and informed that they will take all the details from ATS in the coming days. As of now they haven’t officially filed any case in the murder of my brother. They told us that they will come to meet us in next two days with more information on the case. They have not shed light on the role of Shinde or the bookie to us. They stayed for a short time and left,” Hiran’s brother Vinod said.ATS had on Sunday arrested two persons in connection with Hiran’s murder: a former constable Vinayak Shinde and a bookie Naresh Gor. Shinde, convicted in an encounter killing, was released on parole last year during the decongestion of prisons due to the pandemic.Vinod claimed that Hiran’s family is satisfied with the pace of the investigation and hope it will be resolved soon. A Scorpio that Hiran had been driving for three years and reported stolen on February 18, was found parked outside Ambani’s residence Antilia on February 25. It had 20 sticks of gelatin (but no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani.Vimla’s statement to the ATS revealed that Vaze had borrowed this car from Hiran last year, and returned it to him on February 5.Hiran reported the car stolen on February 18. On February 25, the car was found parked outside Antilia with two identical sets of three different registration number plates kept beneath the rear seat of the vehicle, and its own engine number and body number of the vehicle removed. Even the chassis number embossed on the car near right front wheel was wiped out.The Gamdevi police registered an FIR in the case on multiple charges. On March 7, on the basis of a statement given by Vimala, ATS registered a murder case against an unknown person and started the probe. The next day, NIA took over the probe into the Gamdevi FIR after orders from the Union home ministry..Who is Shinde?In 2013, a Mumbai sessions court had awarded life sentences to 21 people, including 13 Mumbai Police personnel, for an encounter killing of a gangster named Lakkhan Bhaiyya (Ramnarayan Gupta) in 2006. Gupta was a member of the dreaded Chota Rajan gang.One of the policemen convicted was Vinayak Shinde, 55, a constable, who was released on parole last year in the state’s drive to decongest prisons during the coronavirus pandemic.Shinde is one of the co-accused, along with bookie Naresh Gore and prime suspect Sachin Vaze, a suspended assistant inspector currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), in the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.According to investigators of the state Anti Terrorism Squad, Shinde took care of Vaze’s “illegal dealings in Thane and Kalwa areas” and executed the murder of Hiran on Vaze’s behest. Shinde was in Mumbai Crime branch in the mid 2000s and had a good network in Mumbai as well as Thane. “Shinde has a good network across Thane and also has connections with local goons,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity. One of Shinde’s family members said that after he came out of parole, he would stay home. Shinde celebrated his birthday on March 11 with his family at his house.

23-03-2021||Mumbai||Guv should apprise Prez about situation, says BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has upped its ante against Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), seeking the ouster of home minister Anil Deshmukh, with its state unit urging Governor BS Koshyari to seek an explanation from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and send a report on the situation to the President. Party MPs from Maharashtra demanded President’s rule when the issue was raised in the Lok Sabha on Monday. A state BJP delegation will meet the Governor on March 24. BJP leader and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar drew a parallel between the current situation in the state with the one in 1980 when President’s rule was imposed. “A similar report was sent in September 1980, when the Sharad Pawar-led Progressive Democratic Front government was in power in the state. Based on that, President’s rule was imposed in the state. I think a similar turmoil exists today in the state and it should be reported to the President by the governor. We are not demanding President’s rule, but want a factual report to be sent to the President,” he said. Mungantiwar, in a press conference held at the party’s Nariman Point office, also said on Monday that several government officials have been complaining about corruption in the administration and the pressure they have been going through to be part of the malpractices. Such officers should come forward and submit their complaints to the governor with proof, he said. “The allegations levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh are serious, despite which the state has been dismissing them. Singh, in his letter, said he had apprised Thackeray about the home minister’s illegal demand of police officers collecting money from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours. Neither the officers, who have been quoted in Singh’s lette, have denied it, nor have the associations of bars and restaurants have refuted it,” Mungantiwar said. Party MPs Girish Bapat, Manoj Kotak and others raised the issue in Lok Sabha and demanded imposition of president’s rule. “The law and order situation in the state has deteriorated and it calls for enforcement of President’s rule in Maharashtra,” he said. Mungantiwar also demanded a judicial probe into the allegations levelled by Singh against the home minister. “These are not political allegations, but are facts brought to light by an IPS officer of the rank of director general. They need to be taken seriously and an impartial probe by a high court judge is necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, leader of opposition and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis raised questions over NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s claim about the home minister being in hospital from February 15 and 27 after the Covid infection. Pawar said the period mentioned in Singh’s letter during which Deshmukh is alleged to have demanded collection of ₹100 crore a month from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours clashes with the period of his hospitalisation. Fadnavis, in his tweet on Monday afternoon, said Deshmukh held a press conference on February 15, then how can Pawar say that he was in home quarantine?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/guv-should-apprise-prez-about-situation-says-bjp-101616439651745.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena not happy with handling of Deshmukh controversy||While the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) struggles to defend home minister Anil Deshmukh, amid allegations of bribery by former top cop Param Bir Singh, the Shiv Sena, its ally in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, is supporting the NCP’s stand but wants a probe into the allegations. Significantly, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has maintained silence over the issue. Sena MP Sanjay Raut has maintained the party supports the NCP’s stand not to sack Deshmukh. Party leaders said the Sena leadership also wanted some action against Deshmukh such as his ouster from the home department to send a message to the people that the government is taking action. The Sena is on the backfoot after NCP chief Sharad Pawar ruled out Deshmukh’s resignation. In his first reaction to Singh’s letter that dropped on Saturday evening, Raut on Sunday called for “introspection” by all MVA partners and “corrections” to “come out clean”. A day later, Raut said there are several other issues before the government, including rising Covid-19 cases, besides Deskmukh’s resignation. Between the two statements, Raut met Pawar at the latter’s residence in New Delhi. A senior Sena leader said the two leaders deliberated over options before the MVA. “Pawar saheb felt that if resignations are taken on merely wild allegations, it would set a wrong precedent,” said a leader, privy to the details. Further, the Sena is treading cautiously as the Opposition is targeting Sena minister Anil Parab, who is known to be close to Thackeray. “If the chief of NCP has decided there is no truth in the allegations made on Deshmukh and there must be a probe, what is wrong in it? Levelling accusations has become a trend today.. If we keep taking resignations of everybody against whom accusations are levelled, running the government will become difficult,” Raut said in Delhi. Raut, however, said a probe will be conducted by the government. “Param Bir Singh’s letter is being termed a bomb, but it is not so. Deshmukh has called for a probe on this letter. The chief minister himself will probe it... If the government is taking up the challenge of investigating, why is resignation being sought repeatedly,” he said, adding: “Till Thackeray is the chief minister, all issues can be probed in a free and fair manner”. There are speculations that Thackeray was not happy over the manner in which NCP ministers Dhananjay Munde and Deshmukh were protected by the party leadership, but Sena minister Sanjay Rathod, who faced allegations related to the death of Pune woman was asked to resign. Raut said Deshmukh and Rathod cannot be compared. Another option being considered is moving Deshmukh out of home portfolio. “If an inquiry is ordered, Deshmukh can be moved out and given another portfolio,” a Sena leader said. Meanwhile, Raut said the attempt to get President’s rule in the state will not be successful as the government’s hands are “clean”. “If somebody is trying to misuse central agencies to impose the President’s rule, I wish to warn them that you will burn in that fire. I wish to tell them their efforts will not succeed... Henceforth, we will not even respond to your allegations,” Raut said. The Sena leader said the Opposition is using Singh as a “weapon” now but they did not show much trust in him when he oversaw the TRP scam and action against actor Kangana Ranaut. “The opposition is now shooting the gun from his shoulder. But their gun doesn’t have any bullets,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-not-happy-with-handling-of-deshmukh-controversy-101616439592320.html

While the Goa government was yet to register a formal protest, officials of the Goa water resources department admitted that there was a ‘fracas’ outside the gates of the venue where the inspection was scheduled, with some members of the state delegation involving in a confrontation with the Karnataka Police, who, they said, behaved in a demeaning manner with them. “We believe that the restriction of the Goan delegation by the Karnataka police is a gross violation of the Supreme Court… we remain utterly shocked and express our deepest concerns to the numerous examples of misconduct and verbal abuse faced by the Goan officers,” Sardesai wrote in his letter to Yeddurappa. “We urge Karnataka and especially its police force to duly permit and not obstruct the proceedings of the Joint Inspection Committee. We have always treated our neighbours with respect and dignity. Likewise, we too expect the same from Karnataka,” Sardesai added. Rajendra Kerkar, who was one of Goa’s expert witnesses called to testify before the Mahadayi Tribunal during the hearings, said that members of the delegation were roughed up, had their ID cards confiscated and treated ‘insultingly’. “Although this was meant to be an inspection by the three nominated officers from each state, Karnataka brought a battery of officials who had no business being present for the inspection, but from Goa side only one official was allowed to take part. The rest were treated like criminals,” said Kerkar, who was among those who was involved in the confrontation. Sardesai has, meanwhile, also urged the Supreme Court to take note of Karnataka’s ‘misbehaviour’. “The Goan delegation who were part of the joint inspection team were made to wait outside the Kalsa project while the joint inspection was being carried out, their lDs confiscated by the Karnataka police. Additionally, the Goan delegation reported that they face numerous instances of verbal abuse and were treated with utmost disrespect,” Sardesai wrote in his letter. “By obstructing the Goan delegation from performing and inspecting their due diligence at the Kalsa project, the Government of Karnataka and the Karnataka Police force have violated the Supreme Court’s order and we urge that the apex court look into this matter,” Sardesai added. While hearing Goa’s contempt plea filed before the Supreme Court alleging that Karnataka had violated the terms of the Mahadayi tribunal award and had begun diverting water even before they met the conditions stipulated by the tribunal, the Supreme Court ordered that a joint inspection of an official nominated by each of the three contesting states — Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra — be held. Despite the inspection being held last week, officials said that the report to be submitted to the Supreme Court is yet to be finalised. Goa has opposed any diversion of waters of the Mahadayi river, which originates in the Western Ghats in Karnataka, takes a detour via Maharashtra and enters Goa as the Mandovi. The Mahadayi river basin drains an area of 2,032 sq km, out of which 375 sqkm lies in Karnataka, 77 sqkm in Maharashtra and rest in Goa. Both the Goa and Karnataka governments have, for very different reasons, challenged the final award granted by the Mahadayi Interstate Water Disputes Tribunal, which in a verdict in August 2018, granted Karnataka a total of 13.42 Thousand Million Cubic Feet (TMC) of water out of their demand of 36.558 TMC. While Goa has approached the Supreme Court arguing that Karnataka shouldn’t be allowed to divert any water owing to the fact that the Mahadayi is a water-deficient river, Karnataka has argued that the tribunal erred in granting it only 13.42 TMC of water. Besides the Goa government has also filed a contempt petition accusing Karnataka of violation of the Supreme Court’s orders in going ahead with the diversion while the case is ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mahadayi-dispute-goa-leader-writes-to-karnataka-cm-sc-after-reports-of-fracas-during-joint-inspection-101616439471752.html
23-03-2021||Other||State decides to approach SC to raise reservation cap||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Monday decided to inform the Supreme Court that it favours increasing the cap on reservation beyond the 50% ceiling, which will pave the way for chief minister B.S Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state to heed to the growing reservation demands from dominant and politically influential communities.“The decision to approach the Supreme Court was taken today,” said one cabinet minister of the Karnataka government, requesting not to be named.However, the state is yet to file an affidavit before the apex court, according to an official aware of the developments.At least five other states — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand — have decided to ask the highest court to increase the reservation cap. The reservation in government jobs and educational institutions was capped at 50% by the Supreme Court in a 1992 order by a nine-judge Constitution bench. However, the apex court allowed the relaxation provided there was enough scientific data to justify the raising of the cap.Dominant communities like the Panchamasalis, a subsect of Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Valmikis and Kurubas have sought a higher allocation of reservation-based opportunities and a change in category among other requests. Yediyurappa, who has been under pressure to heed to these requests, has set up a committee to study these requests.Yediyurappa, known for his reservation-based politics, has tried to assuage the demands of these dominant communities to earn their support in the 2023 assembly elections. A Lingayat himself, Yediyurappa has enjoyed the support of the community and has attempted to further consolidate the community’s support to fuel his ambition of bringing the BJP to power on its own in the next assembly elections. He has reached out to communities that are not known to back the BJP as well. The Vokkaligas, found in large numbers in the Old Mysuru region, are known to back the former chief minister H.D Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular), while backward classes, the Kurubas and minorities have often backed the Congress.By heeding to requests for higher allocations and even change of category of reservation, Yediyurappa is attempting to expand the support base of the saffron party, analysts said.The Panchamasalis called off their agitation in Bengaluru after assurances by the chief minister while other communities have kept the heat on the chief minister.Yediyurappa is reported to have further strained his relations with the BJP’s top central leadership and has battled dissent within his government, the opposition and growing reservation demands to remain in power at least till the next elections.Yediyurappa has allocated ₹500 crore each to the Lingayats and Vokkaligas and another ₹50 crore for the Brahmin community in the state budget. He has also budgeted ₹1,500 crore for minorities in the state budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-decides-to-approach-sc-to-raise-reservation-cap-101616439471171.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||CM likely to take call on probe after consulting Pawar||Even as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has thrown the ball over announcing a probe into the allegations made by former Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh in Uddhav Thackeray’s court, the chief minister (CM) has not taken a decision on it yet. Senior Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers said the CM is expected to make a decision in consultation with Pawar on the scope of the probe and then decide.MVA government is also racing against time, as Singh has moved the Supreme Court on Monday, seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the entire issue. But as MVA government has withdrawn the general consent given to CBI, the agency has to seek the state’s permission for cases registered in Maharashtra before it can conduct a probe, unless an investigation is ordered by the court. If the Apex court hears Singh’s petition and decides to allow the central agency to probe the case, it will be another embarrassment for the three-party government. It could also be politically problematic for the ruling coalition. An MVA minister, requesting anonymity, said, “CM is waiting to have a dialogue with Pawar over the probe. Once they discuss the modalities and the scope of the probe, a decision is expected to be made on it.” Earlier in the day, Pawar told reporters in Delhi that the decision to announce an investigation lies with CM. “To probe or not the CM’s right and he has to decide on it. Yesterday [on Sunday], I had suggested that a person like [former IPS officer Julio] Ribeiro should probe the matter. But as it is clear that he was not there [in Mumbai], now it is not our demand,” he said.Most MVA ministers, however, want a probe to send across a message that the government is taking due cognisance of the serious allegations against it. Meanwhile, CM held a review meeting with law and judiciary department officials on Monday evening. .Athawale’s demandUnion minister Ramdas Athawale has asked the country’s home minister Amit Shah to impose President’s Rule in Maharashtra in view of the “deteriorating law and order” in the state. Athawale said he will meet Shah on Tuesday to apprise him of the situation in the state and press for the dismissal of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. In his press release, Athawale pointed out that the current situation – former cop Sachin Vaze’s arrest and the allegations by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against state home minister Anil Deshmukh – has caused tremendous anger among citizens. “These incidents indicate the collapse of law and order and call for President’s Rule in the state,” said Athawale, adding that the recent incidents had adversely affected the morale of the Maharashtra Police. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has demanded an open inquiry against a top-serving police officer, alleging that he seems to be abetting the mafia raj in the state. AAP leaders alleged that the said officer has also been indicted by his seniors, but has been able to escape punitive action due to the blessings of his political masters, spread across party lines. AAP has demanded that the inquiry be conducted by a sitting or a retired judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-likely-to-take-call-on-probe-after-consulting-pawar-101616439413451.html
23-03-2021||Chandigarh||Nuh struggles to pick pace; vaccine stock exhausted in Jind||Nuh, the majority Muslim population district of Haryana that is grappling with the tag of backwardness, has been testing to the hilt the grit of Haryana health department teams tasked to mobilise the target groups for Covid-19 vaccination.On Monday, during a mega Covid-19 vaccination drive, 1,151 people were given the vaccine jabs in Nuh, while 2,48,312 beneficiaries were given Covid-19 vaccine across state on Monday during mega vaccination day.Apart from Nuh, other districts where the Covid-19 vaccination pace has been sluggish are Jind and Charkhi Dadri.Last Friday, state health minister Anil Vij had expressed unhappiness over “low testing and vaccination” in Palwal, Mahendergarh, Fatehabad, Nuh and Jind districts.Till Monday, 12,738 people were vaccinated in Nuh, while 30,478 in Jind, and 21,817 in Charkhi Dadri, as per the health bulletin.According to Nuh district immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Basant Dubey, there is vaccine hesitancy among a sizeable section of Mewat residents.“Also, there is lack of internet or access to smartphones in villages, which is another hurdle that the health department is facing to persuade people to walk into the identified Covid-19 vaccination centres,” Dr Dubey said.Dr Dubey added that health teams including ASHA workers, ANMs, and trained staff have been going to villages with twin objective of persuading people and doing on the spot online vaccine registration.“In other districts, people are coming to health centres for the shots, but in Mewat, the health teams are moving from village to village for online registration of people and their vaccination,” the DIO of Nuh said, pointing out that online registration is the key problem in district.“Vaccine hesitancy among residents is another problem. There are multiple challenges on the ground level,” Dr Dubey said.After the vaccination drive was launched on January 16, healthcare and frontline workers, who directly deal with Covid-19 patients, were given shots of the vaccine in the first phase of the vaccination drive.In the second phase that began on March 1, people above the age of 60 and above 45 with co-morbidities were chosen for vaccination.Dadri DIO Dr Ashish Mann said 6,450 people were vaccinated during Monday’s mega vaccinations drive.Vaccine out of stock in JindBarring Narvana civil hospital, the vaccine was out of stock towards afternoon in Jind as over 13,000 people were inoculated on Monday.“We utilised almost the entire vaccine stock on Monday,” Jind DIO Dr Navneet Singh said.“Our efforts finally bore fruits on Monday as we were successful in mobilising people in large numbers. The vaccine was almost out of stock in district by Monday evening except in two centres,” Dr Singh said.Jind district has 34 cold chain points, 27 primary health centres (PHCs) and seven community health centres (CHCs).Dr Singh said he received frantic calls from almost all PHCs and CHCs, demanding more vaccine doses as there were more people waiting for the jab.He said that Monday’s response to the drive from Jind residents, a predominantly rural district, was a testament of people “overcoming the vaccine hesitancy”.“Now, the drive has picked the desired momentum. Public demand is vital for success of such a massive immunisation drive. And that is what happened on Monday in Jind,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nuh-struggles-to-pick-pace-vaccine-stock-exhausted-in-jind-101616439411739.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Why NCP chief Sharad Pawar didn’t sack Maha home minister Anil Deshmukh||Claiming that the allegations of bribery made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against home minister Anil Deshmukh were false, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Pawar on Monday reiterated that they will back the minister and not seek his resignation over the controversy. He stressed the allegations were made to divert attention from the bomb scare case, in which gelatin sticks were planted in a car parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, in south Mumbai, as the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) arrested two persons allegedly involved in the murder of Mansukh Hiran, who was believed to be the owner of the car. According to NCP insiders, the party top brass is convinced the allegations were malafide and, if Deshmukh resigns, the Opposition’s next target could be chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, as they want to pull down the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Pawar pointed out flaws in the letter: “Deshmukh was in a hospital being treated for Covid when he met Vaze, according to Singh.” He said there was no need to initiate a probe into the allegations, however, it was the prerogative of Thackeray to decide over the probe or action and that he would be sharing fresh evidence with him as well. “In view of fresh evidence that proves that Deshmukh was not in Mumbai, it would not be fair to take his resignation… The BJP’s demand for home minister’s resignation has no substance… I am absolutely clear that allegations made against Deshmukh were incorrect as he was in Nagpur,” the NCP supremo said. Hinting at the conspiracy, Pawar said, “It appears that the ATS probe is in the right direction. There are some names that need to be investigated in detail… I suspect that certain people may not want that to happen.” “Their ultimate target is Thackeray. Since the beginning, the BJP is targeting him by making claims he wanted Vaze to be reinstated. Devendra Fadnavis (leader of opposition) said that when he was chief minister he got a call from Thackeray requesting Vaze’s reinstatement. In that scenario, if the party decides to remove Deshmukh, they (BJP) will train their guns on the chief minister and try to bring the government in trouble,” said a senior NCP minister, requesting anonymity. However, Deshmukh may be shifted to some other department in due course of time. “He may be replaced by state labour minister Dilip Walse Patil,” said a senior minister. Refuting the claims, Amit Malviya, national in-charge of BJP’s Information & Technology department, tweeted: “On February 8, a delegation of the Congress party met Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, claiming that influential voices tweeted against anti-India voices, under pressure from the BJP. Where did the delegation meet Anil Deshmukh? In the hospital?” Meanwhile, Fadnavis raised questions over NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s claim about the home minister being in hospital from February 15 and 27 after the Covid infection. Responding to Fadnavis, the home minister in a video statement said, “I was infected with coronavirus and was admitted to Alexis hospital, Nagpur between February 5 and 15. While leaving the hospital after getting discharged on February 15, media persons wanted to ask some questions. I was fine by that time and thus decided to respond to the queries by sitting on a chair. Later, I left for my home and home quarantined till February 27. I stepped out of my home only on February 28,” Deshmukh said.Reacting to queries raised by Malviya, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the meeting was held online. “It is a full-fledged war against the MVA government,” said a senior NCP functionary. He was indicating towards senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar meeting the Governor and BJP MP Girish Bapat demanded imposition of the President’s rule in Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha. Reacting to the demand for President’s Rule, Pawar said, “I have said this before as well. The case won’t impact the MVA government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-didn-t-sack-maha-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101616439232054.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||‘Convicted cop Vinayak Shinde executed Hiran Mansukh’s murder’||Preliminary investigation by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) in Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s murder has revealed that former police constable Vinayak Shinde was the one who had called the 48-year-old auto spare parts trader to Ghodbunder Road on March 4, the day Hiran went missing.“Our probe has confirmed that while [Sachin] Vaze was the mastermind, but the murder of Hiran was executed by Shinde. Shinde had called Hiran to Ghodbunder Road on March 4,” said a senior ATS officer.The ATS on March 21 arrested two men, Vinayak Shinde, a convicted constable on parole in an encounter case, and bookie Naresh Gor in the murder of the 48-year-old spare parts dealer, who is linked to the SUV that was found parked outside Mukesh Ambani’s Antilia residence last month containing 20 loose sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter addressed to the industrialist.The state investigation agency also named suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his role in planting the explosives outside Antilia, as the prime accused in the case.The Union home ministry on Saturday handed over the Hiran murder case to NIA, but ATS officials, as of Monday, were still sharing details of their own probe.“Vaze is a prime accused in the Hiran murder case. He had played a key role. During the probe, ATS found that Gor had provided five SIM cards to API Vaze and Shinde for the crime. Shinde used to help Vaze in his illegal activities,” an ATS officer had said earlier, claiming that their arrests was a major breakthrough.ATS investigators said Shinde was in regular touch with Vaze ever since he got out on parole in May 2020 and, according to ATS remand application, Shinde was looking after Vaze’s “illegal activities” in Mumbai and Thane area.An ATS officer said Shinde, who was convicted for the encounter killing of Lakhan Bhaiya in 2006, had called Hiran late in the evening of March 4 pretending to be a police officer named Tawde from Malwani, and had asked to meet him somewhere along Godbunder Road in Thane.In a statement to the ATS, Hiran’s wife Vimla had said that an officer by the name of Tawde had called Hiran on March 4, prompting her husband to leave his home at 8.30pm. When he did not return, she tried his phone at 11.30pm but found it to be switched off. The following morning, she filed a missing person report.The ATS team on Monday took Shinde and Gor to the creek where Hiran’s body was found, and also conducted a search at a godown in Majiwada area, believed to be of a firm owned by Vaze.“Today, we took Shinde to the spot where Hiran’s body was found at Mumbra, then to his house in Kalwa, Vaze’s house in Saket, a car décor shop and a godown at Majiwada and Bhoomi World complex in Bhiwandi to trace Shinde’s entire movement on March 4 and 5,” the officer said. “We suspect that Shinde made Hiran unconscious in the godown by administrating chloroform and later dumped him in the creek,” the officer added.Investigators on Monday also took Shinde to his residence in Kalwa and seized a printer, suspected to be used to print the threatening note left behind in the explosive-laden SUV abandoned near Ambani’s residence.Another ATS team on Monday apprehended a man from Gujarat who had allegedly supplied some SIM cards obtained on the basis of bogus documents to co-accused Naresh Gor, a cricket bookie.One of the SIM supplied by Gor was purportedly used by Shinde to stay in touch with other accused in the case, said the official, adding that the ATS team that has gone to Gujarat has also recovered 14 SIM cards.Several senior ATS officials who are part of the investigating team including additional commissioner Shivdeep Lande, DCP Rajkumar Shinde and ACP Shripad Kale, senior police inspector Daya Nayak were in Thane for almost the entire day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/convicted-cop-vinayak-shinde-executed-hiran-mansukh-s-murder-101616439051754.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 24k cases, experts say surge will continue for 3 more weeks||Amid the grim surge in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, experts and state-appointed medical professionals said the number of cases is expected to drop only post April 15, around eight weeks since infections started increasing in the state. Maharashtra has been witnessing an alarming spike in daily infections since mid-February now. After reporting more than 30,000 cases on Sunday, the state reported 24,645 new cases and 58 deaths on Monday, taking the tally to 2,504,327 and toll to 53,456. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said if the spike continues, the government will have to impose a lockdown in certain cities.Tope said, “The chief minister in his address to citizens has been saying that if the number of cases keeps increasing, we will have to impose a lockdown. I will be talking to the chief minister again tomorrow. If cases continue to increase, then we will have to impose stricter restrictions.” He also said most of the cases in the state are asymptomatic. “It is my appeal to citizens to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour if they want to avoid a lockdown.”Since March 17, when the state started reporting more than 20,000 cases a day, 156,999 infections have been recorded. In comparison, the state recorded 143,262 cases in total in November 2020 and 120,684 cases in December 2020. There are also 215,241 active cases in the state. The state’s positivity rate is 13.56%. Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the state-appointed death audit committee, said that numbers will stabilise post April 15. “Speaking to various epidemiologists and going by previous trends, we expect the number to stabilise in eight weeks, which means we can expect a drop only after April 15,” Dr Supe said. He also added that, unlike the previous year, the case fatality rate (CFR) is low in the state. “The number of asymptomatic patients is higher,” Dr Supe said. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), on Saturday had also told HT that cases will surge till April 15.On Monday, the state’s CFR was 2.13%. Dr. Shashank Joshi, a member of the state-appointed task force said the state will see a spike in the coming days. “The numbers will increase and the state will break records in the coming days. Apart from non-compliance to Covid-appropriate behavior, the other reasons for the surge is also increased testing and increased contact tracing in all districts,” Dr. Joshi said.Dr. Uday Pai, a practicing paediatrician from Mumbai, said, “Ever since the city and state have opened up, people have become complacent. There is complete lack of discipline when it comes to following protocols.”On Monday, Mumbai recorded 3,262 new infections and 10 deaths, taking the tally to 365,937 and toll to 11,596.Meanwhile, experts also said that since the state is the worst-affected in the country owing to the pandemic, the pace of vaccination needs to increase rapidly. Dr Supe said, “By now, we should have opened vaccination for anyone more than 45 years of age.” Thackeray had also raised this demand with the Central government, however, vaccination is limited to those above 60 years of age and those above 45 with comorbidities. The state is vaccinating around 200,000-250,000 people on an average every day. Tope, on Monday, said that the state has vaccinated 4.5 million citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-24k-cases-experts-say-surge-will-continue-for-3-more-weeks-101616438633438.html
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Nothing incriminating in chat between Arnab Goswami, Partho Dasgupta: ARG counsel to Bombay HC||The counsel for ARG Outlier Media Private Limited, which runs Republic TV, submitted that the WhatsApp chat between Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta was merely a friendly chat and there was nothing incriminating in it. The counsel also alleged that the Mumbai Police was harassing the employees of the company by taking the chat out of context and ascribing it to be part of the television rating point (TRP) manipulation case. The counsel submitted that though Goswami is just a suspect and has not been summoned by the police so far, there was an apprehension that he may be named as an accused on the whims of the police. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by ARG Outlier and Goswami seeking to quash the first information report (FIR) and proceedings in the charge sheet against ARG Outlier employees in the TRP manipulation case, was informed by senior counsel Ashok Mundargi that the voluminous chat record between Goswami and Dasgupta had nothing incriminating in it. He submitted that the chat between the two was only about market trends and individuals, which usually transpire between friends, and hence the same could not be construed in any other way except normal chat. When the bench referred to a portion of the chat wherein it was said that “I am only helping you” indicating that Dasgupta was helping rig TRP in favour of Republic TV, Mundargi said if that was the case, it should have been mentioned in the charge sheet, but there was nothing like it. He added that by keeping the probe open-ended and vague, the police was resorting to tactics to harass Goswami. In view of this, the counsel sought protection from coercive action on Goswami till the investigation was completed. The court, however, declined it. The court then referred to the chat and sought to know from the state as to how it managed to recover the chats even after they were deleted, to which chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare said it was possible though the social messaging platform claiming that the messages were end-to-end encrypted. Thakare said he would make a statement on the same in the next hearing, following which the court posted the hearing to March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nothing-incriminating-in-chat-between-arnab-goswami-partho-dasgupta-arg-counsel-to-bombay-hc-101616438511881.html

23-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra forest dept plans to felicitate staff for probing Wildlife Act violations||In an administrative circular issued on March 19, the Maharashtra forest department has asked officials at the divisional and district level to compile a list of staffers who have contributed significantly in investigating violations of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972. Such officials will be felicitated on Maharashtra Day on May 1 to “boost the morale of the forest force”, as per the circular.“The forest department, unlike other departments in the state, is not just a department but a law enforcement agency. Prevention of forest crime and its investigation is part of the routine work of officials... In order to achieve these objectives, the morale of the organisation should remain high,” states the circular, translated from Marathi.For this, the circular continues, it is “desirable to reward government servants who are doing their best to protect the forest and investigate related crimes.” It also mentions that if “award ceremonies are not held at various levels, the department is likely to lose vigour”.Sanjeev Gaur, additional principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) (protection), said, “There are many frontline staff whose hard work has been central to cracking forest law offences. Statutory provisions under Maharashtra Forest Rules, 2014 and WPA 1972 provide for giving cash rewards, up to ₹10,000 in case of the latter, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions. However, a substantial time generally elapses during the judicial process and the contribution of these officials remains unnoticed.”To remedy this gap in the institutional process, the department has instructed district level officials to “issue commendation certificates to government servants for effective performance without waiting for a verdict from a judicial or quasi-judicial authority”. District level committees have also been constituted to assess the performance of staffers. The committees have been asked to complete their assessment and compile a list of deserving officials by April 15.Gaur, however, clarified that these felicitations will only involve issuing tokens of appreciation, and no monetary rewards as prescribed under Section 60A of WPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-forest-dept-plans-to-felicitate-staff-for-probing-wildlife-act-violations-101616438272761.html
23-03-2021||Other||‘Climate change impacting J-K, time to recharge depleting water resources’: L-G||Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Monday underlined reconciliatory measures on war-footing to recharge rapidly depleting water resources in river and snow-rich Jammu and Kasmir before it proved too little, too late. Addressing a gathering on the occasion of World Water Day, Sinha said that climate change has impacted Jammu and Kashmir as well where glaciers have reduced from 25 per cent to 17 per cent. “Out of 208 hydrograph stations which were monitored, the water level in 171 wells has decreased. The water level has increased in only 37 wells in Jammu division,” he said. Sinha also said that the water level in Kathua, Samba, Jammu and Udhampur districts has also gone down and efforts were needed to recharge them with the active support of the people. “This is high time that we should work out an integrated strategy to increase the receding water level in the wells before it is too late,” he said. He, however, expressed satisfaction that the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has kept all 20 districts of the UT in ‘safe category’. “But it has also asked us to be cautious because climate change is also affecting J-K,” said Sinha. The L-G said that 90 per cent of the water bodies, including ponds in J-K, remained ignored. In this context, he cited a report of Survey of India in 1911 regarding Wullar Lake in Kashmir Valley. “As per the report, Asia’s largest freshwater lake today has shrunk to 75.82 sq kms from 91.29 sq kms open area. I have cited just one instance. There are many such lakes and ponds,” said the L-G. In Udhampur district, he said, there were 26 lakes and water bodies which have now been reduced to only 19. Sinha called for the active participation of elected representatives and people of J-K in rainwater harvesting and water conservation activities.On the occasion, he also inaugurated and laid the foundation for various water supply schemes, irrigation schemes and projects worth ₹117.49 crores. He also underlined the need of supplying potable water through pipes to every household in the UT. However, it may be stated here that many areas in Jammu city still san piped water supply, especially densely populated areas like Sainik Colony and Channi Himmat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/climate-change-impacting-j-k-time-to-recharge-depleting-water-resources-lg-101616438271679.html

23-03-2021||Other||Rahul attacks ruling LDF over corruption, jobs crisis in Kerala||Kochi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday intensified his attack on the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala, alleging that it was steeped into politics of vendetta, nepotism and corruption and urged the people to give the party a befitting reply in the April 6 assembly elections. “The government was on the verge of giving fishing rights to an American giant and it was stopped after the Opposition leader raised the issue. Later, the government was forced to scrap the agreement,” said the Wayanad MP, who is on a two-day campaign visit to the poll-bound state.The Congress, which is part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala,  is contesting on 91 seats in elections to the 140-member assembly. Among other UDF allies, the Indian Union Muslim League will be contesting on 27 seats, the Kerala Congress, the splinter group headed by PJ Joseph, will field its candidates for 10 seats, the Revolutionary Socialist Party ( RSP) will for five seats and the Mani C Kappan-led faction for two seats.Addressing a rally in Kochi, Gandhi also alleged that the youth in Kerala can only dream of  employment. “The Government’s primary responsibility is to give jobs to youngsters, not to their own organization and cadres. The LDF government here and the BJP in Delhi have failed miserably on this. If you are a young person in Kerala, a job isn’t a reality but a dream,” he said. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) -led LDF, however, rubbished his allegations. “He makes many such silly comments. He has changed narrative of a national leader,” said senior CPI(M) leader M A Baby.Earlier in the day, the Congress leader interacted with the students of St Theresa’s College and exhorted women to realise their real strength. “I will tell you a secret that men will never tell you, women are much more powerful than men,” said the 50-year-old leader as he helped the students learn a basic lesson in the Japanese martial art form Aikido. “Society wants to convince you that you are less powerful, but don’t buy it,” he said. He, however, advised women not to misuse their power. “Once you realize that you are powerful, then the tendency to misuse it also comes, it is not right.” Gandhi has been campaigning extensively in the poll-bound state and interacting one-on-one with local residents. Just weeks ago, he took a swim in the sea with fishermen in the state’s Kollam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rahul-attacks-ruling-ldf-over-corruption-jobs-crisis-in-kerala-101616438032346.html

23-03-2021||Mumbai||Colleges await University of Mumbai guidelines for final-semester exams||While the University of Mumbai (MU) is yet to announce its plan for exams, many city colleges are gearing up for online examinations for the final-semester. Usually, final-semester exams take place in April, but they have been pushed to May this year owing to the lockdown and subsequent delay in admissions. With Maharashtra witnessing a second wave of Covid-19 infections, colleges in the city expect MU to announce online exams. Principal of St Xavier’s College, Rajendra Shinde, said, “Given the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in the city, it is safe to assume that the university will decide on online examinations.” Shinde also pointed out that students hadn’t done any practical classes or lab work for an entire year. “We have completed our internals by collecting assignments from students. However, there is no word yet from the university. It’s about time students had some clarity,” said a principal of a suburban college, requesting anonymity. Sources in the varsity said online exams are most likely. MU’s pro-vice-chancellor Ravindra Deshmukh did not respond to queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colleges-await-university-of-mumbai-guidelines-for-final-semester-exams-101616437911876.html

No cleaning work of this area has been done in the last two months by the administration,” said Ranjan Natu who has an office in the Yash Towers.When HT visited the spot, it found out that empty liquor bottles were also thrown in the garbage.“Many nearby shops throw garbage here, it is not a garbage dumping zone, however, people continue with their old habits. There has been no response from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on the cleaning work,” said Mangesh Sharma from Yash Towers.Security guards from Parth Heights complained against the stink which they have to bear for the whole day.“We are sitting outside the whole day, so it becomes very hard for us. I have seen many people throwing garbage, but no one restricts them. The PMC should take some concrete decisions,” said Shivkashi Ram, Parth Heights.Kiran Kumar Naidu, a resident from Parth Heights added, “Stink is a major problem when we open the windows. Most of the residents are facing this problem.”“Since many days, the work in the Aundh area is pending. We will send officials to clean the garbage from the plot,” said Ajit Deshmukh, PMC’s solid waste management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mosquitoes-bad-odour-put-citizens-at-risk-in-aundh-101616427530492.html
23-03-2021||Pune||Residents of Pune’s Baner-Pashan Link road fume over civic apathy||PUNE Underdeveloped road, garbage piled up on streets, lack of street lights, open drainage chambers – are major civic problems faced by residents of Baner-Pashan Link road as infrastructure development work is continuing at a snail’s pace in the area.Even stray dog menace, especially during the night time, has made it difficult to commute on the road, say, residents.“The road work is pending for the last two years. No work was undertaken even after the lockdown period ended. Stray dogs are making things even worse as two cases of dog bite have occurred in last four days,” said Dinesh Sood, a resident of Baner-Pashan Link road.There are 65 housing societies on the Baner-Pashan Link road area and at least 12,000 residents reside here.A member of Baner-Pashan Link road Vikas Samitee said, “When I called Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) road department an official said currently other projects are undertaken on priority due to the March 31 deadline so we are not focusing on Baner-Pashan Link road as of now.”Baner-Pashan Link road Vikas Samitee has so far conducted several meetings with PMC, but development work never picked up speed in the locality, claim members.“According to the development plan of Baner-Pashan Link road, it should have gardens, libraries, children playground, but there is no infrastructure for common public,” said Sood.Ashish Sharma, a resident of Crystal Palace housing society in the area, said, “There are all posh societies in this locality where people have spent crores of rupees to buy homes, but they are suffering without basic infrastructure.”In 2019, PMC had decided to acquire land for the 120-foot-long link road, using the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, (LARR Act) 2013.“Last year, no budget was allocated for the development of Baner-Pashan Link road. This year funds have been allotted and after the tendering process is complete the work will start, most probably after the monsoon. Since it is a big project it will need approval from the standing committee,” said Dinkar Gojare, superintendent engineer, PMC road department.“There are two-three such localities where people are not willing to give land under the LARR Act. We will take advice from the land acquisition department,” said Gojare.As per the LARR Act, PMC will have to pay a compensation of ₹5.9 crore to the landowners and an initial amount of ₹1.5 crore will have to be deposited with the district collector before the land acquisition process is initiated by the collector’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-of-baner-pashan-link-road-fume-over-civic-apathy-101616419970206.html
23-03-2021||Delhi||Inside Delhi’s ambitious plans to turn transport services online||What comes to your mind when you think of a regional transport office (RTO)? Most of us would think of a crowded public building, marked with people frantically moving from counter to counter, long queues, the smell of dusty files and the nearly-ubiquitous sound of fingers bagging on computer keyboards.One may not need to visit a transport office beyond a few times in life – considering how most documents such as drivers’ licenses (DL) and registration certificates (RC) demand renewal only after 10-20 years for most people. But the sheer high number of vehicle registration in the city often succeeds in ensuring that the RTOs are jam-packed.Delhi has at least 10 million registered vehicles, of which 7.9 million are two-wheelers and 3.3 million are four-wheelers, of which 0.5 million vehicles were registered in 2019-20.In the light of the pandemic, crowding at RTOs, a key government office with high degree of public interface, has generated concerns. Also, a single visit in a packed RTO building can take a long time — which essentially means more exposure to an air-borne virus, more contact points and, hence, a high probability of transmission.Also Read | Delhi traffic police test new diversion plan for Ashram flyover extensionTo address this challenge, and to ease services for citizens, the Delhi government has come up with a plan that aims at making nearly 70 essential transport services completely online in two phases over the next few months. These services include renewal and duplicate DL or RC, permit or RC transfer, NOC for other states, among others, which currently demand physical visit to the RTOs in Delhi and in most other states. Several cities, globally, have succeeded in transforming their RTOs completely or partially online in the recent past.The shift to digital Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said Delhi is going to be the first state in the country to move in this direction. In February this year, the Delhi government started the “ambitious project” to shift all its transport services to the online mode.At present, only appointment booking facilities to visit an RTO for various documentation is available online.“The project aims to decongest all the 13 RTOs of the city as it will allow people to get important documents, including renewal of DLs or transfer of vehicle ownership, from the comfort of their homes. This is the biggest reform package from the transport department that we have planned this year. Under the first phase, 12 services will be made 100% online. The second phase will include 58 services. Since it is a radical shift from the traditional way RTOs operate, it is difficult to set a specific launch date at the moment,” Gahlot said.Trials for the project started from February 19, under which 12 services related to DLs and RCs are being provided online in all the RTOs.Government data accessed by HT showed that between February 19 and March 17, the transport department managed to provide 100% online services to at least 34,000 applicants. It means that 34,000 people actually did not turn up at any RTO in the 27-day period of the trials so far. All these applicants received their RC or DL related documents at their homes through speed post. In pre-Covid times, Delhi’s 13 RTOs together used to witness a footfall of at least 100,000 every month.Also Read | Delhi traffic police to install cameras in 31 locationsData from the ongoing trial period showed that 66% of the total applicants eligible for online services were still visiting the city’s RTOs. This is also because the transport department has not opened the online service completely at the moment and is capping the number of daily online applications received at each RTO.What it means for citizensDarshan Rai (42), a salesperson in an apparel store in Connaught Place, took a casual leave earlier this month to renew his driving license as the Centre’s relaxation, owing to the pandemic, on driving with an expired DL or RC will end on March 31.“Renewal of my DL at the RTO took the whole day as the waiting time has increased further due to social distancing norms being followed. In between, there’s lunch time and one has to wait for the officers to return to their seats. Then physical verification of all the documents takes time,” Rai said. “Thankfully, I took leave from office. Otherwise, my colleagues were suggesting that I take a half day. Had I done that, I would have had to visit the RTO once again to get the final document,” he said.Rai’s experience is representative of the wider experience of citizens. They will, however, have to wait before the trek to the RTO can fully transform to a digital experience.The transport department still has a month or two more to go until all RTOs shift to 100% online services, said Ashish Kundra, Delhi’s transport commissioner. He also clarified that once fully implemented, only the applicants seeking a learner’s license or permanent DL or vehicle fitness certificate will have to physically visit the RTOs as these documents require appearing for tests.The challenges ahead Kundra explained the challenges faced in the project and the interventions made in terms of technology and capacity building.“There was re-engineering of business processes involved because officials at the counters in RTOs are used to seeing physical files and people standing in the queue,” he said.“In terms of technology, our system has to be geared not only to receive the increased volume of applications online, but also to enable officers to ensure compliance by checking that all the documents required as per law are in order. Once the verification is done, the officials will simply approve it online, get the document printed and send it to the applicant by speed post. All payments will be online,” Kundra said.Also Read | Legal age to drink lowered to 21 from 25 in Delhi, announces Manish SisodiaA challenge being faced by the department is managing applicants, most of whom are confused about the online system and insist on coming to the RTOs, or those delivering the services at the transport offices.Pravesh Biyani, associate professor at IIIT-Delhi, who has collaborated with various state governments on providing contactless services especially in the transportation sector, said the move will not only make public services hassle-free for people but will also curb corruption.“But making public services faceless also makes it difficult for those who are not technology-savvy. This is my biggest worry about such schemes. I also hope that the government provides a very good user experience while shifting to 100% digitisation and computerisation,” Biyani said.Kundra said that for applicants who do not have access to computers or the internet, the department has decided to open help desks at all the 13 RTOs which will fill the forms, submit the documents for them.For its own officers, the department is now organising training sessions in batches on learning the software and the online application, verification and approval system.“There are teething issues that are either people oriented or process oriented. We have to reorient our own people because they are not accustomed to our model. We are also learning as we go along. Also, we are constantly working to see how the user interfaces can be made better. The ambition is that the transport department should go completely online for everything except a driving test or vehicle fitness test,” said Kundra.Shreya Gadepalli, who leads the South Asia Programme of the Institute for Transport and Development Policy (ITDP), said the idea is a welcome move and is likely to be a one-of-a-kind project in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/inside-delhi-s-ambitious-plans-to-turn-transport-services-online-101616417210818.html
23-03-2021||Delhi||Legal drinking age to be lowered to 21 from 25 in Delhi: Manish Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday announced that the drinking age in Delhi will be lowered to 21 and the system of “age-gating” will be introduced in the city wherein persons below 21 will not be allowed to enter any restaurant, pub or club that serves liquor by themselves. The change in rules is part of the new proposed Delhi excise policy which Sisodia said is aimed at improving excise revenue and liquor-buying experience by equitably distributing liquor vends and making good quality liquor available in the market.Addressing a press conference, Sisodia said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal approved the recommendations of the group of ministers on Monday. A proper policy document will now be drafted and then notified. He said the entire process would take about three months, upon which the new rules will be implemented.Also Read | Remain alert, follow Covid-19 guidelines during Holi: Satyendar Jain“Delhi is going to make the legal drinking age at par with its neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh.

They will be allowed entry if they are accompanied by their parents or others who are 21 years and above,” Sisodia, who is also the excise minister of the city, said.The current drinking age in Delhi is 25.The deputy chief minister also said that the policy aims to put an end to the liquor mafia which he claimed is thriving because of the inequitable distribution of liquor vends in the city. He said no new liquor shops will be opened in the city and that the existing ones will be relocated. He added that with these reforms the government expects a growth of about 20% from excise as compared to the current annual growth of 5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/legal-drinking-age-to-be-lowered-to-21-from-25-in-delhi-manish-sisodia-101616416490640.html
23-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chill back in the hills as mercury dips after snow, rain in Himachal||The prolonged dry spell was finally broken on Monday when the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh experienced snowfall and the middle and low hills got moderate rainfall. Keylong, the administrative headquarters of tribal Lahaul and Spiti district, witnessed 9cm of snowfall, Udaipur 26cm, Gondla 15cm and Hansa 5cm snow. The Atal Tunnel, Rohtang has been closed for tourists after heavy snowfall on its north portal. Meanwhile, the tourist resort of Manali recorded the highest rainfall of 30mm. “More rain and snow are likely in the state over the next two days as a western disturbance is active over the region,” said Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh. Seohbag in Kullu recorded 19.2mm of rain and Mandi and Dalhousie got 10.1mm and 10mm of rain, respectively. Sundernagar received 8.2mm of rain, Shimla 5.2mm, Palampur 3.4mm and Dharamshala 3.4mm, respectively. Shimla cold at 8 degrees, Dalhousie at 5.2 Keylong was the coldest place in the state, where the minimum temperature fell to minus 0.2 degrees Celsius, followed by 1.7 degrees in Kufri and 2.6 degrees Celsius in Kalpa. State capital Shimla was cold at 8 degrees Celsius. “There was no appreciable change in the minimum temperatures since Sunday. The minimum temperatures were 1-2 degrees Celsius above normal,” Singh said. However, the maximum temperature dropped by 2-3 degrees Celsius. Dalhousie experienced a low of 5.2 degrees Celsius, while Manali and Palampur recorded a minimum of 11.5 degrees Celsius. Dharamshala recorded a low of 10.4 degrees Celsius. Rain relief for wheat farmers The rain has come as a relief for farmers, who feared losses due to the dry spell. “The fresh rainfall is good for the Rabi crop, especially wheat. There has been a loss of 30% crop in non-irrigated areas,” said Ramesh Chaudhary a farmer in Kangra. He said if it continues to rain for two-three days, it would be enough to save the rest of the crop. In the higher altitude areas, rains are good for the apple crop but decline in temperature could impact the blooming as cloudy weather and rains disturb natural pollination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chill-back-in-the-hills-as-mercury-dips-after-snow-rain-in-himachal-101616403469990.html
23-03-2021||Delhi||Over 4000 DU students protest digitally to reopen campus||From increased screen time and consequent headaches to problematic wifi connections, students of Delhi University aren’t enjoying the #digitalcampuslife. It’s been almost a year since DU shifted to the online mode for teaching and learning, however, students are still having a tough time with regard to online classes, and more than four thousand DU students are protesting digitally by signing a petition to open colleges. “We are organising digital protests. Thousands of students are participating in twitter storms and have signed an online petition for reopening of campus. We will be sending this petition to our VC. There are multiple student protest groups formed on Whatsapp where we coordinate our protests. Some of us make meme pages and post memes asking for colleges to reopen, others make reels on the issues faced in online classes and the rest of us tweet tagging the authorities,” shares Pranshu Nain, of Ramjas College.The digital petition to reopen campus is spammed with comments after comments by students enlisting reasons as to why they are demanding the campus re-opens. “The digital divide is steep. Many of my friends in Kashmir weren’t even able to attend most of their online classes because of wifi problems. Some of my classmates living in villages don’t get steady electricity connection, what to say of wifi. Teachers aren’t able to explain the concept properly because if you get a bad connection in between you have an audio and video lapse. There is limited interaction in classes. Even extra curricular activities have become digital. The confidence and exposure students get from physical interaction with the faculty, seniors and friends is stumped,” says Aatika Choudhary of Vivekananda College.The current student life is rampant with digital fests, online freshers and online exams and handling everything virtually is taking a toll on students who have been reaching out to their seniors for help. “Scores of students reach out to me daily with their problems. They cry on the phone and are mentally anguished. Students are so worried about their future. The digital campus is no longer working. Sports, dramatics, workshops - all of these were a very important aspect of personality development for students and there’s nothing happening to make up for that. The university isn’t well equipped with handling the online shift. It’s been a year and the exam portal still crashes while students submit their answers while attempting Open Book Examinations,” says Shubham Chaudhary, Executive Councillor, Delhi University Student Union.The authorities of DU claim that they are trying their best to help the students but safety comes first. “No plans of re-opening campus as of now. Covid-19 cases have increased. MHA guidelines and government advisories suggest restrictions and precautions. So we will have to wait and watch. We are with the students and are trying to help them to the best of our capabilities. We are also trying to ensure that all colleges make study material available on their website,” says Rajeev Gupta, Dean Students’ Welfare, Delhi University. But what do the authorities suggest to combat problems of weak internet connection that hampers the study session of students? “Difficult to suggest any amicable solution regarding wifi problems faced by students because they are currently spread over the country and not residing in a student hostel where we could provide all of them with a speedy connection. However, once the entire study material is available online, things will get smoother for the students. Students are welcome to reach out to us and we will help them in whatever way we can,” says Gupta.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/4000-du-students-protest-digitally-to-reopen-campus-101616401552435.html
23-03-2021||World||After rebuke over 'outdated' data, AstraZeneca to publish full US trial results||AstraZeneca will publish up-to-date results from its major US Covid-19 vaccine trial within 48 hours after health officials publicly criticized the drugmaker for using "outdated information" to show how well the immunization worked.The rare public rebuke marks the latest setback for the vaccine once hailed as a milestone in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic but has since been dogged by questions over its effectiveness and possible side effects.AstraZeneca said results it published on Monday in which the vaccine had demonstrated 79% efficacy were based on an interim analysis of data through Feb. 17, and it would now "immediately engage" with the independent panel monitoring the trial to share its full analysis.The British-based drugmaker on Tuesday said it had reviewed the preliminary assessment of its full, or primary, analysis and found it to be consistent with the interim report.But the Washington Post reported that the data monitoring panel told federal officials they had been working with the company through March, had seen data that showed the vaccine might be 69% to 74% effective, and had "strongly recommended" AstraZeneca include that information in its public statement.AstraZeneca shares fell 1.8% in London trading.The US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said on Monday that the board charged with ensuring the trial's safety and accuracy had expressed concern the company may have included outdated data that gave an incomplete view of the shot's effectiveness.NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci called the whole issue a really unfortunate unforced error."This is very likely a very good vaccine and this kind of thing does ... nothing but really cast some doubt about the vaccines and may contribute to the hesitancy," he told ABC's "Good Morning America.""The data really are quite good but when they put it into the press release it wasn't completely accurate," he said.In addition to the 79% efficacy in stopping symptomatic illness in the trial conducted in the United States, Chile and Peru, the data reported on Monday also showed the shot was 100% effective against severe or critical forms of the disease and posed no increased risk of blood clots.Dr. Larry Corey, co-leader of the US Coronavirus Vaccine Prevention Network, which helped design AstraZeneca's US trial, said the monitoring panel's rebuke was something he had not seen before. The virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, praised the panel for speaking up, saying it showed the system of checks and balances worked.'NEGATIVE REPORTS'The new doubts about the shot's efficacy coincide with its rollout in dozens of countries and clouds the timeline for its potential emergency use authorization in the United States."This is indeed an extraordinary act. The negative reports about this vaccine do not stop, although my assessment is that it is well tolerated and safe, but clearly less effective than the two mRNA vaccines," said Peter Kremsner, from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.Vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna that use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to produce an immune response both had efficacy rates of about 95% in their pivotal clinical trials, far above the 50% benchmark set by global regulators.AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot has faced questions since late last year when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data from an earlier trial with two different efficacy readings as a result of a dosing error.Confidence in the vaccine took a further hit this month, when more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended giving out the shot after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.The European Union's drug regulator said last week the vaccine was clearly safe, but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained skeptical about its safety.The latest trial data, which has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers or regulators, was based on 141 infections among 32,449 participants.Stephen Evans, a pharmacoepidemiology professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the up-to-date data request may have to do with efficacy readings from recent cases, which may include new virus variants and thus lower protection rates."The other vaccines may also show such reduced efficacy and we don't know by how much," he said.The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of Covid-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.It has been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorization in more than 70 countries.Many countries are relying heavily on the shot to end the pandemic, and several state leaders have taken it publicly to boost confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-rebuke-over-outdated-data-astrazeneca-to-publish-full-us-trial-results-101616523396053.html

It has only been activated once by NATO, after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.Former US President Donald Trump often criticized NATO partners for failing to pay their fair share of the defense burden, claiming falsely that they owed the alliance or the United States money.Early in his tenure, he threatened not to come to the defense of any country that did not meet NATO spending guidelines, causing deep concern among member nations close to Russia’s borders, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.The ministers noted that members of the 30-nation alliance “are making good progress on fairer trans-Atlantic burden sharing; we welcome the efforts made by all Allies in Europe and North America that contribute to our indivisible security. We must and will do more.”They also vowed that NATO would continue to adapt in the face of “rising threats and systemic competition,” and underlined that “Russia’s aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-affirms-unity-as-minsters-put-donald-trump-era-behind-them-101616519447307.html

They flew at full staff for a few hours on Tuesday morning before being lowered again to mark the Boulder killings.Biden, whose personal life has been marked by the loss of his first wife, and two children, is expected to offer condolences to the families of victims. He did the same in Atlanta on March 19, and to the families of more than 525,000 dead from coronavirus on March 11."A day will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye, as unbelievable as that is now," he said in Atlanta, during a speech originally planned to celebrate the passage of his $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. "It will take a while, but I promise you it will come."Biden has in recent weeks promoted the coronavirus stimulus bill while grappling with a surge of migrants along the US southern border with Mexico.Now his two-month-old administration faces increased pressure to fulfill promises on gun regulation. Any effort to move the United States toward greater gun control has historically been difficult with Democrats in favor and Republicans largely opposed.Biden will visit Ohio State University's James Cancer Hospital to mark the healthcare bill anniversary and promote a $100 million grant the hospital received under the Affordable Care Act to upgrade its radiation oncology department, according to White House officials.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) - the signature 2010 legislative achievement of then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat under whom Biden served as vice president - has survived repeated attacks from Republicans, on Capitol Hill and in the courts. It is expanding under Biden's watch.The federal exchange reopened in mid-February for a special enrollment period, with more than 206,000 people signing up for coverage in the first two weeks, nearly triple the number during the same time frame last year, when access was limited to life-changing events, federal data shows.There are about 28 million Americans without health insurance, down from about 46.5 million in 2010, when the ACA was passed, according to the latest federal figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-step-into-familiar-role-as-counselor-in-chief-after-colorado-shooting-101616518691223.html

The office is based in Manhattan.The president also intends to nominate Breon Peace, who worked under former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, as the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District, based in Brooklyn, the person said. Lynch served in the same role before she became attorney general.Biden will also nominate Trini Ross, a longtime federal prosecutor, to run the office in the Western District, based in Buffalo, the person said.The person could not discuss the matter publicly ahead of an official announcement.Williams was a law clerk to federal Judge Merrick Garland, before Garland became attorney general. He currently works at the chief of the U.S. attorney’s office’s securities and commodities task force and supervises a team of more than 20 prosecutors. He has been involved in a number of high-profile prosecutions in New York, including of former state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and of former U.S. Rep.

23-03-2021||World||India abstains from UNHRC vote on Sri Lanka’s human rights record||India on Tuesday abstained from a crucial vote at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Sri Lanka’s rights record, though New Delhi called on Colombo to carry forward the reconciliation process and address the aspirations of the Tamil minority.The 47-member UNHRC adopted a resolution – sponsored by a group of countries that includes the UK, Germany and Canada – which gives UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet the mandate to collect and preserve evidence of crimes related to Sri Lanka’s civil war that ended in 2009 with the defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels.A total of 22 countries voted for the resolution that was very critical of Sri Lanka’s failure to address human rights violations that occurred during the civil war. The resolution also contended the human rights situation has deteriorated under the Rajapaksa administration and that rights defenders and ethnic and religious minorities are facing problems.Eleven countries, including Bangladesh, China and Pakistan, voted against the resolution, while 14 countries, including India, Indonesia, Japan and Nepal, abstained.In a statement before the voting on the resolution on “Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka”, Pawankumar Badhe, first secretary at India’s permanent mission in Geneva, said New Delhi believes states have the primary responsibility for protecting human rights.“We would urge the government of Sri Lanka to carry forward the process of reconciliation, address the aspirations of the Tamil community and continue to engage constructively with the international community to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected,” Badhe said.India’s approach to human rights in Sri Lanka, he said, was guided by “two fundamental considerations” – support to the Tamil minority for equality, justice, dignity and peace, and ensuring the unity, stability and territorial integrity of the island nation.“We have always believed that these two goals are mutually supportive and Sri Lanka’s progress is best assured by simultaneously addressing both objectives,” he added.India also supports the world community’s call for Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitments on devolution of political authority to the Tamils, including through early holding of elections to provincial councils and ensuring that these councils are able to operate effectively in line with the 13th amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution, Badhe said.India has traditionally shied away from backing direct UN intervention on human rights issues because of its sensitivities related to the Kashmir issue. At the same time, the Modi government has repeatedly pressed Sri Lanka to take steps to devolve powers to the Tamil minority and address their aspirations.The Tamil Nadu assembly election, to be held during April-May, is also believed to have been a factor behind India’s decision to abstain. The status of Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority is often a factor in Tamil Nadu’s politics.Though the Sri Lankan government reached out to India to vote against the resolution at the UNHRC, New Delhi has been irked with Colombo for reneging on a 2019 tripartite India-Japan-Sri Lanka agreement for developing the East Container Terminal at Colombo port.The Sri Lankan government scrapped the deal last month following pressure from labour unions and instead offered to develop the West Container Terminal with Indian and Japanese investors.Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena made a distinction while thanking countries that voted against the resolution or abstained. In a tweet, he appreciated “the support shown at Geneva” by countries such as India and Japan that abstained, and in another tweet, he extended a “very warm Thank You for solid support” shown by countries that voted against the resolution.While presenting the resolution at the UNHRC, British ambassador Julian Braithwaite said: “Impunity has become more entrenched; progress in emblematic cases has stalled.” But Sri Lankan ambassador MCA Chandraprema rejected the document as “unhelpful and divisive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-abstains-from-unhrc-vote-on-sri-lanka-s-human-rights-record-101616518376995.html

As transmission continues, more variants are likely to emerge, including those that could evade vaccines.“The global access to vaccines are at risk because of the demands that high- and upper middle-income countries are putting on the global supply,” he said. “This is not just a moral outrage, it is also economically and epidemiologically self defeating.”These trends could put the world back at “square one,” Tedros said. “As long as the virus continues to circulate anywhere, people will continue to die, trade and travel will continue to be disrupted and the economic recovery will be further delayed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truly-worrying-trends-who-chief-on-rising-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-101616516660694.html

Then, he went back to their homeland -- but not before he placed her in the hands of a young man who was to help her cross the river into Texas.“He just said to go on my own and take care of myself,” she said.What happened to the man who was to be her guide is unclear, but the pony-tailed girl met up with a group and pressed on, vigorously swinging her arms to keep up as they trekked north through the Rio Grande Valley on Sunday under a half-moon. Temperatures had dipped into the mid-50s; the girl wore a yellow jacket decorated with cartoonish drawings of trains, and a black mask to protect her from Covid-19.The AP is not using the girl’s name. It does not normally name children without permission from their parents, and the identity of her father could not be obtained.But her journey illustrates the extraordinary risks taken by migrant parents to get their children across the border, even if it means abandoning them for the most perilous part of the trip.These desperate decisions represent a dilemma for the fledgling administration of President Joe Biden as it attempts to restore an orderly asylum system: In trying to adopt a more humane approach to protect minors traveling alone, more children may be put at risk.Nearly 9,500 migrant children arrived at the border in February, up 60% from a month earlier. The government is rushing to set up more facilities to house them and speeding up the process to place them with relatives in the US. The city and county of San Diego said Monday that its downtown convention center would host migrant children for an average of 30 to 35 days.Single adults are almost always expelled, while families are sometimes expelled and sometimes allowed to remain in the United States to pursue asylum.The girl did reach the United States. A fellow Honduran migrant, 25-year-old Fernanda Solis, said she found her crying alone on a dirt path north of the Rio Grande after midnight, as a helicopter hovered overhead and border agents addressed migrants through a loudspeaker.Solis tried to comfort the girl, who was cold, hungry and thirsty. She told her they could walk together to turn themselves over to Border Patrol agents and seek asylum.The girl gained confidence as she walked a route commonly used by Central American migrants. She answered questions unhesitatingly: She turns 8 next month. She should be going into third grade, though she did not complete second because of the pandemic.She pressed ahead to a country where she knows no one but a family member in South Carolina.“That’s how she acts. She is brave,” Solis said.The girl said her father had no more money to cross the border with her.“He lost his job,” she said, simply.Solis said she was able to gather that the girl’s father had recently tried to cross with her, but they were both quickly expelled back to Reynosa, Mexico, under pandemic-related powers the Trump administration invoked. Biden has kept the powers -- known as Title 42 for the section of an obscure public health law -- in place.“The girl told me they had tried to cross together, but they were returned. This time, he just sent the girl for her to turn herself in,” Solis said.A federal judge halted expulsions of unaccompanied children in November, after the Trump administration had turned back at least 8,800. But an appeals court panel of three Trump-appointed judges ruled in January that they could resume. Biden, in a break with Trump, decided to release children to relatives with notices to appear in immigration courts.The Honduran girl turned herself over to Customs and Border Protection; the agency did not respond to a request for information about her whereabouts.Her story is being repeated again and again along the border. On Sunday, a Salvadoran man approached a journalist to ask whether his 13-year-old daughter would qualify to stay if she crossed on her own.“The parents are saying ‘We are not going to make it. We have to be very realistic here, but if I send my child up to the bridge, and they cross alone, they’ll have to take them in,’” said Jennifer Harbury, a Texas-based human rights advocate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7yearold-girl-s-solo-journey-to-us-border-shows-risks-parents-take-101616514396744.html

We must fight for it.”The 44-year-old Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken opponent, was arrested on Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.Last month, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.Navalny’s arrest fueled a series of protests that drew tens of thousands to the streets across Russia. Authorities detained about 11,000 people, many of whom were fined or given jail terms ranging from seven to 15 days.Several top Navalny associates have faced charges of violating coronavirus restrictions by calling for protests, and have been put under house arrest.Russian officials have rejected demands from the United States and the European Union to free Navalny and stop the crackdown on his supporters.Moscow also has rejected the European Court of Human Rights’ demand to release Navalny, describing it as unlawful and “inadmissible” meddling in Russia’s domestic affairs.Earlier this month, Navalny posted a note confirming that he arrived at a prison colony in Pokrov in the Vladimir region, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of Moscow, to serve his sentence. The facility stands out among Russian penitentiaries for its particularly strict regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalnys-allies-call-for-major-protest-across-russia-101616513988917.html

"Her boyfriend and her had been good friends and began dating in the fall of 2019. He was working yesterday too.

The flagship University of Colorado campus is near the store.Knuston said she thought Leiker's job had come through a special needs work program.The 10 victims ranged in age from 20 to 65 and included Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder police force. Talley, 51, was the father of seven children and had recently been looking for a less dangerous job, according to a statement released by his father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/among-colorado-victims-a-shop-worker-who-loved-job-and-was-dating-colleague-101616514418541.html

Asked about her position on stalled WTO talks on an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 drugs proposed by India and South Africa, she said she was not opposed to it.However, she said that it was important to also seek to boost manufacturing through other routes because the talks were "taking some time"."What I have proposed is a third way because people are dying," she said, adding that this included lowering export barriers and using existing capacity to increase output.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disappointed-wto-chief-okonjo-iweala-on-eu-vaccine-export-restrictions-101616514406621.html
23-03-2021||World||Myanmar's military junta defends crackdown amid intensifying protests||Myanmar's military junta on Tuesday took the offensive to try to justify last month's coup and subsequent actions against those opposed to it, even as street demonstrations continued against the takeover.At a news conference in the capital Naypyitaw, the military presented a video of a former political colleague of ousted national leader Aung San Suu Kyi claiming he had handed over large amounts of cash and gold to her personally, in what the military has characterised as corruption. Such allegations were previously denied by her lawyer.Many of the protests Tuesday were staged in a way that avoided confrontations with authorities, who have not hesitated to use lethal force to break up demonstrations. Some marches were held before dawn in Yangon, the country's biggest city, and elsewhere and went unmolested. Other protests adopted the tactic of having signboards or other inanimate objects lined up in the street to serve as proxies for human demonstrators.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has verified 261 protesters' deaths nationwide but says the actual total, including cases where verification has been difficult, is probably much higher. It said 2,682 people have also been arrested or charged since the coup, with 2,302 still detained or sought for arrest.In its news conference, the military presented displays of seized homemade weapons and videos of street battles to argue that the demonstrators are violent and that its efforts to stop them are justified. However, in the weeks since the February 1 coup, protesters only began using organised violence after more than 100 demonstrators had been shot dead by police and soldiers.The allegations against Suu Kyi made by former Yangon Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein were first mentioned by the military several weeks ago. Last week the military-controlled Myawaddy TV station aired a similar video with a construction magnate who also claimed to have made large payoffs to Suu Kyi. That video was replayed at Tuesday's news conference.No supporting evidence for the allegations has been offered, and they are generally dismissed as an effort by the military to frame Suu Kyi so she can be discredited and tried on a serious criminal charge. She is already being held on several more minor charges.A report in the state-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper on Tuesday said the junta has expressed fresh concern about civil servants, teachers and medical workers joining the Civil Disobedience Movement that is the vanguard group opposing last month's military takeover.The report referred to the opposition group as CDM, the initials by which it is popularly known. The group encourages employees of key enterprises, such as government offices, to stay away from work.In what was a relatively conciliatory tone compared with earlier threats, the junta at its Monday meeting was reported to have described failing to show up at work as “not a crime but a violation of the civil service disciplines.”It said that for first offences, civil servants would have to sign confessions, but further offences would be dealt with according to civil service rules.Previously, government employees have been detained for joining the CDM, and striking state railway workers have been kicked out of their government-supplied housing if they don't agree to go back to work.Myanmar labour unions on March 7 issued a joint call for an extended nationwide work stoppage, with the goal of a “full, extended shutdown of the Myanmar economy.”In a statement, they called for the strike to continue “until we receive our democracy back.”Tuesday's report of the junta's meeting also highlighted teachers' absences from work, saying some have joined the CDM, as have health workers.The junta repeated its claims that civil servants, teachers and doctors joined the CDM under threat.“They should make a complaint to the respective authorities about the matter,” said the newspaper's account of the junta meeting. “Some teachers and doctors are still absent from work as they are worried that they may face punishment if they return to the unit," junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing was cited saying.Although the CDM does not advocate violence, the movement has painted those who don't give it support as collaborators with the junta with blood on their hands, who may be ostracised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-military-junta-defends-crackdown-amid-intensifying-protests-101616513260771.html

He said the investigation is in the early stages but that detectives believe the suspect was the only shooter, Dougherty said.A law enforcement official briefed on the shooting told The Associated Press that the gunman used an AR-15 rifle, a lightweight semi-automatic rifle.

23-03-2021||World||Colorado shooting: What is ‘Charleston loophole’? Why US needs stricter gun laws?||Multiple mass shootings across the United States within a week, particularly the Monday incident in a Colorado supermarket which claimed 10 lives, have resulted in a renewed call for stricter gun laws. In 2021, there have been at least six mass shooting incidents with four or more killed, including spa shootings in Georgia which killed six Asian American women. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren took to Twitter to call on Democrats to get rid of the filibuster and pass gun safety legislation, adding that a huge majority of Americans support it.“Week after week, month after month, year after year – the gun violence doesn't end. And things won't get better until Democrats get rid of the filibuster and finally pass gun safety legislation that a huge majority of Americans support. What are we waiting for – another tragedy?” she tweeted.Week after week, month after month, year after year – the gun violence doesn't end. And things won't get better until Democrats get rid of the filibuster and finally pass gun safety legislation that a huge majority of Americans support. What are we waiting for – another tragedy?US House of Representatives, led by Democrats, recently passed two bills aimed at strengthening federal gun laws while the majority of Republicans opposed the legislation. The first bill, passed with 227-203 votes, would provide for background checks on all firearms sales and transfers, including those purchased over the internet, at gun shows and through certain private transactions.'Charleston loophole'The second bill, passed in the House with only two Republicans supporting it, would close the so-called “Charleston loophole”. Apart from the age limit, certain individuals, including those with felony convictions and prison sentence exceeding one year or guilty of unlawfully possessing controlled substances within the past year, are prohibited from purchasing firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968.In the vast majority of cases, the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS) returns a definitive result when an individual submits to a background check for purchasing a gun. However, in some cases, the system fails to make an immediate determination on the eligibility of the prospective buyer.Under the current law, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) gets only three business days to probe the submission and if the agency doesn’t conclude the investigation in the stipulated time period, the gun seller gets the discretion of proceeding with the firearms sale. In 2015, a shooter with a criminal history misused this loophole of “default proceed” sales to purchase firearms and went on to commit a hate crime at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine worshippers at the historic African American church.Democrats are hoping to close this loophole through the second bill by giving authorities 10 business days for federal background checks before a gun sale can be licensed. Although Democrats control the 100-members Senate with 50 seats plus a tie-breaker vote of vice president Kamala Harris, the bill, like most legislation, would need 60 votes to end the debate to go for a full vote on the Senate floor. This procedure allows senators to filibuster and debate the bill endlessly to stall the vote.In order to eliminate the filibuster, all 50 Democratic senators have to be on board with the plan but at least two Democrats - Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have opposed the idea of ending the procedure. With sweeping voting rights, strongly backed by Biden, also facing the roadblock of the filibuster, the US Senate is rapidly moving towards a showdown over the procedural manoeuver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-are-we-waiting-for-colorado-shooting-triggers-call-for-stricter-gun-laws-101616511355037.html

23-03-2021||World||More than 2,300 children killed in Yemen war between 2018-2020: Aid agency||Children accounted for a quarter of civilian casualties over the last three years in Yemen's grinding war between Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the internationally recognised government, a child relief agency said Tuesday.More than 2,300 children were killed between 2018 and 2020, Save the Children said in a new study. However, the group said the actual toll is likely to be much higher.“Yemeni children have been living through a horrific and endless nightmare for six years now. Children continue to be killed and injured on a near-daily basis," said the organization's country director, Xavier Joubert.Save the Children's report comes on the heels of a UNICEF statement issued Saturday, saying that eight children were killed and 33 wounded this month alone.Philippe Duamelle, UNICEF's representative to Yemen, said the casualties happened in several areas including the provinces of Taiz and Hodeida, where fighting between forces of the internationally recognized government and Houthi rebels has recently intensified.On Monday, Saudi Arabia offered their Houthi rivals a cease-fire plan that includes the reopening of the international airport in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, which has been under siege for almost six years. The Houthis downplayed the offer, claiming it did not offer anything new.“All parties to the conflict must fully implement a cease-fire as soon as possible," said Joubert. "The cease-fire should be used to work towards a sustainable peace and a political solution to this war — it's the only way to truly end this humanitarian catastrophe.”Like other relief agencies, the London-based Save the Children deplored plummeting funding levels for relief efforts in the war-stricken country. The group said its funds for aid to children in Yemen has dropped by more than 40% compared to last year.“If the U.N.'s predictions are correct, the worst famine in decades could kill hundreds of thousands of children. We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening,” said President and CEO Janti Soeripto.Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 when the Houthis took control of the capital Sanaa and much of the country's north, forcing the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition, backed at the time by the U.S., entered the war months later to try to restore Hadi to power.Now mired in stalemate, the war has killed about 130,000 people — including more than 12,000 civilians — and spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis in a country that was already the Arab world's most impoverished nation.The Biden administration has been keen to stop the war in Yemen. Earlier this month, the U.S. envoy for Yemen, Tim Lenderking, urged the Houthis to accept his cease-fire proposal. However, the rebels are still pushing aggressively to take the government stronghold of Marib, in central Yemen.Also Tuesday, Human Rights Watch accused the Houthis of firing indiscriminate artillery and missiles into heavily populated areas as they push to take Marib. The New York-based group called on the rebels to halt their attacks and allow unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians trapped by the fighting.Afrah Nasser, the group's Yemen researcher, said the Houthis have “shown a shocking disregard for the well-being and safety of civilians.” A spokesman for the Houthis was not immediately available for comment.Last week, a Houthi missile reportedly hit a fuel station at a Marib market, killing at least two civilians and wounding seven.“It was tragic seeing blood and flesh of bodies spread on the ground and the damaged cars ... The explosion was huge, and we felt it across all Marib city,” HRW quoted an unnamed witness as saying.The group said Houthi artillery and heavy weapons have hit several camps for displaced people last month in the city. Already, four displacement camps have been abandoned since the start of the offensive, the U.N. migration agency said.Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yehia Sarie, meanwhile, said they targeted Saudi Arabia's southwestern Abha airport with a bomb-laden drone.There was no immediate comment from the Saudi-led coalition on the attack, which came a day after Saudi Arabia announced a cease-fire initiative in Yemen.Sarie also claimed they shot down a U.S. MQ-9 drone over Marib. He did not say which country operated the drone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-2-300-children-killed-in-yemen-war-between-2018-2020-aid-agency-101616510412340.html
23-03-2021||World||'Busy on other fronts': White House without Trump stays quiet on OPEC||When oil prices surged during Donald Trump's term in the White House, OPEC and its allies had to brace for a Twitter storm demanding action to bring prices down.That has all changed under US President Joe Biden. His team barely uttered a word this month when crude soared to more than $70 a barrel, an almost 40% rise from the start of 2021."Biden's people are busy on other fronts, like fighting the pandemic," said one OPEC source.It is not just that Twitter is no longer the preferred means to communicate US demands. OPEC sources say no-one from the Biden administration has even reached out informally to OPEC to complain about the latest oil price rise, which was fuelled by a decision in March by OPEC, Russia and others to stick broadly to existing production restrictions rather than to open the taps.When the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet again on April 1, traders and market sources say the group known as OPEC+ can pursue policies to prop up prices in the knowledge the White House won't be breathing down its neck."Right now is the ideal point in time," said an oil trade source and veteran OPEC watcher. "One doesn't need to worry about backlash from Washington, as Trump is gone."After a demand slump sent oil prices crashing in 2020, crude has rebounded. Brent hit $71.38, on March 8, after the OPEC+ decision on March 4 to keep most of their production curbs in place.Yet, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki made no direct comment about the OPEC decision when asked about it on March 4 and instead said the United States was focused on helping Americans via the U.S. economic stimulus package.Oil prices have now eased from their highs but are still up almost 20% this year, trading at $62 on Wednesday.A spokesperson for the National Security Council (NSC) at the White House said there had been no U.S.-OPEC contact on oil policy or prices since Biden took office on Jan. 20, although that did not mean the oil market was off the radar."The Biden Administration continues to monitor oil market developments carefully as economies reopen and oil demand recovers to ensure economic stability as a short-term imperative," the spokesperson said.'FAR LESS VOCAL'For now, OPEC+ delegates expect there will be no output increase or only a modest one agreed on April 1.Asked if Washington wanted OPEC+ to agree to pump more oil, the NSC spokesperson said the government was "committed to supporting policies that ensure the American people have reliable access to sustainable and affordable energy resources."The contrast with Trump's approach could not be more stark. The former US president often took to Twitter to address the group directly and to demand publicly that it change policy."REDUCE PRICING NOW!" Trump tweeted in July 2018, addressing a group he called the "OPEC Monopoly" in a month when crude hit $80.In April 2020, when prices crashed, hammering U.S. oil producers as well as others, Trump engaged in talks that included Saudi Arabia and Russia, leading to a deal in which OPEC+ agreed a record supply cut. Most curbs remain in place."The Biden administration has been far less vocal and I don't see them interacting much with OPEC+ in the near term either," said Samuel Ciszuk, who founded consultancy ELS Analysis and previously worked for the Swedish Energy Agency.Since taking office, Biden has kept his distance from Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two leading producers in OPEC+.His administration imposed sanctions on some Saudis over the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the U.S. president has said he thought his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was a killer, sending diplomatic ties to a new post-Cold War low."Firstly, on a political level both Russia and Saudi Arabia have been pointedly shunned by Biden himself in his first months, in order for him to send a message," Ciszuk said."And from a market and economics perspective, I think the Biden administration has also had to focus elsewhere."The NSC spokesperson said Biden's team was not seeking to play a less active role than Trump's administration in trying to influence OPEC policy but the emphasis was on clean energy."The United States will utilise its strong relationships with other major oil producing economies to meaningfully advance the clean-energy transition and jointly pursue a path towards our climate goals," the spokesperson said.That goal was to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/busy-on-other-fronts-white-house-without-trump-stays-quiet-on-opec-101616507179550.html

So, while you attacked them, they might come to us. We controlled areas along the border because we have our national security concerns. But if your army can control the trenches, we will leave the next day."He said the Ethiopian government had also raised accusations of widespread looting and rights abuses by Eritrean soldiers."The Eritrean government has highly condemned it and said they will be accountable if any of their army participated in this."Fighting erupting in Tigray after forces loyal to the regional government - the Tigray People's Liberation Front - attacked army bases across the region overnight and in the early hours of Novem 4.The attacks initially overwhelmed the federal military, which later launched a counter offensive alongside Eritrean soldiers and forces from the neighbouring region of Amhara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopian-pm-confirms-eritrean-troops-entered-tigray-during-recent-conflict-101616504090862.html
23-03-2021||World||Polish writer facing prison for calling president 'moron'||A Polish writer is being facing up to three years of imprisonment for calling the nation's president a “moron” on social media.Jakub Zulczyk had criticized the manner in which Polish President Andrzej Duda — a close ally of former President Donald Trump — had reacted to the electoral victory of President Joe Biden last year.Zulczyk wrote on Facebook on Monday that a district prosecutor in Warsaw had filed an indictment against him based on an article in the penal code that makes it a crime to insult the head of state.Zulczyk said he believed that he is probably "the first writer in this country in a long time to be tried for what they wrote.”People have also been charged in the past for insulting previous Polish presidents in the post-communist era under the country's broad insult laws. Fines or fines or community service — and not years in prison — are seen as the most likely punishment.However, the case also comes amid what many see as an erosion of democratic standards in Poland since a right-wing populist party, Law and Justice, won power in 2015. Government critics accuse the authorities of aggressively harnessing prosecutorial powers to promote those in power.The comment in question concerns a critical response by Zulczyk to a congratulatory tweet by Duda after U.S. media called the election for Biden on Nov. 7.Duda offered his congratulations to Biden “for a successful presidential campaign. As we await the nomination by the Electoral College, Poland is determined to upkeep high-level and high-quality PL-US strategic partnership for an even stronger alliance.”At the time of Duda's tweet, many other European leaders were offering full-fledged congratulations to Biden. At home, Duda was criticized by many for suggesting that Biden's victory was somehow not definitive and that the Electoral College could still somehow change the result.That same day, Zulczyk wrote on Facebook that as someone with a master's degree in American studies, he had never heard of a “nomination by the Electoral College” in the U.S. system. He said the Democratic candidate had clearly won the election.“Joe Biden is the 46th president of the United States. Andrzej Duda is a moron," he wrote.Prosecutors made their indictment based on the complaint of a private individual, and it was unclear if Duda had been informed about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polish-writer-facing-prison-for-calling-president-moron-101616499502501.html

The company will “immediately engage” with the independent panel monitoring the trial to share its analysis with the latest efficacy data.In a brief statement last night, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the monitoring board charged with ensuring the safety and accuracy of the vaccine trial had expressed concern that results included outdated information.The institute, headed by Anthony Fauci, urged AstraZeneca to work with the data and safety monitoring board to “ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible.”The disclosure marks the latest hitch for AstraZeneca, which said on Monday that the vaccine was found to be 79% effective in preventing Covid-19 in a U.S. clinical trial of more than 30,000 volunteers. The shot, developed with the University of Oxford and viewed as a frontrunner to help curb the pandemic, has been beset by complications.It’s now at the center of a supply showdown with the European Union, just days after concerns about blood clots prompted a dozen countries to suspend immunizations.More Concerns“The last thing this vaccine needs is more concern when we kind of thought we were at that point now where we’d put to bed all the other concerns,” said Paul Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, who is conducting clinical studies in Australia on four Covid-19 vaccine candidates.After the vaccine was cleared for use in the UK and many other nations, AstraZeneca is preparing to seek approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. That greenlight may now be delayed.The shares traded 1.1% lower Tuesday in London.The efficacy rate in the US trial was stronger than the 70% figure AstraZeneca reported from an earlier study. But those data were an average of different readings -- 62% and 90% -- from two arms of the trial. Because of a manufacturing error, one group of participants had received a lower first dose, which produced the higher reading, compared with those getting two standard doses. Further analysis suggested it was the greater dosing gap rather than amount that had created the difference.Something ‘Significant’The Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent panel, also brought its concerns about the US trial results to the British drugmaker and to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a U.S. agency that partially funded the shot’s development.“It was referring to outdated information, and it’s kind of hard to imagine how outdated information could be included when these vaccines are all fairly new,” said Griffin, an infectious-disease physician and microbiologist. “The impression I got was that it seemed to be something very significant they were alluding to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-to-share-more-data-on-covid-vaccine-after-us-calls-results-outdated-101616501629658.html
23-03-2021||World||India abstains as UNHRC adopts resolution against Sri Lanka's rights record||The UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday adopted a resolution against Sri Lanka's rights record, in a setback to Colombo, which made determined efforts to garner international support ahead of the voting.The resolution titled ‘Promotion of Reconciliation Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka’ was adopted by the UNHRC after 22 members out of 47 voted in favour of it. Eleven members voted against the resolution.India was among 14 countries which abstained from voting.Sri Lanka described the draft resolution as "unwarranted, unjustified and in violations of the relevant articles of the United Nations’ Charter…"India urged that the government of Sri Lanka to carry forward some process of reconciliation, address the aspirations of Tamil community and continue to engage constructively with the international community to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected.Sri Lanka was earlier defeated at three consecutive resolutions at the UN rights body when Gotabaya’s elder brother and incumbent Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was the country's president between 2012 and 2014.The government of Gotabaya Rajapaksa had officially withdrawn from co-sponsoring the previous resolution undertaken by the previous government. It had called for an international investigation into alleged war crimes committed by both the government troops and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the final phase of the near-three-decade-long civil war that ended in May 2009.Sri Lanka was assured of support from China, Russia and several Muslim countries, including Pakistan.Ahead of the voting on the resolution, President Gotabaya and Prime Minister Mahinda made phone calls to world Muslim leaders.The resolution calls upon "the (Sri Lankan) government to ensure prompt thorough and impartial investigation, if warranted, prosecution of all alleged crimes relating to human rights violations and serious violations of international human rights law".The resolution has been tabled by Core Group on Sri Lanka consisting of the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Malawi, Montenegro, and North Macedonia at the 46th Session of the (UNHRC) in Geneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-abstains-as-unhrc-adopts-resolution-against-sri-lanka-s-rights-record-101616500973957.html

23-03-2021||World||Evanston, Illinois, becomes first US city to pay reparations to Black residents||Evanston, Illinois, on Monday became the first U.S. city to make reparations available to its Black residents for past discrimination and the lingering effects of slavery.The Chicago suburb’s City Council voted 8-1 to distribute $400,000 to eligible Black households. Each qualifying household would receive $25,000 for home repairs or down payments on the property.The program is being funded through donations and revenue from a 3% tax on the sale of recreational marijuana. The city has pledged to distribute $10 million over 10 years.Qualifying residents must either have lived in or been a direct descendant of a Black person who lived in Evanston between 1919 to 1969 and who suffered discrimination in housing because of city ordinances, policies or practices.Alderman Rue Simmons, who proposed the program that was adopted in 2019, said pro-reparations groups have offered pro-bono legal assistance if the program is challenged in court.“This is set aside for an injured community that happens to be Black, that was injured by the city of Evanston for anti-Black housing policies,” Simmons said.The City Council acted after dozens of citizens addressed the body and the plan received some pushback from several.Alderman Cicely Fleming, the lone vote against the plan, said she supports reparations, but what the City Council was debating is a housing plan that is being called reparations. She said the people should dictate the terms of how their grievances are repaired. Fleming described the program as paternalistic, and it assumes Black people can’t manage their own money.Hundreds of communities and organizations across the country are considering providing reparations to Black people. They range from the state of California to cities like Amherst, Massachusetts, Providence, Rhode Island, Asheville, North Carolina, and Iowa City, Iowa; religious denominations like the Episcopal Church; and prominent colleges like Georgetown University in Washington.The efforts, some of which have been underway for years, have gained momentum in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody last May in Minneapolis. President Joe Biden has even expressed support for creating a federal commission to study Black reparations, a proposal that’s languished for decades in Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evanston-illinois-becomes-first-us-city-to-pay-reparations-to-black-residents-101616500736338.html
23-03-2021||World||US health body questions AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine trial data||AstraZeneca may have released outdated information on its latest Covid-19 vaccine trial, giving an "incomplete" picture of its efficacy, a leading US health agency said on Tuesday, casting doubt on the shot's potential US rollout and plunging its developers, once again, into controversy.The surprise public rebuke from federal health officials comes just one day after interim data from the drugmaker showed better-than-expected results from the U.S. trial. That had been seen as a scientific counter to concerns that have dogged the shot over its effectiveness and possible side effects.The vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in the large trial that also took place in Chile and Peru, according to the data. It was also 100% effective against severe or critical forms of the disease and hospitalisation, and posed no increased risk of blood clots.The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent committee overseeing the trial, has "expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data," the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said in a statement https://bit.ly/3scE3ji released after midnight in the United States."We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible," it said, adding that the DSMB had informed AstraZeneca of its concerns.AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Its shares were down 1.2% in midmorning trade.The statement raises fresh questions about the vaccine's efficacy as it is being administered in dozens of countries worldwide and clouds the timeline for its emergency use authorization in the United States."This is indeed an extraordinary act. The negative reports about this vaccine do not stop, although my assessment is that it is well tolerated and safe, but clearly less effective than the two mRNA vaccines," Peter Kremsner, from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.Rival vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that use so-called mRNA technology produced efficacy rates of around 95% each, far above the 50% benchmark set by global regulators.The DSMB is organised by NIAID, and its role is to provide study oversight and evaluate clinical data to ensure safe and ethical conduct of the study. NIAID is headed by U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and is part of the National Institutes of Health."DSMB externalisations of concerns are deeply unusual for multinational pharma companies and suggest an extraordinary high level of friction between the DSMB and the sponsor," Citi analysts said in a note.DOUBTS RAISEDHailed as a milestone in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic when it first emerged as a vaccine contender, the AstraZeneca shot has faced questions since late last year when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data with different efficacy readings due to a measurement error.Later analysis suggested the dosing interval rather than the amount of dose administered was responsible for the difference.Confidence in the vaccine took a further hit this month when more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended the shot after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.The European Union's drug regulator said last week it was safe but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained sceptical about its safety.Fauci, who also serves as chief medical advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden, said on Monday the U.S. trial found no indication at all of the rare blood clots and the statement from the NIAID didn't raise questions about the trial's findings regarding blood clotting.The latest data, which has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers, was based on 141 infections among 32,449 participants.Analysts had noted AstraZeneca's achievement of producing strong trial data against a backdrop of more infectious variants spreading in the United States and other countries.Stephen Evans, a pharmacoepidemiology professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the up-to-date data request may have to do with efficacy readings from recent infections which may include new variants and thus lower protection rates."The other vaccines may also show such reduced efficacy and we don’t know by how much. It does not leave me concerned particularly unless they had found a safety issue that was being hidden, which does not appear to be the case."The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of Covid-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.It has been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorization in more than 70 countries. Many countries are relying heavily on it to end the pandemic, and several state leaders have taken the shot to boost confidence in the vaccine including South Korea's President Moon Jae-in who received it on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-body-questions-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-data-101616500153626.html
23-03-2021||World||US urges court to certify India's request to extradite 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana||The Biden administration has urged a federal court in Los Angeles to certify India's request to extradite fugitive Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, saying he meets all the criteria required for the handover.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian has scheduled the extradition hearing for April 22.Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian, in his submission before a federal US court in Los Angeles, California, said Rana, 59, meets all the criteria to be extradited to India for his trial in the Mumbai terrorist attack. On February 4, Rana's attorney had opposed his extradition."The United States respectfully requests that following the April 22, 2021, extradition hearing, the Court certify India's request for Rana's extradition for the Secretary of State's surrender decision," Lulejian said in his 61-page court submission on Monday.Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India."Fugitive Tahawwur Hussain Rana is wanted in India to stand trial for offences related to his role in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, that resulted in the death of 166 people, the injury of 239 people, and the damage to property in excess of USD 1.5 billion," Lulejian said.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated the extradition proceeding.Lulejian said the criteria warranting certification of extradition are satisfied in this case.These criteria are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.India's extradition request contains evidence to establish probable cause that the individual appearing in court is the fugitive who committed the offence for which extradition is requested, Lulejian argued.In his court submission on February 4, Rana's attorney had argued that Rana's extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences.Lulejian said that the court should find that Rana's extradition is not barred under Article 6 of the India-US Extradition Treaty.Although there is ample evidence that Rana aided and abetted the Mumbai attack, he claims that he should not be extradited because probable cause is lacking. Rana's claim is based on an improper attempt to attack the credibility of a key witness against him, Lulejian said.Rana also does not contest that he is the person who India alleges committed the charged crimes. Instead, he challenges only whether Article 6 of the treaty bars his extradition and whether probable cause exists to believe that he committed the offences for which India requests his extradition, the Assistant US Attorney said.Lulejian said Headley's plea agreement is irrelevant because Rana cannot benefit from its terms. Not only is Rana in a different position than Headley because he did not plead guilty or cooperate with the United States, as is his right, but his inability to benefit from the negotiated terms of Headley's plea agreement is confirmed by the text of the plea agreement itself.He said Rana's extradition proceedings are separate from Headley's criminal proceedings and are being litigated by a different United States attorney's office from the one who negotiated the plea agreement with Headley.According to its very terms, Rana has no rights under Headley's plea agreement and is therefore prohibited from relying on it in an attempt to undermine the United States' position on his extraditability under the treaty, he added."Rana has failed to demonstrate that he cannot be extradited to India as a result of his prior prosecution in the United States," the attorney said.Rana attempts to undermine India's evidence of probable cause by questioning the credibility of the key witness, David Headley. Not only is Rana's challenge improper in this extradition proceeding, but his claims are also not supported by the law or the evidence, Lulejian said.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-urges-us-court-to-certify-india-s-request-to-extradite-tahawwur-rana-101616499547825.html

The crash involved three cars, the report said, and also left 11 people injured.The accident comes as Iran is celebrating the Persian New Year, or Nowruz, which began on Saturday. Many Iranians are traveling during the holidays — despite warnings by health officials over the pandemic. Iran has struggled with the region's worst outbreak of the coronavirus, with over 1.8 million registered cases and 61,951 deaths.The ISNA news agency quoted Mojtaba Khaledi, spokesman of the country’s emergency department, as saying the accident took place around noon near the city of Zahedan in Sistan and Baluchistan province.The fatalities among the children were two girls and six boys, aged between 3 years and 8 years. Two men and four women also died in the accident, he added. The casualties were taken to a hospital in Zahedan.Iranian police said road traffic increased 52% during this Nowruz holiday, compared to the same period last year. So far, since the holiday-related traveling started last Friday, more than 120 people have died in road accidents.With some 17,000 annual deaths, Iran has one of the world’s worst traffic safety records. The grave toll is blamed on wide disregard for traffic laws, unsafe vehicles and inadequate emergency services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-road-accident-kills-at-least-14-including-8-children-101616498601382.html

Another one in the United States is listed as a back-up supplier. Currently, only the plant in Belgium, run by Thermo Fisher Scientific, is producing shots for the EU.The Commission has also started a procedure foreseen under the contract with AstraZeneca that could lead to legal action against the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-use-all-tools-available-over-astrazeneca-shortfalls-eu-vaccine-chief-101616498132793.html

"What they've done is violating behaviour. It's physical. It's sexualising, objectifying behaviour - it makes me feel physically sick."Australia's parliament has been repeatedly criticised for a "toxic" workplace culture that has allegedly spawned persistent bullying, harassment and sexual assault of women -- particularly in the ruling coalition.Former government staffer Brittany Higgins alleged publicly last month that she had been raped by a colleague in a minister's parliamentary office in 2019.And earlier this month, Attorney-General Christian Porter vigorously denied swirling accusations he had raped a 16-year-old girl in 1988 when they were both students.The controversies have placed growing pressure on the prime minister, who critics say has fumbled the government's response.Morrison grew emotional at a press conference in Canberra on Tuesday when talking about the importance of his wife, mother and daughters, also saying women had endured a "very traumatic" month."These events have triggered, right across this building and indeed right across the country, women who have put up with this rubbish and this crap for their entire lives, as their mothers did, as their grandmothers did," he said.Tens of thousands of women this month joined "#March4Justice" rallies to protest sexual violence and gender inequality, calling for systemic change in politics and wider Australian society.The opposition Labor party, which already has gender quotas in place, has not been immune from similar allegations. A Facebook group of female workers recently detailed alleged sexual harassment by male colleagues and politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disgraceful-sex-acts-in-parliament-rock-australia-s-government-101616497398470.html

Here's the list||The shooting at a Colorado supermarket on Monday, which claimed 10 lives, including that of a police officer, was among at least seven mass shootings in the last seven days across the United States. The rise in the incidents of gun violence has renewed the discussion around gun control, a contentious issue in the United States as Democrats and Republicans hold a contrasting view on the matter. Former US president Donald Trump was against stricter gun laws but Joe Biden, who ran a successful presidential campaign, had promised to completely ban assault weapons after taking the office.In the US, nearly 40,000 people were killed in 2019 in incidents involving firearms, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which means 12 deaths per 100,000 people. In 2021, there have been at least six mass shooting incidents so far with four or more killed, including Monday’s shooting in the Boulder area of Colorado and spa shootings in Georgia which killed six Asian American women. However, the US federal government has no centralised system to track firearm incidents and mass shootings around the country.Take a look at the seven mass shooting incidents within as many days:Atlanta, Georgia, March 16: A white gunman, Robert Aaron Long, went on a shooting rampage last Tuesday at three Atlanta-area massage parlours that sent terror through the Asian American community. The 21-year-old suspect was charged with killing eight people in the worst mass shooting in the United States in almost two years.Stockton, California, March 17: A group of people gathered and preparing for a vigil in Stockton were targeted in a drive-by shooting. According to the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office, a total of five people were shot but all were “uncooperative with the deputies on the scene.” They were treated and released from the hospital as none had life-threatening injuries.Gresham, Oregon, March 18: Four victims were taken to the hospital following a shooting in the city east of Portland. The Gresham police department said in its initial report that lots of police resources were trying to gather information on what exactly happened.Houston, Texas, March 20: Five people were shot after a “disturbance” inside a club, said the Houston police department on Twitter.Dallas, Texas, March 20: A total of eight people were injured in a mass shooting at the Pryme Night Club, one of the victims, a 21-year old Latin female, died from her injuries. According to the Dallas police department, the suspect was involved in a verbal argument with another patron in the club after which he produced a firearm and began shooting inside the club.Philadelphia, March 20: According to police officials, gunfire erupted inside and outside a rental hall adjacent to Hot Pot Cuisine in north Philadelphia's Nicetown neighbourhood. The shooting at an illegal large gathering in Philadelphia killed one person and wounded five others.Boulder, Colorado, March 22: The shooting at a Colorado supermarket killed 10 people and a suspect was taken into custody, authorities said. Police said that they were investigating the incident and didn’t have the details on the motive of the shooting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-supermarket-incident-among-7-mass-shootings-in-us-in-as-many-days-101616495469239.html

Of these, 158 cases were reported in the last two weeks.The mutant strain from UK was first reported in India on December 29 in six passengers who had returned from Britain.The UK strain, which triggered panic worldwide about three months ago, also led to travel restrictions in India with the government announcing a temporary ban on flights.Minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey earlier told the Rajya Sabha that the three variants are believed to be more contagious or easier to catch. These three mutated variants also have the potential to re-infect people who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."No case of re-infection by mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported from India so far," the Minister said.India reported 40,715 infections of coronavirus disease, 10,731 active cases, 29,785 recoveries and 199 deaths in the last 24 hours, Union ministry of health and family welfare's data showed today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/795-uk-brazil-south-africa-covid-19-variant-cases-in-india-govt-101616495022892.html

23-03-2021||World||'Global political turbulence': Russia, China call for UNSC summit||Russia and China said on Tuesday they wanted a summit of permanent members of the U.N. Security Council amid what they called heightened political turbulence, with Moscow saying they both believed the United States was acting in a destructive way.The two allies, whose relations with the West are under increasing strain, made the call for a summit in a joint statement after talks between their foreign ministers in the city of Guilin."At a time of increasing global political turbulence, a summit of the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council is particularly necessary to establish direct dialogue about ways to resolve humankind's common problems in the interests of maintaining global stability," they said in a statement published on the Russian foreign ministry's website.Moscow has long been pushing for such a summit.The statement did not mention the United States by name. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that Moscow and Beijing were both unhappy with U.S. behaviour."We noted the destructive nature of U.S. intentions, relying on the military-political alliances of the Cold War era and creating new closed alliances in the same spirit, to undermine the U.N.-centered international legal architecture," said Lavrov."We emphasised that against the background of active attempts by the West to promote its concept of a 'rules-based world order', the joint efforts of Russia and China...to preserve the modern system of international law are becoming more and more relevant."Both countries' ties with Washington are strained.U.S. and Chinese officials on Friday concluded what Washington called "tough and direct" talks in Alaska, while Russia's ambassador is back in Moscow for talks after U.S. President Joe Biden said he believed President Vladimir Putin was a killer.Kicking off his two-day trip to China on Monday, Lavrov issued a call for Moscow and Beijing to reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar.Tuesday's joint statement urged other countries to refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of Russia and China.Lavrov said Russia and China regarded European and Western sanctions as unacceptable.On Monday, the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on a handful of Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Russia too is braced for a new round of U.S. sanctions over what Washington says was its meddling in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, which Moscow denies.Lavrov also took a swipe at the European Union, accusing Brussels of destroying Russia-EU ties. He said that Moscow only had relations with individual EU nations now."On the Western front there are no changes, but in the East there is an intensive agenda which grows richer every year," he said.(Reporting by Andrew Osborn, Maxim Rodionov and Alexander Marrow in Moscow and by Stella Qiu and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-political-turbulence-russia-china-call-for-unsc-summit-101616494875063.html

Paris and other regions have been under a new lockdown since Saturday, although the government is encouraging open-air activities and more businesses are open than during previous confinements.Macron said the priority was to immunize most vulnerable people and seniors “to relieve pressure on the hospital system,” according to a pool report. So far, the vaccination was open only to people over 75, patients with preconditions or medical staff, but the number of people above 75 in intensive care has dropped, highlighting the need to expand eligibility to the vaccination campaign.Around 9% of French people have received at least one vaccine jab. The government aims to have immunized 10 million people by mid-April, 20 million in mid-May and 30 million mid-June -- less than half of the total population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-expand-covid-19-vaccination-to-people-above-70-says-macron-101616494505939.html

Authorities took samples from the pigs and river water for examination, and pigs on nearby farms would be tested, it said.The magazine reported Monday that dozens of pig carcasses had been discovered on the Inner Mongolia section of China’s second-longest river and some were rotting in the water, turning the spotlight back onto food and water safety. The authorities also found 17 dead sheep and one cow carcass and vowed to crackdown on the practice of discarding dead animals, it said.The latest discovery comes as China’s hog herd is recovering from the ravages of African swine fever. The disease broke out in the country in 2018 and destroyed almost half the hogs in the world’s largest pork producer. Concerns over food safety and rising costs of pork production have accelerated the closure of small pig farms in favor of larger, more efficient facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-collects-48-dead-pigs-discarded-along-the-yellow-river-101616485515074.html

23-03-2021||World||Extremist groups thrive on Facebook despite bans: Report||A new outside report found that Facebook has allowed groups — many tied to QAnon, boogaloo and militia movements — to glorify violence during the 2020 election and in the weeks leading up to the deadly riots on the U.S. Capitol in January.Avaaz, a nonprofit advocacy group that says it seeks to protect democracies from misinformation, identified 267 pages and groups on Facebook that it says spread violence-glorifying material in the heat of the 2020 election to a combined following of 32 million users.More than two-thirds of the groups and pages had names that aligned with several domestic extremist movements, the report found. The first, boogaloo, promotes a second U.S. civil war and the breakdown of modern society. The second is the QAnon conspiracy, which claims that Donald Trump is waging a secret battle against the “deep state” and a sect of powerful Satan-worshipping pedophiles who dominate Hollywood, big business, the media and government. The rest are various anti-government militias. All have been largely banned from Facebook since 2020.But despite what Avaaz called “clear violations" of Facebook’s policies, it found that 119 of these pages and groups were still active on the platform as of March 18 and had just under 27 million followers.Facebook acknowledged that its policy enforcement “isn't perfect,” but said the report distorts its work against violent extremism and misinformation.The company said in a statement that it has done more than any other internet company to stanch the flow of harmful material, citing its bans of “nearly 900 militarized social movements” and the removal of tens of thousands of QAnon pages, groups, and accounts. It added that it is always improving its efforts against misinformation.On Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are slated to testify before Congress about extremism and misinformation on their platforms.Facebook has tightened its rules against violence, hate and misinformation in the past year. In October, it banned QAnon groups across its platform. Before that, it would remove them only if they expressly supported violence. It has also banned extremist and militia movements and boogaloo groups with varying degrees of success.For instance, while Facebook banned “Stop the Steal" groups from its platform, Avaaz — like The Associated Press — found that such groups and the #stopthesteal hashtag remained active on the platform after the purge.Facebook's failures, Avaaz said, “helped sweep America down the path from election to insurrection."According to the report, the social network provided a “fertile ground" for misinformation and toxicity that contributed to radicalizing millions of Americans, helping create the conditions in which the storming of the Capitol became a reality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremist-groups-thrive-on-facebook-despite-bans-report-101616494147323.html
23-03-2021||World||Saudis seek US help to thwart rising attacks on oil sites||Saudi Arabia is seeking more help from the US to defend its oil facilities, underscoring the kingdom’s concern about recent missile and drone strikes that it’s linked to arch-rival Iran.The requests were put to President Joe Biden’s administration since January, according to a Saudi official, who asked not to be named as the matter is private. Saudi Arabia is also asking other allies for support to thwart almost-daily attacks on cities and towns, the official said.On Sunday, the Saudi navy began drills in the Persian Gulf to enhance the security of “vital installations” and oil fields, and secure freedom of navigation in the region’s waters, the official Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, will take part, according to SPA.The military exercises follow three attacks on Aramco sites this month alone. On Friday, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran, said they were responsible for drones and missiles that targeted a 120,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. They also claimed strikes on the world’s biggest oil-export terminal of Ras Tanura and on a fuel depot in Jeddah.InterceptedSaudi officials said their air-defense systems and fighter jets intercepted the projectiles used in all the attacks, preventing them from causing substantial damage. Amin Nasser, Aramco’s chief executive officer, said the incidents haven’t impacted the company and that it will continue to supply petroleum to customers around the world “under any scenario.”Still, oil analysts have said the risk of a major crisis in the Gulf is rising.“We are one incident away from a major conflagration,” said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “If one of these drone or ballistic-missile attacks results in significant civilian casualties, it could potentially lead to a more direct confrontation between the Saudis and the Iranians.”A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting a grinding war against the Houthis since 2015 in an effort to restore Yemen’s United Nations-recognized government. The conflict’s created what the UN has called the world’s worst humanitarian disaster and pushed the Yemeni population to the brink of famine.Peace EffortsSince coming to power, Biden has rescinded a decision by his predecessor, Donald Trump, to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization, and stepped up efforts to secure a ceasefire. He’s also halted the sale of offensive weapons to the coalition, though his administration’s pledged to continue providing Saudi Arabia with equipment to defend its territory.Saudi Arabia has welcomed the prospect of peace talks, despite the increase in Houthi attacks that analysts and diplomats say are intended to increase the group’s leverage. The danger, they say, is that a successful strike on Saudi oil installations could force the kingdom into an escalation it doesn’t want.Coalition planes pounded Houthi bases over the weekend in retaliation for the refinery attack.The Saudi government on Monday proposed a series of steps to end the war in Yemen, though the Houthis appeared to reject the plan.Riyadh says the missiles and drones used to target its infrastructure are Iranian manufactured or supplied, a view shared by the UN. That’s led to claims that Iran is using the Houthis to pressure the U.S. as the two nations tussle over how to revive nuclear diplomacy and remove American sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Abqaiq AttacksThe most prominent attack claimed by the Houthis came in September 2019, when explosive-laden drones swarmed Aramco’s Abqaiq oil-processing plant and Khurais field. They temporarily knocked out about half of Saudi Arabia’s production capacity and caused crude prices to spike.Oil markets have taken comfort from the recent attacks not being anywhere near as damaging, according to Bob McNally, president of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. Moreover, unlike in 2019, there’s plenty of spare capacity around the world due to deep supply cuts that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia started last year.While Brent crude prices have risen 24% this year to around $64 a barrel, they have dropped this month, mostly due to concerns about a third coronavirus wave.Still, “the increase in the frequency of airborne attacks and the focus on energy infrastructure will mean some risk premium remains in oil prices,” said Bill Farren-Price, a director at research firm Enverus. “The situation demands a diplomatic push to reduce tensions.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-seek-us-help-to-thwart-rising-attacks-on-oil-sites-101616475595627.html

23-03-2021||World||Yellen, Powell to face deficit, inflation fears at US Congress||Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will enter a heatedly partisan arena on Tuesday to kick off two days of congressional hearings assessing the economic policy response to the Covid-19 crisis.Less than two weeks after President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill that failed to win a single Republican vote in Congress, the hearings will feature lawmakers positioning over the impact of the package and plans for the next one. Biden’s advisers are preparing a long-term program that could be as much as $3 trillion, though no decisions have been made, people familiar with the talks said Monday.Yellen is expected not only to highlight the improved economic outlook and dramatic expansion in help to households from the bill, but also telegraph the need for more spending -- partly paid for with higher taxes. The administration is now working on a longer-term support program for the economy, and Democrats may use the hearings to advocate inclusion for their preferred measures.GOP members will assail the Democrats for piling on debt for a far-left agenda at a time when an economic rebound was already under way -- risking a spike in inflation. Powell, meantime, will be looking to stay out of the political crossfire, while repeating his pledge to hold off on tightening monetary policy until deep into the recovery.“I suspect there will be lots of questions on the sustainability of deficits and the debt -- and ‘aren’t the deficits and debt big problems that will come back to haunt the United States?’” said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Group AG.Yellen’s already made her answer clear, repeatedly saying over the past two months that the U.S. can afford to borrow more with interest rates historically low. Expect her to point out that despite much higher debt, the cost to service those obligations is the same is it was in 2007.Powell’s take has been to set aside addressing debt sustainability for now. He said last month that “the time to prioritize those concerns is when we’re close to full employment, when the taxes are rolling in and we can do it without so much pain.”The duo testify before the House Financial Services Committee at noon Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. Wednesday. The appearances are required by the March 2020 Cares Act, which gave the Treasury and Fed hundreds of billions of dollars of firepower to fight the crisis.Questions from lawmakers could range widely. The following are some of the items to expect.Economy Bouncing BackYellen and Powell will repeat their assessments that the U.S. is bouncing back nicely from a devastating shock, thanks to fiscal and monetary policy support, but also flag that it has not fully recovered.“While we’re seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we’re digging out of: The country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak,” Yellen said in her opening remarks, which were released Monday evening.New Fed projections point to 6.5% GDP growth this year, with unemployment seen falling to 4.5% by year’s end. Still, more than 9 million Americans remain out of work and the Covid-19 virus has not yet been contained.Yellen also gave credit to lawmakers for passing the third massive stimulus bill in a year. “I am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact,” she said in the prepared remarks.Aid Disbursement UpdateYellen may be asked for fresh numbers on how much money has been delivered so far under Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Last week, the Treasury reported it had disbursed $242 billion of the $442 billion it expects to send to individuals under the law. Lawmakers will also be keen to hear when aid for state, local, territorial and tribal governments will be released.State Tax CutsYellen may also get pressed by Republicans over whether new relief will limit the ability of state governments to cut taxes. The law doesn’t explicitly bar states from cutting taxes but does prohibit them from using federal aid to offset tax cuts.Asked during a phone briefing Thursday how the Treasury will enforce the law if states shift money within their budgets, department officials said the agency is in the process of crafting rules that will explain how the restrictions work.Inflation Fear and MarketsBoth Yellen and Powell may be asked about inflation fears, with critics saying that ultra stimulative fiscal and monetary policy settings run the risk of a surge in consumer prices. The sharp selloff in longer-dated Treasuries this quarter has only amplified those concerns.Related: Treasuries Bull Market That Began in 1981 Has Finally EndedEach key policy maker has predicted that a jump in prices, especially compared with depressed levels a year ago, will prove temporary. Last week, Powell said he expected a “pop” in inflation measures beginning this month, but said it would be a “one-time sort of bulge in prices.”Interest RatesDemocrats will also be happy to hear Powell repeat the Fed’s commitment to ultra-easy monetary policy. Watch for the Fed chief to repeat that the central bank won’t act on forecasts of inflation, but only on hard data points showing that the economy is back to full employment and there’s sustained achievement of the 2% target for price gains.“The recovery is far from complete, so, at the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes,” Powell said in testimony prepared for delivery Tuesday.Build Back BetterThe Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers are moving forward on a long-term economic package that could total up to $3 trillion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, though they cautioned that no decision had been made. The program will feature a range of initiatives from infrastructure and combating climate change to increasing subsidies for child and elder care, strengthening workers’ rights and expanding Obamacare.Democratic lawmakers may ask for each policy makers’ thoughts on their favored measures for inclusion. Powell almost certainly will seek to avoid comment, as he did in hearings last month -- a contrast to his repeated calls last year for more fiscal support to fight the impact of the pandemic.“You’ve seen him pivot already,” said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. “Last year he was pleading with them” for more spending. “This year he’s saying, ‘I can’t say anything.’”Financial RegulationThe Biden administration has signaled interest in tightening scrutiny of big banks. Separate discussions are already underway at the Treasury about reforming the structure of the market for U.S. Treasuries in order to make it more resilient -- after the episode in March 2020 when trading nearly seized up amid an investor flight to cash, forcing the Fed to inject massive liquidity.“There’ll be a huge conversation about banks and bank regulation,” predicted Carpenter at UBS. “And lawmakers will ask, ‘Is there something broken in markets and why do you have to keep swooping in to save them?’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yellen-powell-to-face-deficit-inflation-fears-at-us-congress-101616463916190.html
23-03-2021||World||US climate envoy Kerry to take part in summit co-hosted by China||The Biden administration is set to participate in a climate summit co-hosted by China on Tuesday, just days after its first face-to-face talks with that country descended into bickering.John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate, is to participate in the Ministerial on Climate Action, according to two people familiar with the matter. Yet no separate virtual session is planned between Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, the people said.The virtual ministerial session, organized by the European Union, Canada and China, is intended to bring together representatives of more than 30 countries, including some of the world’s top emitters of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.In a joint statement earlier this month, the U.S. and European Union highlighted the ministerial meeting as one of several “key milestones for increasing momentum” and encouraging more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions-cutting goals before a United Nations climate summit in Glasgow this November.The U.S. also is holding its own virtual meeting with top-emitting countries on April 22.Despite a fraught U.S.-China relationship, Kerry has emphasized the U.S. can “find a way to compartmentalize” its global warming discussions with China, which is the world’s top emitter, responsible for almost 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns about other matters , such as protecting intellectual property, are “obviously significant issues,” Kerry said on March 2 at CERAWeek by IHS Markit, “but the climate crisis is not something that can fall victim to those other concerns and contests.”Kerry, a former secretary of State and U.S. senator, has been in touch with Xie since they were both appointed, and further conversations between the two are expected, according to one of the people familiar with the interactions.Tuesday’s meeting comes as the U.S. seeks to rebuild trust after the country’s departure from the Paris climate agreement under President Donald Trump. Since the U.S. formally rejoined the pact in February, Kerry has been meeting with climate negotiators globally to underscore the country’s commitment to the accord.Kerry, who helped broker the landmark agreement when he led the State Department under President Barack Obama, pressed climate concerns in meetings with top European Commission officials earlier this month. A renewed alliance between the U.S. and the E.U. on climate issues could shift the dynamics of crucial global talks, encouraging China and other major polluters to step up their efforts to reduce emissions, Kerry said at the time.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-climate-envoy-kerry-to-take-part-in-summit-co-hosted-by-china-101616470064563.html

23-03-2021||World||'Psychopathic leader': Brazil governor says Bolsonaro mishandled Covid-19 crisis||The governor of Brazil's Sao Paulo state on Monday, in an interview to the CNN news network, called the country's president Jair Bolsonaro a "psychopathic leader" who mishandled the Covid-19 crisis.Responding to a question on the healthcare system in the state, Joao Doria said that much of Brazil's pandemic death toll could have been prevented had Bolsonaro "acted with the responsibility that his position gives him."Brazil has recorded the second-most coronavirus deaths, after the United States, and the situation is worsening. Brazil's average daily death toll -- currently the highest worldwide -- has more than tripled since the start of the year, to 2,259. Brazilian media reports Bolsonaro is scrambling to find a way to deal with the surging Covid-19 cases, with the government sacking a health minister last week without naming a replacement in the official gazette.The latest wave of Covid-19, fueled by a local, more contagious variant of the coronavirus, is pushing many Brazilian hospitals to the breaking point, news agency AFP reports."We are in one of those tragic moments in history when millions of people pay a high price for having an unprepared and psychopathic leader in charge of a nation," said Joao Doria, the governor of Sao Paulo, where educational institutes and commercial establishments have remained shut since early this month. One of Bolsonaro's fiercest critics, Doria also criticised the messy situation over allotment of the country's health ministry amid an unprecedented health crisis. "We're in the middle of a pandemic... and we have two health ministers. Which in reality means we don't have any," Joao said. Sao Paulo's state government has said it had obtained guarantees from oxygen suppliers that they will be able to keep up supply for public hospitals, and announced that brewer AmBev will also produce the gas at one of its plants in the state.Hundreds of Brazilian business leaders and economists have already called for a new policy approach as the country grapples with spiking Covid-19 deaths and overwhelmed hospitals. Rio de Janeiro, where more than 90 per cent of intensive care beds are full, announced last week that only essential shops will be allowed to open and an overnight curfew would be imposed for ten days, while beaches will remain closed. Reuters reports that a letter, published in newspapers on Monday and signed by former central bank chiefs and some of Brazil's richest bankers, underscored a growing revolt by business leaders against the Brazillian president whom many had backed for his 2018 election. The message from such prominent economists and bankers cut at Bolsonaro's core political argument that he has defended jobs by opposing lockdowns, which the letter called a "false choice between saving lives and ensuring support for the vulnerable."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/psychopathic-leader-brazil-governor-says-bolsonaro-mishandled-covid-19-crisis-101616489059603.html
23-03-2021||World||Coal markets roiled as Australia’s flood crisis worsens||The deluge that’s inundating Australia’s eastern states is hampering shipments from the world’s biggest coal export terminal.Heavy rainfall and damaging winds are expected to continue on Tuesday, including in the key coal regions of the Hunter Valley and the Port of Newcastle. That is likely to see prices of the power-station fuel extend Monday’s climb to a two-year high, as coal in Europe also gained on the news.Overnight there were 870 rescue operations in New South Wales state, as dams overflowed and catchments flooded. A further 15,000 people may be evacuated today, after 18,000 people were forced to leave their homes on Monday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters earlier today.The one-in-100 year flooding event forced companies from Glencore Plc to Yancoal Australia Ltd. to cut production, while Whitehaven Coal Ltd. said there is a backlog of ships at the Port of Newcastle.“This type of temporary weather event does not typically have any lasting impact,” the Port of Newcastle said in a statement. “The port continues to operate and is monitoring conditions closely.”The rain is forecast to ease on Wednesday, but Berejiklian warned “the rivers will keep rising.”“Shutdowns and disruptions to coal mining operations and exports will impact 1Q gross domestic product. Yet, the flood damage is unlikely to have a significant impact on other economic variables. In many cases, the economic costs of natural disasters are canceled out by subsequent reconstruction and recovery activity.”The drenching comes as some parts of Australia are still recovering from the catastrophic bushfires of last summer that razed an area the size of the U.K., wiping out communities and billions of animals. While The fires were linked to climate change, it isn’t clear yet whether the floods have a similar causation.“Little is known about how the frequency of weather events like this one will change with global warming,” said Todd Lane, a professor at the University of Melbourne’s School of Earth Sciences. “In a warmer world the atmosphere can hold more moisture, so as the climate continues to warm events like this have the potential to produce more rain when they occur.”Southern areas of neighboring Queensland state are also on flood watch. Disruptions to freight and logistics services are impacting fresh produce supplies and have also hampered Australia’s rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine.The floods are also impacting on the agricultural sector, with the dairy industry reporting lost animals, power outages and stalled transport that could affect milk deliveries.The Bureau of Meteorology said around 10 million Australians in every mainland state and territory except Western Australia were currently subject to a weather warning, covering “an area similar to the size of Alaska.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coal-markets-roiled-as-australia-s-flood-crisis-worsens-101616463889193.html

"The United States wants to rebuild our partnerships, first and foremost with our NATO allies, we want to revitalise the alliance."After four years of friction with Washington under the presidency of Donald Trump, who said the alliance was obsolete, NATO's European allies have also welcomed the change in tone under new US President Joe Biden.Stoltenberg has set out areas where NATO could modernise over the medium term - from climate measures to more sustainable funding of military operations - and needs US support,Asked about any possible withdrawal from Afghanistan, Blinken said a US review of options was still underway and he would listen and consult with allies. NATO foreign ministers will discuss Afghanistan over the next two days in Brussels."We went in together, we have adjusted together and when the time is right, we will leave together," Blinken said of Western involvement in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-brussels-blinken-offers-boost-for-nato-cooperation-on-afghanistan-101616490405564.html

Speaking on his first visit to NATO, Blinken said he was due to meet his German counterpart, Heiko Maas, to discuss the issue."President (Joe) Biden has been very clear, he believes the pipeline is a bad idea, bad for Europe, bad for the United States, ultimately it is in contradiction to the EU's own security goals," Blinken said as he met NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg."It has the potential to undermine the interests of Ukraine, Poland and a number of close partners and allies," Blinken said, saying that a US law required Washington to impose sanctions on companies participating in the Nord Stream 2 project.Nord Stream 2 will bypass Ukraine, a Western ally, potentially depriving it of valuable transit fees. It will also increase European energy dependency on Russia and compete with shipments of US liquefied natural gas.The pipeline is already around 95% built, and could be finished by September, analysts who monitor tracking data say.The United States fears Russia could use Nord Stream 2 as leverage to weaken EU states by increasing dependency on Moscow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-nato-united-states-warns-germany-over-nord-stream-2-pipeline-101616490097560.html
23-03-2021||World||We want friendly relations with all countries, including India: Pak diplomat||Pakistan desires friendly relations with all countries, including India, and the two sides should resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue, the senior-most Pakistani diplomat in New Delhi said on Tuesday. Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires Aftab Hasan Khan made the remarks while addressing an event organised to mark Pakistan Day. The comments came against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral relations after the armies of the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) last month. “Pakistan wants to have friendly relations with all countries including India,” Khan said, according to a statement issued by the Pakistan high commission. “To achieve peace between Pakistan and India, both countries shall resolve all outstanding issues including [Jammu and Kashmir] through dialogue,” he said. Peace within South Asia is “inevitable” for the larger interest of the region, he added. Also Read | Pakistan delegation on Indus water in India to hold talksKhan spoke after raising the Pakistani flag at the brief ceremony with limited participation that was organised in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Messages from the president and prime minister of Pakistan were also read out at the ceremony. Noting that Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah had made a resolve to create a separate homeland on March 23, 1940, Khan said the day is observed as Pakistan Day every year. He stressed the importance of each generation making its own contribution to realise Jinnah’s vision. The Indian and Pakistani high commissions in Islamabad and New Delhi are currently headed by the deputy chiefs of mission as Pakistan decided not to post an envoy in the Indian capital after Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was scrapped in August 2019. Pakistan also expelled the Indian envoy and downgraded diplomatic ties.

Last week, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa said the time has come for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, though he cautioned that any peace process would be susceptible to disruption without the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Bajwa’s conciliatory remarks came a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations. The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are expected to participate in the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on March 30.

The provincial total has risen to 200,969 and the death toll is 6,039."Punjab government has issued new SOPs for public places, bazaars and other activities that involved gatherings," she said while speaking to a private news channel.She said the Punjab government has done satisfactory arrangements to deal with the third wave of Coronavirus, adding, the district administration had started a crackdown on violations of SOPs (standard operating procedures).Dr Yasmin Rashid also said that Lahore was becoming the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, as 1,824 new cases have been reported.Pakistan has reported 633,741 cases so far. 13,935 people have succumbed to the infection in the country.Last week, Pakistan imposed a complete ban on travel from 12 countries, including South Africa, Rwanda and Tanzania, in a bid to curb the spike of coronavirus cases.Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-micro-smart-lockdown-imposed-in-cities-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101616488455154.html
23-03-2021||World||Myanmar junta blames protesters for violence as EU, US impose sanctions||Myanmar's military accused anti-junta protesters of arson and violence as Western countries imposed more sanctions on individuals and groups linked to last month's coup and an ensuing brutal crackdown on dissent.Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said 164 protesters had been killed in the violence and expressed sadness at the deaths."They are also our citizens," he told a news conference in the capital Naypyitaw on Tuesday.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group says at least 261 people have been killed in the harsh crackdown by security forces.Three people were killed in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay in unrest on Monday, including a teenage boy, witnesses and news reports said.Security forces staged more raids in parts of Yangon on Monday night with shots fired and some people wounded, the Mizzima news service reported.The junta has tried to justify the coup by saying a Nov. 8 election won by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was fraudulent - an accusation the electoral commission rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency.Zaw Min Tun blamed protesters for violence and arson and said nine members of the security forces had been killed."Can we call these peaceful protesters?" he said, while showing a video of factories on fire. "Which country or organisation would regard this violence as peaceful?"He said strikes and hospitals not fully operating had caused deaths, including from Covid-19, calling them "undutiful and unethical".The spokesman also accused media of "fake news" and fanning unrest and said reporters could be prosecuted if they were in contact with the CRPH, as the remnants of Suu Kyi's government is known locally. The military has declared the CRPH an illegal organisation.He gave granular details or how the NLD had created hundreds or even thousands of extra ballots in numerous townships by inventing voters, including in Suu Kyi's own constituency. Videos of people saying they were paid by NLD representatives were shown at the news conference.Also shown was video testimony of former Yangon chief minister Phyo Min Thein saying he visited Suu Kyi multiple times and gave her money "whenever needed".Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, is being held in detention. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.Overnight helpThere were also more examples of demonstrations overnight staged without people in a bid to avoid becoming targeted by security forces trying to stamp out organised rallies.In Hsipaw in Shan State the names of dead protesters written on cards were laid out next to candles with a sign reading "We spirits don’t want the junta", DVB TV News reported.Elsewhere, helium-filled balloons were released on Monday bearing messages calling for international help. Street protesters were replaced by toy cars or dolls, some led by cardboard cutouts or manikins dressed in outfits.The European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Monday against individuals involved in the coup and the repression of the demonstrators.The EU sanctions were the bloc's most significant response since the overthrow of Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1.The 11 people it targeted included General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar military and head of the junta that has taken power.The EU already has an arms embargo on Myanmar and has targeted some senior military officials since 2018.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters before the meeting that the military repression "has reached an unbearable extent".Stronger measures are expected soon as the bloc moves to take aim at businesses run by the military, EU diplomats said.Washington had already sanctioned Min Aung Hlaing and the measures announced on Monday expanded the list.The US action targeted senior policeman Than Hlaing and military officer Aung Soe, as well as two Burmese Army divisions, the 33rd Light Infantry and 77th Light Infantry.US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said members of the 33rd Division had fired live rounds into a crowd in Mandalay. Both units were part of the security forces' "planned systemic strategies to ramp up the use of lethal force", he said.There was no immediate response from the junta, which has shown no sign so far of being swayed by international condemnation of its actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-blames-protesters-for-violence-as-eu-us-impose-sanctions-101616489009342.html

The government has launched an investigation into fellow staffers who allegedly swapped images and videos filmed at the Parliament House.Morrison, who has faced criticism of his handling of rape allegations against a former staffer and the historical rape allegation denied by Attorney-General Christian Porter, said he was "shocked" and "disgusted" by the reports."I am shocked and I am disgusted. It is shameful. It is just absolutely shameful," he told reporters in the press conference while fighting back tears."We must get this house in order. We must put the politics aside of these things and we must recognize this problem, acknowledge it, and we must fix it."These events have triggered, right across this building, and indeed right across the country, women who have put up with this rubbish and this crap for their entire lives, as their mothers did, as their grandmothers did."Morrison said he was "open" to a discussion about quotas for female representation in the Liberal Party after Industry Minister Karen Andrews said it was time for "serious considerations."At the press conference, when asked about whether he had lost control of the ministerial staff, Morrison said that "no one individual" can be overwatch on every single inch of this place every second of the day."What I am held accountable is what I do now and that is what I am outlining to you today. So you are free to make your criticisms and to stand on that pedestal but be careful," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-promises-to-improve-treatment-of-women-in-politics-101616488997169.html

China earlier said that its vessels near Whitsun Reef were sheltering from the wind.“We stand with the Philippines, our oldest treaty ally in Asia,” the US Embassy said. Manila has filed a diplomatic protest with China, and called for the Chinese vessels to immediately leave what it considers part of its exclusive economic zone.The incident comes amid continued tensions between the US and China, and as the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte builds friendly ties with Beijing while maintaining its alliance with Washington.Duterte will discuss the incident with China’s envoy to Manila, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Tuesday, while repeating that the two nations can talk things out as friends. More than 180 vessels were still near the reef, the Philippine military said after patrolling the area on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rips-china-s-maritime-militia-backs-philippines-in-spat-101616488263902.html
23-03-2021||World||Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un share messages reaffirming China-N Korea alliance||The leaders of China and North Korea are reaffirming their traditional alliance following contentious talks between top diplomats from Washington and Beijing and diplomatic isolation and economic problems in the North that have left it ever-more dependent on the Chinese.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger “unity and cooperation” with China in the face of challenges posed by “hostile forces” while exchanging messages with Chinese President Xi Jinping.According to KCNA and China’s Xinhua news agency, Xi in his own message to Kim described bilateral relations as a “valuable asset” to both countries and vowed to make unspecified contributions to the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.KCNA said Xi also expressed a commitment to “provide the peoples of the two countries with better life.” Some analysts saw this as an indication that China would soon provide North Korea with badly needed food, fertilizer and other aid that had been significantly reduced amid the pandemic border closures.Xinhua said the leaders’ messages were exchanged during a meeting between Chinese senior diplomat Song Tao and North Korean Ambassador to China Ri Ryong Nam during a meeting in Beijing on Monday.The exchange between the leaders came as the Biden administration steps up diplomatic efforts to strengthen cooperation with Asian allies South Korea and Japan to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat and China’s growing regional influence.Top U.S. and Chinese officials traded sharp and unusually public barbs in Alaska last week in their first face-to-face meetings since President Joe Biden took office, where Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington is united with its allies in pushing back against Chinese authoritarianism.The contentious talks in Anchorage came after Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to Japan and South Korea for talks that mainly focused on North Korea and China.During his visit to Seoul, Blinken sternly criticized North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and human rights record and pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince the North to denuclearize.The North has so far ignored Biden’s administration’s efforts to reach out, saying it won’t engage in meaningful talks with the United States unless Washington abandons what Pyongyang sees as “hostile” policies, which clearly refers to the U.S.-led sanctions and pressure over its nuclear program.KCNA said Kim addressed the state of the North’s relations with the United States and South Korea and said communication between him and Xi was required in the face of changed “external situations and reality,” apparently referring to the new U.S. administration.Kim’s message “stressed the need to strengthen the unity and cooperation between the two parties and two countries to cope with the hostile forces’ all-round challenges and obstructive moves,” KCNA said.Kim’s message to Xi was clearly in response to last week’s visits by Blinken and Lloyd to Japan and South Korea, which signaled the start of the Biden administration’s efforts to create a coordinated approach with its allies on North Korea, said Cheong Seong-Chang, director of North Korea studies at South Korea’s private Sejong Institute.Cheong said it was notable that Xi did not publicly express his support for Kim’s stated plans to expand the North’s nuclear capabilities and instead stressed regional stability.This shows that China prefers diplomacy over a revival of tensions in the Korean Peninsula, and despite its friction with the United States, could still endorse a resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang, he said.China had advocated a “two-track approach” to the issue, whereby the U.S. would offer security guarantees to North Korea in exchange for Pyongyang abandoning its nuclear weapons programs.The meetings in Anchorage reflected increasingly troubled relations between the United States and China, which are at odds over a range of issues from trade to human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong and China’s western Xinjiang region, as well as over Taiwan, China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic.Responding to Blinken’s criticism about his government, Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi said Beijing had no intention to back down on any issue and that the United States should stop pushing its own version of democracy at a time when America itself has been roiled by domestic discontent.As North Korea pursued diplomacy with the U.S. starting in 2018, it also worked to strengthen relations with China, its traditional ally and economic lifeline. But Kim has nothing to show for his ambitious summits with then-President Trump, which collapsed in 2019 over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s disarmament steps.The North’s economic woes have been compounded by pandemic border closures and devastating natural disasters that wiped out crops last summer. At a ruling party congress in January, Kim vowed to further expand the North’s nuclear program and urged his people to be resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance.South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers late last year that North Korea’s trade volume with China fell by 75% during the first 10 months of 2020. That led to a shortage of raw materials that plunged the North’s factory operations to its lowest level since Kim took power in late 2011, and a jump in the prices of imported foods like sugar and seasonings.Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was to arrive in South Korea later on Tuesday for talks on North Korea and other regional issues. Public spats between Washington and Moscow erupted this week after Biden during an ABC interview characterized Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “killer” and said Putin will “pay a price” for his efforts to undermine the 2020 U.S. election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-kim-jong-un-share-messages-reaffirming-china-n-korea-alliance-101616488406647.html
23-03-2021||World||Pakistan reaches out to China to ensure supply of Covid-19 vaccine||Pakistan on Tuesday reached out to its all-weather ally China for ensuring the supply of the coronavirus vaccine, as the country is grappling to contain the third wave of the pandemic that has also hit Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi held a telephone conversation with his Chinese counterpart and State Councilor Wang Yi, underscoring that Pakistan had devised an elaborate plan of vaccination across the country as part of its efforts to combat the pandemic, according to the Foreign Office (FO).“To reinforce Pakistan’s capacity to effectively and expeditiously fight the pandemic, Foreign Minister Qureshi discussed with his Chinese counterpart the supply of Covid-19 vaccine from China to Pakistan during March-April 2021,” the FO said.Foreign Minister Wang reassured that China will continue to firmly support Pakistan in its fight against the pandemic and accord highest priority to the requirements of its time-tested friend, according to FO.Qureshi also expressed gratitude to China for earlier gifting Pakistan 1.5 million doses of the Chinese vaccine, underlining that it had played a pivotal role in protecting precious human lives.China on Wednesday gifted another 500,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccine to Pakistan, the Dawn reported.He thanked Prime Minister Li Keqiang’s message wishing Prime Minister Imran Khan speedy recovery from Covid-19. Wang also wished swift recovery to Pakistan premier Khan.Khan, 68, and his wife Bushra Bibi, 47, tested positive on Saturday for the Covid-19, two days after he got the first shot of a vaccine.Both the Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen Pakistan-China “All-Weather Strategic Co-operative Partnership”. The two sides also agreed to maintain high-level exchanges.The exchange came as Pakistan recorded another 3,270 new cases in the last 24 hours, taking the national tally of infections to 633,741, according to the ministry of National Health Services.Seventy two people died during the period, with the total number of COVID-19 deaths jumping to 13,935 in the country. A total of 2,485 are in a critical condition.Pakistan on Monday announced new stringent measures, including restrictions on commercial activities to control the spread of the virus.In Pakistan, Covid-19 vaccination is so far being carried out through the Adult Vaccination Counters (AVCs). However, the government’s response to procure vaccines remained very slow and it is largely eyeing donations to vaccinate the increasingly vulnerable population.Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, last month allowed private firms to import coronavirus vaccines and agreed to exempt them from price caps.The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) last week notified the procedure for determining the maximum retail prices of imported Covid-19 vaccines in the country.Official sources said that the maximum sale price of Sputnik V Russian vaccine will be fixed at ₹8,449 for two doses and China’s Convidecia at ₹4,225 per injection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-reaches-out-to-china-to-ensure-supply-of-covid-19-vaccine-101616487990401.html

23-03-2021||World||Bitcoin dubbed ‘far too costly’ in Norway as cashlessness rules||Norway recently emerged as the world’s most cashless society, but its central bank governor says people shouldn’t start turning to Bitcoin as an alternative.Oystein Olsen, the governor of Norges Bank in Oslo, says it’s inconceivable that Bitcoin -- the most popular cryptocurrency -- will replace the money that’s currently controlled by central banks.Bitcoin is “far too resource-intensive, far too costly and most importantly, it doesn’t preserve stability,” Olsen said in a phone interview. “I mean, the basic property and task for a central bank and central-bank currency is to provide stability in the value of money and in the system, and that is not done by Bitcoin.”Olsen’s dismissal of Bitcoin comes not long after one of Norway’s most prominent businessmen, Kjell Inge Rokke, endorsed the cryptocurrency, arguing it will ultimately be on the right side of monetary history. He even suggested a single Bitcoin might one day “be worth millions of dollars.”On Monday, one Bitcoin traded at around $57,000, almost 900% up from its value roughly a year ago. Elon Musk is a fan, as is Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management. Matt McDermott, global head of digital assets for Goldman Sachs Global Markets Division, recently said there’s now “huge” institutional demand across different industry types and from private banking clients for Bitcoin.Meanwhile, central banks are racing to respond to widespread cashlessness by developing their own digital currencies before cryptocurrencies take over. Norges Bank Deputy Governor Ida Wolden Bache said last November that Norway has become the world’s most cashless country, with only 4% of all payments conducted with bank notes and coins. That’s raised questions about how payments should be conducted in the future.But Norway isn’t one of the front-runners when it comes to developing central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Instead, Sweden and China are the world leaders among major economies, as policy makers team up with technology experts to figure out how best to design something that central banks can control.Norges Bank is due to publish a report on its CBDC project in April. Wolden Bache said earlier this month the goal is that users “must be able to pay efficiently and securely in” Norwegian kroner. According to her slide presentation, a Norwegian CBDC “will not change private sector credit intermediation.”As for Bitcoin, which some central bankers have compared to the tulip bubble of the 17th century, Olsen said, “I don’t think at the end of the day it will be a threat to central banks. Although some people talk about that.”“Digital currencies more generally are the new wine, in many respects,” he said. But now, “central banks are entering the scene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-dubbed-far-too-costly-in-norway-as-cashlessness-rules-101616479492763.html

Health minister Matt Hancock said the government's original plan to review international travel in April and possibly permit it from May 17 still stood but the travel fines were included in legislation in case that would not be possible.The news sent shares in travel stocks such as easyJet , British Airway-owner, Jet2 and TUI down between 3 and 4% in early trade on Tuesday.In the UK, foreign holidays are currently banned."The earliest date by which we will allow for international travel...is the 17th May. That has not changed," Hancock told Sky News.The question of whether people can travel abroad without specific reasons such as work or education will still be addressed by the government's travel review which is due to report on April 12, said Hancock.But hopes that the government will give the green light to summer getaways from 17th May have faded in recent days due to warnings over rising Covid-19 infection levels in Europe.Europe's airlines and travel sector are now bracing for a second lost summer. Having already racked up billions in debt to survive a year of travel restrictions, they are facing further strain and some may need fresh funds.Hancock said it was too early to say what the government would decide on holidays."The reason for that is that we are seeing this third wave rising in some parts of Europe and we're also seeing new variants and it is very important that we protect the progress that we've been able to make here in the UK," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-to-introduce-fines-on-those-attempting-to-travel-abroad-before-endjune-101616487105490.html
23-03-2021||World||China stocks fall as western sanctions over Xinjiang weigh on sentiment||Chinese stocks fell on Tuesday as western sanctions against China reduced risk appetite and lingering worries over policy tightening continued to weigh on the market.The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 1%, to 5,009.25 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.9% to 3,411.51 points.The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and Beijing hit back immediately with broad punitive measures against the EU."The sanctions hurt risk appetite, in particular among foreign investors, who sold shares via the Stock Connect," said Jin Jing, an analyst with Caitong Securities."Persistent worries of policy tightening at home also continued to weigh on high flying sectors and stocks with lofty valuations as investors turned cautious," he said.China's monetary policy needs to focus on supporting economic growth in a targeted way while also reducing financial risks, the central bank head said on Saturday.Foreign investors on Tuesday sold a net 5.1 billion yuan ($783.51 million) worth of A-shares via the Stock Connect linking mainland and Hong Kong, according to Refinitiv data.Leading the declines, the CSI300 materials index and the CSI300 new energy index slumped 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively.China's blue-chip index has fallen more than 15% from an all-time high hit on Feb. 18, led by consumer, healthcare and new energy firms, as investors worry Beijing's conservative economic growth target for this year could give it more room to rein in bubbles in its financial markets.Analysts also said pressure was mounting for mutual funds to sell stocks to deal with increasing redemptions, as a correction continued in the stock market.Enthusiasm about mutual funds has decreased after the Lunar New Year holiday, while there is evident redemption pressure for funds that heavily invest in consumer and health care stocks, CITIC Securities said in a report on March 22, noting the issuance of new mutual funds remained sluggish in March.($1 = 6.5092 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-stocks-fall-as-western-sanctions-over-xinjiang-weigh-on-sentiment-101616485799181.html
23-03-2021||World||Sinovac says its vaccine is safe for children as young as 3||Sinovac said its Covid-19 vaccine is safe in children ages 3-17, based on preliminary data, and it has submitted the data to Chinese drug regulators.More than 70 million shots of Sinovac’s vaccine have been given worldwide, including in China.China has approved its use in adults but it has not yet been used in children, because their immune systems may respond differently to the vaccine.Early and mid-stage clinical trials with over 550 subjects showed the vaccine would induce an immune response, Gang Zeng, the medical director at Sinovac, said at a news conference.Two recipients developed high fevers in response to the vaccine, one a 3-year-old and the other a 6-year-old. The rest of the trial subjects experienced mild symptoms, Zeng said.“Showing that the vaccine is safe and would elicit potentially useful immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is very welcomed,” said Eng Eong Ooi, a professor at the Duke NUS Medical school in Singapore who is co-leading the development of a separate Covid-19 vaccine. However, he said the data presented publicly by the company was not enough to give a conclusive answer on the findings.Children are far less likely to be seriously ill with Covid-19, but they are still at risk and can spread the virus. And while vaccination campaigns worldwide have focused on adults, children will need to be immunized to end the pandemic.The Pfizer vaccine is cleared for use starting at age 16 and is being studied in ages 12-16. Moderna has been studying its vaccine in children aged 12 and older and last week announced a new study testing its use in children younger than 12.State-owned Sinopharm, who has two Covid-19 vaccines, is also investigating the effectiveness of its vaccines in children. The company said in January it had submitted clinical data to regulators, though it was unclear if it was for one or both vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-says-its-vaccine-is-safe-for-children-as-young-as-3-101616484419718.html
23-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca may have provided outdated vaccine data, US agency says||AstraZeneca Plc may have released outdated information about its Covid-19 vaccine trial, giving an “incomplete” view of the efficacy of the shot, said the leading US agency on infectious diseases.The Data and Safety Monitoring Board, charged with ensuring the safety and accuracy of the trial, has “expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,” said the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in a statement early Tuesday.Read more: AstraZeneca vaccine found 79% effective in US trials: Key points“We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible,” said the statement from the group headed by Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official.The disclosure comes as a setback to AstraZeneca, who earlier Monday said its vaccine was found 79% effective in preventing Covid-19 in a U.S. clinical trial of more than 30,000 volunteers.It’s preparing to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use in the US; the shot has already been cleared in the U.K. and many other nations around the world.AstraZeneca’s vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was once seen as a frontrunner to protect the world against Covid-19 but has been beset by a series of complications.Read more: Explained: Why have some countries suspended use of AstraZeneca vaccine?An error in dosing regimens during trials last year caused confusion over its efficacy, and it’s now at the center of a supply showdown with the European Union just days after concerns about blood clots prompted a dozen member states to suspend immunizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-may-have-provided-outdated-vaccine-data-us-agency-says-101616478206710.html
23-03-2021||World||Russia seeking to gain as Biden mulls over US' role in Syrian war||The Biden administration is mulling over America’s role in Syria’s ongoing conflict as the U.S. tries to break away from Middle East wars, but Vladimir Putin’s top diplomat already has been busy on the ground, trying to win support for a Syria approach that could establish Russia as a broker of security and power in the region.The new U.S. administration has yet to say how it plans to handle Syria, which is now fragmented among a half-dozen militaries — including U.S. troops — owing to a war that has killed and has displaced millions. The conflict includes al-Qaida affiliates, Islamic State forces and other jihadist groups eager to use Syria as a base.Russia and Iran have intervened to prevent the collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has wielded chemical attacks, barrel bombs and starvation to crush what had started out as a peaceful uprising. The conflict just entered its 11th year.Dealing with Syria's war will test the Biden administration's determination to focus on Asia and not the Middle East. If the United States diminishes its presence, Russia and other hostile U.S. rivals are poised to step in and boost their regional stature and resources.Hence Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's Middle East tour this month.Lavrov stood by as the foreign minister of a Gulf state generally friendly to Washington, the United Arab Emirates, delivered a message in line with Moscow's position: U.S. sanctions on Syria's Russia-supported regime were blocking international efforts to rebuild Syria. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said it is time to welcome Syria back into the fold of Arab nations.In other words, Russia's message is “the Syria war is over, Assad has won, Assad will be in power as long as he is breathing oxygen," said Frederic Hof, who served as a U.S. Syria adviser and envoy in the Obama administration.Hof said there was an unstated part of the message: Russia plans to be on hand as “Syria is built from the ashes,” benefiting from any international reconstruction resources coming in, and positioning itself as the broker to manage the security threats that Syria poses to the region.Hof and James F. Jeffrey, a career diplomat under Republican and Democratic administrations who served as President Donald Trump’s Syria envoy, argue for the United States to remain a significant presence in the country, citing Russia's ambitions.“If this is the security future of the Middle East, we’re all in trouble,” Jeffrey warns. “That’s what Putin and Lavrov are pushing.”The Biden administration is reviewing whether it should consider Syria as one of America's most important national security problems.It's shown no sign yet of doing so. Notably, where President Joe Biden has spelt out some other Middle East problems as priorities — including Yemen’s war and Iran’s nuclear program, for which Biden appointed envoys — he and his officials have said and done little publicly on Syria.In Congress, Syria is at the heart of a congressional debate over whether to reduce or end the authorities given to presidents to conduct military strikes in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.It was the Syrian war that sparked that debate when President Barack Obama first considered military strikes there, said Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Congress has sidelined itself in some of the most important decisions that a country can take.”One of Biden’s few public mentions of Syria since taking office came last week when he listed it among international problems that the U.N. Security Council should do more on.Marking the 10th anniversary of the start of the Syrian conflict last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement with European counterparts emphasized the need for humanitarian aid for Syrian civilians and accountability for the Assad regime.U.S. troops are helping protect an opposition enclave in northeast Syria, in an area that includes oil and natural gas. During Biden's campaign last year, Blinken framed the military role as a “point of leverage” in negotiations over the international handling of Syria, rather than an ongoing force.Spokespeople with the National Security Council and State Department declined to answer specific questions on Biden's Syria policy, including whether the administration sees the Syria conflict as a major national security threat or plans to appoint an envoy.Biden follows Obama and Trump in seeking to minimize the United States' military role in the Middle East and shift the focus of U.S. foreign policy to Asia, where China has been increasingly aggressive.But the Middle East's conflicts and the United States' own strategic schemes have a way of pulling Americans back. Biden last month became the sixth consecutive U.S. president to bomb a Middle East target, hitting an Iranian-allied militia in Syria that had attacked American and allied personnel in neighbouring Iraq.Some current and former U.S. diplomats for the Middle East have argued Syria is not a top security threat for the United States.Robert S. Ford, an Obama administration ambassador to Syria with years of diplomatic experience in the region, concluded in a Foreign Affairs article last year that Washington should move toward pulling its troops out of northeast Syria, arrange for Russia and others to deal with jihadist fighters, and put the United States' money toward helping the war's refugees.But Hof and Jeffrey, two others who dealt with Syria for past administrations, argue against withdrawal.“If I were an ISIS leader now trying desperately to organize an insurgency to come back” in Syria, “I would pray that that advice be taken,” Hof said. For the Islamic State group, “if you can have as your enemies the (Syrian) regime, the Iranians and the Russians, it doesn’t get any better than that.”A test of Biden administration intentions is looming, as Russia seeks to use its U.N. Security Council position to shut down a humanitarian aid route into part of Syria not under the control of the Russia-supported Syrian government, notes Mona Yacoubian, senior Syria adviser for the U.S. Institute for Peace think tank.Maintaining or bolstering the U.S. footprint in Syria will be important, Yacoubian said — not just as leverage in political negotiations, but also to shape the rules of the game for Russia's presence in the Middle East. And other immediate goals for the international community remain: making life “more manageable and less miserable for Syrians,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeking-to-gain-as-biden-mulls-over-us-role-in-syrian-war-101616482849138.html
23-03-2021||World||War of sanctions breaks out between China and EU over Xinjiang||China has hit back at the European Union with a broad set of retaliatory measures after Brussels united with the US, Britain and Canada to sanction Chinese officials on Monday for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, a northwestern province home to the Muslim Uighur community.It was the first coordinated western action against Beijing under new US President Joe Biden, and the first time in decades that the EU issued significant measures against China.The EU imposed sanctions on Monday on four Chinese officials, including a top security director, for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, with Britain and Canada following suit.Beijing’s response against the coordinated western move was quick.China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it had summoned the EU’s ambassador, Nicolas Chapuis, to make a “solemn protest” against sanctions the bloc imposed on Chinese officials in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).In a statement, the ministry said vice foreign minister Qin Gang told Chapuis that the EU should recognise the seriousness of its error and correct it to prevent further damage to ties with China.On Monday night, Beijing sanctioned 10 individuals, including EU lawmakers and four entities, for harming “China’s sovereignty and interests and maliciously spread lies and disinformation”.“It (the EU) must stop lecturing others on human rights and interfering in their internal affairs. It must end the hypocritical practice of double standards and stop going further down the wrong path. Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions,” the Chinese statement added.German politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European parliament’s delegation to China, was among the most high-profile figures to be hit.The targets of Chinese sanctions included the non-profit Alliance of Democracies Foundation, founded by former Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen.Also on the list was Adrian Zenz, a German scholar whose research has been cited by both diplomats and journalists when highlighting alleged abuses in Xinjiang.“The so-called sanctions based on lies are not acceptable,” Wang Yi, foreign minister and state councillor, said separately during a joint briefing with visiting Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.Human rights activists and the UN say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.Reports have levelled widespread allegations of sexual abuse, sterilisation and forced labour in the camps.China has denied all the accusations and has insisted the camps provide vocational training, which generates employment and is needed to fight religious extremism.“Xinjiang issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion at all, but about combating violence, terrorism and separatism. The series of measures Xinjiang has taken are not only in accordance with China’s laws but are also concrete steps and manifestations of China’s implementation of the international counterterrorism and de-radicalisation initiatives,” the Chinese foreign ministry had said earlier.Beijing has also said the inmates have been released from the camps.Access to the Xinjiang camps is strictly restricted, making it impossible to independently verify whether all the camps have closed.Western governments have brushed aside Beijing’s defence, calling it propaganda.“Amid growing international condemnation, (China) continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in statement ahead of meetings with EU and Nato ministers in Brussels this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/war-of-sanctions-breaks-out-between-china-and-eu-over-xinjiang-101616482374175.html

The two have not imposed sanctions themselves.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the multi-national measures were part of “intensive diplomacy” by the U.K., the United States, Canada and the 27-nation EU to force action amid mounting evidence of serious rights abuses against the Uyghur people.The sanctions will be imposed immediately and include travel bans and asset freezes against four officials, Raab said.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement the united response "sends a strong signal to those who violate or abuse international human rights, and we will take further actions in coordination with likeminded partners."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-new-zealand-welcome-sanctions-against-chinese-over-uighur-abuses-101616478742807.html

JICA already agreed to finance the first 1.2 gigawatt phase of the project that is scheduled for completion in 2024, but hasn’t decided if it will finance the expansion, which would double the facility’s capacity.“In spite of difficulties, my government decided to do a survey and research on unit 3 and 4,” Naoki Ito, the Japanese ambassador to Bangladesh, said Thursday during a webinar hosted by the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh, referring to the expansion. Changing climate policies have led the country to scrap dozens of plans for new coal plants, he said.Japan agreed in August to support expanding the Matarbari plant with three additional units planned in a second phase of construction, according to a Japanese government official, who asked not to be identified citing policy. However, Japan hasn’t yet formally committed to providing loans for the second phase, said the official.Institutions providing financing for coal-fired generation are under increasing pressure from investors to exit the sector amid fears that the facilities will become stranded assets that pose financial risk, as governments seek to decarbonize economies.JICA’s decision whether to finance the Matarbari expansion won’t impact its credit rating as long as it is tied to the Japanese government, said Atsushi Moriya, an analyst with Rating And Investment, which rates JICA AA . JICA is a government agency that provides overseas aid in developing countries.The expansion may prove awkward for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has pledged to make Japan carbon neutral by 2050. While the country has tightened conditions for participation in overseas coal projects, it has left the door open to new plants if recipient countries commit to long-term decarbonization and support only the highest-efficiency plants.Japan Bank for International Cooperation Governor Tadashi Maeda said earlier this month that the state-run lender has no immediate plans to finance any new coal-power projects. JBIC in December agreed to provide about $636 million worth of project financing for the Vung Ang 2 plant in central Vietnam.Japan’s commercial banks, including Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., have pledged to phase out coal power financing amid pressure from environmental groups and investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-eyes-overseas-coal-units-in-bangladesh-ignores-climate-pressure-101616479072142.html
23-03-2021||World||Bangladesh officials probe fire at Rohingya camp that killed several people||Bangladeshi officials began investigating the cause of a massive fire that left several dead at a Rohingya refugee camp, as officials sifted through the debris looking for more victims on Tuesday.The fire ripped through the Balukhali camp near the southeastern town of Cox's Bazar late on Monday, burning through hundreds of homes as people raced to recover their meagre possessions.Police have so far confirmed only two deaths after recovering the bodies. Rohingya witnesses, however, said several people had died in the blaze that has left tens of thousands with no shelter.Some witnesses said barbed wire fencing around the camp trapped many people, causing some of the casualties and leading international humanitarian agencies to call for its removal."The cause of the fire is still unknown," said Zakir Hossain Khan, a senior police official. "Authorities are investigating to determine the cause of the fire."Humanitarian organization Refugees International estimated 50,000 people had been displaced - in already crowded camps that house more than one million Rohingya refugees - and the extent of the damage may not be known for some time."Many children are missing, and some were unable to flee because of barbed wire set up in the camps," it said in a statement.John Quinley, of Fortify Rights, a rights organization working in the area, said he had heard similar reports, adding the fences had hampered the distribution of humanitarian aid and vital services at the camps in the past."The government must remove the fences and protect refugees," Quinley said in a statement. "There have now been a number of large fires in the camps including a large fire in January this year...The authorities must do a proper investigation into the cause of the fires."The vast majority of the people in the camps fled Myanmar in 2017 amid a military-led crackdown on the Rohingya that UN investigators said was executed with "genocidal intent", charges Myanmar denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-officials-probe-fire-at-rohingya-camp-that-killed-several-people-101616478682024.html
23-03-2021||World||Canada warns other countries of risk to their citizens who are in China||As international action against the Chinese government has started to coalesce around the detention and trials of two Canadian nationals jailed in China, Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau warned other nations that doing business with Beijing could result in their citizens getting detained there.On a day of quick developments that witnessed the trial in Beijing of a second Canadian man, Michael Kovrig, Canada joined the US and the UK in imposing sanctions on four top Chinese officials and an entity over human rights violations in Xinjiang province. Garneau told CBC, “My advice to all other countries in the world is - if you are doing business with China and you have citizens of your country in China, and you have disagreements with them, there is the possibility that your citizens could be detained.”In a statement issued earlier in the day by Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, Garneau said, “We are deeply troubled by the total lack of transparency surrounding these hearings and we continue to work towards an immediate end to their arbitrary detention.” While one of the detained Canadians, Michael Spavor, was tried in a Beijing court on Friday, Kovrig appeared before a judge on Monday. The two Canadians were arrested in December 2018. They were later charged with spying in China and passing on sensitive information to entities outside the country.It is widely believed that their arrest was politically motivated and came in retaliation after Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, was arrested and detained in Vancouver just days before on an extradition request from the US. Wanzhou was charged with fraud and conspiracy for trying to bypass US sanctions on Iran.Speaking at a press event in Trois-Rivières in Quebec province, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the “arbitrary detention” of the two Canadians was “unacceptable”.Both Trudeau and Garneau thanked diplomats from two dozen nations for standing in unity with Canada outside the courthouse, even as they were barred from entering the premises. “The eyes of the world are on these cases and proceedings and I want to thank our international partners for their continued support and solidarity,” Garneau said.In a separate statement following the imposition of sanctions on Chinese officials, Garneau said, “We remain deeply concerned by the egregious human rights violations that are taking place in Xinjiang at the hands of the Chinese state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-warns-other-countries-of-risk-to-their-citizens-who-are-in-china-101616476734044.html
23-03-2021||World||Israel elections: Opinion polls in favour of Netanyahu after vaccine success||Israelis began voting on Tuesday on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political survival in a fourth election in two years, with the veteran leader hoping his role in a rapid Covid-19 vaccine campaign will win him another term.Opinion polls show the race too close to call.On trial on corruption charges he denies, Netanyahu, 71, is Israel's longest-serving head of government. Since 2009, he has led the politically polarised nation where supporters hail him as "King Bibi" and opponents call him "crime minister".Opinion polls indicated an uptick for Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party in the campaign's final days, giving a prospective coalition of conservative and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties around 60 seats in the 120-member parliament.A possible, but more unlikely, alliance among right-wing, centrist and left-wing parties opposed to a Netanyahu-led government also fell short of a ruling majority in the legislature, but could also be within reach of power, the surveys showed.Polling stations opened at 7am (0500 GMT) and will close at 10pm (2000 GMT), when exit polls could point to voting trends, if not a clear winner. Yair Lapid, a former finance minister who heads the centrist Yesh Atid party, has emerged as Netanyahu's main challenger.No one party has ever gleaned enough votes for a parliamentary majority on its own in an Israeli election. Election night results may only be a starting point, with a final winner to be determined in backroom coalition talks.Critics have accused Netanyahu of seeking new elections out of self-interest, in hopes of securing enough support in parliament for possible legislation to quash the legal proceedings against him.Netanyahu has denied the allegation, or any personal involvement in prospective criminal immunity moves. But he has not ruled out the possibility that allies might pursue them.On the campaign trail, Netanyahu has highlighted his role in securing millions of vaccine doses from Pfizer Inc and turning Israel into what he dubbed a "vaccination nation".About half of Israelis have been inoculated at a pace that drew international praise for Netanyahu as well as calls for Israel to do more to ensure Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza receive vaccines.Israel's swift vaccine roll-out allowed it to reopen much of its economy before the election. Posting a video on Twitter of his visit to a Jerusalem hospital on Monday, Netanyahu wrote: "Today we are the first in the world to return to life and smile again."Netanyahu's current government, a power-sharing alliance with centrist Defence Minister Benny Gantz, collapsed in December, some seven months after it was established.Gantz's Blue and White party is forecast to win barely enough votes to get into parliament, after he angered many of his supporters by reneging on a promise not to serve under an indicted prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-elections-opinion-polls-in-favour-of-netanyahu-after-vaccine-success-101616476167988.html
23-03-2021||World||West sanctions China over Xinjiang abuses, Beijing hits back at EU||The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the first such coordinated Western action against Beijing under new US President Joe Biden.Beijing hit back immediately with punitive measures against the EU that appeared broader, including European lawmakers, diplomats, institutes and families, and banning their businesses from trading with China.Western governments are seeking to hold Beijing accountable for mass detentions of Muslim Uighurs in northwestern China, where the United States says China is committing genocide.China denies all accusations of abuse.The coordinated effort appeared to be early fruit in a concerted U.S. diplomatic push to confront China in league with allies, a core element of Biden's still evolving China policy.Senior US administration officials have said they are in daily contact with governments in Europe on China-related issues, something they call the "Europe roadshow.""Amid growing international condemnation, (China) continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in statement ahead of meetings with EU and NATO ministers in Brussels this week.Canada's foreign ministry said: "Mounting evidence points to systemic, state-led human rights violations by Chinese authorities."Activists and UN rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations. China says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.The European Union was the first to impose sanctions on Monday on four Chinese officials, including a top security director, and one entity, a decision later mirrored by Britain and Canada.Those also targeted by the United States were Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau and another senior official in the region, Wang Junzheng.The United States had already last year designated for sanctions the top official in Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, who was not targeted by the other Western allies on Monday, to avoid a larger diplomatic dispute, experts and diplomats said.The foreign ministers of Canada and Britain issued a joint statement with Blinken, saying the three were united in demanding that Beijing end its "repressive practices" in Xinjiang.Evidence of abuses was "overwhelming", including satellite imagery, eyewitness testimony, and the Chinese government's own documents, they said.Separately, the foreign ministers of Australia and New Zealand issued a statement expressing "grave concerns about the growing number of credible reports of severe human rights abuses against ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang" and welcoming the measures announced by Canada, the European Union, Britain and the United States.FIRST MAJOR EU SANCTIONS IN DECADESThe move by the US and its allies follows two days of talks between US and Chinese officials last week, which laid bare the tensions between the world's two largest economies.The EU accused Chen Mingguo of "arbitrary detentions and degrading treatment inflicted upon Uighurs and people from other Muslim ethnic minorities, as well as systematic violations of their freedom of religion or belief".Others hit with travel bans and asset freezes were: senior Chinese officials Wang Mingshan, the former deputy party secretary in Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Public Security Bureau.The EU has sought to avoid confrontation with Beijing and Monday's sanctions were the first significant measures since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, although Brussels targeted two computer hackers and a technology firm in 2020 as part of broader cyber sanctions.The steps were praised by the United States. "A united transatlantic response sends a strong signal to those who violate or abuse international human rights," Blinken said.While mainly symbolic, the EU sanctions mark a hardening towards China, which Brussels regarded as a benign trading partner but now views as a systematic abuser of rights and freedoms.Britain has repeatedly denounced torture, forced labour and sterilisations that it says are taking place on an "industrial scale" in Xinjiang and repeated its criticism of Beijing on Monday.'POINTLESS'Beijing's reprisal was swift.Retaliation included sanctions on European lawmakers, the EU's main foreign policy decision-making body known as the Political and Security Committee and two institutes.On Tuesday, China also summoned the EU ambassador, Nicolas Chapuis, to lodge a "solemn protest" and demand that the bloc correct its error to prevent further damage to relations."The so-called sanctions based on lies are not acceptable," Wang Yi, foreign minister and state councillor, said separately during a joint briefing with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.German politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation to China, was among the most high-profile figures to be hit. The non-profit Alliance of Democracies Foundation, founded by former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, was on the list, according to a statement by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Also included was Adrian Zenz, a German scholar whose research was cited by the State Department last year when highlighting alleged abuses in Xinjiang.The Netherlands summoned China's ambassador to The Hague after Beijing announced its measures on 10 Europeans, while the European Parliament, along with German, Dutch, Belgian and other foreign ministers, rejected the Chinese retaliation."These sanctions prove that China is sensitive to pressure," Dutch lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, who was put on China's sanctions list, said on Twitter. "Let this be an encouragement to all my European colleagues: Speak out!"Restricted from entering China or doing business with it, Beijing accused its targets of seriously harming the country's sovereignty over Xinjiang.All 27 EU governments agreed to the bloc's punitive measures, but Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, called them "harmful" and "pointless".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-sanctions-china-over-xinjiang-abuses-beijing-hits-back-at-eu-101616475295609.html
23-03-2021||World||Biden to talk up health insurance cost cuts in visit to Ohio||President Joe Biden will showcase health insurance cost cuts in a speech in Ohio Tuesday during what may be the best time for Democrats to talk up the Affordable Care Act since it became law.Biden's Covid-19 relief bill pumps up “Obamacare” premium subsidies to address longstanding problems of affordability, particularly for people with solid middle-class incomes. More taxpayer assistance means, in effect, that consumers who buy their own policies through HealthCare.gov will pay hundreds of dollars less out of their own pockets.“The ACA is over a decade old and this is literally the first time that Democrats have been successful at improving it,” said analyst Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. “Democrats have succeeded politically by selling the ACA's protections for preexisting conditions, but affordability has always been a challenge. And now Democrats have successfully improved the premium help available under the law.”Biden's speech Tuesday in Columbus, the capital of a political battleground state, is part of a mini-blitz by the White House. Newly minted Health Secretary Xavier Becerra will echo Biden's comments Tuesday in Carson City, Nevada, and join a Florida-themed Zoom event. Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff will pitch the relief bill in Omaha, Nebraska.The numbers show that the Biden administration does have a product that consumers may want to hear about.The Covid-19 legislation cuts premiums paid by a hypothetical 64-year-old making $58,000 from $1,075 a month to about $413, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. A 45-year-old making $19,300 would pay zero in premiums as compared with about $67 on average before the law. People who have even a brief spell of unemployment this year can get a standard plan for zero premium and reduced copays and deductibles.New and existing customers will be able to take advantage of the savings starting April 1 by going to HealthCare.gov. States that run their own health insurance markets will offer the same enhanced assistance, although timetables for implementation may vary.Biden has opened a special sign-up period for uninsured people to get coverage through HealthCare.gov through May 15, and the early response has been strong. By spreading the word about the higher subsidies, the White House is hoping to super-charge enrollment. But the 11 million people who already have private plans through the health law will also benefit.Republicans see Biden's sweeter subsidies as an example of Democratic overreach on the COVID-19 bill. Policy consultant Brian Blase, a former health care adviser in the Trump White House, expects most of the additional taxpayer assistance will merely substitute for what private households would have otherwise paid.Their complaints notwithstanding, Republicans may face a political dilemma. The higher health care subsidies are keyed to the pandemic and expire by the end of 2022. That will let Democrats set up election-year votes to make the new benefits permanent, or add even more.The COVID-19 bill follows Biden’s strategy of building on the Obama-era health law to move the U.S. toward coverage for all.Another provision offers a dozen or so holdout states led by Republicans a financial inducement to expand Medicaid to more low-income adults. So far there have been no takers.It’s unclear how big a dent the Biden legislation will make in the number of uninsured people, which has risen to an estimated 33 million or more.But it represents the biggest expansion of federal help for health insurance since the ACA's enactment. Obamacare not only survived President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to tear it down, it's now getting new life.Because health insurance is so complicated, consumers are going to have to do their homework to figure out if there’s something in the legislation for them. But people who qualify for higher tax credits won't lose out. If they don't claim the enhanced assistance immediately, they're still entitled to the money when they file their 2021 tax returns next year.Tuesday marks the 11th anniversary of then-President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act. Biden, who as vice president was at Obama's side at the signing ceremony, is scheduled to tour the James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute before his speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-talk-up-health-insurance-cost-cuts-in-visit-to-ohio-101616474552213.html

Officer Eric Tally responded to the scene -- was first on the scene -- and he was fatally shot," said police chief Maris Herold.Tally, 51, had been serving in the Boulder police department since 2010, police said. Herold added the King Soopers supermarket shooting is a complex investigation that will take no less than five days to complete.According to police officials cited by news agency Reuters, they had few immediate details of the shooting and no known motive for the violence, which unfolded at about 3pm at the grocery store in the Table Mesa area of Boulder, a city at the eastern foot of the Rockies about 28 miles (45km) northwest of the state capital of Denver.The person taken into custody, who was also injured in the violence, was believed to be the only individual who survived the bloodshed, commander Kerry Yamaguchi of the Boulder Police department was quoted as saying. No further details about the suspect were revealed.According to video footage cited by Reuters that was broadcast on local television, a shirtless, bearded man in boxer shorts was seen handcuffed and being taken out of the storeAccording to video footage cited by Reuters that was broadcast on local television, a shirtless, bearded man in boxer shorts was seen handcuffed and being taken out of the store, before being placed on a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance. The man in custody appeared to have a bloody leg and was limping as he walked, the agency reported.An eyewitness, Ryan Borowski, who was in the store when he heard at least eight gunshots and escaped, told CNN, "I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips." "It felt amazing that everybody was helping each other out and that our instincts were on the same page and we ran... I don't know why other people didn't, and I'm sorry that they froze. I wish that this just didn't happen," he said, according to AFP.Armoured vehicles, ambulances and armed personnel including FBI agents and SWAT teams were deployed to the scene. Later, shoppers who had been led safely out of the store sat wrapped in blankets, talking to emergency workers in the snow-covered parking area, AFP reported.This is the second shooting in the United States in a week after eight people, including six Asian women, were killed by a gunman at three locations in and around Atlanta last Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-supermarket-shooting-10-including-cop-dead-suspect-arrested-what-we-know-so-far-101616470077672.html

She said the number of reported cases went up in four of the WHO's six regions, though there were significant variations within each region."In the last week, cases have increased by 8 per cent," Van Kerkhove told reporters. "In Europe, that is 12 per cent -- and that's driven by several countries."The increase is in part due to the spread of a variant that first emerged in Britain and is now circulating in many other places, including eastern Europe, she said.Southeast Asia registered a 49 per cent week-to-week jump in confirmed cases, while WHO's Western Pacific region reported a 29 per cent rise largely fuelled by the Philippines, Van Kerkhove said.The eastern Mediterranean region saw cases rise by 8 per cent, while the number of cases reported in the Americas and Africa declined."I do want to mention that it had been about six weeks where we were seeing decreases in deaths," said Van Kerkhove. "And in the last week, we've started to see a slight increase in deaths across the world, and this is to be expected if we are to see increasing cases. But this is also a worrying sign."WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan acknowledged an urge among the public in many places to emerge from pandemic restrictions.He insisted that any easing should coincide with measures such as strict case surveillance and high levels of vaccination, but said vaccines alone would not be enough."I'm afraid we're all trying to grasp at straws. We're trying to find the golden solution: So we just get enough vaccine and we push enough vaccine to people and that's going to take care of it," he said. "I'm sorry, it's not."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-worrying-sign-global-covid-19-deaths-rise-for-first-time-in-6-weeks-who-101616469418647.html
23-03-2021||World||Britain marks 1 year since start of first Covid lockdown||The UK is marking one year since the start of its first coronavirus lockdown, as the government reflects on the best and worst of its response to the pandemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will privately hold a minute’s silence Tuesday for more than 126,000 people who have died from Covid-19 in the UK, the fifth-biggest death toll in the world according to Bloomberg’s Covid-19 tracker.It comes as the country’s health service presses on with a vaccination program that has seen more than half of all adults receive their first dose of the vaccine, by far the fastest of all European countries.For Johnson’s government, the vaccine roll-out is a chance at redemption after a year punctured by indecision over imposing coronavirus restrictions and a faltering start to the UK’s test-and-trace system.“The last 12 months has taken a huge toll on us all, and I offer my sincere condolences to those who have lost loved ones,” Johnson said in an emailed statement. “Today, the anniversary of the first lockdown, is an opportunity to reflect on the past year -- one of the most difficult in our country’s history.”Praising the “great spirit shown by our nation”, he said everyone had played their part including those who had home-schooled their children and stayed at home to prevent the spread of the virus.Third WaveCoronavirus cases in the UK fell fast following a peak in infections that threatened to overwhelm hospitals over the winter, but there are now signs the pandemic is shrinking more slowly.The reproductive rate of the virus, known as the R rate, increased slightly last week to between 0.6 and 0.9. The rate represents the average number of people that each positive case goes on to infect: anything above 1 means the virus is spreading.As Covid-19 infections begin to soar once again in a number of European countries, Johnson warned on Monday that the U.K. would feel the effects of this “third wave” in “due course.”“When a wave hits our friends, I’m afraid it washes up on our shores as well,” he said in a pooled TV interview.An imminent influx of fresh cases could spell trouble for the government’s “road map” of unlocking restrictions, starting with allowing up to six people -- or two households -- to gather outside from next Monday.Members of Parliament are set to vote on renewing the Coronavirus Act, which was brought in last year to enshrine the first lockdown, on Thursday. But Johnson will face a rebellion from some of his own Conservative colleagues on extending restrictions that they believe cause serious harm to people’s wellbeing and livelihoods.Dr. Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Public Health England, said in a statement: “On this day of reflection many of us will be thinking about those loved ones we have sadly lost this past year.“This virus has left no one untouched, and it has been the most challenging time both personally and professionally that many of us have ever faced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-marks-1-year-since-start-of-first-covid-lockdown-101616468192338.html

Rui Xu, a Westwood Democrat, said the man confronted him and, using an expletive, questioned why he was wearing a face mask. Xu told the Associated Press that the patron also questioned if he was carrying the virus."That's a pretty specific dog whistle at Asian Americans from the last year," Xu told the AP. "Most of the anti-Asian American rhetoric that has happened has had some form of that message."Many members of the Asian American community see the shootings at three Georgia massage parlours and spas that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent, as a reminder of harassment and violence that have been occurring against Asian Americans since Covid-19 entered the country.Moments after the confrontation, Xu said he heard the patron searching for him in the bar, yelling that he was going to "kick his ass."In a post shared over 200 times, Xu said he visited the Russell sports bar after featuring as a guest on a PBS television show based in nearby Bunker Hill. Waitresses apologised to him after the incident and a patron bought him a drink, Xu said. He said people at the bar told him the patron was from out of state."Everybody at the bar who's actually from Russell was amazing and kind and I had a good time," Xu said, adding that he doesn't think where the incident happened is important.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threatened-at-bar-questioned-if-i-was-carrying-the-covid-19-says-asian-american-lawmaker-101616463706912.html
23-03-2021||World||World Meteorological Day 2021: History, theme and significance of the day||World Meteorological Day is observed every year on March 23 to highlight the importance of the role that people and their behaviour play in protecting Earth’s atmosphere. The day also commemorates the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which is an intergovernmental body, on March 23, 1950. According to WMO’s website, the day “showcases the essential contribution of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services to the safety and wellbeing of society.”World Meteorological Day historyThe day is celebrated to mark the establishment of WMO, which has 193 member countries and territories. The organisation originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), the idea of which is rooted in the Vienna International Meteorological Congress 1873. WMO was then established by the ratification of the WMO convention in 1950 after which the organisation became a specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) in 1951. The headquarters of WMO are located in Geneva, Switzerland.World Meteorological Day 2021 themeThe theme of World Meteorological Day 2021 is “The Ocean, Our Climate and Weather.” According to WMO’s website, the theme has been chosen to reflect the organisation’s focus on “connecting the ocean, climate and weather within the Earth System.” The theme has also been chosen as this year marks the starting year of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, which focuses on gathering support for ocean science and understanding the role that ocean science plays in sustainable development.“WMO, as the United Nations specialized agency for climate, weather and water, strives to support understanding the inextricable link between ocean, climate and weather. This helps us understand the world in which we live, including the impacts of climate change, and to help Members to strengthen their ability to keep lives and property safe – reducing the risk of disaster – and to maintain viable economies,” WMO’s website added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-meteorological-day-history-theme-and-significance-of-the-day-101616467536898.html
23-03-2021||World||Germany extends coronavirus lockdown till mid-April as cases rise||Germany extended its lockdown measures by another month and imposed several new restrictions, including largely shutting down public life over Easter, in an effort to drive down the rate of coronavirus infections.Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the measures early Tuesday after a lengthy video call with the country's 16 state governors, nearly three weeks after the two sides last agreed on a plan paving the way to relax some rules.Since then, infections have increased steadily as the more contagious variant first detected in Britain has become dominant. The restrictions previously set to run through March 28 will now remain in place until April 18.Regions were the weekly number of new infections exceeds 100 per 100,000 residents on three consecutive days will face tougher rules, as agreed at the previous meeting."Unfortunately, we will have to make use of this emergency brake,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin.The weekly infection rate per 100,000 people stood at 107 nationwide on Monday, up from the mid-60s three weeks ago.Officials agreed to largely shut down public life from April 1-3, adding a public holiday and shutting down most stores for the period. Public gatherings will be banned from April 1-5, to encourage people to stay at home.Amid concern over the rise in Germans traveling abroad on holidays, authorities also agreed on a blanket requirement for air travelers to be tested for COVID-19 before boarding a flight to Germany.Drawing up legally watertight rules has proved a headache at times. A court in Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, said Monday it struck down rules requiring people to get appointments to visit shops. It said they violated a requirement that businesses get equal treatment.The state government promptly reinstated the rules, tightening them for some businesses — such as bookshops and garden centers — that were previously exempt.According to Tuesday's agreement, authorities will aim to offer free tests to all students and teachers in German schools, many of which have only recently reopened after months of remote teaching.Merkel said Germany, which had comparatively low deaths during the first phase of the pandemic last spring, has seen "successes but also of setbacks.”The country's vaccination campaign has lagged far behind expectations, with only about 9% of the population receiving at least a first shot and 4% receiving both doses by Sunday.“We don't want our health system to be overloaded,” Merkel said, noting that the new variant has caused severe illness also in younger people who are infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-extends-coronavirus-lockdown-till-mid-april-as-cases-rise-101616466895083.html

He was 65.“After a battle with post-Covid related symptoms, including severe tinnitus, Kent Taylor took his own life,” according to the statement. “Kent battled and fought hard like the former track champion that he was, but the suffering that greatly intensified in recent days became unbearable.”Taylor founded the restaurant chain in 1993 and most recently was its chief executive officer and chairman. During the pandemic, he donated his entire compensation to support the company’s front-line workers, and recently committed to fund a clinical study to help members of the military who also suffer from tinnitus, according to the statement.Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ears even when there’s no external sound. The American Tinnitus Association said the chronic condition is exacerbated by increased stress and anxiety, which are at unprecedented levels due to the pandemic.The Louisville, Kentucky, based company named its president, Jerry Morgan, as the new CEO on Friday.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior US senator from Kentucky, was among several public figures who paid tribute to Taylor, saying he’d built the company “with creativity, grit and a lot of bold risks.””From the cooks to the executives, Kent deeply cared about his team,” McConnell said. ”When the pandemic threw everything into uncertainty last year, there was no question what Kent would do.”Texas Roadhouse shares have tripled since its March low last year, outperforming the gain in the S&P 500 Index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-roadhouse-founder-kent-taylor-dies-by-suicide-after-covid19-101616463496453.html
23-03-2021||World||Police officer among 10 dead in shooting at Colorado grocery store: Cops||A shooting at a Colorado supermarket killed 10 people Monday, including a police officer, and a suspect was in custody, authorities said.Boulder police Chief Maris Herold announced the death toll at a news conference Monday night, fighting back tears.The suspect was getting medical treatment and there was no further threat to the public, authorities said. Officers had escorted a shirtless man with blood running down his leg out of the store in handcuffs but authorities would not say if he was the suspect.The officer who was killed was Eric Talley, 51, who had been with Boulder police since 2010, Herold said.Victims' families were still being notified so their names weren't released, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said.“This is a tragedy and a nightmare for Boulder County, and in response, we have cooperation and assistance from local, state and federal authorities,” Dougherty said.Yamaguchi said police were still investigating and didn't have details on a motive for the shooting at the King Soopers store in Boulder, which is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver and home to the University of Colorado.Dean Schiller told The Associated Press that he had just left the supermarket when he heard gunshots and saw three people lying face down, two in the parking lot and one near the doorway. He said he “couldn’t tell if they were breathing."Video posted on YouTube showed one person on the floor inside the store and two more outside on the ground. What sounds like two gunshots are also heard at the beginning of the video.Law enforcement vehicles and officers massed outside the store, including SWAT teams, and at least three helicopters landed on the roof. Some windows at the front of the store were broken.At one point, authorities said over a loudspeaker that the building was surrounded and that “you need to surrender."Sarah Moonshadow told the Denver Post that two shots rang out just after she and her son, Nicolas Edwards, finished buying strawberries. She said she told her son to get down and then “we just ran.”Once they got outside, she said they saw a body in the parking lot. Edwards said police were speeding into the lot and pulled up next to the body.“I knew we couldn’t do anything for the guy,” he said. “We had to go.”James Bentz told the Post that he was in the meat section when he heard what he thought was a misfire, then a series of pops.“I was then at the front of a stampede,” he said.Bentz said he jumped off a loading dock out back to escape and that younger people were helping older people off of it.One person was taken from the shooting scene to Foothills Hospital in Boulder, said Rich Sheehan, spokesman for Boulder Community Health, which operates the hospital.Colorado Gov. Jared Polis tweeted a statement that his “heart is breaking as we watch this unspeakable event unfold in our Boulder community."Police had told people to shelter in place amid a report of an “armed, dangerous individual” about 3 miles (5 kilometers) away from the grocery store but said at the news conference later that it wasn't related to the shooting.The FBI said it’s helping in the investigation at the request of police.White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting.In a statement, the King Soopers chain offered “thoughts, prayers and support to our associates, customers, and the first responders who so bravely responded to this tragic situation. We will continue to cooperate with local law enforcement and our store will remain closed during the police investigation.”Kevin Daly, owner of Under the Sun Eatery and Pizzeria Restaurant a block or so from the supermarket, said he was in his shop when he saw police cars arriving and shoppers running from the grocery store. He said he took in several people to keep them warm, and others boarded a bus provided by Boulder police and were taken away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-officer-among-several-dead-in-shooting-at-colorado-grocery-store-cops-101616462948029.html

The charity has been raising money to support African families who were financially impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.According to Valuables, 95 per cent of the proceeds from the sale price go to the tweet's original creator while 5 per cent go to the platform.Dorsey tweeted the Bitcoin receipt on Monday afternoon, and said the funds were sent to the charity."Incredible - huge thanks @jack and @sinaEstavi - looking forward to getting this $ into recipients' hands soon," Give Directly tweeted following Dorsey's announcement.NFTs have recently swept the online collecting world. A digital artwork by artist Beeple sold for USD 69.4 million in an online auction by a British auction house earlier this month, with an NFT as a guarantee of its authenticity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-sells-nft-of-first-tweet-for-2-9-million-101616460831263.html
23-03-2021||World||On Covid-19 lockdown anniversary, Boris Johnson hails Britain's 'great spirit'||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday praised the "great spirit" shown by Britain in tackling Covid-19, marking a year since the first lockdown by saying everyone's efforts had allowed the country to start "on the cautious road" to easing restrictions.With Britain suffering one of the highest death tolls from the coronavirus, Johnson has come under fire for moving too slowly last year to tackle the first and second waves of the pandemic, with some accusing him of prioritising the economy over health.But since then, his government has overseen a successful vaccine rollout, reaching more than half of the adult population, and a cautious approach to easing the latest lockdown, prompting a recovery for him in opinion polls."Today, the anniversary of the first lockdown, is an opportunity to reflect on the past year – one of the most difficult in our country's history," Johnson said in a statement."We should also remember the great spirit shown by our nation over this past year. ... It's because of every person in this country that lives have been saved, our NHS (National Health Service) was protected, and we have started on our cautious road to easing restrictions once and for all."On March 23 last year, Johnson ordered the first lockdown to try to stem the spread of the coronavirus, telling Britain that people should "stay at home", part of a slogan on saving lives that has become a common refrain since then.Last month, he unveiled a roadmap to ease England's lockdown, starting with the reopening of schools two weeks ago and ending on June 21 at the earliest when most of the restrictions will be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-covid-19-lockdown-anniversary-boris-johnson-hails-britain-s-great-spirit-101616460568200.html
23-03-2021||World||'Willing to work hand in hand': China boosts North Korea, Russia ties after US Talks||China is looking to boost ties with North Korea and Russia following a contentious meeting with US officials in Alaska last week.“We are willing to work hand in hand with North Korean comrades to maintain, consolidate and develop China-North Korean relations,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency, citing verbal messages delivered on behalf of Chinese President Xi Jinping.The messages come after senior US diplomats visited Japan and South Korea before the meeting with their Chinese peers, as Washington seeks to shore up its alliances in Asia. US President Joe Biden has said he wants to work with “like-minded countries” to forge a common approach to China.Beijing may also be taking stock of its own allies, with a visit from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov this week.In an interview with media outlets including China Global Television Network, Xi called for cooperation between Russia and China in response to hegemony pursued by some Western countries led by the U.S. Lavrov also promoted settlement of deals in currencies that can replace the U.S. dollar and help reduce risks posed by sanctions.Xi reiterated that China is willing to work with North Korea and other related parties to preserve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, according to Xinhua. The remarks were delivered by Song Tao, a senior Chinese diplomat, and Ri Ryong Nam, North Korea’s new ambassador to China, during a meeting on Monday.In Seoul last week before meeting Chinese officials, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Biden’s approach toward North Korea was still under review and stressed China’s “clear self-interest” in getting its neighbor and Cold War ally back to the table.China is North Korea’s biggest benefactor, for years providing a lifeline that helped keep its neighbor’s struggling economy afloat. Beijing is also a key player for managing the effectiveness of the global sanctions regime put in place to punish Kim Jong Un for his test of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.Kim sent a verbal message to Xi as part of their strategic communication, the official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday. Kim “stressed the need to strengthen the unity and cooperation between the two parties and two countries to cope with the hostile forces’ all-round challenges and obstructive moves,” KCNA said, in reference to what Pyongyang sees as the threat posed by the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/willing-to-work-hand-in-hand-china-boosts-north-korea-russia-ties-after-us-talks-101616460181394.html
23-03-2021||World||Joe Biden starts big infrastructure bet with US far behind China||President Joe Biden is betting that a multitrillion-dollar economic plan centered around infrastructure spending will do more than bolster an American economy hammered by the coronavirus pandemic: It will ensure his country’s competitiveness against China for decades to come.“If we don’t get moving, they’re going to eat our lunch,” Biden told lawmakers in a pitch for his proposal shortly after his call last month with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “We just have to step up.”Biden’s advisers will present him this week with a detailed proposal for a plan whose cost could touch $3 trillion, according to three people familiar with the deliberations. Infrastructure and climate change have long been described as key efforts in the pending program, and the new details show the administration is eyeing some $400 billion in so-called green spending, according to one of the people.Even if he gets all he asks for, catching up to China on infrastructure won’t be easy.While US officials have been promising an approaching “infrastructure week” since the early days of the Trump administration, China has been plowing ahead for years. In February, Xi’s government set out a 15-year plan for the country’s transportation network. It pledges to extend China’s rail network from 146,300 kilometers (91,000 miles) in 2020 to about 200,000 kilometers by 2035 -- enough to circle the equator more than five times.The plan also calls for adding 162 new civilian airports, after Beijing’s new $11 billion international airport opened last year.In contrast, the US has built just one major airport -- Denver international -- since the mid-1990s. And on rail, even a bipartisan effort to build the long-sought “Gateway” rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey -- part of the busiest rail line in the US -- has foundered in recent years.China’s infrastructure efforts aren’t limited to China. Since Xi introducing the so-called Belt and Road initiative in 2013, the World Bank estimated China has built or pledged to construct $575 billion in energy plants, railways, roads, ports and other projects across the globe from Sri Lanka to Greece. Morgan Stanley in 2018 said total spending on the effort could reach $1.3 trillion by 2027.Biden is hoping to begin leveling the playing field. If he can win support for his plan in a deeply divided Congress, there’s certainly no shortage of projects to work on.The U.S. got an early start on all its infrastructure, but much of it is now aging or decrepit. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers 2021 Infrastructure Report Card, 43% of U.S. public roadways are in poor or mediocre condition, and 42% of the nation’s 617,000 bridges are at least 50 years old. About 7.5% of them are considered structurally deficient.“The United States is entering what could be a decades-long competition in which economic and technological power will matter just as much, if not more, than military might,” Jonathan Hillman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last month. “Starting this race with decaying infrastructure is like lining up for a marathon with a broken ankle.”The engineering report doesn’t go into another challenge that may have a defining imprint on competitiveness between the U.S. and China: technology infrastructure.The US is still mired in domestic political debates about how to get broadband technology rolled out across the nation. More than a third of Americans in rural areas still lack high-speed access, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Money to help close that gap is expected to be part of any new U.S. proposal.Rail FailuresDespite Biden’s impulse to push for big spending, the track record of recent presidents suggest he’s likely to fall short.Donald Trump, a real estate developer who was touted as a potential “builder president” upon his arrival in Washington, proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan -- funded mostly by private investment -- that never won approval.President Barack Obama vowed to bet big on high-speed rail as a tool to help the U.S. emerge from the 2008 financial crisis. He spoke frequently in his first term about developing a rail network that could grow to rival the interstate highway system and included $8 billion in his 2009 economic stimulus package for high-speed rail lines. But Republican governors in states like Ohio, Wisconsin and Florida rejected the money, and a decade later a line in California that most of the rejected money was funneled to is still only in its early stages.“Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,” Obama said in 2011 when reflecting on his struggles to harness infrastructure projects to jump-start the economy.China’s ExampleMeanwhile, China has had access to cheaper labor, engineering prowess and experience in massive infrastructure projects, both at home and abroad. It also had the benefit of building much of its infrastructure from scratch over the past few decades as its economy boomed, with little fiscal scrutiny and fewer protections for workers, the environment or property rights.The government has long relied on big infrastructure spending to boost the domestic economy and, more recently, to generate international support through investing or providing aid overseas.Read more: China Bets $600 Billion on Infrastructure to Revive GrowthThat spending helped insulate China’s economy from the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, and again limited the decline in growth after the coronavirus pandemic hit last year. However, the reliance on building roads, railways and airports to support growth also cause a spike in debt, with some of that money funneled into unnecessary infrastructure and uneconomic boondoggle developments.The World Bank estimated in 2019 that only one-sixth of China’s high-speed rail lines made enough money to cover their operating costs and service the construction debts. That problem is likely to increase with the plan to build even more, as the newer lines will be mostly in poorer and less densely-populated parts of the country where there’s less demand.Xi also faces a set of financial and demographic challenges that his government will struggle to address as the population ages and the country’s previous “one child” policy means there aren’t as many workers to replace retirees.“In the coming years, the country will be traveling a demographic downslope with an increasingly heavy debt burden and tough prospects for improving the productivity of its workers,” said Ryan Hass, a former China director on the US National Security Council and author of “Stronger: Adapting America’s China Strategy in an Age of Competitive Interdependence.”That may help give Biden an opening to fend off Beijing’s bid to dominate the 21st century.“If the United States makes progress in fixing some of its own problems, including its infrastructure deficit, it will remain highly competitive against any challenger, including China,” Hass said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-starts-big-infrastructure-bet-with-us-far-behind-china-101616459663478.html

Turkey's defence ministry said it asked Russia to secure an immediate halt to the attacks.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the recent wave of attacks in northwest Syria, which have killed and injured dozens of civilians, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said on Monday.The UN chief reiterated his call for a nationwide ceasefire, citing the aerial attacks near the border as well as artillery strikes on a hospital in western Aleppo Governorate on March 21, reports of shelling of a residential neighbourhood in Aleppo city causing civilian casualties, and airstrikes close to densely populated areas with camps for displaced people, Haq said.Mark Cutts, UN deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, called the attacks "extremely worrying" because they endangered the lives of the area's most vulnerable population.The US condemned the attacks and called for a nationwide ceasefire. In a statement on Monday, it said the strikes near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey had put access to much-needed assistance at risk.The area along the border with Turkey in rebel-held northwestern Syria had been considered one of the safest spots in the conflict-stricken region, and had attracted aid groups who located their offices and warehouses there.The rebel-held enclave divided between Idlib and Aleppo provinces is home to more than 2.7 million displaced people, mostly living in camps and temporary shelters, many having escaped repeated rounds of military offensives and fighting."Many of the camps are in that area, about a million people in camps around that area. They are highly vulnerable when airstrikes and shelling happen," Cutts told The Associated Press."It is also the area where many of the humanitarian organisations have offices and warehouses. They put their warehouses and offices there thinking that was the safest part of Idlib. So when that starts coming under attack that is extremely worrying."Turkey and Russia support rival parties in Syria's 10-year conflict. The countries reached a ceasefire deal last March that stopped a Russian-backed government offensive on Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in war-torn Syria.Opposition activists claimed that Russian warplanes carried out the attacks near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey late Sunday, hours after government artillery shells hit a major hospital in Atareb, another rebel-controlled town. Six patients, including a 10-year-old child, were killed. The medical staff was wounded, forcing the facility to shut its doors.The Bab al-Hawa border crossing is the main point from which international aid is brought to rebel-held parts of northwest Syria.The crossing "remains the only UN-authorised humanitarian border crossing in Syria and remains the most efficient and effective way to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance" every month to residents of the area, US State Department spokesman Ned Price said.Cutts called the attack on the hospital "really horrific", adding that the same facility came under attack years before, forcing it to go underground to continue to operate.Idlib-based journalist Salwa Abdul-Rahman said one of the strikes hit an area near the town of Sarmada, setting afire trucks used by aid workers to distribute assistance."The targeted locations were civilian with no military presence," she said.One person was killed in the strikes, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, and the opposition's Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets.The civil defense said the strikes also targeted a cement factory.An AP video from the area showed about a dozen trucks on fire as civil defence members sprayed them with water.Turkey's defence ministry blamed the Syrian government forces for the attack, saying it left several people wounded.Cutts said the year-old ceasefire has held in some parts but not everywhere, saying that shelling in some areas has happened every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airstrikes-on-northwest-syria-near-turkey-border-area-worrying-says-un-official-101616459596223.html
23-03-2021||World||These 'virus hunters' hope to stop the next pandemic by catching bats||Researchers wearing headlamps and protective suits race to untangle the claws and wings of bats caught up in a big net after dark in the Philippine province of Laguna.The tiny animals are carefully placed in cloth bags to be taken away, measured and swabbed, with details logged and saliva and faecal matter collected for analysis before they are returned to the wild.The researchers call themselves the "virus hunters", tasked with catching thousands of bats to develop a simulation model they hope will help the world avoid a pandemic similar to Covid-19, which has killed nearly 2.8 million people.(Open https://reut.rs/2OYdIHh in an external browser to see a picture story on the Philippine bat "virus hunters".)The Japanese-funded model will be developed over the next three years by the University of the Philippines Los Banos, which hopes the bats will help in predicting the dynamics of a coronavirus by analysing factors such as climate, temperature and ease of spread, to humans included."What we're trying to look into are other strains of coronavirus that have the potential to jump to humans," said ecologist Phillip Alviola, the leader of the group, who has studied bat viruses for more than a decade."If we know the virus itself and we know where it came from, we know how to isolate that virus geographically."Beyond work in the laboratory, the research requires lengthy field trips, involving traipsing for hours through thick rainforest and precarious night hikes on mountains covered in rocks, tree roots, mud and moss.The group also targets bat roosts in buildings, setting up mist nets before dusk to catch bats and extract samples by the light of torches.Each bat is held steady by the head as researchers insert tiny swabs into their mouths and record wingspans with plastic rulers, to try and see which of the more than 1,300 species and 20 families of bats are most susceptible to infections and why.DEVASTATING IMPACTResearchers wear protective suits, masks and gloves when in contact with the bats, as a precaution against catching viruses."It's really scary these days," said Edison Cosico, who is assisting Alviola. "You never know if the bat is already a carrier."What we're after is finding out if there are any more viruses from bats that can be transmitted to humans. We'll never know if the next one is just like COVID."The bulk of those caught are horseshoe bats known to harbour coronaviruses, including the closest known relative of the novel coronavirus.Horseshoe bats figure in two of the scenarios of World Health Organization experts investigating the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.Host species, such as bats, usually display no symptoms of the pathogens, although they can be devastating if transmitted to humans or other animals.Deadly viruses to have originated from bats include Ebola and other coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).Humans' exposure and closer interaction with wildlife meant the risk of disease transmission was now higher than ever, said bat ecologist Kirk Taray."By having baseline data on the nature and occurrence of the potentially zoonotic virus in bats, we can somehow predict possible outbreaks."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-virus-hunters-hope-to-stop-the-next-pandemic-by-catching-bats-101616458313363.html

The last meeting of the permanent Indus commission was held in Lahore in August 2018.Last month, the Indian and Pakistani militaries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, raising hopes for further improvements in bilateral ties. The decision to adhere to the truce on the volatile LoC was the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two countries.An eight-member delegation of Pakistan’s Commission on Indus Waters will leave for New Delhi on Monday for a two-day meeting of the Permanent Commission on Indus Waters to discuss with their Indian counterparts Pakistan’s objections to the design of Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydroelectric plants/projects and other issues.The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. The last meeting took place in August 2018 in Lahore. Officials said the gap between the two meetings was caused by the coronavirus pandemic. After the 2018 meeting, a Pakistani delegation was invited by India to inspect the sites of the hydroelectric projects being constructed by India on Pakistani rivers.Recent comments by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa about improving ties with India have also helped clear the environment, though India has said the onus is on Pakistan for creating an atmosphere conducive to a meaningful dialogue.During the meeting of the Indus commission, the Pakistani side is also expected to seek information on new projects planned by India on western rivers, and flood data arrangements for the flood season.The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, which was brokered by the World Bank, is one of the most durable agreements between India and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-delegation-on-indus-water-in-india-to-hold-talks-101616453429111.html

Hopes of a less hardline response from the US government has encouraged some migrants to make the journey north.US officials are struggling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said last month it was opening the temporary facility in Donna to provide processing capacity for the heavily trafficked Rio Grande Valley sector while a permanent center in McAllen was being renovated. It said at the time that the Donna facility was expected to provide ample areas for eating and sleeping.In one photo, people of all ages, including children, are shown sitting on the floor. With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, all appear to be wearing masks but they are crowded close together.In others, rows of people are seen lying down next to each other on mats and covered in emergency blankets.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for physical distancing during the pandemic is at least 6 ft to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.The CBP did not immediately reply to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inside-border-facility-in-texas-migrants-crowd-together-new-photos-show-101616442888552.html

23-03-2021||World||Immigrant kids sleeping under foil blanket highlight Biden's border secrecy||President Joe Biden's administration has tried for weeks to keep the public from seeing images like those that emerged Monday showing immigrant children in US custody at the border sleeping on mats under foil blankets, separated in groups by plastic partitions.Administration officials have steadfastly refused to call the detention of more than 15,000 children in US custody, or the conditions they're living under, a crisis. But they have stymied most efforts by outsiders to decide for themselves.Officials barred nonprofit lawyers who conduct oversight from entering a Border Patrol tent where thousands of children and teenagers are detained. And federal agencies have refused or ignored dozens of requests from the media for access to detention sites. Such access was granted several times by the administration of President Donald Trump, whose restrictive immigration approach Biden vowed to reverse.The new president faces growing criticism for the apparent secrecy at the border, including from fellow Democrats.Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Monday “the administration has a commitment to transparency to make sure that the news media gets the chance to report on every aspect of what’s happening at the border.”White House press secretary Jen Psaki added that the White House was working with homeland security officials and the Health and Human Services Department to “finalize details” and that she hoped to have an update in the “coming days.”Axios on Monday first published a series of photos taken inside the largest Border Patrol detention center, a sprawling tent facility in the South Texas city of Donna. The photos were released by Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat from the border city of Laredo.Cuellar said he released the photos in part because the administration has refused media access to the Donna tent. He said he also wanted to draw attention to the extreme challenges that border agents face in watching so many children, sometimes for a week or longer despite the Border Patrol's three-day limit on detaining minors.“We ought to take care of those kids like they’re our own kids,” Cuellar said.The White House has prided itself on its methodical rollout of policy during its first 50-plus days but West Wing aides privately acknowledge they were caught off guard by the surge of migrants at the border and the resulting media furor.Republican lawmakers largely sat out the debate over administration’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill. While none of them voted for the package, their opposition was muted and they instead focused on culture war issues, like the debate over racial stereotypes in some Dr. Seuss books, rather than a bill that was broadly popular with GOP voters.But the GOP has grabbed on to the border situation with both hands, reviving the issue that was key to propelling Trump to the top of the Republican field in 2016. In 2018, the Trump administration detained hundreds of children in many of the same facilities being used now after separating them from their parents. The following year, hundreds of families and children detained at one West Texas border station went days without adequate food, water, or soap.Biden has kept in place a Trump-era public health order and expelled thousands of immigrant adults and families, but he declined to expel immigrant children without a parent after a federal appeals court in January cleared the way for him to do so. He also moved to speed up the reunification of hundreds of separated immigrant families.“What Trump did was horrible,” Cuellar said. “These pictures show you that even under our best intentions, and the Biden administration has the best intentions, it’s still very difficult.”Cuellar said the White House needs to work more with Mexico and Central America to prevent people from leaving their home countries. The White House said Monday that key officials would go this week to Mexico and Guatemala.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who visited a facility in El Paso, Texas, last week, told NPR, “We want to make sure that the press has access to hold the administration accountable.”The Associated Press has requested access to border facilities for more than a month. Reporters first asked Health and Human Services on Feb. 4 to allow entry into a surge facility re-opened at Carrizo Springs, Texas, holding hundreds of teenagers. And they have asked Homeland Security officials for access at least seven times to Border Patrol facilities, with no response. The AP has also petitioned Psaki to open border facilities.Border agencies under Trump allowed limited media tours of both Homeland Security and Health and Human Services facilities. Several of those visits revealed troubling conditions inside, including the detention of large numbers of children as young as 5 separated from their parents.Under Biden, the agencies also have denied full access to nonprofit lawyers who conduct oversight of facilities where children are detained. Those oversight visits occur under a federal court settlement.When lawyers this month visited the Border Patrol tent at Donna, where thousands of children are now detained, agents refused to let them inside and the Justice Department said they were not entitled to gain access. The lawyers were forced to interview children outside the tent. The Justice Department declined to comment.The administration is rushing to open more space to get roughly 5,000 children out of Border Patrol detention and into Health and Human Services facilities that are better suited for youth. It has also tried to expedite the releases of children in HHS custody to parents and other sponsors in the US. But border agents continue to apprehend far more children daily than HHS is releasing, even though more than 40% of youths in the system have a parent or legal guardian who could take them.Meanwhile, the administration is seeing its emergency facilities for immigrant children approach capacity almost as quickly as it can open them. The downtown Dallas convention center has 1,500 teenagers less than a week after opening and is expected to take in 500 more teens Monday, according to HHS. Its current capacity is 2,300 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immigrant-kids-sleeping-under-foil-blanket-highlight-biden-s-border-secrecy-101616443209403.html

23-03-2021||India||Madras HC grants conditional bail to former judge CS Karnan||The Madras High Court on Tuesday granted conditional bail to former judge of the court Justice CS Karnan, who was arrested for uploading derogatory content on social media against former judges of the Supreme Court and their families. The single-judge bench of Justice V Bharathidasan granted bail to Karnan arrested in December 2020 on the condition that a personal bond of ₹50,000 along with two sureties would be furnished.Other conditions include refraining from ‘committing similar offences’ of releasing defamatory videos, making abusive statements and he will have to remain in Chennai. Karnan has had to give an undertaking that he will not abscond during investigations and will not tamper with evidence. His bail would be cancelled if he doesn’t follow the conditions laid down by the court. Karnan’s bail petitions were rejected earlier and he was granted conditional bail this time as he needs treatment for post-Covid-19 complications.Ten FIRs have been registered against Karnan under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act on complaints from the Bar Associations of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on charges that he had uploaded as many as 33 abusive videos on social media such as YouTube and Facebook. He also faces a complaint of trespassing into the residence of a woman Supreme Court judge. During the course of the case, Karnan had admitted to uploading videos as he was suffering from mental depression, the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-grants-conditional-bail-to-former-judge-cs-karnan-101616523846199.html
23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court stays OTT regulation proceedings in various High Courts||The Supreme Court on Tuesday restrained High Courts from hearing petitions to regulate content of releases on over-the-top platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar and Zee5.On Tuesday, a three-judge bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud stayed proceedings in separate petitions pending in this regard before the Punjab & Haryana High Court, Madhya Pradesh High Court and Allahabad High Court. The bench, also comprising Justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna pointed out that about 20 petitions are pending in other High Courts as well following which the top court applied the stay order to such other High Courts where a similar issue is pending.The order was passed on a petition moved by the Centre seeking transfer of all petitions to regulate OTTs from various High Courts to Supreme Court. Last month, the top court had issued notice on this petition moved jointly by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Law and Justice.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre pointed out that despite notice on the transfer petition, the Punjab and Haryana High Court was continuing to hear the petition. He requested the Court to stay the proceedings before the respective High Courts.Along with Centre’s plea, the bench took up two PILs filed separately by NGO Justice for Rights Foundation and advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha. The petitions had demanded an autonomous body much on the lines of Censor Board to screen, filter and regulate content shown on OTT platforms.In response to one of these petitions, the Centre submitted an affidavit indicating the legal position governing OTT platforms. “There is a mechanism for regulation of the OTT Platforms under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the newly framed Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 notified on February 25, 2021.”The Centre informed the Court that it received complaints of members of civil society, Parliamentarians and Chief Ministers on the content streamed by OTT platforms and the need to regulate the same. The IT Rules 2021 now provide for an oversight mechanism and a self-regulatory body, the affidavit filed by Information Technology Ministry stated. With the mechanism already been put in place, the Centre demanded dismissal of the petitions which were filed prior in time to the 2021 Rules.Even the 2021 Rules are under scrutiny in a separate proceeding before the Supreme Court. Early this month, the Supreme Court had termed the 2021 IT Rules on OTT Platforms to “lack teeth” as it contained no penal provision for enforcing its implementation. The matter is pending consideration as the Centre expressed its willingness to revise the Rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-ott-regulation-proceedings-in-various-high-courts-101616523074280.html
23-03-2021||India||Atmosphere of trust, without terror imperative: PM Modi’s message to Imran Khan||An atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is “imperative” for better relations between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan on Tuesday.The message was part of a letter of greetings sent by Modi to Khan on the occasion of Pakistan Day. People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the letter as a routine message sent to heads of government or state on national days.“As a neighbouring country, India desires cordial relations with the people of Pakistan. For this, an atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is imperative,” said the letter.The letter also referred to the impact of Covid-19 as a “difficult time for humanity”, and conveyed Modi’s best wishes to Khan and the people of Pakistan “for dealing with the challenges” of the pandemic.A separate message was sent by President Ram Nath Kovind to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi, the people cited above said.After it emerged on Saturday that Khan had tested positive for Covid-19 and was self-isolating at home, Modi had tweeted: “Best wishes to Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI for a speedy recovery from Covid-19.”Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s chargé d'affaires Aftab Hasan Khan said his country desires friendly relations with all nations, including India, and the two sides should resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue.The diplomat made the remarks while addressing an event organised at the Pakistan high commission to mark Pakistan Day. The comments came against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral relations after the armies of the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) last month.“Pakistan wants to have friendly relations with all countries including India,” Aftab Hasan Khan said, according to a statement issued by the Pakistani mission.“To achieve peace between Pakistan and India, both countries shall resolve all outstanding issues including [Jammu and Kashmir] through dialogue,” he said. Peace within South Asia is “inevitable” for the larger interest of the region, he added.The chargé d'affaires spoke after raising the Pakistani flag at the brief ceremony with limited participation in view of the pandemic. Messages from the president and prime minister of Pakistan were also read out at the ceremony.Noting that Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah had made a resolve to create a separate homeland on March 23, 1940, the chargé d'affaires said the day is observed as Pakistan Day every year.The Indian and Pakistani high commissions in Islamabad and New Delhi are currently headed by the deputy chiefs of mission as Pakistan decided not to post an envoy in the Indian capital after Jammu and Kashmir's special status was scrapped in August 2019. Pakistan also expelled the Indian envoy and downgraded diplomatic ties.The Indian and Pakistani armies began strictly adhering to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.Last week, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa said the time has come for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, though he cautioned that any peace process would be susceptible to disruption without the resolution of the Kashmir issue.Bajwa’s conciliatory remarks came a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said India will have to take the first step for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations.The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are set to participate in the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on March 30. However, it is still not clear whether they will hold a bilateral meeting in Dushanbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmosphere-of-trust-without-terror-imperative-pm-modi-s-message-to-imran-khan-101616518073600.html

It was further agreed that, in return for getting access to the AZ technology AZD1222, Serum Institute Of India Pvt. Ltd will treat AstraZeneca as a priority customer, whether it is for drug substance or finished product," Singh stated.According to the agreement, Serum Institute has to supply millions of doses of Covishield to AstraZeneca according to their requirement. "We have to supply at least 50 lakh doses to AstraZeneca immediately for use in the UK.""This is of utmost priority as AstraZeneca has conveyed and is also reminding us of our obligation to supply Covishield to them according to the agreement. AstraZeneca and representative of the UK Government have also conveyed to us today morning that if these minimum 50 lakh doses are not supplied to the UK immediately this week then the UK government might have to halt the vaccination programme," Singh said.The letter also reminded the government that the Serum Institute has received the technology to manufacture Covishield from AstraZeneca-Oxford and need to honour the commitment to supply at least 50 lakh doses of the vaccine."We are sure, considering the gravity of the situation and prestige of our company as well as our country is at stake, you will definitely intervene and give permission to us to supply at least 50 lakh doses of Covishield to the UK this week. We will be highly obliged for the same. We assure you that the Government of India's vaccination programme will not be disturbed because of this supply," Singh stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-seeks-govt-s-nod-to-supplu-50-lakh-covishield-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-uk-101616519343038.html

23-03-2021||India||'Considerable threat': Delhi bans public fests of Holi amid daily Covid surge||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday ruled that there will be no public celebrations for Holi, Navratri in general, as the Capital is witnessing a steady surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. Unlike Maharashtra, Punjab, the Capital is not among the states that are reporting the highest number of daily Covid-19 cases. However, on Tuesday, Delhi reported 1,101 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest in this year.Noting that there has been a "persistent rise" in Covid-19 cases in the NCT of Delhi during the last fortnight, the DDMA, in its order, said, "It is anticipated that gathering, congregations and public celebrations during upcoming festivals like Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Navratri etc., may pose a considerable threat of the spread of virus and may cause a setback to the appreciable gains made in the suppression of chain of transmission of Covid-19 cases in Delhi. Considering this, it has been decided that public celebrations and all gatherings/congregations during upcoming festivities should not be allowed in public places."Public places include parks, grounds, markets, religious places etc., the authorities noted."In case any person is found violating the aforesaid instructions, the defaulting person(s) shall be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 51 to 60 of Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws," the DDMA said.The authorities have also notified that at all airports, railway stations and inter-state bus terminals, there will be random testing of passengers coming from other states.For the past one week, the Capital has been witnessing a steady surge in the number of daily cases. According to the government data, last Wednesday (March 17), there were 536 fresh cases and since then, cases have been shooting up. On Thursday, there were 607 cases, on Friday 716, on saturday 813, on Sunday 823, on Monday 888 to reach to the three-month high on 1,101 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-celebration-for-holi-navratri-in-delhi-orders-delhi-govt-as-cases-reach-1k-101616514451498.html
23-03-2021||India||Delhi court upholds 2-year jail term to Somnath Bharti for attack on AIIMS staff||A Delhi court Tuesday upheld an order sentencing AAP MLA Somnath Bharti to two years in jail for assaulting the AIIMS security staff after which he was taken into custody and sent to prison, his lawyer said.A magistrate court had in January sentenced him to two years in prison.Special Judge Vikas Dhull partly dismissed Bharti's appeal and convicted him for the offences under sections 147 (rioting) read with 149 (unlawful assembly) of IPC and under section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The court, however, set aside his conviction under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) read with section 149 of IPC.According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down the fence of a boundary wall at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here with a JCB operator.According to Bharti, AIIMS had no authorisation to cover the 'nallah' (drain) between Gautam Nagar and Ring Road as it was public property and had to be opened for general use. During the course of the investigation, it came on record that the drain was given on lease to the AIIMS for covering and maintenance.The sessions court said in its order that the evidence of eyewitnesses to the incident was consistent to the effect that a gathering of around 200-300 people along with Bharti was present near the boundary wall of AIIMS and they were trying to break the wall and the fence by the use of JCB machine.It added that when some of the eyewitnesses resisted the bringing down of the fence, they were abused and injured due to stone-pelting by the mob."The evidence which has come on record of the eyewitnesses shows that unlawful assembly was comprised of 200-300 persons of which appellant (Bharti) was the member."It is true that only five accused persons were charged for the offence under Section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC and out of which four accused persons have been acquitted but still I do not find any illegality in the conviction of the appellant for the offence under section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC as the evidence which has come on record shows that unlawful assembly was comprising of 200-300 persons and the remaining persons could not be identified or apprehended," the judge said in his order.The judge said however that the magistrate court had committed "grave illegality" in convicting the AAP leader for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt as the evidence of the injured persons were not reliable and trustworthy.It said no explanation has been given by the prosecution as to why the injured persons were not medically examined on the date of the offence and on what basis, opinion was sought when no injuries were observed by the doctor or reported by the injured."The opinion regarding injuries has been taken by the IO (investigating officer) on May 5, 2018, i.e. almost after two years of the incident," it said.It further said the manner in which the persons had suffered injuries was not corroborative and was contradictory to each other which made their testimony doubtful and unreliable.The court said the prosecution has not brought any such medical record which made this court raise an adverse inference against prosecution that no such injuries were suffered by the injured."In the light of the evidence which has come on record, the evidence of injured persons namely...was not at all reliable and trustworthy and the MLCs could not have been relied upon."Therefore, the trial court had committed grave illegality in convicting the appellant for the offence under section 323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC when the evidence which has come on record, was not reliable and trustworthy. Accordingly, the appellant is acquitted for the offence under Section323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC," it said.In his appeal filed through advocate Mohd Irshad, Bharti had claimed the magistrate court's order was based upon a totally false and fabricated story of the prosecution which failed miserably to provide even an iota of evidence to prove his guilt.The public prosecutor, appearing for the police, said there was no illegality or infirmity in the judgment for conviction and sentencing order of the magistrate court and the judgment has been delivered based upon the reliable evidence which has come on record.In January, Bharti was granted bail to enable him to file an appeal before the high court against his conviction in the case and jail term.The magistrate court had acquitted Bharti's associates and co-accused -- Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey -- citing a lack of evidence against them.The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint from R S Rawat, Chief Security Officer, AIIMS.Bharti had told the court that police officials and other witnesses had deposed against him in order to falsely implicate him in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-upholds-2-year-jail-term-to-somnath-bharti-for-attack-on-aiims-staff-101616512680890.html

The 24-hour death toll in the state projected a sharp jump from Monday's toll as from 58 deaths of Monday, the single-day toll jumped straight to 132. The spike comes on a day the Centre alerted all states and Union territories to be on guard in view of the upcoming festivities of Holi.With Tuesday's spike, active cases in Maharashtra jumped to 2,30,641 — the highest in the country. The state's 24-hour recovery tally on Tuesday was 3,165, which is a considerable increase from Monday's recovery figure of 11,314. But the gap between daily recoveries and daily infections is not narrowing as the rate of increase in infections is more than that of the recoveries.Among the districts contributing the highest to Maharashtra's single-day surge is Nagpur which recorded 3,095 fresh cases and 33 deaths on Tuesday.

23-03-2021||India||4.85 crore people administered Covid-19 vaccines so far: Govt||As many as 4.85 crore people have received anti-Covid-19 vaccine till now, with over 32.5 lakh taking it in the last 24 hours, the government told Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the pace of inoculation in the country is not slow and 40 per cent of the total vaccines administered across the world in a single day are in India."I have to say that it is not correct that the speed of vaccination is slow. Till today morning, 4.85 crore people have taken vaccines in the country, and in the last 24 hours, as many as 32,53,095 people have taken vaccines," he said when asked about the vaccination drive being slow."Of the total vaccines administered in a single day, 40 per cent of it is administered in India," Vardhan told the House.The minister in a written reply said that the government of India is coordinating with state governments at all levels and the highest example is the prime minister's continuous dialogue with chief ministers on Covid-19 and how the vaccination drive can be sped up.The Centre is providing vaccines to all states, he said."The government of India is in touch with state governments. We have a national expert group on vaccine administration which guides us on vaccination," Vardhan said.On a question about private hospitals allegedly overcharging and not providing free services to the poor despite being given free or subsidised land, he said health is a state subject and state governments make agreements when such land is given, and they monitor the process."When required, the government of India holds meetings with different hospitals on capping hospital charges," he said, citing the example of capping the price of Covid-19 vaccines.Vaccines are being provided to all states, including Maharashtra, on the basis of a ratio of vaccines provided and used by states, the minister informed when a member asked for more vaccines for the state which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country."Adequate vaccines are available to all states and there is no shortage. Efforts are on to improve coverage of vaccination and the central government is fully committed to help states," he said.On free vaccination in private hospitals, Vardhan said while vaccine is being provided at no cost in government hospitals, ₹250 is being charged at private facilities. Those who can afford it, should go to private hospitals, he said.To a question on hesitancy among people to take vaccines, he said many are taking the shots following several awareness campaigns by the government."In this regard, 7,84,612 sessions have been held and 2,02,31,137 people above 60 years of age have been administered vaccine after the vaccination process started on March 1 (for them)," the minister said.He said Covid-19 vaccine is being provided to beneficiaries prioritised by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) at private Covid-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) at a ceiling cost of ₹250 per dose per person.This includes ₹150 towards cost of vaccine to be remitted to the government and ₹100 for administration and service charges to be retained by the private CVC, he said.Vardhan said records of earnings of private hospitals is not centrally maintained by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare."Since March 1, 2021 to March 21, 2021, a total of 62.43 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered at private CVCs. Presently, the Covid-19 vaccine administration at private CVCs has a ceiling cost of ₹250 per dose per person," he said.The Covid-19 vaccination drive in India is going on for beneficiaries prioritised by the NEGVAC and they include healthcare workers, frontline workers, persons aged 60 years and above, and those aged 45-59 years with identified comorbidities, Vardhan said.Unemployed ration card holders in any of the above mentioned prioritised groups can avail Covid-19 vaccine free of cost at government Covid-19 vaccination centres, he said."All people amongst the prioritised groups of beneficiaries recommended by NEGVAC can avail Covid-19 vaccine free of cost at government centres," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/485-crore-people-administered-covid-19-vaccines-so-far-govt-101616510782394.html
23-03-2021||India||Rajya Sabha adjourned after protests over NCT Bill||Rajya Sabha on Tuesday witnessed a series of adjournments amid protests by the Opposition over the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that seeks to give overarching powers over Delhi’s daily functioning to the Centre-appointed Lieutenant Governor. Lok Sabha passed the bill on Monday. No sooner had minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy moved the bill for consideration in the Upper House than the Opposition members began their protests, with some MPs walking down to the Well of the house. Amid protests by angry members, the house witnessed four adjournments before it was finally adjourned for the day. Soon after Reddy moved the bill, leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said it was a “dangerous bill” that sought to take away the rights of elected representatives. The bill says the “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly. Also, it makes it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action. Before the house was finally adjourned for the day, Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the government and the Opposition had reached the consensus that the house will meet at 10 am on Wednesday. He said the NCT bill would be taken up after a discussion on the Finance Bill on March 24, and there would be no Zero Hour, Question Hour or lunch break.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-adjourned-after-protests-over-nct-bill-101616510816231.html

The education minister said the decision to close down all educational institutions and student hostels was taken in view of the outbreak of the second wave of infections across the country. “Except medical colleges, all government and private schools, colleges and universities will remain closed from Wednesday till further orders,” Sabita said, adding that online classes, however, would continue. She said there had been reports of a large number of Covid-19 cases from various educational institutions across the state.

All movements, including that of trains, flights, buses, were prohibited. Only essential services were allowed. As one year of the imposition of the lockdown approaches, several states are imposing local lockdowns and border restrictions to make sure cases are not imported from areas that are particularly reporting a massive outbreak.However, there is not likely to be another national-level lockdown, the Centre has made it clear as the focus is on tracking new infections, not shutting down establishments. In its latest guideline for the month of April, the ministry of home affairs said all activities have been permitted outside containment zones. These activities include movement by passenger trains; air travel; metro trains; schools; higher educational institutions; hotels and restaurants; shopping malls, multiplexes and entertainment parks; yoga centres and gymnasiums; exhibitions, assemblies and congregations, etc.Focus on Covid-19 test-track-treat, may impose district-level lockdown: CentreWhile the SOPs (Standard operating procedure) for each of these activities will have to be followed, there will be no restrictions on the interstate and intrastate movement of persons and goods, the Centre said. By restrictions, it meant separate permission, approval, e-permit, while most states are making Covid-19 tests mandatory for people coming from other states.Lockdown ensures containment of the infection for just a specific period of time, but tracking, testing should be the focus at this moment, the Centre has been emphasising, after the process of unlocking began in 2020.However, lockdown can be an option at district/sub-district and city/ward level, with a view to containing the spread of the infection, based on the assessment of the situation, the Centre said.On being asked about what the Centre is thinking on lockdown given the sudden spurt in infections, Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday said, "Centre is in constant touch with the states which are reporting a surge in Covid-19 infections. We are hopeful that the situation will improve in the coming days."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-2nd-peak-as-daily-cases-rise-what-centre-says-on-lockdown-101616503241947.html

23-03-2021||India||Gold smuggling case: ED moves Kerala HC, seeks quashing of FIR against officials||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday moved the Kerala High Court seeking to quash the FIR registered against its officials by Kerala police for allegedly forcing Swapna Suresh, key accused in the gold smuggling case, to give statements against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.In its plea, the ED alleged the FIR was registered against its unnamed officials with "ulterior motive of derailing the statutory investigation" under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) into a large economic offence of smuggling of huge quantities of gold.In its prayer, the ED submitted that the FIR filed be quashed or the investigation be transferred from the state police to the CBI to ensure an impartial investigation.The central agency also wanted the court to stay all further proceedings pursuant to the FIR against ED officials and direct no coercive action against the officers of the Enforcement Directorate "who are performing their official duties" under the PMLA 2002 pending disposal of the petition.The impugned FIR has been registered with an oblique motive to put pressure on the Investigating Officers,besides also "ensure that trial is not conducted in a fair and impartial manner because certain highly placed persons are involved in this case," the ED submitted. It also submitted that the preliminary inquiry allegedly conducted by the state police was clearly a farce.The Crime Branch registered the case on March17 on the basis of a report filed by the Crime Branch team which was probing the leak of a voice clip, purportedly belonging to Suresh.According to the FIR, the ED officials, probing the gold smuggling case while questioning an accused named Swapna Prabha Suresh on August 12 and 13, 2020, have forced her to give false statements against the state chief minister in order to make fake evidence.The Crime Branch case has been registered under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 192 (fabricating false evidence), 195-A (threatening any person to give false evidence), among others, of the Indian Penal Code.Suresh, a former employee of the UAE consulate here, is the prime accused in the case relating to the smuggling of 30 kg of gold worth ₹14.82 crore in a diplomatic baggage and now under judicial custody since her arrest.In a voice clip purported to be that of Suresh circulated a few months ago, it was alleged that some ED officials had threatened her while she was being interrogated at the agency office in Kochi in August last year to give statements against Vijayan and some ministers.Later, two women civil police officers, who had been with Suresh when she was interrogated by the ED, had also reportedly claimed they had heard the ED officials forcing her to name Vijayan.Besides the ED, the Customs and the National Investigation Agency are also probing the smuggling of gold through the diplomatic channel.Vijayan has been accusing the Central agencies of targeting his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-ed-moves-kerala-hc-seeks-quashing-of-fir-against-officials-101616501326869.html

What's happening in the state is not 'vikas' (development), it is 'vasuli' (extortion)."Dubbing the Maharashtra dispensation as "the most confused government", Prasad said the ruling coalition partners themselves don't know what is happening in the state and who is running the show.Prasad said the Maharashtra government led by Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray has lost the right to govern the state as "it is a government of vasuli (extortion), by vasuli and for vasuli."Taking on NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, Prasad said the political credibility of the senior leader has taken a hit and that he was forced to speak a patent falsehood for defending his party colleague and state home minister Deshmukh.Prasad further said Pawar's credibility can be restored only if he ensures resignation of Deshmukh.Days after he was shunted out, former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh wrote a letter to Thackeray alleging that the state home minister had asked Sachin Waze, currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and other police officers to collect ₹100 crore monthly, including ₹50 crore to ₹60 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Deshmukh had denied these allegations.The NIA is probing Waze's alleged role in placing an explosives-laden SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence on February 25.The SUV was in possession of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was found dead at a creek near Mumbai. The case related to the death of Hiran was also handed over to the NIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-is-of-extortion-by-extortion-and-for-extortion-rs-prasad-101616501433460.html

As the number of fresh infections in the country is skyrocketing and local restrictions are coming back, the Centre in its new directive made it clear that such restrictions are okay to be imposed at district/ sub-district and city/ ward level, ruling out statewide lockdown at this situation. It also said there will be no bar on the inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods. The guideline will remain effective till April 30, it said."There shall be no restriction on inter-State and intra-State movement of persons and goods including those for cross land-border trade under Treaties with neighbouring countries. No separate permission/ approval/ e-permit will be required for such movements," it said.The new rules are to address the sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the order said.All those above 45 years will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine from April 1Most of the new orders have been derived from the recent discussion held between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the heads of the states and the Union territories. Apart from increasing the proportion of RT-PCR tests to the prescribed 70 per cent, states will have to bring back their focus on tracking cases, isolating and treating them while demarcating containment zones like they did last year, it said. "Local district, police and municipal authorities shall be responsible to ensure that the prescribed Containment measures are strictly followed and State/ UT Governments shall ensure the accountability of the officers concerned in this regard," the new order said.With several districts, cities going under fresh lockdown in the wake of what is being considered as the second wave of Covid-19, the Centre said states and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may impose local restrictions, at district/ sub-district and city/ ward level, with a view to containing the spread of Covid-19.On vaccination, the Centre said that the pace is uneven across different states and UTs and the slow pace in some states is a matter of concern.

Statistical analysis of meteorological data on the portal is still under development.CDSP also offers climatological data for each station. For example, for Safdarjung station, the mean maximum temperature from 1981 to 2010 has been 35.3 degrees C (°C) and the highest temperature recorded in March at the station was 40.6°C on March 31, 1945. The mean wet bulb temperature recorded in June at 5.30pm is 25.4°C ; 27°C in July and 26.9°C in August—the three monsoon months. Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature, according to a paper in Science Direct.Meanwhile, this year, IMD’s theme for World Meteorological Day was “Oceans, Our Climate and Weather’ with scientists highlighting the ocean’s impact on weather and climate, especially during the El-Nino and La-Nina phases. The ocean is also a major driver of the global economy, carrying more than 90% of world trade and sustaining 40% of humanity that lives within 100 km of the coast.

So, you can imagine the impact of oceans on meteorology. The sea surface temperatures are rising more rapidly than atmospheric temperature. Naturally, oxygen levels are depleting, and oceans are becoming acidic. El Nino Southern Oscillation episodes, for example, have a profound impact on weather conditions in US, India and many parts of the world,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. In India, for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with a strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-launches-portal-to-aid-climate-change-mitigation-in-india-101616498935980.html

Soldiers are awarded medals for gallantry, distinguished service and several key landmarks in their military careers. The army has signed a contract for 17 different types of medals. “Integrated Headquarters of Ministry of Defence (Army) has concluded a contract for procurement of a total of 17.27 lakh Service Medals of 17 different types,” the army wrote on Twitter. The move has resolved a decade-old problem. The procurement has enabled the army to meet all outstanding demands of service medals of soldiers who have served and are serving the force, the army said. Also Read | Myanmar: Army uproots ethnic villagers amid anti-coup protestsFor almost 10 years, soldiers were buying medals from the market as the army was grappling with a short supply. While there was no shortage of medals awarded to soldiers for gallantry, the defence ministry’s department of medals failed to issue the other variety of medals for almost a decade, officials familiar with the development said. The difference between original and duplicate medals is that the latter don’t have the names of soldiers and their service number engraved on them. Most soldiers posted in Delhi were sourcing medals from markets in Delhi Cantonment. In 2016-17, the medals department was saddled with a backlog of more than 1.4 million medals of different types. Soldiers are automatically entitled to a variety of medals after completing a certain number of years in service, serving in difficult areas or taking part in different operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-signs-contract-for-1-7-mn-medals-soldiers-won-t-have-to-buy-duplicate-ones-101616498876405.html

23-03-2021||India||Covid vaccine above 45: Which vaccine should you take? What should be the gap between doses?||As the vaccination drive will be open for all above the age of 45 years from April 1, India is set to cross a major milestone in its fight against Covid-19, which is completing a year in March, 2021.Here is all you need to know about vaccination above 45.Who are eligible?Everyone above the age of 45 years is now eligible for vaccination. This includes those with co-morbidities and those who do not have any health issues.Is there no need for a medical certificate regarding co-morbidities?As vaccination is open for all above 45 years, there is no need for medical certificates from April 1. The government earlier published a list of comorbidities which included heart issues, hypertension, diabetes, kidney, liver issues, leukaemia among many other conditions.Why did the government specify health conditions in the second phase only to do away with it now?The second phase of vaccination commenced on March 1. Senior citizens and people with comorbidities between the age of 45 and 59 were considered priority groups in this phase. Now as the vaccination has gained pace, based on scientific advice, the government is opening the drive a little more to accommodate more beneficiaries. The government started the vaccination drive with the most vulnerable groups, healthcare workers and frontline workers. Then it moved to senior citizens and people with co-morbidities, as they are at a greater risk of contracting the infection than young people, because of their age and health conditions, respectively.Covaxin or Covishield: Which vaccine to takeThe Centre has emphasised that both the vaccines have proved to be successful and has advised to go for any vaccine.Four weeks or eight weeks: What should be the gap between the doses?The two doses of a vaccine were being administered 28 days apart so far. But now the expert group has reviewed recent scientific evidence and has advised widening the gap to six to eight weeks for Covishield, the vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharma company AstraZeneca and manufactured in India by Pune's Serum Institute of India.There has been no new instruction for Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.Doctors in the health centre, hospitals where you will get your first dose will advise you regarding the timing of the second dose.How much will the vaccine cost?At government facilities, the vaccination will be free while private facilities can charge a maximum of ₹250 for a dose.Will you still have to register on Co-Win now that the vaccination is being made open?Yes. Without registration on Co-Win, there will be no vaccination as the government is maintaining every vaccination data through this interface.Will this move help address vaccine wastage? How?At present, vaccine wastage is a concern for India, as many states are reporting over 10 per cent vaccine wastage. The issue was raised in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with the heads of the states and Union territories. Vaccines get wasted when the vial is opened but the beneficiary does not turn up. If there are enough beneficiaries, then this problem might be mitigated. Allowing more people for vaccination is one step to ensure that there are more beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-above-45-which-vaccine-should-you-take-what-should-be-the-gap-101616497689150.html

Addressing the Lok Sabha, Vardhan said, “Vaccine doses administered in India in a single day amount to 30-40% of the doses given across the world during the same time period.”Citing Monday’s vaccination data, Vardhan said that 32,53,095 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the last 24 hours. The health minister also informed the lower house of Parliament that more than 2.2 crore beneficiaries above the age of 60 were inoculated in a short period of time since the start of the second phase in March.#LargestVaccineDrive #Unite2FightCoronaभारत में सबसे तेज़ गति से कोरोना के खिलाफ टीकाकरण किया जा रहा है। बाकी देशों में जितनी वैक्सीन रोज़ाना मिलकर लगाई जा रही है, उसकी 30% से 40% वैक्सीन रोज़ाना सिर्फ भारत में लगाई जा रही है।- @drharshvardhan @PMOIndia @AshwiniKChoubey pic.twitter.com/CuEQCIDrYGThe Centre launched the first phase of the nationwide vaccination drive from January 16, where all healthcare and frontline workers were inoculated against the disease. Under the second phase, which started from March 1, doses are being administered to people above the age of 60 and those between 45-59 with specific co-morbidities. According to the health ministry’s data at 7am, around 4,06,31,153 beneficiaries have been administered the first dose while 78,63,441 have received both doses. Five states - Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal - have vaccinated the highest number of beneficiaries in the country, the data showed.Also Read| All those above 45 years will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine from April 1India on Tuesday recorded 40,715 new Covid-19 disease cases and 199 related fatalities in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload and death toll to over 1.168 crores and 160,166 respectively. The active cases have climbed to 345,377 while 1,11,81,253 people have recovered till now.With the daily cases in the country spiking since February, several states requested the Centre to remove or reduce the age limit for getting vaccine doses so that more citizens can be inoculated as quickly as possible. Keeping this in mind, Union minister Prakash Javadekar announced on Tuesday that from April 1, all those above the age of 45- with or without co-morbidities - will be allowed to take the vaccine. The decision was taken on the basis of scientific advice, Javadekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccinating-rate-highest-in-the-world-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-101616496396830.html
23-03-2021||India||Almost 300% rise in cyber attacks in India in 2020, govt tells Parliament||Cyber attacks amid the Covid-19 pandemic rose by almost 300% last year in the country to reach 1,158,208 compared to 394,499 in 2019, the Union home ministry told Parliament on Tuesday, citing the data from Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).The ministry did not elaborate on the attacks or the profile of attackers. But cyber experts said the spike could be linked to an increase in online activity last year particularly during the lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread. The experts blamed a lack of cybersecurity awareness for phishing and malware attacks.“CERT-In receives inputs from its situational awareness systems and threat intelligence sources about malware infections in networks of entities across sectors. Whenever any incident comes to notice of CERT-In, it issues alerts and advisories to the entities concerned and sectoral CERTs for remedial measures,” Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy told Parliament. He was responding to a query on cyber attacks on India’s power supply and on a company supplying Covid-19 vaccines.Also Read | After power sector, transport ministry gets alert about attempted cyberattackEarlier this month, American cyber intelligence company Recorded Future said it uncovered a suspected China-linked cyber operation that was focused on India’s electricity grid and other critical infrastructure. While the company did not link a wide power outage in Mumbai to the operation, which it titled RedEcho, it did not rule out a link. Recorded Future said RedEcho deployed malware known as ShadowPad, which has been previously linked to Chinese cyber soldiers.Reddy said the government has issued guidelines to chief information security officers regarding their key roles and responsibilities for securing applications/infrastructure and compliance. “All the government websites and applications are audited with respect to cybersecurity prior to their hosting. The auditing of the websites and applications are conducted on a regular basis after hosting also. [The] government has empanelled security auditing organisations to support and audit [the] implementation of information security best practices.”Reddy said the government has formulated a Cyber Crisis Management Plan for countering cyber attacks for implementation by all ministries/ departments of the central government, state governments, and their organisations.He added the government is operating the Cyber Swachhta Kendra (Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre). “The centre is providing detection of malicious programmes and free tools to remove the same.” Reddy said the government has set up the National Cyber Coordination Centre to generate necessary situational awareness of existing and potential cybersecurity threats.Pavan Duggal, a cyber law expert said, there are mainly two reasons for the increase in cyber-attacks last year. “...first, the fear and panic due to Covid-19, which cyber-criminals were able to weaponize to their benefit. Secondly, the work-from-home ensured that cyber security did not get the kind of attention it was supposed to get. It was far easier to breach the systems at home than at the workplace. But, keeping numbers aside, this can be called the golden age of cyber-crimes. The cyber breaches will be a new normal now with both state and non-state actors involved.”HT on Monday reported the Union transport ministry on Sunday received an alert from the Cert-IN regarding “targeted intrusion activities” directed towards the country’s transport sector with “possible malicious intentions”. This came after a slew of cybersecurity attacks on the Indian government’s domains over the past few months. On February 25, HT reported about new phishing emails using compromised government accounts to target groups of officials, attempting to lure them into sharing their passwords on a page that mirrored the government’s official mail server sign-on website.On February 21, HT also reported that the devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through similar attacks carried out by government domain email addresses.Last year, the National Highways Authority of India reported a cyberattack on its email server and said prompt action resulted in no data loss. It shut down its server then as a precaution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/almost-300-rise-in-cyber-attacks-in-india-in-2020-govt-tells-parliament-101616496416988.html

23-03-2021||India||PM Modi's visit to Bangladesh to bolster bilateral ties, says report||The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Dhaka on the eve of Bangladesh's 50th Independence Day on 26 March as the 'honoured guest' will not only be a diplomatic tour but also a bridge of the cultural connect of the two countries.PM Modi is slated to travel to Bangladesh on March 25-26 for the second time since 2015, his first-ever foreign tour after the Covid-19 pandemic.PM Modi's visit to Dhaka will be in connection with three epochal events - Mujib Borsho (birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman); 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Bangladesh and India; and 50 years of Bangladesh liberation war, reported eureporter.Bangladesh-India relations are multifaceted in nature and rooted in a shared history, geographical proximity and commonality in their cultures. The emotional bonds stemming from the contribution of India towards the liberation of Bangladesh remain a dominant factor in the country's political, social and cultural web.Louis Auge, in an article in eureporter, states, "Economically and commercially, the two countries are becoming increasingly closer. Besides, the dependence of Bangladesh on the common river waters remains an ever-present reminder of the umbilical links between the two countries."Economic relations between these two countries have over the last couple of years become multifaceted, embracing trade transactions, joint ventures, transit facilities and transport development.Bangladesh is the recipient of India's largest-ever financial assistance. Prime Minister Modi, during his last visit to Dhaka (June 6-7, 2015), had announced that India would provide Bangladesh a Line of Credit of $2 billion. The credit carries the lowest ever one per cent interest rate with a repayment period of 20 years and a five-year grace period.These credit lines are used by Bangladesh to complete its 14 infrastructure and transport projects. Out of these 11 projects are in the railways' sector for the supply of locomotives, tank wagons, flat wagons and brake wagons to Bangladesh, as per eureporter.The private sector initiative comes in parallel to the Indian government's effort to bolster relations with Bangladesh. 38 Indian investments had been registered with the Board of Investments (BoI) in Bangladesh for about $183 million in the preceding years, writes Auge.Major Indian companies such as Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, Marico, Godrej, Venky's Hatcheries, Parle Products, Forbes and Marshall have invested in Bangladesh in the recent past. At the Bangladesh Investment and Policy Summit held in Dhaka in 2016, two big industrial groups of India, Reliance and Adani, committed to making huge investments in Bangladesh to the tune of $1,100 crores.Moreover, Dhaka's average economic growth rate has been over 7.0 per cent for the last couple of years, thereby attracting Indian investment.The middle class is rising steadily and creating demand for consumer goods and services. The country has also graduated as a developing nation.Further, the recent virtual summit between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and PM Modi while inaugurating 'Maitri Setu' (Friendship Bridge) on March 9, has shifted the focus on regional connectivity.'Regional connectivity is not only strengthening friendship between Bangladesh and India but also proving to be a strong link of business', Hasina had remarked. PM Modi also expressed the view that connectivity between Bangladesh and India will prove to be very important for the north-east region of India and Bangladesh trade as well.Auge also focussed upon security aspects and said that Bangladesh-India relations have never been better. Bangladesh has already addressed major issues that remained matters of concern from India's security point of view for a long period. Bangladesh has handed over to India a large number of North-East Indian insurgents who had been camping and executing anti-India operations from Bangladeshi soil. Bangladesh government did this even though there was no extradition treaty between the two sides. Anup Chetia, a major United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) insurgent and a constant headache for the Indian security establishment, has also been handed over to India by the country.Bangladeshi security forces have seized huge stockpiles of explosive materials, broken up numerous camps and apprehended a number of Indian insurgents.Prime Minister Hasina has delivered on all of India's concerns ranging from security to connectivity. India on its part has done its best to reciprocate by giving priority to supply Covid 19 vaccine to Bangladesh, writes Auge.Many of the long outstanding problems that had existed since the partition of India in 1947 have been resolved. The most important of these being strengthening connectivity between the two countries through resuming the long suspended rail, road and waterway links.The exchange of enclaves and the long-standing border disputes were also solved and the Indian Parliament showed a rare gesture of good-will when both houses of the Indian Parliament unanimously voted to ratify the Mujib-Indira accord of 1974 agreeing to exchange adversely located enclaves and demark the boundaries, reported eureporter.Meanwhile, Teesta river water sharing continues to remain a nagging problem. PM Modi has indicated that the problem will be resolved during this tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-visit-to-bangladesh-to-bolster-bilateral-ties-says-report-101616493610354.html
23-03-2021||India||Goa CM rules out making Covid test mandatory on arrival||Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday ruled out making Covid-19 testing mandatory for those entering the state saying that such a move could lead to shuttering to economic activity which the state couldn’t afford. On Monday, state Health Minister Vishwajit Rane told the media that he had ‘sent a file’ to the Chief Minister seeking that all arrivals into the state should either bring a negative certificate on arrival or be tested upon arrival in view of the increasing cases. “Yesterday there were 84 cases, prior to that there were 100. We should all take care including tourists coming to the state. We cannot once again close all economic activity. We have ramped up testing and am requesting all to maintain social distancing and use masks,” Sawant said. “I am in constant touch with the Health Minister. For now there is no decision to be taken (regarding testing on arrival) except that we will test on a bigger scale. Those who have signs and symptoms should get themselves tested and those who are eligible should get vaccinated,” Sawant said. “There are several neighbouring states such as Kerala, Maharashtra Karmnataka who have made it mandatory for people from Goa flying into those states to carry Covid-19 negative certificates, without which they don’t allow them entry into the states,” Rane had said on Monday.“We need to make Covid-19 negative certificates mandatory for people from other states, which already have such restrictions in place. The trouble has started from these states. They have put us in trouble. I am personally in favour of testing at the airport and on arrival. The proposal will be put before the Chief Minister,” Rane said.Goa has witnessed an uptick in cases and a rise in the number of active cases that now stand at 1017. The number of active cases was less than 700 a few weeks ago. The state’s tourism industry had expressed apprehensions that any restriction on arrival to the state would further dampen the already weak enthusiasm for travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-rules-out-making-covid-test-mandatory-on-arrival-101616494555018.html
23-03-2021||India||India delivers second batch of heavy equipment to Chabahar port||India has delivered the second consignment of heavy equipment, including two 100-tonne mobile cranes, to Iran’s Chabahar port, reflecting New Delhi’s commitment to the strategic connectivity and transit initiative. The cranes and other loading equipment reached the port on the Gulf of Oman on Sunday, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. India had delivered the first consignment of heavy equipment, including two 140-tonne mobile harbour cranes, in January. “Continuing with our commitment to develop Chabahar Port, second shipment of equipment reaches Shahid Behesti Terminal,” minister of state for ports and shipping Mansukh Mandaviya said in a tweet. The new loading equipment is worth $7.5 million, said Behrouz Aghaei, director general of the ports and maritime department of Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. This is part of the Indian side’s commitment to make a total investment of $85 million in the Iranian port under a long-term contract, he added. Farhad Montaser Kouhsari, the deputy head of Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization, recently told the Iranian media that the new cranes supplied by the Indian side will help increase the annual loading and unloading rate at Chabahar to 20 million tonnes. More heavy equipment from the Indian side is expected in the coming months, Kouhsari said. Afghanistan, Iran and India signed a tripartite agreement on developing Chabahar port and setting up a trilateral transport and transit corridor in 2016. India then set up India Ports Global Limited to operate the Shahid Behesti terminal at Chabahar. The mobile harbour cranes provided in January are part of a contract for six such cranes, worth more than $25 million, with the Italian firm Italgru S.r.l. Last year, India cancelled a $30-million contract with Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries for heavy cranes because of delays by the Chinese company in supplying the equipment ordered in 2017. India recently proposed that Chabahar port be included in the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-km multi-mode route spanning 13 countries. Despite Chabahar port being granted a waiver from US sanctions on Iran, India has faced problems in acquiring heavy equipment from foreign countries, mainly because of the reluctance of foreign banks to open letters of credit (LoCs) for a project within Iran. Since India Ports Global Limited began operations in December 2018, the port has handled 123 vessels, 13,752 containers and 1.8 million tonnes of cargo. There has been an increase in average monthly calls by merchant vessels, and 110,000 tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been shipped to Afghanistan via Chabahar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-delivers-second-batch-of-heavy-equipment-to-chabahar-port-101616493174886.html
23-03-2021||India||6,520 forest fires scorch Chhattisgarh in last 37 days||Chhattisgarh recorded a total 6,520 forest fire incidents from February 15 to March 22, which is highest in forest fire season in last three years, the forest department said Tuesday. Most of these fire incidents have been in Maoist affected districts of the state where the reach of the forest department is less. Forest department officials claimed that till now total 13.51 square kilometers of forest has been affected in the bush fires which suggest that most of the fire incidents were small and were doused on time. Fire incidents between February 15 and June 15 are recorded in the forest fire season every year. “Around 20 per cent of total fire incidents were reported in Bijapur district and Udanti Sitanadi Forest Reserve in Gariyaband district. Both are Maoist affected districts of the state hence the reach of the forest department is less in comparison to other areas. Secondly, this year the season is dry compared to previous years and no rainfall was recorded, hence the fire incidents increased,” said Rakesh Chaturvedi, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF). In Bijapur district total 705 fires were reported till Monday while in Udanti Sitanadi Tiger Reserve 599 incidents of fire were recorded. The official further claimed that the movement of people was less in 2020 due to the lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and hence, a lesser number of fires - 4713 - were reported. In 2019, a total of 17,835 fire incidents were reported in the state and around 138 square kilometers of area was affected. “In 2021, most of these recorded fire incidents, till now, were minor and were contained by the department within an hour. The satellite system which alerts us for any fire incident in the jungle is very sensitive hence it alerts us even for small fire incidents. The local forest officials were alerted in most cases and the fires were contained within a few hours,” said OP Yadav, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Protection). Activists believe that most of these fires were reported in protected areas which indicates that the poachers and hunters are active in these areas. “Hunters burn forest to push the wild animal in a corner of a jungle so that they can kill or trap them. The figures suggest that the forest department should be more active in the jungle since the forest fire season continues till June,” said Amlendu Mishra, member of the State Wildlife Advisory Board. Some activists also alleged that the forest department was not prepared to contain fire incidents in the state. “The way fire incidents are reported in the state, it is clear that the department was not prepared and has not provided resources at village-level to contain incidents. These incidents also suggest that the management and protection of forests is possible only with the participation of the community and village. That is why under Community Forest Resources (CFR), the forest resources can be protected and managed only by handing over forest resources to the gram sabhas and empowering them,” said Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan. Sundeip Shrivasatva, an environmental activist, said that the government should focus on better forest management to contain fire incidents in the state. “Beat guards can play an important role. The forest department should clear dry leaves more effectively and ensure availability of water to douse fires,” said Shrivastava. “Forest fire destroys not only big trees but also herbs, insects, smaller vertebrates and their eggs. Also the grasslands are destroyed which in turn affects herbivorous animals. It hits the entire forest ecosystem. Further this is the time for forest produce collection particularly mahua. Forest department along with public support can stop forest fires,” Mishra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6520-forest-fires-scorch-chhattisgarh-in-last-37-days-101616492877203.html
23-03-2021||India||All those above 45 years will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccine from April 1||In a major move, the Union Cabinet on Tuesday decided to open the vaccination drive for everyone above the age of 45 years starting from April 1. Union minister Prakash Javadekar announced that there will be no need for medical certificates as evidence of co-morbidity conditions, as the government had stipulated earlier for the second phase of vaccination.The decision has been taken based on scientific advice, the minister said adding that the gap between Covishield doses has also been extended up to eight weeks, from its earlier four weeks, as this is more effective.Widen gap in Covishield jabs to 6-8 weeks: CentreIndia's vaccination drive entered the second phase from March 1 as senior citizens and people above the age of 45 years with co-morbidities were made eligible to receive the vaccine shots. For people between the age group of 45 and 59, medical certificates in proof of their health conditions were mandatory. But as the Centre is aiming to speed up the vaccination drive in the face of an alarming rise in the number of daily Covid-19 infections, now anyone above the age of 45 can get vaccinated, the Cabinet decided on Tuesday.In the past few weeks, several states have urged the Centre to open vaccination for all. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday requested the Centre to include people younger than 60 years of age under the vaccination drive."Vaccination is going on well and at a fast pace. Around 4.85 crore people have already got vaccinated. Many of them have got their second doses too. 32.5 lakh doses were administered yesterday in 24 hours. In February, our daily average was 3.77 lakh, it surpassed 15 lakh in March," the minister said."Would urge everyone above 45 years to get themselves registered and inoculated," the minister said adding that adequate doses of vaccines are available at present in India. "We are proud that both of India's vaccines are successful. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself took Covaxin. So you can take any vaccine. And take a doctor's advice regarding the gap between the two doses," Javadekar said.The vaccine is the only shield against Covid-19, the minister said, adding, "We will have to continue using masks for another one year and a half. Similarly, we will have to wash hands, maintain social distancing. Vaccination is the only shield."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-for-all-those-above-45-years-from-april-1-cabinet-clears-proposal-101616492383386.html

A week ago, there were 73 active cases in the district while in February, there were only 55 active cases.The Banaras Hindu University on Tuesday suspended all offline classes until further notice, keeping in view the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the hostels and in the BHU hospital - Sir Sundarlal Hospital.After Diwali, a surge in the number of Covid-19 infections was witnessed across the country which subsided in November, December and January.

March 23 is observed as 'Shaheed Diwas' to pay tribute to the trio who were hanged for killing British police officer J P Saunders. The trio wanted to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai.Earlier on December 19, the farmers organised a 'turban langar' at the Singhu border. The initiative at the Delhi-Haryana border was conducted by a group of volunteers from Punjab.In February this year, the farmers again marked the 'Pagdi Sambhal Divas' at the Delhi borders. Donning traditional turbans and singing songs of the peasant movement, the farmers protested against the three agri laws.Called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the day-long event was inspired by the "Pagdi Sambhal Lehar" of 1906.Farmers have been protesting in and around the national capital since November 26 against the three farm laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Enacted in September last year, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-organise-pagdi-langar-at-ghazipur-border-on-shaheed-diwas-101616489114683.html

Singh said that the process needs to be expedited, pointing that experts have found the existing Covishield vaccine to be equally effective against the UK variant - B.1.1.7. “It was essential to vaccinate more and more people to break the chain of transmission,” he said, according to a statement released by his office.According to the statement, 81% of the latest 401 samples sent by the state for genome sequencing were positive for the new UK Covid variant.Also read | India sees slight dip in daily Covid-19 cases at 40,715, tally over 11.68 mnThe chief minister also urged people to strictly follow all Covid protocols, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.

The pilots said that they faced the brunt of unjust pay cuts of around 58% from April 2020 and 55% from October 2020. They asked the airline to pay them their full salary as they have been the first and constant ones to serve the nation throughout the pandemic when they operated repatriation flights during the peak of Covid-19.“By taking away the fixed pay, which is the industry norm, pilots infected with this deadly virus could not operate flights and earn their rightful livelihood similar to other pilots. It is unfair to deny these pilots their monthly flying allowance despite them being available to the company and remaining unutilised due to varied reasons lain alongside the pandemic,” ICPA said.Also Read | Address concerns on bookings, refunds: Country’s largest tourism body to Air IndiaThe pilots also questioned the airline on amending international layover allowances to government rates instead of referring to the aviation industry standards for allowances. A member pilot said,“The international layover allowance should be paid at par with industry-standard or rather, the Ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) should treat us at par with other public sector undertakings while considering any pay cut from March 2020.”The ICPA said that while the Indian aviation industry is set on the road to recovery, and all private airlines have scaled back the severity measures by a vast margin, denying wages and allowances to the pilots of Air India, Air India Express and Alliance Air defies a rational justification.The letter written to Puri read, “...We have long lost hope that our management will ever stand by us or fulfil its responsibilities to Air India and its pilots. We request you to kindly intervene to restore our rightful wages and allowances in line with current Industry practices and standards..”Air India did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-airbus-pilots-body-writes-to-minister-puri-for-pay-as-per-industry-standards-101616482794198.html
23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court waives compound, penal interests on loans during moratorium||The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered banks against charging borrowers any penal interest or compound interest (interest on interest) on loans during the moratorium on repayment of loans from March to August 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. It rejected a request by individuals and traders’ associations for waiver of complete interest during the moratorium. The court refused to extend the moratorium or tinker with the resolution mechanism proposed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to waive compound interest on six categories of loans up to ₹ 2 crore.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy, and MR Shah issued the order on a clutch of petitions filed by corporate bodies, business associations, and individuals demanding extension of moratorium beyond August.At the instance of the court, the Centre agreed to waive compound interest on loans for six categories. The business associations and corporate bodies had demanded the extension of this benefit to borrowers with loans of above ₹2 crore.Also Read | Government planning crackdown on apps offering cash loans onlineThe bench said courts are not experts and such decisions lie in the realm of economic policy in which interference should be rarely made.It added the Covid-19 pandemic affected even the government. The bench said the Centre and RBI still came out with schemes and packages to reduce stress on businesses and granting any further relief would have consequences on the economy.The court clarified any penal interest or compound interest charged by banks for non-payment of any loan amount during moratorium shall be refundable. And if the bank is not in a position to refund, the same shall be adjusted in the loan amount, it added.The bench said decisions on economic policy matters should be left to the government and courts should not interfere even if a second view is possible.During the hearing of these cases, the Centre and RBI argued that compound interest on loans of up to ₹two crore was waived keeping in mind fiscal constraints and the viability of banks. Any order to further extend the benefit to other borrowers will make banks inviable, which an economy like India will be unable to sustain, the Centre and RBI argued.Some petitioners questioned the ceiling limit of ₹2 crore for waiving compound interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-waives-compound-penal-interests-on-loans-during-moratorium-101616482074879.html

The order came on a transfer plea moved by the Centre to club all these petitions filed in various high courts.The top court issued notices to all petitioners, who have filed pleas in Punjab and Haryana High Court, Madhya Pradesh High Court and Allahabad High Court, in February on the plea jointly filed by the ministry of information and broadcasting, electronics and technology and the ministry of law and justice.Tuesday’s order was passed by a bench of justice DY Chandrachud, justice MR Shah and justice Sanjiv Khanna. The top court took up the transfer petition along with public interest litigations filed by NGO Justice for Rights Foundation and another by lawyer Shashank Shekhar Jha, in which they have demanded has that a pre-screening committee be set up before the content on OTT platforms is streamed online.The government has currently identified 40 OTT platforms that live stream content.The ruling comes days after the government notified a set of regulations for OTT platforms, which according to the Supreme Court lacked teeth. In a separate proceeding, the court had said that the regulations lack provisions for enforcement following which the Centre agreed to revise the rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-all-petitions-on-regulation-of-content-on-ott-platforms-pending-in-high-courts-101616481382588.html
23-03-2021||India||Explained: Ken-Betwa river interlinking project and environmental concerns||Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat signed a tripartite agreement with the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday on the occasion of World Water Day to start the work on India’s first major river interlinking project that will connect the Ken and the Betwa Rivers. The Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) was signed almost 18 years after the idea of the project was conceived owing to disagreement between the two states over sharing of water. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the project will help in irrigating at least 1 million hectares of land and people of nine districts of the state will benefit from it.What is the Ken-Betwa interlinking project?The project is part of the National Perspective Plan aimed at interlinking rivers of the country. According to the project report, 2,800 million cubic metres (MCM) of water from the Ken River basin will be diverted to the water-deficient Betwa basin through a 73.8-meter-high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhattarpur district. Both of the rivers are rain-fed and are tributaries of the Yamuna. The project, which is estimated to take eight years to complete, has an estimated cost of ₹35,111.24 crore.Read more: Climate change likely to affect Maharashtra’s agricultural productivity: StudyWhat is the history of the Ken-Betwa interlinking project?The project was conceptualised in the 1980s but the water-sharing agreement could not be reached between the two states. The work on the project was originally slated to begin in 2015 but only got a fresh push last year with the government making a revised deal with the two states.What are the environmental concerns?Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed panel, have raised doubts about the project. Environmental activists say that the project will be very harmful to the Panna Tiger reserve, which is located in Madhya Pradesh and is home to more than 52 tigers and endangered vulture species like the white-rumped vulture. Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People said that the decision to interlink the rivers was “very unfortunate” and cited a report of the forest advisory committee which said that an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project which will adversely affect the rain in the already dry Bundelkhand region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-ken-betwa-river-interlinking-project-and-environmental-concerns-101616479775802.html
23-03-2021||India||About 300 sequenced Covid-19 samples found to be of UK, SA, Brazilian variants||At least 284 samples that tested positive for Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, across the country have been found to be of the UK variant, officials aware of the matter said. Another 11 turned out to be of the South African and one of the Brazilian variants. All three contain the N501Y mutation that makes them more transmissible. The South African and Brazilian variants also carry the E484K mutation that helps them evade some of the immune responses generated by a previous infection or through vaccination. A report in the British Medical Journal said the UK variant may increase the risk of mortality from 2.5 deaths per 1,000 detected cases to 4.1.The Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up to conduct genomic surveillance of the strains of the virus when reports about the UK variant emerged in January. The government announced the consortium will sequence 5% of all the positive cases in the country.Also Read | Centre wants gap in Covishield jabs widened to 4-8 weeks: All you need to knowThe consortium received 19,092 RT-PCR positive samples for sequencing as of March 10 with the highest from Kerala (5,191), followed by Maharashtra (2,826), and Rajasthan (1,963). Delhi submitted 1,232 samples to the consortium, which is almost 14% of the total cases reported between January 22 and March 10.The sequencing of 4,869 samples was completed by March 10, the government told Parliament.INSACOG has detected E484K mutations in some of the samples collected from Maharashtra.Rakesh Mishra, director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), said there is no evidence to suggest that the current surge in the number of cases has anything to do with mutant viruses. “This is because the proportion of samples that contain these variants is very small – about 6% of the total. The increase is likely driven by the behaviour of the people. Everything has gone back to normal – marriages are happening, elections are happening, schools are opening up,” said Mishra. “We are also looking for the new local variant, but we are yet to pick up any that is circulating faster or is of any concern. And, no matter what variant it is, the same mask will protect us from all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/about-300-sequenced-covid-19-samples-found-to-be-of-uk-sa-brazilian-variants-101616479494455.html
23-03-2021||India||Maritime, air defence theatre commands to be announced by June 2021||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Combined Commanders Conference at Kevadia in Gujarat on March 6, the first signs of joint manship among the three services were more than evident. The Indian Air Force commanders were wearing Indian Army’s combat disruptive camouflage uniform to signal joint spirit and Indian Navy commanders were in their dark grey disruptive camouflage gear.While PM Modi impressed on joint manship and synergy among the forces, the three services led by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) meant business as if spurred by the 100-day eyeball to eyeball stand-off with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in east Ladakh. “It was not a business conference of the past. The commanders were told to be battle-ready at all times with the inter-services silos showing signs of breaking and giving way to new military reform,” said a senior commander.Also read | Next round of India-China talks looks positive on Gogra-Hot SpringsPM Modi’s address not only charged up the commanders but also has speeded up the process of creation of theatres commands with the announcement of key maritime theatre command and air defence command expected by June this year. The maritime and air defence command will be raised by the 75th year of Indian Independence.The fact is that the PLA’s aggression against India in east Ladakh has really made the Indian military much more responsive and ready for battle than ever before. When the Indian Army was standing up to PLA in Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs and Pangong Tso, the air force was aggressively patrolling the skies and the navy was harassing Chinese warships with submarines as far as the Gulf of Aden. This posture continues with the navy now questioning each Chinese survey ship, trying to map the Indian Ocean in the name of the mineral and heavy metals survey.Also read | East Ladakh stand-off with China on US top official Lloyd Austin’s India agendaWhile the IAF is awaiting its next instalment of Rafale fighters from France, the navy is preparing to receive its first of the 24 MH-60R Seahawk multi-role helicopters from the US this year. Called a “ship on a ship” the Seahawk helicopter is a command and control machine proficient in anti-submarine warfare with torpedoes, anti-surface warfare with Hell-Fire missiles and functions as an attack helicopter at sea in a special operations role. The navy will also get six more Boeing P8I, known for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and ship interdiction, from the US. “The Indian Navy, henceforth, will project force in the entire Indo-Pacific. The time has come for deployment as the era of naval diplomacy is over,” said a senior Admiral.The new-found attitude of the Indian Army is exemplified by its XIV Corps Commander Lt General PGK Menon, who meets his Chinese counterparts on equal footing if not more. With all the aggressive attitude of a Sikh Regiment soldier, Lt Gen Menon has asked his troops to patrol up to designated points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and be prepared for the worst-case scenario. The same mood prevails all along the LAC.Another attribute of the fundamental changes taking place within the Indian military establishment is accountability from the Military Engineer Services and looking at the Indian private sector and not only the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the completion of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat mission. In this context, DRDO is being questioned on delays in the development of weapon systems as well as indigenous content in the proven systems like Brahmos missile, Arjun tank and Tejas fighter. The Indian armed forces finally have decided to shrug off their imperial baggage and are prepared for a more professional tri-service future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maritime-air-defence-theatre-commands-to-be-announced-by-june-2021-101616478448044.html
23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court refuses to extend loan moratorium period, dismisses plea on interest waiver||The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the request by traders’ associations to extend the period of loan moratorium and allow sector-specific reliefs. The top court also dismissed petitions seeking a complete waiver of interest during the moratorium period of March 2020, when a lockdown was imposed in view of the coronavirus pandemic, till August that year.A bench of justice Ashok Bhushan, justice RS Reddy and justice MR Shah held that courts are not experts and such decisions lie in the realm of economic policy, in which interference by courts should be rarely made.The top court’s ruling came on a batch of pleas filed by corporate bodies, business associations, and individuals demanding an extension of the moratorium beyond August 2020. The Centre, on the court’s insistence, had earlier agreed to waive compound interest on loans for six categories of borrowers who took loans of up to ₹2 crore. The business associations had demanded an extension of this benefit to borrowers who secured loans beyond ₹2 crore.The requests were opposed by the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, and senior advocate V Giri representing RBI, had argued that compound interest on loans of up to ₹2 crore was waived keeping in mind fiscal constraints and viability of banks.On waiver of compound interest, the Supreme Court, however, on Tuesday said that it found no rationale behind the government’s decision to waive interest for the six categories. The bench clarified that any penal interest charged by banks for non-payment of loan during moratorium shall be refundable.The top court stated that the coronavirus pandemic affected the government as well and yet the Centre and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) came out with schemes and packages to reduce stress on businesses, adding that grant of any further relief would have far-reaching consequences on the economy.The three-judge bench was of the firm view that decisions on economic policy matters should be left to the government and that courts should not interfere even if a second view is possible.The petitioners included big borrowers like power producers, real estate developers, textile mill owners, knitwear association, jewellery manufacturing association, contract carriage operators, hotel and restaurant associations of states, financial technical institutions, and shopping centre associations who had obtained loans up to or above ₹1,500 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-to-extend-loan-moratorium-period-101616478785023.html

Everyday hundreds of trucks leave a huge trail of dust while passing by our homes. How long should we face the pollution by trucks carrying coal,” asked Anjana Pradhan, one of the children sitting on dharna.The school children, most of them Hill khadia, Bhuyan and Gond tribals, are the latest to join the protest against coal transportation that started in Hemgir block on January 19 this year. Over 5,000 tribals of Sundargarh started a road blockade at Taparia area to stop the trucks carrying coal from Sundargarh to Chhattisgarh. The villagers had a temporary relief when the Odisha Human Rights Commission on February 10 ordered a ban on movement of trucks on the village roads for up to six weeks. But the relief was short-lived after Orissa High Court on March 9 stayed the recommendations of OHRC when the state government petitioned through Mahanadi Coalfields Limited.Prominent activist Prafulla Samantra who visited the area said the situation is becoming volatile. “The people have a constitutional right to protest peacefully the state fails to protect their right to clean air and clean water. But people who are protesting the coal dust pollution are being arrested arbitrarily without any reason. A few days ago women along with children of anganwadi Centre of Kandadhuda, Ratanpur and Beleimunda villages were forcefully taken to police station and kept there for 30 hours without food. Around two dozen villagers including 12 women were sent to jail on false charges of attempt to murder and dacoity. Social activist Sura Mishra has been slapped with a dacoity case as he supported the villagers’ protest,” said Samantra.Sundargarh sub-collector Abhimanyu Behera said a new corridor for the trucks has been planned to be built at a cost of ₹146 crore.“The construction of the corridor would soon start. But till the new road is made the villagers should not try to block the trucks. We have ordered MCL to transport the coal by covering with tarpaulins,” he said.Meanwhile, coal transportation on Bankibahal-Taparia road, which resumed on March 11, had stopped from March 15 following the protest at Ratanpur village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-children-in-odisha-s-sundargarh-district-protest-pollution-by-coal-trucks-101616476974013.html
23-03-2021||India||Martyr's Day 2021: PM Modi, vice president Naidu pay tributes||Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru on the occasion of Martyrs' Day (Shaheed Diwas), saying that the sacrifices made by them will inspire every generation of the country. "Salute to the revolutionaries of Independence, Martyrs Veer Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru on Martyrdom Day. The sacrifice of these great sons of mother India will remain an inspiration for every generation of the country. Jai Hind! #ShaheedDiwas," the PM Modi wrote in a tweet in Hindi.Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu also paid his tributes. “My humble tributes to the fearless freedom fighters, Bhagat Singh, Shiva Ram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar, on their martyrdom day today. Their indomitable courage and love for our motherland inspired many to join the freedom movement,” Naidu also tweeted.Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh paid floral tributes to the martyrs and said in a tweet, “Their unparalleled courage, when they gladly embraced death in the cause of India’s freedom, will continue to inspire generations. Jai Hind!”Martyr’s Day is observed every year on March 23 in India to mark the anniversary of the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Rajguru. The three young freedom fighters were hanged by the Britishers on March 23, 1931, in Lahore Jail.Bhagat Singh, who was born on September 28, 1907, in Punjab's Lyallpur, fought against the British with his companions Rajguru and Sukhdev. Sukhdev, who was born on May 15, 1907, in Ludhiana, came in contact with Singh in 1921 when the latter was a student of National College. Sukhdev later joined the underground revolutionary organisation, Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which included Singh, Rajguru and Chandrashekhar Azad.Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were deeply affected by the assassination of Lala Lajpat Rai who was killed in a non-violent protest against the Simon Commission on October 30, 1928. The British lathi-charged the protesters and during the brutal attack, Rai was injured and eventually died of a heart attack.Singh and his partners decided to strike back at the British and in 1929 threw a bomb at the central legislative assembly in Delhi while cheering the slogan ‘Inquillab Zindabad’ (long live the revolution). Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged to death by the British in 1931 and were cremated on the banks of the Sutlej River.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/martyrs-day-2021-pm-modi-vice-president-naidu-pay-tributes-101616475664743.html

23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court seeks status of vacancies in tribunals||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Centre to provide information by Thursday on vacancies across tribunals and stages at which the appointment processes are held up. The direction came as the court expressed displeasure over inaction in filling vacancies at the National Green Tribunal (NGT) despite the approval for them from the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC).“We need concrete data on the names cleared by the search-cum-selection committee on not just the National Green Tribunal (NGT) but the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Armed Forces Tribunal, etc,” said a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari.The court was hearing a petition filed by the NGT Bar Association (Western Zone) highlighting vacancies at the tribunal even as the NGT Act provides for a maximum of 20 judicial and 20 technical members as the tribunal’s ideal strength. The tribunal should not have less than 10 members from the judicial and technical sides at any given time.“...there are only five members (three judicial and two expert members) besides Chairperson at the Principal Bench, Delhi, and the pendency of cases at the tribunal has scaled the 2,500-mark,” said lawyer Raj Panjwani, who represented the association.The Supreme Court suggested a change in the composition of the search-cum-selection committees, which recommend names for appointment of chairpersons and members of tribunals, under the Tribunals, Appellate Tribunal, and Other Authorities (Qualification, Conditions of Service of Members) Rules in November. This came as the court was considering the validity of rules for filling up posts in tribunals across the country.Also Read | Delhi HC restrains Future, upholds Singapore tribunal’s ruling“In case the search-cum-selection committees have made recommendations after conducting selections in accordance with the 2020 Rules, appointments shall be made within three months from today and shall not be subject matter of challenge on the ground that they are not in accord with this judgment,” the court said.In an affidavit filed in January, the Centre told the court that seven names had been cleared for NGT appointments to bring it in conformity with the November judgment. The search-cum-selection committee cleared their names in September following which ACC approval came in December.Additional Solicitor General N Venkataraman told the court that he required three weeks to compile data on all tribunals where appointments were held up despite clearance of names.“All the orders we have passed are going down the drain. All tribunals are waiting for appointments. Almost every month, new vacancies are getting created. You [Centre] have to sort out this matter. If the selection process is complete, you must take it to the logical conclusion,” the court said and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-seeks-status-of-vacancies-in-tribunals-101616474573865.html
23-03-2021||India||Night curfew returns to Odisha’s Malkangiri district after 3 months||Authorities in Odisha’s southern district of Malkangiri clamped night curfew on Monday between March 23 and 31 to stop the spread of Covid-19 in view of a series of upcoming festivals.It is for the first time in three months that night curfew has been reimposed in the district.Though Malkangiri has no active Covid-19 cases currently and did not report any new positive cases on Monday, district collector Yeddula Vijay imposed the night curfew in view of the Bada Yatra, Dola Jatra and Holi festivities in different parts of the district. The order issued by the district administration said no one can venture out of their homes between 9 pm and 6 am for the next nine days except for essential activities.The night curfew order came on a day Odisha reported 146 new Covid-19 cases, its single-day highest in the last two months with Bhubaneswar’s premier B-school Xavier Institute of Management reporting 45 cases.“The institute has been sealed and close watch is being maintained. All the 45 positive cases are asymptomatic and all of them had travelled to Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu recently,” said special relief commissioner (SRC) Pradip Jena. Jena, who reviewed the preparedness of the state government to tackle rising infections, on Monday asked all district collectors and superintendents of police to strictly enforce Covid-19 guidelines in marketplaces, malls and other commercial establishments across the state. The SRC said already restrictions have been clamped in the state for Holi and Dola Purnima this weekend. “We do not want to unnecessarily clamp restrictions but if the situation needs, we will take an appropriate call,” said Jena hinting at a possibility of a lockdown once again.The SRC said panchayati raj institution (PRI) members like sarpanch, ward members and panchayat samiti members as well as anganwadi workers would be deployed in the fight against Covid resurgence. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik is expected to review the situation on Tuesday.The detection of the large number of cases from XIMB prompted the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation officials to restrict the participation of people in Dola Purnima. In an order, the BMC said a maximum of 6 people would be allowed to take part in Dolajatra. All six must wear masks. In Ganjam district, which had become a Covid hotspot in July-August last year, the administration made RT-PCR test report compulsory for people visiting the district from places like Surat.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said entry into the district will be allowed only to people with health-related issues. Those without RT-PCR reports will have to undergo mandatory home quarantine for seven days.“As festivals like Danda Nacha and Yatras are approaching, residents of Ganjam district who are settled outside Odisha for jobs or business will return to their homes. Therefore, I request the concerned organisers not to invite them for the festivals.

The demonstration included a live video-conferencing with quantum key encrypted signals between two line-of-sight buildings at Space Application Centre in Ahmedabad.This experiment can form the basis for a future quantum key encrypted data transmission between satellites and ground stations. A satellite-based quantum encrypted communication can be used to create a network for sharing secret messages. “This is a major milestone achievement for unconditionally secured satellite data communication using quantum technologies,” said Isro in a release.Also Read | Space Technology Incubation Centres opened at NIT Nagpur, Bhopal and RourkelaQuantum cryptography “future proofs” any data transmission as the encryption cannot be cracked by existing computers. The current data security – for sensitive information such as banking – depends on large prime factorisation problems. A present day computer will be able to tell that the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 but it would not be able to do so for a number that is big enough.For that, quantum computers are needed. There is no country that has figured out how to develop one yet, but they are all in the race to do so.Computers around us work on a system of silicon transistors that store information as bits – either in the state of 0 or 1 –on a binary logic analogous to an on-off switch. But quantum computers use qubits – either a proton or an electron – that can exist as O, 1 or any superposition of any possible combination of 0 and 1.The space agency is now gearing up to demonstrate the technology between two Indian ground stations.A number of key technologies were developed indigenously for the demonstration including a NavIC receiver for time synchronization between the transmitter and receiver modules. NavIC or Navigation with Indian Constellation is India’s regional version of satellite-based positioning system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-demonstrates-technology-for-quantum-encrypted-data-transmission-101616473433925.html

23-03-2021||India||MP, UP sign Ken-Betwa pact: Here’s why it alarmed environmentalists||Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) to begin work on the country’s first major project for interlinking two rain-fed rivers, Ken and Betwa. Here is all you need to know about the MoA and why has it alarmed environmentalists:• Environmental activists said the project would spell doom for the Panna tiger reserve, known for its critically endangered white-rumped vultures besides a thriving big cat population.• According to the project report, 2,800 million cubic metres (MCM) of water will be diverted from the Ken basin to the water-deficient Betwa basin through a 73.8-meter-high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhattarpur district.• The report also said 6,017 hectares of forest land of Panna Tiger Reserve and the Ken Ghariyal Sanctuary would be submerged in the dam reservoir.• Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said people of nine districts will benefit from the project and about 1 million hectares of land will get irrigated. • He added 6.2 million people, mostly in the water deficit Bundelkhand region, will get drinking water.Also Read | Ken-Betwa project could hit wildlife: Report• Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People said it was “very unfortunate” that the Central and state governments signed the MoA on World Water Day even though the project would prove to be a curse for water conservation. • He cited a report of the forest advisory committee and added an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project. This will lead to poor rainfall in an already parched Bundelkhand. • Thakkar said the project will also destroy Panna Tiger Reserve, home to over 52 tigers and several species of endangered vultures, including the white-rumped vulture. • Of the nine vulture species found in India, six can be seen in Panna, which has run a successful vulture population revival programme.• Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee have raised doubts about the project. • A petition opposing the approval of the project is pending before the Supreme Court.• Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh said the project will all but destroy the Panna Tiger Reserve, a success story in translocation and revival. • The MoA was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived.• Officials said the delay was because of lack of agreement between the two states on sharing of water.• The Uttar Pradesh government, which was initially demanding 930 MCM water during the Rabi season, settled for 750 MCM while Madhya Pradesh will receive 1,834 MCM water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-up-sign-ken-betwa-pact-here-s-why-it-alarmed-environmentalists-101616471813855.html

23-03-2021||India||Supreme Court to pronounce order on loan moratorium extension today||The Supreme Court on Tuesday will pronounce its order on the extension of moratorium offered by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on loan instalments accrued during March to August 2020 when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah will pronounce its decision on a clutch of petitions filed by corporate bodies, business associations and individuals demanding an extension of the moratorium beyond August 2020. At the instance of the court, the Centre had agreed to waive compound interest on loans for six categories of borrowers who secured loans of up to ₹2 crore. The various business associations and corporate bodies have demanded an extension of this benefit to borrowers who obtained loans of amounts beyond ₹2 crore.Also Read | Government planning crackdown on apps offering cash loans onlineThe Centre and RBI have opposed these requests. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, and senior advocate V Giri representing RBI, said that compound interest on loans of up to ₹2 crore was waived keeping in mind fiscal constraints and viability of banks. Any order to further extend the benefit to other borrowers will make banks unviable, which no economy like India will be able to sustain, the Centre and RBI had argued. Big borrowers like power producers, real estate developers, textile mill owners, knitwear association, jewellery manufacturing association, contract carriage operators, hotel and restaurant associations of states, financial technical institutions, and shopping centre associations are all represented before the Supreme Court. These petitioners had either obtained big loans (of over ₹1,500 crore) and not-so-big loans (of up to ₹1,500 crore) and expected some relief from the court as businesses were severely hit during the lockdown. Some petitioners even questioned the ceiling limit of ₹2 crore for waiving of compound interest. The RBI and Centre have maintained that problems of big borrowers were remedied by the KV Kamath Committee which fixed parameters for sector-specific resolution for industries and businesses under stress due to the pandemic. The RBI had filed an affidavit in Supreme Court last October stating that the moratorium on loan repayment cannot be extended beyond six months and requested the court to lift the stay on classifying defaulting accounts as non-performing assets (NPA) passed by the top court on September 3, 2020. The court had held, “The accounts which were not declared NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared NPA till further orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-pronounce-order-on-loan-moratorium-extension-today-101616470793972.html

23-03-2021||India||One year of lockdown: Where India stands now?||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 23 last year announced a stringent lockdown in the country for 21 days to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. One year on, Wednesday will mark a complete year of the restrictions in the country even as the Covid-19 threat is far from over."This virus has been spreading very fast across the world. It spreads like wildfire. Looking at the experience of these countries, and what the experts say, the only successful way to tackle the spread of the virus is social distancing,” PM Modi said while announcing the lockdown.Along with many countries around the world, India is also witnessing a surge in the daily Covid-19 cases. The country's death toll has mounted to 159,967 and its infection tally is above 11.64 million. At the time of the lockdown announcement last year, the infection tally was around 500 and 50 people had died due to the viral disease.The lockdownThe lockdown came into effect from midnight on March 24. All establishments, including private, commercial, educational and government, were asked to remain shut. At the time of his address, PM Modi described the situation as a "curfew" like. "Every state, every Union territory, every district, every village and every locality is being put under a lockdown. This is in effect a curfew, more stringent than the Janta Curfew,” the Prime Minister said while explaining the new measure.Limiting the movement of the entire 1.38 billion people, India's nationwide lockdown was one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world.The aftermathFor many industries lockdown became a transformative time as they tried to reinvent themselves according to the new norms. Among this was health industries, OTT platforms, e-commerce companies, whereas, travel, tourism, hospitality and related sector took the worst hit and are still in a process of recovery.The lockdown also triggered a massive exodus of migrants due to the shutdown of factories and the workplace. Millions of migrant workers walked or cycled hundreds of kilometres to go back to their native villages, triggering a countrywide outrage and criticism of the Centre.Covid-19 situation nowToday, there are more than 2,400 laboratories in the country that conduct Covid-19 testing through multiple mediums. According to the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), out of the 2,425 labs, 545 government facilities conduct tests through RT-PCR. While 637 others conduct testing through TrueNat Test. At the time of the beginning of the pandemic, the number was just around 100.In terms of testing samples in a day, the country has improved its numbers to multiple folds. Until March 16 last year, India tested 9,100 samples for Covid-19. At that time India was among the lowest in the world in terms of people tested with respect to population. Today, the number is in millions. As of March 21, the country tested 3,44,45,774 samples for Covid-19, according to the ICMR figures. It tested 880,655 samples on March 21 alone.India has two vaccines—Covishield developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. It is also the second country after the United States to inoculate the highest number of people.

The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the SUV found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident.Alleging that Deshmukh had also been interfering with investigations into several other cases, Singh claimed that the home minister pressured him “to probe the role of certain leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and somehow implicate them” in the abetment to suicide case of Mohan Delkar, the seven-time Lok Sabha MP from Dadar and Nagar Haveli who was found dead in a hotel in Mumbai’s Marine Drive area on February 22.“Fair CBI investigation is thus warranted in each of such acts of Shri Anil Deshmukh in abuse of the official position of the Hon’ble Home Minister,” said the petition. It added that Singh approached the top court for a CBI probe since the Maharashtra government has withdrawn its general consent for the central agency to carry out investigation in the state.Singh is likely to be represented in the top court by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi. The petition is still to get a date of hearing in the top court.Singh, in his plea, has also called the decision to transfer him “a political move with oblique purposes and sinister motives”, besides in violation of the Rule 7 of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 which lays down that every officer shall hold the post for at least two years.The petition further said: “The transfer of the petitioner in the aforesaid circumstances is for reasons smeared with malice, when there is no iota of material or evidence – far from proof – found or even imputed against the petitioner, and is solely based on conjectures, surmises and pure speculation, without detail of any sort against the petitioner having been noticed by anybody. .”Singh said he was constrained to write a letter to the chief minister on March 20 regarding Deshmukh’s conduct after his transfer owing to adverse media publicity by Deshmukh, in violation of his right to reputation, dignity, equality and liberty.In his letter which came out in the public domain a day ago, Singh made a spate of accusations against Deshmukh, who refuted the allegations.On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar also rejected Singh’s claim, saying Deshmukh was in the hospital from February 5-15 and later in home quarantine till February 27 – the period when Param Bir Singh claimed Vaze had met the home minister.Meanwhile, Singh on Monday took charge as the Director General (DG) of Maharashtra Home Guard, a police official said.Singh reached the Home Guard office in south Mumbai around noon but avoided speaking to media persons, the PTI reported.The Maharashtra government transferred Singh from the post and appointed senior IPS officer Hemant Nagrale, who was holding additional charge of Maharashtra DGP, as the new commissioner of Mumbai Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-moves-supreme-court-for-cbi-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-101616467693324.html

23-03-2021||India||Mercury drops as parts of city get light rain; showers likely today too: IMD||Parts of Delhi received trace rainfall on Monday, with strong winds and cloudy skies during the day, bring the Capital some respite from rising mercury levels that have consistently been above normal levels this month. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that with more clouds passing over the city, there is a possibility of light rains continuing on Tuesday.“More clouds are moving over the region. Though Delhi is not expected to receive any intense rainfall, it will be largely cloudy with light rains in some parts,” a senior Met official said on Monday.The overcast skies brought some respite from the rising heat in the city. The maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 33.6 degrees Celsius, down from 35.2°C in the previous day.However, Delhi on Monday also recorded the highest minimum temperature for the season, with the mercury levels touching 20°C.Scientists explained that temperatures usually tend to rise during the onset of a western disturbance, as in the early hours on Monday from when the minimum temperature recordings are noted.A western disturbance is an extra-tropical storm that originates in the Mediterranean, which brings with it rain and a drop in temperature and is mostly associated with winter rain in India. This is the fifth western disturbance to pass over the region this month. The last time the city received rain and thunderstorm was on March 12, when the city woke up to light to moderate showers, with hailstorm in parts of NCR.IMD forecast says that from Wednesday, the temperatures are expected to rise and by Friday it is likely to reach around 37°C. The highest temperature to ever be recorded in March was in 1945, when the mercury levels crossed the 40°C mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-drops-as-parts-of-city-get-light-rain-showers-likely-today-too-imd-101616466374763.html
23-03-2021||India||Contentious bill on Delhi clears Lok Sabha after heated debate||The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that seeks to make it mandatory for the Delhi government to seek the prior opinion of the L-G before any executive action, following a heated debate which saw the Opposition parties rallying behind the AAP and accusing the Centre of trying to run Delhi through an administrator.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said by passing the Bill, the BJP has cheated the people and termed it an insult to the people of Delhi. “Passage of GNCTD Amendment Bill in Lok Sabha today is an insult to people of Delhi. The Bill effectively takes away powers from those who were voted by people & gives powers to run Delhi to those who were defeated. BJP has cheated the people,” Kejriwal tweeted.Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Gopal Rai said the Bill was an insult not only to the people of Delhi but also the Constitution.“It will be remembered as a black day in the history of democracy,” he tweeted.During the debate, the treasury bench argued that according to the laws, the Delhi government can only enjoy “crippled power”.Both sides sparred over legal arguments, power of Delhi’s L-G, the Balakrishna Committee report and even debated the performance of the Arvind Kejriwal government.The Bill, introduced in the House last Monday, says that “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation. It also says that the Delhi assembly cannot constitute any committees to look into the day-to-day and administrative issues.Since Delhi is a Union territory, its elected government does not have full control over the city-state. Law and order, land and services come directly under the L-G. This unique duality has led to frequent tussles between the Delhi government and the Centre.Congress leader Manish Tewari accused the BJP of turning 180 degrees in their stand on Delhi and pointed out that LK Advani as union home minister introduced 102nd constitutional amendment to give entire Delhi apart from New Delhi region full statehood. “The same NDA government brought a bill to end the democratic system in Delhi. This bill is unconstitutional and has a targeted and mala fide intention that seeks to take away Delhi’s character,” he said.He argued that the proposed law defies pragmatic federalism and violates the laxman rekha formed by Supreme Court for the Delhi government. “How can the Delhi government mean the LG when SC has said LG is only an administrator? You (the Centre) want to end democracy and run Delhi through LG,” Tewari accused.“If an assembly can’t have oversight of government activities, what is the utility of having an assembly?” asked Tewari.Tewari and New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi argued over Article 239 AA and 239 B that defines the power for the L-G and the Delhi government. Lekhi said a governor works as per the advice of a council of ministers but an L-G is assisted by the council of ministers. “The rights of the state government and L-G haven’t been changed. They have been defined,” she said.Lekhi narrated several instances — water logging under Minto Bridge, non-availability of piped water in Patel Nagar, and how Delhi Police were denied buses to tackle farm law protesters—to label the AAP government as “anarchists”.She alleged that Kejriwal government spent ₹524 crore on advertisements while the former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit had just ₹32 crore budget for publicity. “Union home minister sets up new hospitals which were to be done by Delhi CM. PM Awas scheme, Kisan samman nidhi are not given to people in Delhi,” she said, accusing the government of mismanaging the national capital.AAP MP from Sangrur (Punjab) Bhagwant Mann slammed the Centre as “specialist in snatching power of states”. He gave examples of Madhya Pradesh and quipped, “Where the BJP doesn’t come to power through elections it comes through by-elections”.He said the Delhi CM, a “Magsaysay award winner”,sought votes on his performance and asked if the BJP can do the same. “What is the problem in sitting in Opposition? You didn’t give Leader of Opposition to Congress in Lok Sabha but we gave your leader [the status of] LoP in Delhi assembly. We didn’t hand over a stadium to you because you wanted to make it a prison for farmers. Tomorrow, you might bring a Bill for no elections in the country.”Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut argued that “just as Lok Sabha is supreme, an assembly is supreme in its own state” and said, “Are we going towards the British Raj? We are imposing a bureaucrat on top of people’s representatives. This Bill would mean the assembly or a minister can’t take any steps.”BSP’s Danish Ali was critical of the AAP government but attacked the BJP saying, “It’s very unfortunate that this NDA government tramples upon BR Ambedkar’s constitution. Instead of decentralisation of power, it is being given to a person.”While the YSR Congress Party supported the Bill, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) opposed it.The Bill will now be taken up in the Rajya Sabha for consideration, before it becomes the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contentious-bill-clears-lok-sabha-after-heated-debate-101616465859412.html
23-03-2021||India||Nurse tests positive for covid over a month after getting both vaccine doses||A nurse at the Delhi government-run Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra hospital has tested positive for Covid-19 over a month after she received two doses of the vaccine against the viral infection, something experts said was not unusual. The woman said she got tested at the hospital on Monday afternoon after she started sweating and experiencing severe body aches.Experts said fully vaccinated people getting infected is not surprising, particularly since now vaccine is 100% effective. But a coronavirus vaccine is still expected to offer 100% protection against severe illness.“Around 12.50pm Monday, I started getting severe body aches and also started sweating profusely. So, I got tested at the hospital itself and found out that I have the infection,” said Wadhwa.“Efficacy of none of the vaccines, whether for Covid-19 or for other infections such as the flu is 100%,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nurse-tests-positive-for-covid-over-a-month-after-getting-both-vaccine-doses-101616465671235.html
23-03-2021||India||Ease of purchase: Better experience for buyers ahead in Delhi's liquor policy||Letting private sector handle alcohol retail, requiring shops to mandatorily allow customers to enter for purchases, and opening doors for new “super-premium” liquor vends for high value products are expected to significantly improve the experience for consumers, experts and citizens on Monday said, listing problems in the way sales happen in most parts of the Capital at present.The Delhi government announced details of an overhaul of its liquor policy, which was approved by the chief minister. The new rules will now be drafted and sent to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.Also read | Liquor policy: Govt divides Delhi into 32 ‘zones’ to streamline excise earnings“The current retail experience is like a jail. When you go to a shop, there is a grille and people rush and throw money to buy liquor. There is no dignity. It will no longer be like that,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said at a press briefing.Among the main measures to improve the buying experience is a rule that will need any liquor vend in the city to be at least 500 square feet in size. “There can be no counters facing towards the road. They will have to ensure that liquor sale and pick up takes place properly inside the shop premises. The shop owners will have to ensure law and order outside the shop,” Sisodia said.The government also decided that it will exit the retail sale business, and allow private companies to step in. “We have detected revenue leakages in the government shops -- through tax evasion, brand pushing and other means. Also, most government shops operate with 150 sq ft space. Several of them have grilled counters,” said Sisodia.The proposed policy includes a new license category to enhance the liquor-buying experience for those looking for high-end products. The government wants these to be at least 5,000 sq ft in area, and deal in sales of premium brands only. The plan allows these to be open for an hour longer than the usual closing time.Also read: Microbreweries likely to be allowed take-away and supply to barsConsumers said the proposed policy could improve customer experience.“The new policy sounds good. For women, most government shops are no-go zones. They are very crowded and women do not feel safe. Then there is this taboo about women buying liquor. That is one reason why most of my women friends prefer going to private outlets,” said Akanksha Nagpal, manager at an audit firm based in Delhi.Arijit Sen, who works with a legal consultancy company, said the biggest concern with government retail shops has been the lack of room to explore brands, “In peak hours, one has to have a certain brand in mind. Sometimes, shop owners push another brand as an alternative. The range of stock too is a major issue. These problems are likely to get resolved with private players taking over,” he said.Industry representatives welcomed the move, but said the implementation needs to be carefully done and the policy studied further.“If the government has decided to exit the retail sector, it must do so in a carefully calibrated and phased manner — their exit from the retail sector at one go can potentially give disproportionate power to private license holders, lead to cartelisation with undue control on brand availability — thus disrupting the organic demand-supply mechanism. That will lead to customers facing the same old problems,” said Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ease-of-purchase-better-experience-for-buyers-ahead-in-delhi-s-liquor-policy-101616465192295.html

Senior police officers said the suspected con man collected ₹1,500 from each person to fraudulently enrol them as a member of an NGO named “Target Welfare Association” to avail of rations and later fled with the money. Till date, over 500 people have been duped of more than ₹8 lakh cumulatively, police said.Police have identified the arrested man as Rajesh Kumar Bhartiya. Senior police officers said the forgery came to light when multiple complaints were received against the “NGO Target Welfare Association” that despite paying ₹1,500 and enrolling for free distribution of ration -- flour, rice, sugar, and refined oil etc -- for 15 months, the NGO did not give any ration.Deputy commissioner of police (economic offences wing) Mohammad Ali said preliminary probe revealed that the NGO is run by one Rajesh Kumar Bhartiya and his associates. “It was also found that the same NGO was running similar schemes in the areas of Jhandewalan, Pratap Nagar, Manakpura, Kishanganj, Mukundpur, Dabri etc. Complainants further alleged that the NGO is neither supplying the ration nor answering the phone since the membership amount was paid. A case of cheating was registered, and investigation was taken up,” Ali said.The DCP said during investigation, it was established that Bhartiya is the key accused who is running the ponzi scheme and he is also the beneficiary of the money duped from people. “When our teams tried to contact him, he never joined the investigation and frequently changed his address. With the help of technical surveillance, our teams managed to zero in on him in Nangloi and he was arrested on Friday following a search,” the officer said.During questioning, police found that Bhartiya and his associates have cheated at least 535 persons so far by enrolling them in their NGO. “They initially used to distribute some ration but later would flee with the membership amount and change their contact details,” a police office said, adding that efforts were on to arrest the remaining suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-for-floating-ponzi-scheme-duping-over-500-of-8-lakh-in-delhi-101616455179666.html
23-03-2021||India||Three men arrested, juvenile apprehended for series of crimes in Delhi||Police on Monday said they had arrested three men and apprehended a juvenile for allegedly committing nearly a dozen cases of armed robberies, snatchings, attempts to murder and vehicle thefts. Within three hours on March 12, the minor boy and his partner allegedly stole two motorcycles from Jahangirpuri and Bharat Nagar and used them in two robberies in Shalimar Bagh and Majnu Ka Tila in north Delhi, the police said.In both robberies, the suspects had fired shots. A 12-year-old had sustained a bullet injury in his arm when he along and his father and seven to eight labourers tried to nab the robbers who had snatched the mobile phone of the driver of a goods vehicle in Shalimar Bagh village. A man suffered two bullet injuries in his legs when he resisted the robbery. The suspects had fled with his mobile phone, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said the gang is infamous as “Pagal (mad) gang” among criminal circles because of the aggressive behaviour of its members, who often fire during robberies. One pistol, three cartridges and five stolen motorcycles were recovered from the arrested persons, said the DCP.On March 12 around 5am, Alphonse said one Saurabh Sharma from Pitampura was waiting for a bus to Jaipur near Majnu Ka Tila, when two persons arrived on two separate motorcycles and robbed him of his mobile phone at gunpoint. When they tried to snatch Sharma’s bag, he resisted and overpowered one of them. The other suspect fired two bullets that hit Sharma in the leg. The suspects fled leaving behind one motorcycle that later turned out to be stolen from Jahangirpuri area, just a few hours before the crime, he said.On March 18, the juvenile and his associate, identified as Akash alias Bhalla,22, were caught from Civil Lines area with a pistol and three bullets. Their questioning led to the recovery of three bikes that they had stolen from Usmanpur, Paharganj and Jafarabad. Two other members of the gang, identified as Sahil alias Ajaz24, and Sahil alias Fazal,21, were arrested from near Kashmere Gate bus terminal on March 20.During the questioning, the DCP said, it was revealed that after March 11 midnight, Akash and the juvenile first stole a motorcycle from Jahangirpuri and used it to rob the mobile phone from goods tempo driver in Shalimar Bagh. They had fired a bullet when some people tried to overpower them. The bullet went through the left arm of a 12-year-old boy. After the robbery and firing, the duo stole another bike from Bharat Nagar area and used both the bikes while robbing Sharma at Majnu Ka Tila, the officer said.“Three brothers of the apprehended juvenile are also into crime and presently in jail for various crimes including murder. The juvenile came into contact with Aakash through a common friend,” said Alphonse, adding that Ajaz and Fazal were involved in 37 and 20 crimes, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-men-arrested-juvenile-apprehended-for-series-of-crimes-in-delhi-101616455184586.html
23-03-2021||India||SDMC clears plan to provide a plateful of food for ₹15, 40 kiosks to be set up||The standing committee of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Monday approved a proposal to restart its Atal Aahar Yojna by remodelling the scheme which was launched in 2018. In the scheme, people will get a thali (food plate) at a subsidised rate of ₹15. The idea was proposed in SDMC’s final budget presentation in February this year.The SDMC had in 2018-19 implemented the step on a pilot basis by opening five kiosks but the project was put on hold after the coronavirus pandemic struck the country.Senior SDMC officials said nearly 40 kiosks will be established at different places in south Delhi.The outlets will prominently cater to the lower-income groups as due to financial constraints, they mostly partake of unhygienic food, risking their health.“Initially, 10 kiosks with inbuilt kitchen mobile vans (IKMV) will be placed in each of the four zones and later, their number will increased or decreased, depending upon the requirement (in each zone). SDMC will provide bare spaces of 5X3 metres on a “as in wherein basis“ to the bidder who will be allowed to construct eco-friendly kiosks with no permanent structure. The bidder will bid considering the revenue potential and SDMC will not be responsible for losses,” stated the proposal which was approved by the standing committee. It will now be placed before the house meeting for a final nod.A senior SDMC official said the outlets will sell breakfast from 8am to 11am and lunch from noon to 3pm. “The maximum rate for breakfast would be ₹10 and lunch would ₹15. The menu will include puri and stuffed paratha in breakfast and rice, dal, raita, and roti in lunch,” said the official.The proposal also mentioned that a bidder can apply for a maximum of five sites at a time.Officials said chairs or temporary structures, which may hinder the movement of pedestrians, will not be allowed at these kiosks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sdmc-clears-plan-to-provide-a-plateful-of-food-for-15-40-kiosks-to-be-set-up-101616455190742.html
23-03-2021||India||Liquor policy: Govt divides Delhi into 32 ‘zones’ to streamline excise earnings||The Delhi government has made some structural changes to the state’s excise policy to augment its liquor revenue, including dividing the city into 32 zones and ensuring allotment of licenses on a zonal basis. The proposed policy, unveiled on Monday, also aims to recover projected revenues mostly through rationalisation of licenses as well as reducing duties and tax imposed on each bottle to “nominal rates”, apart from tightening protocols for issuing license to wholesale distributors, according to a document that HT has seen.Delhi currently earns ₹6,574 crore each year through excise revenue. Through the proposed policy, the government plans to increase its annual revenue by ₹1,500-2,000 crore, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a press briefing on Monday.Delhi currently has 849 liquor shops. These, however, are not equally distributed, which Sisodia said has proved to be an obstacle to the revenue Delhi earns through liquor trade.He said. “There are some areas of Delhi where liquor is overserved and there are some areas of Delhi where liquor is underserved or unserved. This is the fundamental reason why in Delhi liquor mafias work. You all know that Delhi has 272 wards. Of these, 79 wards have zero liquor shops. Around 45 wards have just one shop.”“Around 58% of Delhi is either unserved or underserved. Based on liquor sale distribution only 8% area of Delhi is normally served. There are around 37 wards where more than three liquor shops are present. On the other hand, there are 54 wards in Delhi where liquor is over-served some of these wards have more than 10 shops. This means in 20% of Delhi liquor is over-served. It is also to be noted that 50% of liquor shops in Delhi are present in just 45 wards. This clearly shows that in Delhi the liquor sale distribution is very unequal. The maximum revenue is coming from 189 liquor shops of just 46 wards. This also shows that from other areas misappropriation of revenue is taking place,” said Sisodia.The government plans to keep the total number of vends intact, reshuffling them to ensure a more equitable distribution across 272 municipal wards in the city, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area and the Airport, which has been classified as a ‘special zone’.“Delhi will be distributed into pre-defined zones. Each zone will have an equal number of A category, B Category and C Category wards. A category would be the wards where the vends have the history & potential for higher sale, B category would be wards with history & potential for medium-level sale and C category would be wards which have history & potential of low sales. This method of zoning will ensure that each zone operator will have a fair and equal chance of generating optimum revenue,” read the recommendations by a Group of Ministers (GoM) in the document concerning the excise policy.Under the proposed policy, Delhi is supposed to be divided into 30 zones with 27 retail liquor shops in each. Other than that, the NDMC area will be one zone with 29 shops and the airport will be another zone with 10 retail shops.It also recommended that wholesale licenses should only be to experienced distributors who cannot be into manufacturing of liquor and in retail trade. The government in its report cited that manufacturers and retailers doubling up as distributors or using proxies in distribution leads to lapse in duty collection that arise on trade of liquor in each level – starting from a distillery to a household or a bar.The proposed policy also stresses on rationalising licenses. It has either merged or discontinued several licenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-policy-govt-divides-delhi-into-32-zones-to-streamline-excise-earnings-101616455231720.html
23-03-2021||India||Microbreweries likely to be allowed take-away and supply to bars||New Delhi: The proposed excise policy for Delhi allows microbreweries in the city to offer take-away services for draught beer, and supply to bars and restaurants by meeting certain protocols.“Draught beer will be allowed to be taken away in bottles or growlers (pitcher or can like containers used for measuring beer) as applicable in other states such as Punjab and Karnataka. This will help fuel the micro-brewery industry. Draught beer will also be allowed to be served at permitted events who have the P10, P10A P11, P13 license. However, wherever draught beer is being served as a take away, clear signage and information will be needed to put up about its short shelf life and the bottles will have to mention the expiry date clearly,” read the report of group of ministers set up last September.The recommendations were cleared by the Delhi cabinet. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday that the excise department will start drafting the new Delhi Excise Policy, 2021 on the basis of the GoM report.The report also recommended that micro-breweries will be allowed to supply to other bars and restaurants who have L12, L15, L16, L17, L18, L19, L20, L21 licences. It said the orders can only be placed by the these licence holders through a retail vend who will procure the product from an L1 distributor. “Each microbrewery will have to appoint a L1 (wholesale license category) distributor for any off-premise sale. The L1 distributor and the micro-brewery will have the responsibility to reinforce the expiry date and ensure no product outside the expiry date is being sold at the outlets,” the report read.Delhi has only two microbreweries – Ministry of Beer and Connaught Club -- both located in Connaught Place, said a senior official in the excise department.Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, said the proposed move will help in the growth of microbreweries in Delhi, and the owners expand their business. “The move to allow microbreweries use their additional capacity for distribution will be a major relief in the winter months when their capacities usually remain under-utilised because of drop in demand but they still have to pay a flat monthly fee.”In 2015, the Delhi government had introduced a provision in its excise policy to allow restaurants, hotels and clubs to have microbreweries. The first application for licence was received the same year. To be sure, the microbreweries in Gurugram had already existed for several years by then – expanding their range products and splashing big offers. But Delhi had a difficult road ahead.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in the Master Plan 2021 included microbreweries under the category of “liquor-making plants” that are prohibited in the Capital. In September 2018, lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal approved a proposal, which said microbreweries be excluded from the prohibited list. Matters related to land use in the Capital comes under the domain of the L-G.In February 2019, the DDA notified the change. Since then, two microbreweries have been functional in Delhi. According to current rules, a microbrewery can only have a capacity of up to 500 litres per day and has to install an on-site waste treatment plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/microbreweries-likely-to-be-allowed-take-away-and-supply-to-bars-101616455237710.html
23-03-2021||India||Not enough checks at Kumbh mela as concerns of Covid-19 spread mount||A day after the Union health secretary wrote to the state chief secretary raising concerns over “inadequate” preparations to handle Covid-19 spread in Haridwar Mahakumbh amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases across the country, the Haridwar district administration and mela authorities have stepped up the preparations for the same. The administration continues to face challenges given the pilgrim numbers that will turn up during the world’s largest religious congregation.The health department has decided to increase the number of tests during Mahakumbh mela which is scheduled to start from April 1 and go on till April 30. A government order on the same is yet to come. It has also decided to especially focus on the devotees coming from states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, where the cases have significantly increased in the past few days. Many experts are terming it the “second wave” of Covid-19 spread.Chief medical officer, Haridwar, Dr SK Jha said that following the Centre’s instructions to ramp up Covid-19 precautions, the district health department has decided to increase the number of tests in the mela area by roping in private pathology companies also.“To ensure maximum random testing of pilgrims during the peak of Mahakumbh, especially during the Shahi Snans, we would increase the tests by about four times. We have also tied up with seven private pathology companies to conduct the Covid-19 tests,” said Dr Jha.He said that the administration has built a 1,500-bed Covid-19 facility for the purpose of isolating those devotees who test positive for the virus.“Apart from this, six temporary hospitals are also being built in the entire Mahakumbh area. Also, ashrams and medical colleges in Haridwar would also be utilised to ensure adequate beds for Covid-19 isolation during the fair which is expected to witness millions of devotees, especially during the Shahi Snans,” said Dr Jha.Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had earlier eased out the Covid-19 restrictions in the Mahakumbh, including ending the mandatory Covid-19 RT-PCR negative test report, saying that, “the mega-event is held after every 12 years, hence devotees cannot be stopped from coming.” He had also promised to run extra buses to ferry devotees from neighbouring states to Haridwar apart from requesting railways to run extra trains during Shahi Snans during the Mahakumbh.His move was questioned by many experts apart from previous CM Trivendra Singh Rawat who had said that “lifting of restrictions would be highly risky for the state considering the rising number of cases in the country.” Later, on Saturday, during his visit to Haridwar, the chief minister had said that “the faith of devotees will overcome the fear of Covid-19” after which he tested positive for the virus on Monday.As part of precaution, the authorities would also conduct random sampling of people coming from public transport and private vehicles.“If any person is tested positive for the virus in public transport then he would be isolated in the Covid care centres as per the norms. However, if any person coming by his private vehicle tests positive, he would be turned back,” said Mahakumbh nodal health officer Dr AS Sengar. The official said that apart from trained doctors and nurses, medical students would also be deployed in the health facilities during Mahakumbh.He also stressed the strict adherence to Covid-19 precautions by those attending the mega-event.“To ensure compliance with the Centre’s guidelines, mela administration has started making relevant arrangements. Masks will be mandatory for all pilgrims which will be provided to them free of cost. Installing sanitiser dispensers, regular sanitization of Ganga ghats and water tap-soap facility for washing of hands is also being ensured by the mela administration,” he said.He also informed that during the first Shahi Snaan of Mahakumbh on March 11, around twenty teams of health department were formed for random checking of RT-PCR negative reports of pilgrims and tourists staying in hotels, lodges, ashrams, dharamshalas and guest houses.Amid the recent spike in Covid-19 positive cases, the administration on Monday held a meeting with dharamshala, hotels, tour-travel association, and traders to take adequate preventive measures regarding Covid-19.“From now onwards, the authorities would be checking hotels, lodges and dharamshalasas daily to ensure that they are adhering to the Covid guidelines,” said additional mela officer Ramji Sharan Sharma.Apart from the health administration, the police have also geared up to implement the Covid-19 precautions during Mahakumbh.Circle officer Kumbh traffic, Prakash Deoli, said, “Owing to a large number of pilgrims coming from buses and private vehicles, we have already enhanced the infrastructure at border check posts along with a ready to implement route diversion plan in case of pilgrim influx increasing during Mahakumbh.”He added, “The entry points to Haridwar from Narsain, Mandavar, Kali Nadi, Chidiyapur, Chila canal and Raiwala will be manned by state police and paramilitary forces personnel to ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines are followed by all.”The experts are, however, sceptical with the administration’s claims regarding the Covid-19 precautions, especially on the number of tests being done by it on a daily basis in Haridwar.Social activist Anoop Nautiyal, who had been keeping an eye on the pandemic situation in the state since the lockdown, said, “As far as the letter by the Union health secretary to state chief secretary is concerned, it suggests that the state has informed him that the government is conducting about 55,000 Covid-19 tests daily, something that is hard to believe.”“As per the daily health bulletin issued by the state health department, from March 1-21, a total of about 1 lakh tests have been conducted with about 5,000 tests every day, which is much less than what is claimed by the state before the Centre. With the number of cases rising again, the state should ensure foolproof facilities to handle the spread else it could prove very deadly for us considering the limited resources we have,” said Nautiyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-enough-checks-at-kumbh-mela-as-concerns-of-covid-19-spread-mount-101616453809545.html
23-03-2021||India||Holes in NCP defence as Sharad Pawar backs Anil Deshmukh||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar continued to defend his party colleague and Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday, claiming that at the time Deshmukh met police officer Sachin Vaze in February according to former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s tell-all letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the minister was at a Nagpur hospital being treated for Covid-19.This is the second day in a row Pawar has defended Deshmukh, who has been named by Singh as having asked Vaze to collect ₹100 crore a month from restaurants, hotels, and other sources.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was quick to point out that Deshmukh addressed a press conference and also met with a Congress delegation on February 15 and February 8 respectively, and that video and photographic proof of these meetings were posted on Twitter by Deshmukh himself, putting a cloud over Pawar’s defence. This was also raised by some journalists at the NCP chief’s media briefing.The minister subsequently said that he met with the delegation virtually, and that he addressed the conference after his discharge and before going into home quarantine. But the BJP also pointed out that the police officer’s letter mentions the timing of the meeting as February end.The debate over Deshmukh’s whereabouts in February played out even as Singh followed up his letter with a plea in the Supreme Court, seeking an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the charges he has levelled against the minister. Singh was transferred on March 17 for his handling of the Antilia-Vaze-Hiran case, but said in his plea that the transfer was “arbitrary” and “illegal”.Singh did not respond to repeated calls and messages.Chief minister Thackeray has not responded to Singh’s letter so far, although his party, the Shiv Sena, has supported the home minister thus far.In the press briefing, Pawar showed a certificate issued by Alexis multi-specialty Hospital, Nagpur, where Deshmukh was admitted for Covid-19 treatment between February 5 and 15. After being discharged, Deshmukh was home quarantined till February 27, following medical advice, he added.“In view of fresh evidence... it would not be fair to take Anil Deshmukh’s resignation… The BJP’s demand for home minister’s resignation has no substance… I am absolutely clear that allegations made against Deshmukh are incorrect as he was in Nagpur,” the NCP chief said.He also claimed the allegations against Deshmukh are aimed at diverting investigations in the Antilia bomb scare case, in which gelatin sticks were planted in a car parked near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai.“There are some names which need to be investigated, which certain people may not like and thus, allegations were made against the home minister.”The BJP alleged that Pawar is misleading the public.“Shri Sharad Pawar ji said, from 15th to 27th February HM Anil Deshmukh was in home quarantine. But actually along with security guards & media, he was seen taking press conference!,” Fadnavis tweeted.Responding to Fadnavis, home minister Deshmukh said in a video statement that he met the media before leaving the hospital. He added that he was “home quarantined till February 27. I stepped out of my home on February 28”.BJP IT cell’s Amit Malviya also tweeted, “On 8th February, a delegation of the Congress party met Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, claiming that influential voices tweeted against anti-India voices, under pressure from the BJP. Where did the delegation meet Anil Deshmukh? In the hospital?”Reacting on the claims, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the meeting was held online. “I had two online meetings with @AnilDeshmukhNCP one on 8th Feb with a demand to inquire into the tweets of celebrities and another on 24th February to demand investigation into the Delkar suicide case because HM was infected with Covid and was hospitalized and then quarantined.”Pawar earlier suggested a probe by a former senior police officer and suggested former Mumbai Police chief Julio Ribeiro who demurred saying he did not want to get involved in a probe at his age (91) nor wants to “touch such a murky situation”.In his letter, Param Bir Singh accused Deshmukh of asking Vaze to “accumulate ₹100 crore per month” from bars, restaurants, and other establishments. Deshmukh has denied all the allegations. The National Investigation Agency has arrested Vaze in relation with that case.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has named Vaze the prime accused in the murder of Mansukh Hiran, the Thane auto spare parts dealer who was linked to the vehicle in which the explosives were found. Hiran filed a complaint about the car being stolen on February 18. The explosives were found on February 25. Hiran was found dead in a creek on March 5. The ATS arrested two people, Vinayak Shinde and Naresh Gore, in connection with the crime on March 21.Param Bir Singh, who was transferred from his post to Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra, on March 17, made the charges in a letter on March 20, a few days after Deshmukh told reporters that the transfer was not routine but due to “serious and unpardonable mistakes” committed by police officers in the Antilia security scare investigation.The Congress’s senior leaders and state ministers Ashok Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat met Thackeray to discuss the matter on Monday. After the meeting, Thorat said the CM will take a decision and that the home minister’s resignation will not happen just because the Opposition demanded it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holes-in-ncp-defence-as-sharad-pawar-backs-anil-deshmukh-101616449096169.html
23-03-2021||India||Delhi reduces age bar in major liquor reform||The Delhi government on Monday announced it will slash the legal age of drinking in the Capital from 25 to 21, exit the retail alcohol business, and overhaul a labyrinthine tax system as part of a sweeping new policy meant to boost the city’s revenue, crack down on the liquor mafia, and improve user experience.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said no additional liquor shops will be opened and that the government — which runs roughly two-thirds of the city’s 849 vends — will redistribute its stores to the private sector.The new policy will abolish the levying of taxes on each bottle, focusing instead on generating revenue upfront from the auction of store licences. It will introduce age gating, or checking of age proof at establishments.The policy aims at providing a more equitable distribution of stores, scraps several antiquated laws regulating service in restaurants, and reduces the number of dry days from 21 to 3.The steps were cleared by the cabinet on the recommendation of a group of ministers. Sisodia said the excise department will start drafting the new Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, on the basis of the report, and the changes will be sent to the L-G.It could take about three months till the policy is notified, but the government said it expected backlash.“Excise reforms announced today will act as a major blow to liquor mafia in Delhi. The mafia will do everything to obstruct these reforms. AAP govt has ended mafia raj in many sectors like education, water, elect, health etc. We are committed to reforming this sector too,” tweeted chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Queries sent to the L-G’s office with regard to the development remained unanswered at the time of going to the print.“In the policy, proxy ownership of manufacturers or wholesalers in the retail business and low-quality shops will be gone. There will be zero-tolerance to liquor shops creating disturbances in localities. Also, all government liquor shops will shut as it’s not the state’s job to sell liquor,” Sisodia told reporters.He said the excise revenue is projected to increase by ₹1,500-2000 crore annually because of the new policy. Currently, the government gets around ₹6,000 crore from this revenue stream that is important because, unlike full states, Delhi doesn’t have access to all sources of income.For decades, Delhi’s liquor business has been notoriously unwieldy, as reported in a five-part series by HT in February. A high drinking age, coupled with outdated regulation, a thriving liquor mafia, and poor oversight, robbed the government of precious revenue, made premium brands scarce, and soured the experience for customers, especially women. The HT series was mentioned in the GoM report.Sisodia admitted the shortcomings, and said the current retail experience at state-run liquor shops was like jail.“When you go to a shop, there is a grill and people rush and throw money to buy liquor. There is no dignity. Bootlegging and illicit liquor will stop in these areas,” he said.The GoM report notes that Delhi is among a handful of states that kept 25 as the legal age of drinking. “The GoM is of the view that the this should be brought in line with majority of states in India …Hence we recommend the age to be reduced and be brought in parity with these states and especially neighbouring cities like Noida, Ghaziabad etc,” read the report, which was reviewed by Hindustan Times.But the government also stressed on robust checking of age for any patrons. “This concept of age gating is practised internationally and the same should be set up in Delhi,” the report said.The GoM report suggests strict parameters or checks for retail liquor license in Delhi. All liquor vends will need a minimum area of 500 square feet to provide a walk-in experience. Delhi will also have five “super-premium” liquor vends that will be allowed to be open till 11pm, an hour beyond usual vends.“The retail shopping experience for an average customer in Delhi is very pathetic. The scene outside any government vend resembles a zone of mob craving for liquor. The customer has no choice to choose any product and large-scale brand pushing and extra charging happens rampantly. The customers are made to feel like criminals,” the report read. Brand pushing refers to a practice of suppressing certain brands and pushing others, often at the behest of colluding manufacturers and retailers.For the retail trade, the government will divide the Capital into 32 zones — including an airport and an NDMC zone — where the existing 849 vends will be redistributed equitably. It has proposed three categories of retail liquor vends – high sale (category A), medium sale (B), and low sale (C), with the same number of vends under each category. The airport zone will have 10 stores and NDMC 29.To end cartelisation and brand pushing, the draft policy prohibits alcohol manufacturers from opening liquor stores. In wholesale, the government intends to introduce L1 license that will be issued only to high-end professional companies with years of distribution experience comparable to global industry standards.“Many wholesalers are able to acquire retail licenses through proxy ownership in the existing system. This highly prevalent, though illegal, form of dual ownership facilitates and makes it possible to indulge in sale of non-duty paid liquor… No manufacturer to be given the new L1 wholesale license. Any manufacturer that wishes to sell its product in Delhi will have to choose one of the licensed L1 distributors,” the report stated.Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said the reforms will give a big boost to the food and beverages industry. “While we await the formal release of the detailed policy document, we are very hopeful that they will be very progressive and will significantly change the way Delhi looks at the business of bars,” he said.The Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the move. “The truth is that actually government liquor shops were a hurdle for private liquor mafia to sell cheap brands of other states in Delhi, and now the Kejriwal government has given them the freedom,” said Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reduces-age-bar-in-major-liquor-reform-101616448593581.html
23-03-2021||India||Widen gap in Covishield jabs to 6-8 weeks: Centre||The second dose of Covishield can be given up to eight weeks after the first, the Union health ministry said in a statement on Monday, expanding the maximum interval between the two shots from six weeks after the practice appeared to yield a higher efficacy in preventing Covid-19.The decision is likely to also help cover more people during the current vaccination campaign as it will allow hospitals and clinics to give out more first doses to people instead of worrying about stocking adequate supplies for second doses for the time being.“In view of the emerging scientific evidence, the interval between two doses of a specific Covid-19 vaccine i.e. Covishield, has been revisited by National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and subsequently by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) in its 20th meeting. During this meeting the recommendation has been revised to provide 2nd dose of Covishield at 4-8 weeks’ interval after the 1st dose, instead of earlier practiced interval of 4-6 weeks,” said the health ministry statement.The increased interval does not apply to Covaxin, the other coronavirus vaccine India uses.Covishield is the made-in-India version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca AZD1222 vaccine. The Co-WIN platform dashboard showed on Monday evening that it accounted for 92% of the 46 million doses given till 6.30pm across the country.India opened up its vaccination drive for the priority groups among the general public on March 1. As per the schedule decided at first, those who got Covishield would need to get their second doses by mid-April. Now, they can wait until the end of April to do so.Experts in the field said the move to increase the interval will benefit the programme in the long run. “It is possible (there will be better protection) based on immunogenicity and UK trial efficacy data. The US data indicates good protection with shorter intervals, so real world monitoring will show how much extending the gap matters,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccine experts.A recommendation to delay second doses of AZD1222 was first made by UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in December, when the group of experts cited data and an urgency to speed up first shots while the country grappled with a serious wave of infections.On February 1, a group of experts led by those from University of Oxford disclosed new phase III trial data to The Lancet for peer review supporting the decision. The data showed that expanding the interval between the two doses of the vaccine to three months helped increase the efficacy rate to 82.4%, compared to 54.9% if the second dose was given less than six weeks after the first.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan communicated the NTAGI and NEGVAC recommendation on Monday to the chief secretaries of all states and union territories. “Keeping the existing scientific evidence in view, it appears that protection is enhanced if the second dose of Covishield is administered between 6-8 weeks, but not later than stipulated period of 8 weeks,” the letter said.Bhushan also urged the states to instruct officials concerned accordingly, to undertake necessary steps to widely disseminate the message of revised dosing interval and ensure adherence to the revised dosing interval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widen-gap-in-covishield-jabs-to-6-8-weeks-centre-101616447853860.html
23-03-2021||India||Twist of faith: Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat tests Covid positive||Two days after Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said “faith will overcome the fear of the virus”, while defending the relaxing of safety norms during the Kumbh festival in Haridwar, he tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.Rawat was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi this week, but the trip was called off after he contracted the contagious pathogen.“My Corona test report has come positive. I am fine and not facing any difficulty. I have isolated myself under the monitoring of doctors. Those of you who have come into contact with me in last few days, should be cautious and get their tests done. I wish good health to all,” Rawat tweeted.He visited Haridwar three times after becoming CM on March 10, and mingled with pilgrims and ascetics, with hardly anyone following Covid safety norms. Rawat was not wearing a mask in several images taken of him in Haridwar on the day of the “shahi snan” (holy dip) on March 11, when the crowds swelled to 3.3 million.After Rawat took over as CM, he said that there should not be any restrictions on pilgrims wishing to come to Mahakumbh after April 1. Two days ago, during a visit to Haridwar, Rawat said: “Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus.”Worried about the situation in Haridwar in the context of the Mahakumbh and Rawat’s statements, the Centre on Sunday wrote to the Uttarakhand government to take stringent measures to check Covid spread during the Kumbh.Haridwar has highest active cases of all 13 districts in the state at the moment.Since taking over as chief minister of the state on March 10, Rawat has courted several controversies.On Sunday, at a public function, he said that “the US had enslaved India for 200 years”, and questioned why people do not have 20 children if they wanted more subsidised rations during Covid.On March 16, Rawat objected to people, particularly women, wearing ripped jeans.“Ripped jeans paves the way for societal breakdown and is a bad example parents set for their children. Wearing ripped jeans is not our culture but aping westernisation,” he said.Rights activists and the opposition Congress slammed the CM over his comments.“Don’t know what has happened to the CM. Is it lack of wisdom or lack of education or is he doing it deliberately? First, he made a derogatory statement on the attire of women, and then he made a highly insulting statement on producing children”, Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twist-of-faith-uttarakhand-cm-tirath-singh-rawat-tests-covid-positive-101616447083279.html
23-03-2021||India||UP, MP sign deal on linking of Ken and Betwa rivers; experts flag concerns||Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for starting work on country’s first major project interlinking two rain-fed rivers, Ken and Betwa, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as environmental activists said the project would spell doom for the Panna tiger reserve which is known for its critically endangered white-rumped vultures besides a thriving big cat population.The MoA was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived as a part of country’s ambitious programme to interlink rivers to provide water to areas facing scarcity. Officials said the delay was because of no agreement between the two states on sharing of water during the lean supply months, November to April.The Uttar Pradesh government, which was initially demanding 930 million cubic meter (MCM) water during the Rabi (winter crop) season, settled for 750 MCM while Madhya Pradesh will receive 1,834 MCM water, said an officer of the MP water resources department.According to the project report, 2,800 MCM of water will be diverted from the Ken basin to the water-deficit Betwa basin through a 73.8 meter high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in MP’s Chhattarpur district.The report also said 6,017 hectares forest land of Panna Tiger Reserve and the Ken Ghariyal Sanctuary would be submerged in the dam reservoir.MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said people of nine Madhya Pradesh districts, Sagar, Chhatarpur, Vidisha, Shivpuri, Raisen, Damoh, Panna and Tikamgarh, and four districts of Uttra Pradesh, Mahoba, Jhansi, Lalitpur and Banda will benefit from the project.“About 1 million hectares of land will get irrigated and 6.2 million people, mostly in water deficit Bundelkhand region, will get drinking water,” he added.There is, however, opposition to the project from the Panna royal family and environmentalists. “It is very sad that the government and experts overlooked the possible impact of the project on diamond mining in Panna and wildlife in the area. We will lose our world famous diamond site for ever,” said Maharani Jiteshwari Judevi of Panna royal family.Judevi said, “According to a report of 1938 on Diamond mines, the production of diamond took place naturally in Panna and it being excavated since 15th century. The seepage of water due to the dam will reduce the temperature and also reduce the level of nitrogen which is important for the natural production of diamond. I am raising this issue and I want a scientific study should be done to check the impact of dam water on diamond mine.”Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People (SANDRP) said it was “very unfortunate” that the Central and state governments signed an MoA on World Water Day even though the project would proved to be a curse for water conservation.“According to a report of the forest advisory committee, an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project. This will lead to poor rainfall in an already parched Bundelkhand,” he added.He said that the project will also destroy Panna Tiger Reserve, home to over 52 tigers and several species of endangered vultures, including the white-rumped vulture. Of the nine vulture species found in India, six can be seen in Panna, which has run a successful vulture population revival programme.Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC), have raised doubts about the project. A petition opposing the approval to the project is pending before the Supreme Court.“We are sure the project won’t get forest clearance,” Thakkar said.Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh feared the project would destroy local ecology. “The CMs of UP and MP will sign a pact today to link the Ken and Betwa rivers. This will all but destroy the Panna Tiger Reserve in MP, a success story in translocation and revival. I had suggested alternatives 10 years ago but alas,” he tweeted earlier in the day.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office said the project will “also pave the way for more interlinking of river projects to ensure that scarcity of water does not become an inhibitor for development in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-mp-sign-deal-on-linking-of-ken-and-betwa-rivers-experts-flag-concerns-101616446673949.html
23-03-2021||India||To increase cap on reservation, Karnataka to approach Supreme Court||The Karnataka government on Monday decided to inform the Supreme Court that it favours increasing the cap on reservation beyond the 50% ceiling that would pave the way for chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to heed the growing demands from dominant and politically influential communities for reservation.“The decision to approach the SC was taken today,” said a cabinet minister of the Karnataka government, requesting not to be named.The cabinet decided to inform the apex court to increase the cap on reservation on employment and education on the back of growing number of calls from several communities, seeking an increase in opportunities.However, the state is yet to file an affidavit before the SC, according to a person aware of the developments.At least five other states --- Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand --- in the country have decided to ask the highest court to increase reservation caps. The reservation in government jobs and education has been capped at 50% by the SC in a 1992 order by a nine-judge Constitution bench. However, the apex court allowed the relaxation of this cap provided there was enough scientific data to justify the raising of the cap.Dominant communities like the Panchamasali, a sub sect of Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Valmikis and Kurubas among others have sought a higher allocation of reservation-based opportunities and a change in category among other requests. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who has been under immense pressure to heed these requests, had set up a committee to study these requests.Yediyurappa, known for his reservation-based politics, has tried to assuage the demands of these dominant communities to earn their support in the 2023 assembly elections. A Lingayat himself, Yediyurappa has enjoyed the support of the community and has attempted to further consolidate the community’s support to fuel his ambition of bringing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power on its own in 2023. He has reached out to communities that are not known to back the BJP as well. The dominant Vokkaliga community, found in large numbers in the Old Mysuru region, are known to back former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) while backward classes, the Kurubas and minorities among others are seen to back the Congress.By heeding these requests for higher allocations and even change of category of reservation, Yediyurappa is attempting to expand the support base of the saffron party, analysts said.The Panchamasalis called off their agitation in Bengaluru after assurances by the chief minister while other communities have kept the heat on the chief minister.Yediyurappa is reported to have further strained his relations with the BJP’s top central leadership and has battled dissent within his government, the opposition and growing reservation demands to remain in power at least till the next elections.Yediyurappa has allocated ₹500 crore each to the Lingayats and Vokkaligas and another ₹50 crore for the Brahmin community in the state. He has also budgeted ₹1500 crore for minorities in the state budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-increase-cap-on-reservation-karnataka-to-approach-supreme-court-101616442832261.html
23-03-2021||India||Sachin Vaze stayed at 5-star hotel using forged Aadhaar card, fake name: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday conducted a search in a five star hotel in South Mumbai where suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, arrested for his alleged role in planting the explosive-laden Mahindra Scorpio found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month, was staying recently.NIA officials said that a team conducted a search in a room in the Trident hotel at Nariman Point where Vaze reportedly resided from February 16 to February 20. Vaze reportedly booked the hotel room with a forged Aadhar card using his photograph with fictitious name, said an NIA official.A senior official said that documents and CCTV footage have been recovered from the hotel.“The case is being investigated by NIA and anti–terrorism squad (ATS). The probe is ongoing and we are extending our fullest cooperation,” a spokesperson of the hotel said.Read more: Mansukh Hiran murder mystery solved, Sachin Vaze the prime accused, says Maharashtra ATSA Mumbai Police officer said that those dates coincided with the time when Vaze was part of a team that raided various establishments in Mumbai at night for violations of licence conditions such staying open at night beyond allowed hours, among other reasons.Vaze also reported for work at the crime intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch during those dates.The NIA team seized some documents from the hotel room, but it is not clear what the documents pertain to as yet. The team has also seized the CCTV footage from the hotel to probe who all met Vaze at the hotel.On March 13, Vaze, who was the lead investigator in the case, was arrested by NIA which took over the probe earlier this month. Vaze has also been named prime accused in the murder of Mansukh Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane businessman who was linked to the Scorpio.Read more: How Param Bir Singh-Deshmukh faceoff puts NCP chief Sharad Pawar in a tough spotAn NIA team visited Hiran’s home to record the statements of his wife Vimala and other family members.The Union home ministry had transferred the murder probe, currently being conducted by the Maharashtra ATS, to NIA on March 20. “The NIA had come home to explain us the status of their investigation and informed that they will take all the details from ATS in the coming days. As of now they haven’t officially filed any case in the murder of my brother. They told us that they will come to meet us in next two days with more information on the case. They have not shed light on the role of Shinde or the bookie to us. They stayed for a short time and left,” Hiran’s brother Vinod said.ATS had on Sunday arrested two persons in connection with Hiran’s murder: a former constable Vinayak Shinde and a bookie Naresh Gor. Shinde, convicted in an encounter killing, was released on parole last year during the decongestion of prisons due to the pandemic.Vinod claimed that Hiran’s family is satisfied with the pace of the investigation and hope it will be resolved soon.A Scorpio that Hiran had been driving for three years and reported stolen on February 18, was found parked outside Ambani’s residence Antilia on February 25. It had 20 sticks of gelatin (but no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani.Vimla’s statement to the ATS revealed that Vaze had borrowed this car from Hiran last year, and returned it to him on February 5.Read more: Hiran reported the car stolen on February 18. On February 25, the car was found parked outside Antilia with two identical sets of three different registration number plates kept beneath the rear seat of the vehicle, and its own engine number and body number of the vehicle removed. Even the chassis number embossed on the car near right front wheel was wiped out.The Gamdevi police registered an FIR in the case on multiple charges. On March 7, on the basis of a statement given by Vimala, ATS registered a murder case against an unknown person and started the probe. The next day, NIA took over the probe into the Gamdevi FIR after orders from the Union home ministry..Who is Shinde?In 2013, a Mumbai sessions court had awarded life sentences to 21 people, including 13 Mumbai Police personnel, for an encounter killing of a gangster named Lakkhan Bhaiyya (Ramnarayan Gupta) in 2006. Gupta was a member of the dreaded Chota Rajan gang.One of the policemen convicted was Vinayak Shinde, 55, a constable, who was released on parole last year in the state’s drive to decongest prisons during the coronavirus pandemic.Shinde is one of the co-accused, along with bookie Naresh Gore and prime suspect Sachin Vaze, a suspended assistant inspector currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), in the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.According to investigators of the state Anti Terrorism Squad, Shinde took care of Vaze’s “illegal dealings in Thane and Kalwa areas” and executed the murder of Hiran on Vaze’s behest.Shinde was in Mumbai Crime branch in the mid 2000s and had a good network in Mumbai as well as Thane. “Shinde has a good network across Thane and also has connections with local goons,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity.One of Shinde’s family members said that after he came out of parole, he would stay home. Shinde celebrated his birthday on March 11 with his family at his house.With inputs from Anamika Gharat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-vaze-stayed-at-5-star-hotel-using-forged-aadhaar-card-fake-name-nia-101616440213246.html
23-03-2021||India||SC notice to Centre on guidelines against runaway NRI grooms||Moved by the plight of women abandoned by runaway non-resident Indian (NRI) grooms in the country as well as abroad, the Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider a fresh plea for issuing guidelines to police, immigration authorities and Indian embassies to ensure speedy justice to such victims.A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian directed the Centre to file its reply by July this year on the guidelines needed to protect the brides who are abandoned, abused or divorced by NRI grooms against whom neither any court proceedings are maintainable nor criminal proceedings can be initiated as their location is not known.The petition was filed in the year 2019 by NGO Pravasi Legal Cell along with two victims fighting a legal battle against their truant grooms settled abroad. The Court directed this petition to be taken up along with a pending petition filed by one Smita Kudaisya where the same issue is already under consideration.The petition by Pravasi Legal Cell filed through advocate Jose Abraham pointed out that in cases where NRI grooms abandon or dupe gullible women in India, police refuse to register a first information report against the husband due to the absence of his overseas address. Even courts cannot proceed with the case as service of summons or warrants to the husbands who are settled abroad becomes difficult.One of the co-petitioners married an NRI settled in Germany and faced severe brutality and harassment there for want of dowry. She managed to reach India and filed a domestic violence case. After much difficulty, she located the new address of her husband to serve him summons through the embassy.The other co-petitioner has not been so lucky. After being married to a Dubai-based NRI, the husband filed for divorce in a local Delhi court. When the wife moved a petition seeking maintenance, the husband fled the country and remains untraced to date. Further maintenance proceedings have been halted as notice cannot be served to the husband.The petition further stated that no help is forthcoming from embassies for Indian brides who are duped or abandoned by NRI grooms in foreign countries. “The embassies do not even bother to respond to the cries of distress of Indian citizens. When the women contact the police of the foreign country directly they are informed by the police that privacy laws do not permit the police to give away the location of their husbands,” the petition stated.The population of Indians settled overseas is quite significant. A report prepared by the United Nations recently pegs the population of the Indian diaspora across the world at 18 million.“Looking at this figure, it becomes imperative on part of the government to immediately frame necessary guideline to be followed by the police, the immigration department and embassies throughout the world for professional and speedy justice to be provided to the women abandoned by their husbands,” the petition added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-centre-on-guidelines-against-runaway-nri-grooms-101616440198239.html
23-03-2021||India||UK ‘blames’ SII for delay vaccines priority in India as cases surge: Officials||Vaccine supplies to India have taken a priority as the country records a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, people aware of supply and sourcing have said, amid remarks from officials in the UK that appeared to blame delays in deliveries from Serum Institute of India for a shortfall in its estimated stock of doses.On Thursday, British health secretary Matt Hancock said a delayed delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines made by the Serum Institute, in addition to the need to retest them, would postpone its immunisation program. The same day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country would receive fewer vaccines than planned a week ago, in part because of a shortfall from the Serum Institute.“The company has already supplied 5 million doses to UK with the aim of assisting the country in their vaccination programme. There were 5 million more doses to be supplied but since the situation is changing on a day-to-day basis, and new cases rising in India over the past few weeks, the home country has taken priority,” said one of the people familiar with the developments.“Also, India is ramping up its vaccination drive that has also increased the demand for vaccine doses,” this person added.Officials in the Union health ministry refuted allegations that the government had stopped the company from exporting its Covid-19 vaccine doses.“The government has not issued any directions to Serum regarding not to export their Covid vaccine,” said a senior central government official, who asked not to be named.Serum Institute of India is locally manufacturing Oxford-AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine— AZD1222— as the Covishield. It is one of two vaccines approved in India, and accounts for over 92% of the doses given till Monday.“Dear Countries & governments, as you wait Covishield supplies, I humbly request you to please be patient, serum institute of india has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world. We are trying out best,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said in a tweet on February 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-blames-sii-for-delay-vaccines-priority-in-india-as-cases-surge-officials-101616438721246.html
23-03-2021||India||Row over Maharashtra minister rocks Parliament||Protests erupted in Parliament on Monday over the allegations of corruption by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, with Union minister Anurag Thakur demanding appropriate action against the state minister.The Rajya Sabha was adjourned amid protests and the Lok Sabha also saw sharp exchanges between Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and Shiv Sena MPs. In the Lower House, BJP MP Manoj Kotak demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the matter.Speaking during the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, Thakur said that the allegation that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore per month was a “matter of concern”.“The MPs not only from Maharashtra, but from all over India are concerned about the serious allegation of corruption (against Anil Deshmukh ) in Maharashtra... The state government should take appropriate action on the issue,” he said before many ruling party MPs raked up the issue during Zero Hour.Last week, former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh said that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore monthly from bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai.In the Lok Sabha, BJP MP Rakesh Sinha emphasised that the allegations were raised by a former top cop and said: “The House wants to know why an API of Mumbai police was given a target of ₹100 crore? Perhaps this is the first such event in the country.”Sena MP Vinayak Raut alleged that the developments are a part of a larger conspiracy and the BJP is trying to topple the Maharashtra government. Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu termed the developments as a serious matter but questioned why principals of federalism were broken in all Opposition-ruled states, and central agencies were interfering.“The officers are always the main culprits. But they get away while we politicians fight against each other,” Bittu said. “We can fight against each other in assemblies, newspapers or Parliament. But any officers who are guilty should not get away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-maharashtra-minister-rocks-parliament-101616438734191.html
23-03-2021||India||Ashoka University students begin class boycott, demand changes||Students at Ashoka University began their two-day boycott of classes on Monday to demand changes in the university, including divesting of administrative powers from founders of the university to elected students, administrative, and faculty members.The boycott came in connection with the resignation of two professors Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian last week, and despite a statement issued Sunday by the two, and the university expressing “deep regret” at the exits and acknowledging “lapses in institutional processes.”While the students boycotted most of the classes during the day, nearly 900 students attended a scheduled class by Pratap Bhanu Mehta and discussed Karl Marx and his celebrated work Das Kapital.“This was a scheduled class on Western Political Thought and we discussed Karl Marx and his work as it is in our syllabus. There was no discussion on the current crisis and the class took place normally. Since it was made open for all students at the university, nearly 600 students attended the class using a digital platform along with hundreds who were already present on the campus,” said Biplob Kumar Das, 21, a final-year undergraduate student of Political Science at the varsity. The university’s students’ body – Ashoka University Student Government – said in total around 900 students attended the lecture.News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday (he resigned on March 15) and caused a stir among students, faculty, and the larger academic community in India and overseas. In his resignation he wrote that “after a meeting with Founders, it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability” on account of his “public writing”. On Friday, Subramanian, former chief economic advisor, resigned saying Mehta’s exit reflected poorly on the university’s ability to protect academic freedom.On Sunday, Mehta wrote to students asking them not to “press the matter” and the university’s chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee wrote in a letter to students and faculty that the founders “never interfered with academic freedom.”The board of trustees met the students’ body on Sunday, but the previously planned boycott wasn’t called off.Dozens of students were present at the university campus on Monday wearing black to register their dissent over the exits of Mehta and Subramanian . The boycott of classes is slated to continue till Tuesday.While students boycotted most of the classes on Monday, they said that some classes were held using non-university resources.A major demand of students has been to hold an open meeting with University founders. Despite repeated calls, messages, and e-mails, university officials refused to comment on the matter.The Board of Trustees, however, said on Monday that the founders “have never interfered with, nor do they intend to interfere, with academic functioning of the university.”“The founders are supportive with the appointment of the Ombudsperson (as had been decided earlier) by May 31 2021. The Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor will propose candidates for this position for approval by the Governing Body,” the statement read.The statement also called for strengthening existing protocols and processes like the Academic Council and Board of Management which separate academic functioning from Founders.University officials including Ashoka University chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee, vice-chancellor Malabika Sarkar, chairperson of Board of Trustees, Ashish Dhawan on Sunday assured students in a statement, also signed by Mehta and Subramanian that they would work to resolve the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashoka-university-students-begin-class-boycott-demand-changes-101616438765195.html
23-03-2021||India||Bengaluru edu institutes new hotbed of Covid||Educational institutions have become one of the most vulnerable spots for Covid-19in Bengaluru after several colleges reported a number of cases in the last two months, government officials said on Monday. More than 5,800 studentsare in quarantine and active surveillance after a Covid-19 cluster was reported in Udupi district’s Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT) on Sunday. While Karnataka did not announced any lockdown in the state, for the students of the MIT a lockdown is in place after 188 acres campus was declared a containment zone by the district administration.MIT is the latest in a list of colleges, schools and hostels to be hit by the pandemic.Sambhram College of Management Studies (with nine cases), Agragami College (five), Manjushree Nursing College (40), two government high schools (24), Arya Eediga Girls Hostel (15) and Inspire Livesuit PG (eight cases) in Bengaluruwere some of the institutions in the state where the clusters were reported.ven as educational institutions are becoming a matter of concern for the health officials, as the number of cases is on the rise, no decision on closing the educational institutions have been taken by the government. A senior health department official said the government will take a decision on closing educational institutions after consulting the education department and other concerned officialsWhile institutes like MIT where a large number of cases was declared containment zones, Maharani Cluster University in Bengaluru which reported two cases, decided to send residents back home. On Saturday, after a student and a staff member tested positive for the virus, Maharani Cluster University Vice-chancellor Gomathi Devi asked students of first and third semester students residing in hostels to return home. Withmore than 5,000 studentsin quarantine, offline classes have been suspended at MIT. Students have been asked to stay in their rooms, said Narayana Sabhahit, registrar of MIT. “We are continuing online classes wherever possible. For those tested positive, a separate section has been arranged in the hostel, where doctors will be monitoring them. For the test of then students, movement within the campus has been restricted,” he said. However, the process has not been easy. A parent of an MIT student who had tested positive said his son was moved to a separate hotel floor only two days after his test results came. “There was no clarity on whether he would get treatment or checkups during this time. It was only after he was moved to the new ward, a doctor checked him,” the father said on the condition of anonymity. Sabhahit said that since there was a spike in the number of cases, it took time for the institute to make the arrangements. Meanwhile, Bangalore University has asked students who live 40 kilometres from their campus to return home if possible. However, outstation students have been allowed to stay back. While some institutions are struggling with the implementation of the containment rules, institutes that witnessed clusters but that are no longer containment zones, are slowly trying to restart operations. An administration officer of Agragami college, which was declared a containment zone on February 27 said on Monday the restrictions were lifted in the second week of March. “We are now preparing to conduct examinations in the college. We are taking all precautions and we have informed the authorities as well.

While Karnataka has not announced any lockdown, for the students of the MIT, a lockdown is in place after 188 acres campus was declared a containment zone. MIT is the latest in a list of colleges, schools and hostels hit by the pandemic in the state. Officials say that educational institutions have been one of the most vulnerable sections with several institutions in Bengaluru reporting Covid-19 clusters in the last two months. Sambhram College of Management Studies, Agragami College, Manjushree Nursing College, two government high schools, Arya Eediga Girls Hostel and Inspire Livesuit PG were some of the institutions in the state where the clusters were reported. The response from the educational institutions has been different since the government has not decided on whether institutes should be closed once again. While institutes like MIT, which has a large number of cases, were declared containment zones, Maharani Cluster University in Bengaluru, which reported two cases, decided to send residents back home. On Saturday, after the student and staff member tested positive for the virus, Maharani Cluster University’s vice-chancellor Gomathi Devi asked first and third semester students residing in hostels to return home. Meanwhile, Bangalore University has asked students, who live 40 kilometres from their campus, to return home if possible. However, outstation students have been allowed to stay back. In the case of Manipal University, with more than 5,000 students in quarantine, offline classes have been suspended. Students have been asked to stay in their rooms, said Narayana Sabhahit, registrar of MIT. “We are continuing online classes wherever possible. For those who have tested positive, a separate section has been arranged in the hostel where doctors will be monitoring them. For the rest of the students, movement within the campus has been restricted,” he said. However, the process has not been easy. A parent of an MIT student who tested positive said his son was moved to a separate hotel floor only two days after his test results came. “There was no clarity on whether he would get treatment or checkups during this time. It was only after he was moved to the new ward, a doctor checked him,” the father said on condition of anonymity. Sabhahit said that since there was a spike in the number of cases, it took time for the institute to make the arrangements. While some institutions are struggling with the implementation of the containment rules, institutes that witnessed clusters but that are no longer containment zones are slowly trying to restart operations. An administration officer of Agragami college, which was declared a containment zone on February 27, said the restrictions were lifted in the second week of March. “We are now preparing to conduct examinations in the college. We are taking all precautions and we have informed the authorities as well. All students who will appear for the examination will have to produce a negative test report,” the college officials said. Even as Covid-19 cases in educational institutions are becoming a matter of concern for the health officials, no decision on closing the institutions have been taken by the government. A senior health department official said the government will decide on closing educational institutions after consulting the education department and other concerned officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/educational-institutes-become-hub-of-covid-19-clusters-in-karnataka-101616438991770.html
23-03-2021||India||Covid-19: Panel to meet this week over Sputnik V approval||The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is likely to meet sometime this week to consider the emergency use application of the Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V, according to officials aware of the matter, who asked not to be named.An approval to Sputnik V will add a third inoculation to India’s arsenal of vaccines, which could be crucial in the fight against the pandemic at a time when the country is grappling with a resurgence in cases. The dose, made by the Gamaleya Research Institute, is 91.6% effective in preventing Covid-19, according to clinical trial findings.“The committee looking into Covid related application could convene any time this week,” said an official in the know of things. During the last meeting on the matter, the experts asked for safety and immunogenicity data from Sputnik V’s phase II/III trials being conducted in India.Sputnik V’s backers, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has tied up with five India-based pharma companies for production. The latest of these deals was announced on Monday. Virchow Biotech will produce 200 million doses, the RDIF announced.“Vaccine partnerships are the only way to overcome the pandemic. The world continues its fight against coronavirus and we see a growing interest in Sputnik V vaccine as it is one of the most efficient vaccines available. The agreement with Virchow Biotech is an important step to facilitate the full-scale local production of the vaccine in India and to supply our international partners globally,” said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer f the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).Virchow indicated the production is likely to be for “international partners” of RDIF. “The technology transfer is expected to be completed in the Q2 of 2021 followed by full-scale commercial production of Sputnik V. Virchow Biotech capacities will help facilitate global supply of Sputnik V to international partners of RDIF,” the statement read.Tummuru Murali, managing director of Virchow Biotech, said, “We are glad to sign a cooperation agreement with RDIF to produce the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine. Virchow’s proven capabilities in large-scale drug substance manufacturing should help meet the global demand for this vaccine. We are also happy to learn of the positive feedback that this vaccine has been receiving from all сountries.”On Friday, RDIF announced its partnership with Stelis Biopharma, the biopharmaceutical division of Strides, a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in India, to produce and supply a minimum of 200 million vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-panel-to-meet-this-week-over-sputnik-v-approval-101616436714463.html
23-03-2021||India||UK ‘blames’ SII for delay Vaccines priority in India as cases surge: Officials||Vaccine supplies to India have taken a priority as the country records a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, people aware of supply and sourcing have said, amid remarks from officials in the UK that appeared to blame delays in deliveries from Serum Institute of India for a shortfall in its estimated stock of doses.On Thursday, British health secretary Matt Hancock said a delayed delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines made by the Serum Institute, in addition to the need to retest them, would postpone its immunisation program. The same day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country would receive fewer vaccines than planned a week ago, in part because of a shortfall from the Serum Institute.“The company has already supplied 5 million doses to UK with the aim of assisting the country in their vaccination programme. There were 5 million more doses to be supplied but since the situation is changing on a day-to-day basis, and new cases rising in India over the past few weeks, the home country has taken priority,” said one of the people familiar with the developments.“Also, India is ramping up its vaccination drive that has also increased the demand for vaccine doses,” this person added.Officials in the Union health ministry refuted allegations that the government had stopped the company from exporting its Covid-19 vaccine doses.“The government has not issued any directions to Serum regarding not to export their Covid vaccine,” said a senior central government official, who asked not to be named.Serum Institute of India is locally manufacturing Oxford-AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine— AZD1222— as the Covishield. It is one of two vaccines approved in India, and accounts for over 92% of the doses given till Monday. “Dear Countries & governments, as you wait Covishield supplies, I humbly request you to please be patient, serum institute of india has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world. We are trying out best,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said in a tweet on February 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-blames-sii-for-delay-vaccines-priority-in-india-as-cases-surge-officials-101616438571137.html
23-03-2021||India||Gandhi Peace Prize for Mujibur Rahman, late Sultan of Oman||India on Monday announced the Gandhi Peace Prize for the years 2019 and 2020 will be conferred on late Omani Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said and Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, respectively, for their contributions to social and political transformation through non-violent methods. Both Sultan Qaboos, who died last year, and Rahman were unanimously selected for the prize by a jury chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 19. The award carries an amount of ₹1 crore, a citation, a plaque and a traditional handicraft or handloom item. A special exception was made for the award to be conferred on the two leaders, as the selection procedure does not allow the Gandhi Peace Prize to be awarded posthumously, people familiar with the development said. However, given the contributions of Sultan Qaboos and Rahman to peace, non-violence and amelioration of human sufferings and their special relationship with India, an exception was made as a special gesture to honour and celebrate them, the people cited above said. The prize is given for social, economic and political transformation through non-violence and other Gandhian methods. The Gandhi Peace Prize recognises the “immense and unparalleled contribution” of Rahman in “inspiring the liberation of Bangladesh, bringing stability to a nation born out of strife, laying the foundation for the close and fraternal relations between India and Bangladesh, and promoting peace and non-violence in the Indian subcontinent”, an official statement said. The announcement came days ahead of Modi’s two-day visit to Dhaka from March to participate in celebrations marking the birth centenary of Rahman, the father of nation of Bangladesh, 50 years of the country’s independence and the golden jubilee of diplomatic relations between the two countries. According to the statement, Modi said “Bangabandhu”, as Rahman is popularly known, was a champion of human rights and freedom, and a hero to Indians as well. He added that Rahman’s legacy and inspiration has made the “heritage of both countries more comprehensive and deep-rooted”, and the path shown by him has “laid a strong foundation for the partnership, progress and prosperity of both countries over the last decade”. India is honoured to commemorate Rahman’s legacy jointly with the Bangladeshi government and people as the neighbouring country celebrates his birth centenary, the official statement said. The Gandhi Peace Prize for Sultan Qaboos recognises his “unparalleled vision and leadership” in strengthening India-Oman relations and his efforts to promote peace and non-violence in the Gulf, the statement read. Modi had recalled Sultan Qaboos’ contribution to India-Oman ties when he passed away in January last year, saying that he was “a true friend of India and provided strong leadership for developing a strategic partnership” between the two sides. Sultan Qaboos’ twin policy of moderation and mediation in addressing international issues won him praise and respect across the globe, the official statement said. He played an important role in supporting peace efforts in various regional disputes and conflicts. The sultan had studied in India and always maintained a special relationship with the country. India and Oman became strategic partners under his leadership.“The Government of Bangladesh acknowledges with deep gratitude the decision of the Government of India to confer the Gandhi Peace Prize 2020 to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, posthumously for the first time. It is an honour for Bangladesh and its people for the Father of the Nation to be bestowed with this prestigious award,” Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs said.The other members of the jury were the Chief Justice, the leader of the single largest Opposition party in the Lok Sabha, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, and Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh International Social Service Organisation. Past awardees include former Tanzania president Julius Nyerere, Gerhard Fischer of Germany, the Ramakrishna Mission, Baba Amte, former South African president Nelson Mandela, the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, Chandi Prasad Bhatt and the Indian Space Research Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gandhi-peace-prize-for-mujibur-rahman-late-sultan-of-oman-101616438512485.html
23-03-2021||India||Row over Maha minister rocks Parliament||Protests erupted in Parliament on Monday over the allegations of corruption by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, with Union minister Anurag Thakur demanding appropriate action against the state minister.The Rajya Sabha was adjourned amid protests and the Lok Sabha also saw sharp exchanges between Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and Shiv Sena MPs. In the Lower House, BJP MP Manoj Kotak demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the matter.Speaking during the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, Thakur said that the allegation that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore per month was a “matter of concern”.“The MPs not only from Maharashtra, but from all over India are concerned about the serious allegation of corruption (against Anil Deshmukh ) in Maharashtra... The state government should take appropriate action on the issue,” he said before many ruling party MPs raked up the issue during Zero Hour.Last week, former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh said that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore monthly from bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai.In the Lok Sabha, BJP MP Rakesh Sinha emphasised that the allegations were raised by a former top cop and said: “The House wants to know why an API of Mumbai police was given a target of ₹100 crore? Perhaps this is the first such event in the country.”Sena MP Vinayak Raut alleged that the developments are a part of a larger conspiracy and the BJP is trying to topple the Maharashtra government. Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu termed the developments as a serious matter but questioned why principals of federalism were broken in all Opposition-ruled states, and central agencies were interfering.“The officers are always the main culprits. But they get away while we politicians fight against each other,” Bittu said. “We can fight against each other in assemblies, newspapers or Parliament. But any officers who are guilty should not get away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-maha-minister-rocks-parliament-101616438451108.html
23-03-2021||India||Param Bir Singh moves SC for CBI probe against Deshmukh||Shunted out over the case of explosives being found in an abandoned SUV outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia and the subsequent arrest of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the case, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh moved the Supreme Court on Monday, demanding a CBI probe against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police department. In writ petition, Singh claimed that he was transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police’s Home Guards by an order on March 17 “immediately” after he brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders in the state government. “The petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court to seek unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of Government of Maharashtra, before the evidence are destroyed,” said Singh’s petition, filed through advocate Abhinay. It contended that NCP leader Deshmukh held various meetings in February 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai and Sanjay Patil, ACP (Social Service Branch), Mumbai, bypassing their seniors, and asked them to collect ₹100 crores every month from establishments such as bars, hookah parlours, restaurants. “The Home Minister has been instructing them to carry out official assignments and collection schemes, including financial transactions as per his instructions based on his expectations and targets to collect money,” said Singh, adding it was imperative to order a CBI probe before the CCTV camera footage at Deshmukh’s residence is destroyed. Singh has also submitted that he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” in the Antilla case, highlighting that while there were vertically five officers between him and Vaze, Deshmukh was the one meeting Vaze at his residence. In that case, now being investigated by the National Investigation Agency, Vaze has already been arrested. The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the SUV found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident. Alleging that Deshmukh had also been interfering with investigations into several other cases, Singh claimed that the home minister pressured him “to probe the role of certain leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and somehow implicate them” in the abetment to suicide case of Mohan Delkar, the seven-time Lok Sabha MP from Dadar and Nagar Haveli who was found dead in a hotel in Mumbai’s Marine Drive area on February 22. “Fair CBI investigation is thus warranted in each of such acts of Shri Anil Deshmukh in abuse of the official position of the Hon’ble Home Minister,” said the petition. It added that Singh approached the top court for a CBI probe since the Maharashtra government has withdrawn its general consent for the central agency to carry out investigation in the state.Singh is likely to be represented in the top court by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi. The petition is still to get a date of hearing in the top court. Singh, in his plea, has also called the decision to transfer him “a political move with oblique purposes and sinister motives”, besides in violation of the Rule 7 of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 which lays down that every officer shall hold the post for at least two years. The petition further said: “The transfer of the petitioner in the aforesaid circumstances is for reasons smeared with malice, when there is no iota of material or evidence – far from proof – found or even imputed against the petitioner, and is solely based on conjectures, surmises and pure speculation, without detail of any sort against the petitioner having been noticed by anybody. .” Singh said he was constrained to write a letter to the chief minister on March 20 regarding Deshmukh’s conduct after his transfer owing to adverse media publicity by Deshmukh, in violation of his right to reputation, dignity, equality and liberty. In his letter which came out in the public domain a day ago, Singh made a spate of accusations against Deshmukh, who refuted the allegations. On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar also rejected Singh’s claim, saying Deshmukh was in the hospital from February 5-15 and later in home quarantine till February 27 – the period when Param Bir Singh claimed Vaze had met the home minister. Meanwhile, Singh on Monday took charge as the Director General (DG) of Maharashtra Home Guard, a police official said.Singh reached the Home Guard office in south Mumbai around noon but avoided speaking to media persons, the PTI reported.The Maharashtra government transferred Singh from the post and appointed senior IPS officer Hemant Nagrale, who was holding additional charge of Maharashtra DGP, as the new commissioner of Mumbai Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-moves-sc-for-cbi-probe-against-deshmukh-101616438391112.html
23-03-2021||India||Ashoka students begin class boycott||New Delhi: Students at Ashoka University began their two-day boycott of classes on Monday to demand changes in the university, including divesting of administrative powers from founders of the university to elected students, administrative, and faculty members.The boycott came in connection with the resignation of two professors Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian last week, and despite a statement issued Sunday by the two, and the university expressing “deep regret” at the exits and acknowledging “lapses in institutional processes.” While the students boycotted most of the classes during the day, nearly 900 students attended a scheduled class by Pratap Bhanu Mehta and discussed Karl Marx and his celebrated work Das Kapital. “This was a scheduled class on Western Political Thought and we discussed Karl Marx and his work as it is in our syllabus. There was no discussion on the current crisis and the class took place normally. Since it was made open for all students at the university, nearly 600 students attended the class using a digital platform along with hundreds who were already present on the campus,” said Biplob Kumar Das, 21, a final-year undergraduate student of Political Science at the varsity. The university’s students’ body – Ashoka University Student Government – said in total around 900 students attended the lecture.News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday (he resigned on March 15) and caused a stir among students, faculty, and the larger academic community in India and overseas. In his resignation he wrote that “after a meeting with Founders, it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability” on account of his “public writing”. On Friday, Subramanian, former chief economic advisor, resigned saying Mehta’s exit reflected poorly on the university’s ability to protect academic freedom. On Sunday, Mehta wrote to students asking them not to “press the matter” and the university’s chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee wrote in a letter to students and faculty that the founders “never interfered with academic freedom.” The board of trustees met the students’ body on Sunday, but the previously planned boycott wasn’t called off. Dozens of students were present at the university campus on Monday wearing black to register their dissent over the exits of Mehta and Subramanian . The boycott of classes is slated to continue till Tuesday.While students boycotted most of the classes on Monday, they said that some classes were held using non-university resources.A major demand of students has been to hold an open meeting with University founders. Despite repeated calls, messages, and e-mails, university officials refused to comment on the matter.The Board of Trustees, however, said on Monday that the founders “have never interfered with, nor do they intend to interfere, with academic functioning of the university.”“The founders are supportive with the appointment of the Ombudsperson (as had been decided earlier) by May 31 2021. The Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor will propose candidates for this position for approval by the Governing Body,” the statement read.The statement also called for strengthening existing protocols and processes like the Academic Council and Board of Management which separate academic functioning from Founders. University officials including Ashoka University chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee, vice-chancellor Malabika Sarkar, chairperson of Board of Trustees, Ashish Dhawan on Sunday assured students in a statement, also signed by Mehta and Subramanian that they would work to resolve the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashoka-students-begin-class-boycott-101616438332303.html
23-03-2021||India||In TN manifesto, BJP vows laws on prohibition and forceful conversion||Chennai: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday rolled out a dominant Hindutva pitch in its election manifesto for the April 6 Tamil Nadu elections, promising to enact legislations against cow slaughter and religious conversions through force or allurement. The party has also promised total prohibition in the state.The manifesto, released by Union minister Nitin Gadkari in Chennai, also had several promises to appease the Tamil electorate as the BJP is pulling all stops to make its entry into the Dravidian land. The BJP, in alliance with the ruling AIADMK, is facing the elections in 20 assembly constituencies and a bypoll in the Kanyakumari parliamentary seat. In a column titled ‘cow protection’, the BJP said that an ‘anti-cow slaughter Act’ will be “strictly implemented in the state” with a total ban on “smuggling of cows to Kerala and other states for beef and meat”. Goshalas will be established in temples to shelter cows “seized from cattle smugglers”, it added. The party has also said that temple administration would be handed over to a separate board that would be formed with Hindu scholars and saints. “This would replace the system of a secular government controlling only the Hindu religious temples,” the manifesto read. Stating that the right to freedom of religion is not the same as forcible religious conversions, BJP plans to enact “strict anti-conversion laws” to “criminalise religious conversion by force or allurement”. Promising total prohibition in a state where the state run liquor outlets- TASMAC is the highest revenue making business for the exchequer, the party said TASMAC employees who lose their jobs due to prohibition will be transferred to other government departments. Prohibition if often a talking point in Tamil Nadu elections and AIADMK and DMK have promised staggered shutting down of liquor outlets- a demand largely from the women electorate whose spouses are addicted to liquor and from anti-liquor activists. Total prohibition was in force in the state from 1937 to 1971 when the then DMK government headed by M Karunanidhi lifted it first.Besides this for women’s welfare, BJP has promised one-lakh to be deposited in the name of a girl child born in below- the poverty line families and free driving license for two- wheelers for those aged between 18 and 23. BJP has said it will trifurcate the Greater Chennai Corporation like New Delhi.To shed its image of being a north-Indian party imposing Hindi, the BJP has promised several measures for Tamils and the development of the language. A government order will be passed to make Tamil as the medium of instruction in public and private schools for classes 1 to 5. A stone inscription park for more than 1000 couplets from Thirukurral written by Tamil saintThiruvalluvar often quoted by Prime Minister Narendra will be set up in Erode district spanning 20-acres. Tamil will be announced as an official language at the Madras High Court by the party and its bench will be established in Coimbatore. A separate government will be created for Tamil migrants and the diaspora. Recommendations will be made to offer Indian citizenship to Sri Lankan refugees living in the state- a similar step made by their ally AIADMK in their manifesto. BJP has promised to make Tamil Nadu the number one state in south India in ease of doing business. The party has also emphasised on sports by announcing to include Jallikattu players in the sports quota. A 10% reservation under sports quota in education institutions would be revived, it said, adding that efforts will be taken for local martial arts, Silambam, to be recognised as national sports. The party has also stuck to its previous policies of National Education Policy and 10% reservation for economically poor people to be implemented fully. Like its ally AIADMK, BJP has also promised coaching centres to help students to clear NEET & other competitive exams which is a sensitive issue in the state. It has also promised free tablets for students of class 8 and 9 while the AIADMK promised 2G data to students and principal opposition, the DMK retained its 2016 assembly poll promise of free tablets with internet for students. Fishermen would get ₹6000 assistance annually like farmers and a separate budget for agriculture will be introduced like other BJP states. 60-lakh job opportunities will be generated. Free piped drinking water supply to all homes will be provided by 2022 under Jal Jeevan Mission. There will be a ban on sand mining for 5 years to protect riverbeds and several river linking schemes have been announced. In the health sector, multispeciality hospitals in all districts will be established offering free treatment and air ambulances will be available in Chennai and major city public hospitals. The famed Kalakshetra for art forms in Chennai will be established in all districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tn-manifesto-bjp-vows-laws-on-prohibition-and-forceful-conversion-101616438273208.html
23-03-2021||India||Cutting cake depicting national flag no offence: Madras HC||Chennai: Citing the Rig Veda, Rabindranath Tagore, Nani Palkhivala, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, the Madras high court on Monday came down hard on what it termed “hyper and surfeit” nationalism, while ruling that cutting a cake in the form of the Indian map in tricolour and eating it do not amount to an offence under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act. A single judge bench of justice N Anand Venkatesh quashed a magistrate’s direction to Coimbatore police to register a case against those who indulged in the act, saying that “symbolisation of national pride is not synonymous with patriotism, just like how cutting a cake is not unpatriotic”. It was hearing the state’s appeal against the magistrate’s order. The case refers to a 2013 public party on Christmas Day in Coimbatore district. The celebrations featured a large cake, the icing on which depicted a tricoloured outline of India’s map with the Ashoka Chakra in the middle. This cake was cut, distributed, and consumed by at least 2,500 people including around 1,000 children. According to the complainant, D Senthilkumar, of the Hindu Public Party, the celebrations were also attended by the Coimbatore district collector, the deputy police commissioner, various religious leaders, and members of several NGOs. The complainant’s grievance was that the representation of the Indian national flag on the cake, and the cutting of the same, amounted to an offence under Section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Section 2 penalises insults to the Indian flag and the Constitution of India with imprisonment up to three years or a fine or both. “Patriotism is not determined by a gross physical act. The intention behind the act will be the true test,” the court observed. The judge said that, in the case in question, it was important to consider the feeling with which the participants left the function. “Will they be feeling great pride in belonging to this great nation, or would the pride of India have come down on the mere cutting of a cake during the celebration? Without any hesitation, this court can hold that the participants would have felt only the former.” The high court compared a hypothetical example of how after Independence Day or Republic Day celebrations, people who wear flags discard them. “If persons are allowed to give such broad meaning to the word ‘insult’, many will become very uncomfortable and hesitant to handle the national flag.”The Flag Code, 2002, does prescribe ways to destroy flags in private and in a respectful manner, the court said, and while it should be followed by every citizen, not all may be aware of it. Hence, not doing so will not make people liable for prosecution, the judge said. The verdict comes at a time when an increasing number of petitions are been filed in different courts over perceived or alleged insults to national symbols.The court drew from the Rig Veda on the Indian ethos of tolerance and recalled Rabindranath Tagore’s remark, “Patriotism cannot be our final spiritual shelter; my refuge is humanity. I will not buy glass for the price of diamonds, and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I live.” To underscore its judgment, the court cited late jurist N A Palkhivala and American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson’s words and said that “a patriot is not one who only raises the flag, symbolises his national pride and wear it on his sleeve, but also, a person who bats for good governance”.“A wayfarer, for the sake of publicity, should not be allowed to expose people to criminal prosecution for some innocuous acts,” the judge observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cutting-cake-depicting-national-flag-no-offence-madras-hc-101616438091086.html
23-03-2021||India||Stalin blames BJP and AIADMK for deaths of anti-Sterlite protesters||Chennai Raising the poll pitch in Tamil Nadu, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief M K Stalin on Monday alleged that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were hand in glove in the police firing that claimed 13 lives during the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi in 2018. Besides this, Stalin also referred to the alleged custodial deaths of P Jeyaraj and his son, J Bennicks, who were picked up in June last year for reportedly running their mobile shop beyond the designated hours during the coronavirus lockdown.Recalling the protests against the Sterlite plant, Stalin, who was addressing a poll campaign in Thoothukudi, said: “They were peaceful protesters who were marching towards the district administration, demanding that the pollution-causing Sterlite plant be shut and they were shot down like crows.”“As soon as I heard the news, I came to Thoothukudi. I never saw such a scene in my life and we should never see it again. The perpetrators have still not been punished. We should teach this government a lesson,” he added. In 2018, 13 people were killed after villagers in Tuticorin clashed with the police during an agitation against the proposed expansion of a copper smelter of Sterlite Copper, a unit of the Vedanta group, over pollution concerns. Accusing the BJP-led Centre for allegedly stalling the probe led by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the firing, Stalin alleged that Justice Aruna Jagadeesan commission appointed by Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami had not submitted a report into the incident even after three years. “The two regimes have come together for the election. Don’t you want to teach them a lesson?” Stalin told the crowd. “When reporters asked the chief minister (about the firing), he said that he had just watched it on the news. How can he continue in this post?” Attacking the government over the custodial death of the father-son duo, Stalin alleged that a First Information Report (FIR) filed by the police said that Jayaraj and Benicks died due to the injuries they had sustained when they rolled on the ground to evade arrest, a claim that was later debunked from the CCTV footage of the store. AIADMK’s sitting MLA and incumbent S P Shanmuganathan from Srivaikuntam constituency in Thoothukudi denied the charges. “The wrong-doers are being punished and the victims’ families were compensated by our government,” Shanmuganathan said, adding: “The problem is over, Stalin is just taking it up for politics. Those who were affected by these two incidents are ready to support the AIADMK.”Nine policemen were sent to jail on charges of murder with the Madurai bench of the Madras high court dismissing the bail pleas of four of them on Monday. The DMK chief lauded the district for standing up for their rights during these two incidents. The DMK and its allies (Communist parties, Congress, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and Indian Union Muslim League) are contesting in six assembly constituencies in Thoothukudi, where the AIADMK and DMK have three seats each. Stalin’s sister K Kanimozhi was elected as an MP from Thoothukudi Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 elections and has been at the forefront of the protests in the above two cases. This time, TTV Dhinakaran, the chief ministerial candidate of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), is also contesting from one of the assembly constituencies – Kovilpatti – of the district to take on AIADMK’s incumbent MLA and information minister Kadambur Raju. In 2016 assembly polls, Raju won this seat by a thin margin of 428 votes. Dhinkaran, meanwhile, is banking on the support of the Mukkalathor community to which his family, including his aunt and former chief minister J Jayalaithaa’s aide V K Sasikala and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam belong.CPI(M)’s K Srinivasan will also fight the polls from this seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-blames-bjp-and-aiadmk-for-deaths-of-anti-sterlite-protesters-101616437971047.html
23-03-2021||India||Twist of faith: U’khand CM tests Covid positive||Dehradun: Two days after Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said “faith will overcome the fear of the virus”, while defending the relaxing of safety norms during the Kumbh festival in Haridwar, he tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. Rawat was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi this week, but the trip was called off after he contracted the contagious pathogen.“My Corona test report has come positive. I am fine and not facing any difficulty. I have isolated myself under the monitoring of doctors. Those of you who have come into contact with me in last few days, should be cautious and get their tests done. I wish good health to all,” Rawat tweeted.He visited Haridwar three times after becoming CM on March 10, and mingled with pilgrims and ascetics, with hardly anyone following Covid safety norms. Rawat was not wearing a mask in several images taken of him in Haridwar on the day of the “shahi snan” (holy dip) on March 11, when the crowds swelled to 3.3 million. After Rawat took over as CM, he said that there should not be any restrictions on pilgrims wishing to come to Mahakumbh after April 1. Two days ago, during a visit to Haridwar, Rawat said: “Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus.” Worried about the situation in Haridwar in the context of the Mahakumbh and Rawat’s statements, the Centre on Sunday wrote to the Uttarakhand government to take stringent measures to check Covid spread during the Kumbh. Haridwar has highest active cases of all 13 districts in the state at the moment.Since taking over as chief minister of the state on March 10, Rawat has courted several controversies.On Sunday, at a public function, he said that “the US had enslaved India for 200 years”, and questioned why people do not have 20 children if they wanted more subsidised rations during Covid.On March 16, Rawat objected to people, particularly women, wearing ripped jeans.“Ripped jeans paves the way for societal breakdown and is a bad example parents set for their children. Wearing ripped jeans is not our culture but aping westernisation,” he said.Rights activists and the opposition Congress slammed the CM over his comments.“Don’t know what has happened to the CM. Is it lack of wisdom or lack of education or is he doing it deliberately? First, he made a derogatory statement on the attire of women, and then he made a highly insulting statement on producing children”, Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twist-of-faith-u-khand-cm-tests-covid-positive-101616437912335.html

23-03-2021||India||Decoding the proposed changes in the POCSO Act||In its latest report, the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs has recommended to the Union government that the juvenile delinquency age be reduced from 18 to 16, and all accused above 16 be tried as adults for cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.The standing committee, headed by Congress Member of Parliament (MP), Anand Sharma, presented its report to Rajya Sabha on March 15, with a strong pitch for a review of the threshold age for trials under the POCSO Act. What has the report said and what is the existing legal regime under the POCSO Act?Why has the report made a recommendation for bringing down the juvenile delinquency age?The panel underlined a consistent rise in the cases registered under the POCSO Act between 2017 and 2019. The number of POCSO cases in 2017 was 31,668, which increased to 38,802 in 2018. A total of 46,005 cases were registered in 2019.Noting that there had been a large number of cases under the POCSO Act where delinquent juveniles were the offenders, the committee expressed concerns that minor sexual offenders may commit more serious and heinous crime if the issue was left unaddressed.Also Read | Everyday 4 child victims of sexual abuse denied justice, study finds“The committee believes that minor sexual offenders may commit more serious and heinous crimes if left untreated/uncounselled. Therefore, it is very important to relook at these provisions because more and more juveniles are getting involved in such crimes,” stated the report.It, thus, recommended that the ministry of home affairs should take up the matter with the ministry of women and child development “to review the current age limit of 18 years and see if it can be reduced to 16 years for the applicability of the POCSO Act, 2012.”What is POCSO Act and the definition of a “child” therein?POCSO Act came into force in June 2012, putting in place a legal regime to protect the children from offences of sexual assault, harassment and pornography. The provisions under the law provide for safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating child-friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated special courts.The Act defines different forms of sexual abuse which includes penetrative and non-penetrative assault, sexual harassment, use of child for pornography, child trafficking etc. It makes it the legal duty of a person aware of the offence to report the sexual abuse, failing which the person can be punished with imprisonment of six months or a fine. The law mandates the special court to complete the trial within one year from the date of taking cognisance of the abuse.Section 1(d) of the Act defines a “child” as any person below the age of 18 years. The definition of “child” applies both to the victims as well as offenders. This definition is in consonance with the definition of “child” under the Juvenile Justice Act. Under Section 2(12) of the Juvenile Justice Act, a “child” means a person who has not completed 18 years of age.How are juveniles tried under the present system of law? Delinquents below 18 are tried under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, which calls them “children in conflict of law”. Age on the date of the offence is the basis for determining whether a delinquent should be tried as a child or an adult.Under the juvenile justice system, a delinquent found guilty of committing any offence can be housed in a special home for a maximum period of three years, following which he or she must be released.Also Read | Man raped 5-yr-old last month. Judge fast-tracks trial, orders death penaltyHowever, the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000 was amended in 2015 with a provision, allowing for delinquents between the age of 16 and 18 to be tried as adults under certain circumstances. While the amended Act does not make it mandatory for all in the age group 16-18 to be tried as adults, it states that those committing a heinous offence — one that attracts a minimum punishment of seven years — can be tried as adults before a regular court instead of a juvenile court.This amendment was brought in the wake of the December 2012 gang rape case in the national Capital when one of the perpetrators was found to be a juvenile (17 years of age) and his trial was shifted to a juvenile court. On December 20, 2015, despite massive public outcry, the juvenile was released from the correction home after he completed three years.Set up to revamp the criminal laws, Justice JS Verma committee made several recommendations in 2013 but stated that it was not inclined to reduce the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16. However, the then minister of women and child development, Maneka Gandhi, asserted the need to create a distinction in law based on the gravity of crime committed by a juvenile. The amendment was proposed by her ministry in 2014, leading to the amendment in the Juvenile Justice Act the next year.There are 21 such sections under the Indian Penal Code alone where the minimum punishment is seven years in jail after conviction. Besides, there are a host of provisions in other laws such as Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, Arms Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in which juveniles can be tried as adults.What is the procedure to try a juvenile as an adult? Section 15 of the Juvenile Justice Act lays down the procedure for a “preliminary assessment” of a juvenile above the age of 16 years in cases of heinous offences. There are three parameters for conducting a preliminary assessment to determine whether the child should be tried as an adult or under the juvenile justice system.This includes his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence.A juvenile court relies on a probation officer’s social investigation report and a government hospital’s mental health report and may also take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts before arriving at a conclusion. If a juvenile court finds that the child can be tried as an adult, the case is transferred to a designated children’s court, which again decides whether the decision is correct or not.Also Read | 65-year-old man held for raping 4-year-old girl in Bihar’s Vaishali districtUnder the new law, juveniles can be sentenced to imprisonment, including imprisonment for life. However, it prohibits imposition of death penalty and life imprisonment without the possibility of release.There are many sections in the POCSO Act where the minimum punishment is more than seven years in jail. For example, the minimum punishment for penetrative sexual assault under the POCSO Act is ten years in jail whereas it is 20 years’ imprisonment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault. In all these cases, a juvenile can be tried as an adult after complying with the procedure prescribed under the 2015 amendment.However, there are several other crimes under the POCSO Act in which the maximum punishment is up to seven years in jail or less. The punishment for sexual assault under POCSO Act is a minimum of three years up to a maximum of five years. Punishment for aggravated sexual assault is for a term not less than five years but may extend to seven years. Similarly, POCSO Act provides that whosoever commits sexual harassment upon a child shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years. Commercial use of pornographic material involving a child is an offence punishable up to five years in jail.If one looks at the conclusion of the parliamentary committee, it has recommended a change in the definition of “child” under the POCSO Act by reducing the cut off age from 18 to 16. By doing so, irrespective of the nature or severity of the offence, anyone above 16 will have to be tried like an adult if accused under the POCSO Act. However, this will require parliamentary approval and necessary changes in the POCSO Act as well as the Juvenile Justice Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-the-proposed-changes-in-the-pocso-act-101616387029216.html

23-03-2021||Today's||How India and Israel can lead the way on 5G collaboration||Imagine an Israeli surgeon based in Tel Aviv operating on a patient in Mumbai remotely. This is just one of the promises of 5G telecom networks, which will be characterised by rapid connectivity and near-zero latency. The 5G revolution can open new pathways beyond health-technology and faster smartphones to self-driving cars, the internet of things and virtual reality.Despite the evident opportunities, 5G deployment globally hasn’t been without challenges. Superpower competition, costly infrastructure, and slow application development are holding back development. India and Israel can, together, leverage their strengths to collaborate in areas such application development, building networks of trust, and future research and development and unleash the possibilities of 5G for their citizens.Both Israel and India boast of a strong innovation base and are focused on technology-driven development. But both have been lagging behind in terms of their 5G rollout. Yet as they begin to build their respective 5G infrastructure, it is crucial to keep in mind the example of South Korea, where insufficient application development has limited the gains from 5G. After South Korea’s rapid 5G infrastructure push, over half a million users returned their 5G subscriptions in 2020 due to the lack of relevant and attractive content and services.India and Israel have a real opportunity for cooperation to avoid this. Strong application-based technology and infrastructure, supported by government policy, will likely ease the capital investment concerns for telecom operators. Speaking at a recent roundtable discussion, Israeli Consul-General in Bengaluru, Jonathan Zadka, highlighted that Israel and India are both fully integrated into the global app economy, but more cooperation is needed when it comes to deep-tech.This is where both governments should enable entrepreneurs and innovators to work together. The creation of an Israel-India high-level task force can bring together industry leaders, policymakers, and academia to identify opportunities for collaboration. The establishment of joint Centres of Excellence (CoE) focussed on emerging technologies could be another step, permitting research and talent development. This effort can be bilateral in nature, but it can also leverage the strengths of other actors such as Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore.Such cooperation among middle powers is critical as the United States-China technology competition intensifies. US policy has primarily focused on security concerns on 5G. Washington has called on allies to join its Clean Network Initiative, which dispenses with Chinese involvement in telecom networks. Despite this, complete Sino-US technology decoupling seems highly unlikely. Nevertheless, this tense dynamic presents a strategic challenge for other states.Therefore, factors such as security, trust, and supply chain resilience must guide decisions on cooperation between India, Israel, and other like-minded states. As democracies, India and Israel should be cautious in sourcing their hardware and must work to leverage comparative advantages and mitigate risks.One approach to do this could entail creating an India-Israel-US partnership, which combines Indian software expertise, Israel’s device development capabilities, and the US’s clout in building cloud-based applications and setting international standards. The 5G era will involve a lot of visualisation, which creates opportunities for Indian software firms to take the lead. Also, focussing on AI-based security solutions along with the development of use cases in sectors such as agriculture, health care and transportation will facilitate international cooperation. Meanwhile, as a start-up nation, Israel could use its ingenuity to create devices of the future, powered on 5G and other emerging technologies. The US, finally, can leverage its application development ecosystem and its cybersecurity expertise to create new opportunities and ensure network security.Such an approach is likely to resonate well with the private sector, too. High-tech geopolitics is increasingly influencing corporate decision-making. Companies are looking to States to create pathways for the private sector to collaborate to build resilience and opportunities. A multifaceted and clearly defined 5G partnership between India and Israel could lead the way forward.Manoj Kewalramani is the chair of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila InstitutionGedaliah Afterman is the head of the Asia Policy Program at the Abba Eban Institute for International DiplomacyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-india-and-israel-can-lead-the-way-on-5g-collaboration-101616509976359.html
23-03-2021||Today's||In the heart of Mumbai, a corrupt nexus||Towards the end of the third century, bribery and abuse of power were so rampant in the Roman empire that those assigned by the emperor to check corruption started running their own protection rackets. Centuries later, the glittering metropolis of Mumbai is witness to the same sordid tale of unscrupulous politicians colluding with the unscrupulous elements in the police to run an extremely profitable extortion regime.The Scorpio found near the Ambani residence on February 25 was planted with gelatin sticks and a letter, but without a detonator. To a security professional, it was an act of extortion, without the terror angle. It was meant to intimidate the victim, arouse fear and submission. Word travels fast in the Mumbai dark underbelly and a central question immediately began doing the rounds — who is the ultimate boss to pay obeisance to? Is it possible that Sachin Vaze was allegedly the sole culprit behind this heinous act? As an ordinary senior sub-inspector, he had direct access to the police commissioner. He was also in touch with ministers, including the home minister. While facts may soon come out, it is apparent that Vaze’s alleged villainy had the sanction of the higher brass of police and the political establishment. He is been named as the main accused in the murder of the owner of the infamous Scorpio vehicle. The sheer brazenness of the crime has astounded common citizens. As the murky happenings come to light, the political brass has distanced itself, transferring the police commissioner and attributing the episode to police lapses. But the truth has a way of coming out. Now that the ex-police commissioner, Param Vir Singh, has squarely blamed the state home minister for setting extortion targets to the known encounter specialist Vaze, political bosses are doing the indefensible — shielding the minister and shooting the messenger.This is not to absolve the police leadership, which had cosied up with Vaze for quite a while till now. The alacrity with which the Televison Rating Points (TRP) case was taken up by Mumbai Police, naming Vaze as the chief investigator, hinted at personal vendetta. Arresting a TV anchor did not call for an encounter specialist. Additionally, in February, the police commissioner was acquainted with the home minister’s directions to Vaze. He should have come clean right then and may be the ham-handed attempt at extortion would have been prevented.Inducting Vaze into the police is another tale of blatant favouritism and craven submission of the babus and police leadership to the political executive. It was a committee, comprising senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) officers, which recommended his reinstatement, with quick approval given by the political bosses. This was done in the name of shoring up police strength during the Covid-19 crisis. A suspended policeman, a murder accused, a political worker — all such inconvenient facts about Vaze were set aside. And then despite his induction for a certain stated purpose, why was he not used for Covid-19 duties? Many brave policemen died on Covid-19 duties, while Vaze grazed on greener pastures.Singh has been removed to facilitate an impartial probe, but party colleagues are protecting the home minister against whom serious allegations have been made, by no less than a senior IPS officer. The minister allegedly called junior officers for consultations, gave directions on investigations, and asked for extorting money from bars and restaurants. The minister has virtually breached all barriers of integrity and violated the oath of high office and should resign or be dismissed, pending a thorough enquiry.But the incident is reflective of a deeper crisis. No political party can afford to let go of Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, the city of dreams and mafia dons. Maharashtra is a money-minting factory for political funding in India’s electoral politics, cutting across all political lines, and Mumbai is its most productive core. According to recently published National Crime Records Bureau data, Maharashtra has topped in corruption cases for the fourth year in a row. Election after election, leader after leader, Mumbaikars have had to live with the police-politician-mafia nexus.Mumbai’s extortion case has put some politicians and policemen on tenterhooks. Once Vaze spills the beans, it will confirm our worst fears — of an enduring collusion ie politico-police-mafia nexus. An ordinary citizen can only watch helplessly while the drama unfolds, hoping for a drastic overhaul of the police set-up and political establishment. But in a country where grassroots politics is run through police thanas and tehsils, which political party will let go its firm grip on public institutions, and that too in Mumbai? The signs aren’t encouraging. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after seven years in power, lamented over the power of IAS and administrative reform in the Parliament, while the Supreme Court has been expressing anguish over police reforms for the last 15 years.Only a court directed investigation into the sordid affair will restore the faith of citizens and, in the meanwhile, we desperately need another Julio Ribeiro to helm the Mumbai Police.Yashovardhan Azad is a former IPS officer, who served as Central Information Commissioner and special director, Intelligence Bureau The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-the-heart-of-mumbai-a-corrupt-nexus-101616508717248.html
23-03-2021||Today's||NATO: India’s next geopolitical destination||When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) leaders meet later this year, they will debate the recommendations from a group of experts (which I co-chaired) that advocates, among other things, extending a formal offer of partnership to India. Such an idea has been discussed before but has always foundered on India’s aversion to entanglement in rival geopolitical blocs. It’s time to overcome this obstacle.China’s meteoric rise has dramatically heightened India’s need for closer security relationships with politically reliable, like-minded states. As China’s aggressive actions in the Galwan Valley and other border areas demonstrate, Beijing is increasingly willing to depart from its hide-and-bide strategy to directly challenge even the largest of its neighbours. This behavioural shift is likely to accelerate as China’s military capabilities expand. Already, China spends more on its military than all of its immediate neighbours combined, and nearly three times as much as India.In these circumstances, India’s longstanding strategy of careful equi-distancing, punctuated by tilts toward China and Russia, is not viable; inevitably, New Delhi will have to undertake more deliberate efforts to counter-balance the juggernaut of Chinese power. To this end, it has already begun to deepen bilateral defence ties with Japan, the United States (US), and other regional players threatened by China, including through Quad.Becoming a NATO partner would be a natural extension of this evolution with several upsides and few risks. In the near-term, India would derive strategic-signalling value from even the appearance of drawing closer to the Western Alliance at a crucial, early phase of Beijing’s transition to a more aggressive posture. The mere fact of opening partnership talks would send the message that India’s leaders will redouble coalition-building efforts, more or less in direct proportion to Chinese aggression. The signal will hold all the more value precisely because it has heretofore bordered on geopolitical taboo.Longer-term, India would derive military-strategic benefits from partnership with the world’s most powerful alliance. While NATO partnerships do not carry the Article 5 guarantee of collective defence against armed attack, they nevertheless come with regular defence dialogues, military-to-military planning, and joint exercises that improve readiness, interoperability and predictability. In the event of a conflict, India would benefit from having prior planning and arrangements in place for cooperating with NATO and its Mediterranean partners (including Israel, with which India has a close strategic relationship) to secure its western flank and the approaches to the Red Sea.Partnering with NATO also carries technological benefits. Under a provision in the US 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, India now enjoys the same technology-sharing and cost-sharing perks as other non-NATO US allies for purposes of the Arms Export Control Act. But adding NATO partner status could also position India to benefit from possible future programmes aimed at lowering the barriers for cooperation in emerging technologies between NATO and its Asia-Pacific partners. It could also help to offset the growing concerns and negative scrutiny that India is increasingly attracting in Congress for its disproportionate reliance on Russian military equipment.Partnering with NATO would not significantly constrain India’s broader geostrategic options. Egypt and Israel are both NATO partners who maintain defence relationships with Russia. Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, and Austria are all NATO partners with long-standing neutralist traditions. NATO’s partnerships are highly customised arrangements. In India’s case, the sheer size and importance of the country may warrant a new and special category of partnership — one that combines periodic high-level dialogue, technological cooperation and defence planning for maritime contingencies.However, the obstacles to partnership are not only on the Indian side; in the past, some NATO allies have effectively blocked discussion of the matter by insisting that any offer of partnership to India be accompanied by similar invitations to Pakistan. This may have seemed attractive to some in the era when NATO militaries were mainly focused on conducting operations in Afghanistan. But with the winding down of operations there, NATO has little in common with a Pakistan that is increasingly radicalised at home and aligned with, and beholden to, China.By contrast, the case for NATO partnership with India — a large maritime democracy with concerns and interests that tend to overlap with those of the US and many European allies — has only grown more compelling as China’s rise has accelerated.For all of these reasons, NATO leaders should extend to India an offer of opening partnership talks. Doing so would signal that it is seriously evaluating all of its tools, including partnerships, according to how well they equip its members for dealing with a new era of great-power competition in which large states such as China and Russia pose, by far, the greatest threat to their security.In this emerging competition, India is a vital player in its own right and should be treated as such. But Indians should be under no illusions that a truly non-aligned path remains a viable option. Strengthening ties with NATO now, while China is still in the early phase of a shift to a more assertive posture toward both South Asia and Europe, could pay dividends in dissuading aggression and ensuring that, should China continue on its current trajectory, India has as many friends as possible in the right places.A Wess Mitchell served as US assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia from 2017-2019 and as co-chair of the NATO 2030 Reflection Process.

23-03-2021||Editorials||One year of the lockdown||Exactly a year ago, on March 24 at 8 pm, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that to battle Covid-19, India would lock itself up. Flights in and out of the country had already been stopped earlier, and now, all movement — except for essential workers — was halted. Citizens were told to stay home, maintain social distancing, avoid all contact with the external world, follow Covid-19 protocols, and aid the nation in helping break — or slow down — the chain of transmission, even as India was to use the period to build up its health infrastructure to cope with the most devastating pandemic in a century. While there were different phases of slowly unlocking the country, for 68 days, there was a lockdown. A year later, there are lessons and cautionary notes which are still relevant.Based on the scientific evidence available at the time, global trends, an assessment of India’s health infrastructure deficits, and the possibility of rapid transmission given the population and its density, a lockdown was necessary. India did well in using the period to ramp up testing and medical management facilities. But, at the same time, the lockdown was brutal, especially for the poor. The sight of migrant workers walking home will remain the abiding image of the lockdown, as will the unprecedented economic contraction. Supply chains were disrupted, demand plummeted, incomes dipped, jobs were lost, and the social welfare initiatives of the government were not enough to tackle the distress. The disease, too, continued to spiral — though India was fortunate in having a low fatality rate. A year later, the second wave of Covid-19 is here. The good news is that so is the vaccine, and India has, although too gradually for this newspaper’s liking, begun vaccinating citizens — Tuesday’s decision to open it up to all citizens above 45 years is positive. But besides approving more vaccines and opening them up to all citizens, Covid-19 demands a greater degree of responsibility from both governments and citizens. The Mahakumbh in Uttarakhand is only one example of how faith (and the politics of faith) is being allowed to trump science, at great risk — the farm protests at Delhi’s borders or the crowds in election rallies in different states are no different in enhancing the risk for citizens. India has lived through one of its most difficult post-Independence years. The battle isn’t over yet, and just as it was important last March, it is as crucial to follow protocols today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/one-year-of-the-lockdown-101616511298682.html
23-03-2021||Editorials||A welcome change in Delhi’s excise policy||On Monday, the Delhi government proposed sweeping changes in its excise policy in an attempt to boost the city’s revenue, crackdown on the liquor mafia, and improve consumer experience. Its salient points include lowering the legal age of drinking in the Capital from 25 to 21; the government’s exit from the retail alcohol business; and an overhaul of the tax system. Delhi is one of India’s biggest liquor markets, and this serves as a major source of income for the government. The population-to-vend ratio in the Capital, however, is one of the lowest in the country. The city has 849 liquor shops, yet around 58% of Delhi is either unserved or under-served. The government expects the excise revenue to increase by ₹1,500-2000 crore annually because of the new policy. Currently, it earns ₹6,000 crore from the sector.The new policy changes are welcome. For one, drinking age in Delhi is not in step even with other Indian states, let alone other megacities of the world. For example, Uttar Pradesh allows people to drink at 21. In New York and London, the drinking age is 21 and 18, respectively. The age rule is often observed in the breach in Delhi and it is better for the law to catch up on social trends. The consumer experience at the city’s liquor shops is awful, especially for women. Buyers are made to feel like criminals, and women are often harassed. Moreover, the sale of good quality liquor can be found mostly upmarket areas. There is also brand suppression, malpractice in registration, and an opaque cabal of operators controlling the city’s business. The Delhi government’s attempt can help create a more reasonable and effective regulatory regime, and ensure that responsible drinking is seen as a legitimate social activity rather than treated as a crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-welcome-change-in-delhi-s-excise-policy-101616510636532.html
