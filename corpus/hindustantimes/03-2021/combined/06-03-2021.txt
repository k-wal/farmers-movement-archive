06-03-2021||Delhi||College of Art clarifies: Students to get DU degrees||The College of Art on Saturday clarified that its current batch of students would receive their degrees from Delhi University (DU).On Tuesday, the Delhi Cabinet had merged the college, formerly affiliated to DU, with Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD). All three institutions are state-run.Soon after, students raised concerns on their degrees and DU officials had called it “illegal and arbitrary”.The college’s officiating principal BS Chauhan on Friday said in an order: “...the students already enrolled and presently studying in the College of Art would continue to be governed by University of Delhi and would receive their degrees from University of Delhi.”The same day, Delhi University wrote to the government asking it to follow “due process” before removing the affiliation of the college. “Delhi government cannot de-affiliate any college fully funded by it from DU without taking proper approval from the university’s statutory bodies--- academic and executive councils. We are waiting for their response,” said DU Dean of Colleges Balram Pani.A senior Delhi government official responded, “The College of Art is fully funded by the Delhi government and the decision to bring it under AUD does not need any approval from DU.”Chauhan’s order was also sent to all faculty members of the college with a copy of another earlier order from the Delhi government’s Directorate of Training and Technical Education stating that AUD will takeover the admissions process in the college from the next academic session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/college-of-art-clarifies-students-to-get-du-degrees-101615054147686.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||AAP accuses North MCD of ₹546 cr irregularities in Rani Jhansi flyover project||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday, citing audit reports, accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation of irregularities to the tune of ₹546 crore in the construction of Rani Jhansi flyover in north Delhi.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and hit back at the AAP, accusing the Delhi ruling party of making “manipulative” statements.The cost escalation in a project that was delayed by over 20 years was not a scam, nor was it in the control of the north municipal body, the BJP argued.The project, which was conceived by the north Delhi civic body in 1998, had gained notoriety over the years as one of the most delayed infrastructure projects in the national capital. Work on the 1.6km-long flyover, which starts near St Stephen’s Hospital and runs till Filmistan Cinema, finally started in 2008 and was finished in 2018. The flyover was to decongest several areas in north and central Delhi.“MCD audit report exposes a scam of ₹546 crore in the construction of Rani Jhansi flyover -- a project that was estimated to cost ₹175 crore but was completed at a cost of ₹724 crore. Whereas the Shastri Park flyover, estimated to cost ₹302 crore was constructed in ₹250 crore by the Delhi government. The Shastri Park flyover was completed in one and a half years. The Rani Jhansi flyover, on the other hand, took 24 years,” said the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak.Pathak further said, “I want to challenge the Delhi BJP president to read this audit report in front of the media so that the people of Delhi and the country get to know about the real face of the BJP. Instead of acquiring the land for construction of the flyover through a government agency, in adherence to the rules, the BJP leaders did personal dealings with the people to spearhead corruption in the project. Around ₹10 crore was spent without any approval. No approval was taken from any official or agency to spend these extra finances.”While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to the municipal polls in 2022.Responding to the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations. Durgesh Pathak’s statement calling the cost escalation in the Rani Jhansi Road flyover project “a scam” shows that he indulges only in manipulative politics to malign the MCDs. Everybody knows that due to court cases, compensation claims and other humanitarian reasons, this flyover project – started in 1998 and scheduled to be completed by 2000 -- got delayed by 20 years. The two-decade delay escalated the cost of construction from the planned ₹175 crore to ultimately ₹724 crore. This is a cost escalation due to reasons beyond the control of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and not a scam.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-accuses-north-mcd-of-546-cr-irregularities-in-rani-jhansi-flyover-project-101615054027705.html
06-03-2021||Gurugram||Vaccination centres open advance booking till March-end on Co-Win platform||Residents of the city can now book their appointment for Covid-19 vaccination days in advance as private and government hospitals on Saturday opened the schedule for the entire month on Co-Win portal. District health department officials, however, said that private hospitals will have to equally cater to people for on-spot vaccination.“Slots for advance appointments for March can now be seen on CoWIN portal for government and private health facilities, so that people can select the date and location for taking the vaccine jab. Considering the high turnout for walk-in registration and vaccination in government facilities, only 30-40 per cent of vaccines will be kept aside per day for advanced self-registered beneficiaries,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav.Private hospitals will have to keep all slots open for walk-in beneficiaries, Yadav said, adding, “They have to plan 100 per cent open slots for walk-in beneficiaries. Therefore, they cannot limit doses only for those who have taken advance appointments.” Being the first week of Covid-19 inoculation for people above 60 years and those between 45 and 59 with existing illness, many people faced difficulties in registering themselves online for the vaccination.Meanwhile, even though an advance appointment of 24 hours before the vaccination started on March 3, on March 4, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had directed facilities to plan sessions on Co-WIN in advance of at least for 15 days to a month so that beneficiaries can book their slots — with choice of date and location — online.Surijit Singh, manager for Covid-19 vaccination, Park Hospital, confirmed that the advance schedules are available on the portal. “We are getting calls from people for confirmation on advance bookings. Since many people have been reaching hospitals directly for vaccination, we are asking them to at least get themselves registered on Co-WIN to streamline the process,” said Singh. At least 2,744 people above the age of 60 years, and 305 of ages between 45 and 59 took the vaccine jab in 30 private hospitals on Saturday. Currently, private hospitals can conduct vaccination from Monday to Saturday, while government hospitals can conduct vaccinations on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.From March 8, vaccination will be extended to 45 private and 22 government hospitals after the state health department on Friday accepted applications of 19 private hospitals to run the vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccination-centres-open-advance-booking-till-march-end-on-co-win-platform-101615053907693.html

Police said the murder took place because of personal enmity between two groups and multiple teams have been formed to identify and arrest the gunmen.The victim Shashi Kadyan was a resident of village Katewara in Bawana. The man was a civil defence volunteer and was attached to an additional district magistrate in outer Delhi as a driver.Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Rajiv Ranjan said the deceased had sustained multiple gunshot wounds. “Prima facie, the motive behind the killing appears to be personal enmity and local rivalry. A case of murder has been registered and multiple teams have been set up to identify and arrest the accused,” Ranjan said.Police said around 5.30am, the police control room received a call reporting that a man was lying dead near Jogi Wada Chowk in Bawana.

The man is believed to be associated with one of the two rival groups in the village. The officer said they have also recovered some footage of the shooting and efforts are on to trace the assailants. We are also checking if the two groups are associated with criminals in the area,” he said.Police said Kadyan did not have any criminal antecedents . “Efforts to establish the timeline of his movements are being made.

06-03-2021||Gurugram||100 days of protest: Farmers observe ‘Black Day’||Farmers protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera and Sunehra-Jurehra at the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Nuh on Saturday observed ‘Black Day’ in solidarity with fellow farmers who have been camping at Delhi borders for the past 100 days. Flaunting black flags and bands, farmers present at the spot criticised the government for its negligent attitude towards farmers. Sanjay Madhav — a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi borders and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan — said that the government had subjected farmers to trials and tribulations in the past 100 days. “There are so many farmers who died during the course of the agitation. This loss could have been avoided if not for the government’s arrogance. The government has taken steps that will destroy farmers. We have continued the agitation over the past several months and will never forget the treatment that the government has meted out to farmers,” said Madhav. He said that the farmers’ agitation had transformed into a countrywide movement that has received support from different sections of the society who stood by the farmers. Farmers across the country have been agitating against the three contentious farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year, for the past several months. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. While the protests at the Delhi borders have completed 100 days, farmers have been protesting at Shahjahanpur and Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border for the past 83 days. Farmers are also protesting at Sunehra-Jurehra under the banner of Mewat Kisan Morcha for the past 54 days. Rashid Ahmed, a protestor from Nuh, said that the protesting farmers have decided to amplify the movement and hold a gathering on March 15, on the death anniversary of Hasan Khan Mewati, an important figure in the region. “We observed Black Day and recalled the sacrifices of those who have lost their lives in the course of the agitations. Farmers in Mewat have also been protesting daily for over 50 days and we will continue to agitate till the laws are rolled back,” said Ahmed. BJP Haryana spokesperson Jawahar Yadav said that the popular support for the farmer protests had died and only politically motivated people were carrying on with the agitation. Yadav said that people will eventually understand that the farm laws were in the interest of farmers. “The real farmers have returned. Slowly, more people will understand the importance of these laws,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/100-days-of-protest-farmers-observe-black-day-101615053849443.html

06-03-2021||Gurugram||Heavily congested Krishna Chowk to get smart traffic signalling system||Work on installing smart traffic signals on Krishna Chowk — a key intersection at Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road — is likely to commence from next month onwards, said Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials said on Saturday.The intersection is crucial because traffic coming from the directions of sectors 21 and 22 converge with traffic on Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road, making it a chaotic spot in the absence of a signal. The intersection is also located just a kilometre away from the Kapashera Border, which sees a high volume of traffic. Due to the industries that are located nearby, a large number of pedestrians and cyclists also access this intersection.Due to the absence of a traffic signal, Gurugram police officials are often seen at the spot during the peak traffic hours managing traffic manually. Hence, to ensure automatic management of the traffic, GMDA officials have decided to finally install a signal on the stretch.“Krishna Chowk is one of the most congested stretches in the city and a big reason for this is the absence of a traffic signal. Realising this as well as its importance in terms of the volume of traffic, GMDA is installing a smart signal at the stretch on a priority basis,” said JS Sindhu, engineer, GMDA (traffic, mobility wing).Sindhu said that a tender for installing the smart signal was floated last month and bids for finalising a contractor will be opened next month. Sindhu further said that the concessionaire will be given exactly three months to complete the project from the date of allotment.As per GMDA officials, the project is expected to cost around ₹10 lakh. Sindhu also said that due to the difference in the volume of traffic, GMDA has opted to install a smart signal at the intersection instead of a conventional one.“As per our study, the traffic volume on the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road is almost twice that of the Sector 22/23 Road. Hence, it was vital to ensure a smart mode of signal so that the traffic signal turns green or red depending on the volume of traffic. This would also help commuters to wait for the least amount of time,” said Sindhu.Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder of the Raahgiri Foundation, said that the matter of installing a signal at the intersection was taken up by the foundation with the GMDA last month.“During the meeting, we highlighted the difficulties caused due to the absence of a signal at the intersection both in terms of traffic management as well as for the pedestrians and cyclists who were facing a major difficulty in crossing the stretch. GMDA has now started the process for changing the same and we will be working with them for identifying more such junctions and intersections in the city where such a change is required,” said Bhatt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/heavily-congested-krishna-chowk-to-get-smart-traffic-signalling-system-101615053788341.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC directs 3499 undertrials to surrender from March 7||The Delhi high court has directed 3,499 undertrial prisoners, who were granted interim bail to de-congest jails in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, to surrender from March 7 at the expiry of their bail terms.A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh said it was “not inclined” to further extend the period of interim bail granted to prisoners under various criteria laid down by the high power committee in its several meetings.“It is therefore directed that all the 3,499 undertrials granted interim bails under various criteria laid down by the high power committee — who have not obtained regular bails from their court concerned or any other superior court concerned — shall surrender before the jail superintendent upon expiry of the period of their interim bail commencing from March 7,” the bench said in its order passed on March 3 and made available on Saturday.It added that as the 3,499 undertrials were given interim bails on different dates, so the period of their interim bails will expire with efflux of time on different dates and there was no requirement to fix any specific date for their surrender.The decision of the court was based on the recommendation of the high powered committee constituted on the direction of the Supreme Court to decongest jails to prevent the spread of Covid-19.The high court while refusing to extend the interim bails considered the observations and recommendations made by the committee, the improved situation of Covid-19 in Delhi-NCR and the resolution passed by the committee on February 17 of not recommending further extension of interim bails to 3,499 undertrials.It also took into consideration a March 1 direction of the Supreme Court, whereby 2,318 prisoners granted interim bails by trial courts and 356 prisoners granted bail by high court were asked to surrender within 15 days.It also directed the director general (prisons) to ensure that this order is conveyed to all the 3,499 undertrials by telephone and all other available modes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-hc-directs-3499-undertrials-to-surrender-from-march-7-101615053787629.html

Also, the city is likely to witness a rise in mercury by around two degrees Celsius over the next few days.According to the CPCB, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Saturday was 182 against 250 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 204 against 310 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 213 against 276 a day earlier. An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi-NCR may see thundery development on Sunday leading to cloudiness and drizzle in some areas due to a feeble western disturbance. However, due to the low intensity of the western disturbance, the rise in mercury will continue, IMD said. “The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to rise across NCR, including Noida, by two degrees Celsius,” said an official at IMD.On Saturday, the maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida were recorded at 30.9 degrees Celsius and 17 degrees Celsius respectively, against 30.5 and 16.7 degrees a day earlier.

Temperatures will increase further for the rest of the month as mercury to rise slightly due to change in wind directions and shift in cloud covers prior to any western disturbance. Temperatures will thus keep rising and could only drop slightly by two-three degrees over the span of two days on March 9 and 10 due to another upcoming western disturbance,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve further. “Surface winds are high and south-westerly and forecasted to change in direction towards easterly.

According to the police, the gang has allegedly been active for the past four years at least.“They mostly operated around the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and portions of the Yamuna Expressway where they would pick up solitary passengers, offer them a lift and then rob them at gunpoint of their valuables including cash, ATM cards and jewellery, before letting them go. Members of the gang would already be sitting in the vehicle in a show of legitimacy of the service,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.The three were nabbed following a chase with the Expressway police near Sector 168.

Three people were arrested while nine bottles of foreign liquor and 30 bottles of beer were seized, said the police.Explaining why the party was deemed an unauthorised affair, officials of the excise department said: “In order to serve alcohol in farmhouse parties, organisers are required to take a temporary one-day license. But that was not followed here. Moreover, the liquor which was being served at the party was for sale in Delhi only and not in UP, which further made serving it an illegal act. We have registered a case and due action will be taken against the responsible parties,” said RB Singh, district excise officer.According to police officers, the action was taken based on a tip-off late Friday about an unauthorised party allegedly taking place at the farmhouse.“There are a lot of farmhouses in the area but very few of them are given out for commercial activities. A joint team from the Expressway police station and the excise department reached the spot and found a party taking place there. The men and women at the gathering were let go after questioning but the three organisers of the party were taken into police custody,” said a senior police officer, requesting not to be identified.The arrested suspects were identified as Kapil Kumar and Praveen Rathi, both residents of Delhi, and Lalit Kumar, a Noida resident.

The Ghaziabad police said that through electronic surveillance, started tracking the suspects and nabbed three of them near Raj Nagar Extension late Friday, when they allegedly came for another robbery in the area. The Ghaziabad police initially lodged an FIR under section 392 (robbery) at Kavi Nagar police station while the it was changed to IPC section 395 (dacoity) when involvement of more suspects came to the fore.In a statement, the Delhi Police said on Saturday that the prime suspects Khairul, Mulla and Sheikh were arrested by the crime branch from near Lado Sarai in Delhi. The Delhi Police said Srivastava allegedly used to provide rented houses and cars to the gang which they used in crimes. The police said that the gang members would allegedly target houses in posh colonies and mostly entered houses after cutting window grilles, and they used the same modus operandi during the dacoity at Garg’s house in Ghaziabad. “During interrogation, it was revealed that all the (three) suspects are Bangladesh nationals and involved in several cases of dacoity and burglaries committed in NCR. Khairul is the gang leader and has been committing crimes since 1997. He and Mulla illegally entered India through Satkhira Border, West Bengal, in October 2020. Sheikh also illegally entered India and was residing in Kolkata with his family,” the Delhi Police said in the statement, adding that Khairul allegedly met Srivastava in 2012. Police said Khairul has 15 criminal cases against him while Mulla and Sheikh have 19 and two cases, respectively, against them at police stations across NCR. “One of our teams went to Delhi to bring the three prime suspects on transit remand for more questioning in the Raj Nagar incident. We recovered the car used and ₹26,600 from the three suspects arrested by us,” the Ghaziabad SP (city 1) said. The Delhi Police recovered gold and silver jewellery and expensive wrist watches from the suspects arrested in Delhi. Victim Pawan Garg said he identified jewellery items and watches which belonged to his family. “But I have opted not to identify the suspects as all of them were covering their faces during the incident,” Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/armed-dacoity-at-bizman-s-house-in-ghaziabad-three-bangladesh-nationals-among-six-arrested-101615053007618.html

According to rules, the district administration can attach only those properties against which the UP Rera had recommended action for failing to deliver promised flats to buyers.“The defaulters would have shifted their money into personal property but we cannot move against that. So we have sought the government’s nod to move in that direction,” he said. “We don’t have the power to e-auction the property through the revenue courts either. We requested the government to either invest the powers to the district revenue officers or get the Noida Authority, which is the land owning agency, to do it and recover the money.” The request was made at a meeting of builders, buyers and district authority before the UP chief secretary R K Tiwari on Saturday.Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer of Noida Authority, said, “Chief secretary directed us to set up camps to carry out registry of flats. He also wanted a forum to address homebuyers’ issues.” RK Arora, the chairman of Supertech Group and the president National Real Estate Development Council (UP), who also attended this meet, said that they sought that land rates be decided on recent Supreme Court judgment. Namit Gautam, president of apartment owners’ association of Prateek Fedora sector 61, said that ever since the Noida authority has announced not to issue completion certificate, till the sports complexes are completed in sector 150 and other sports’ city, it has created panic among the buyers. “We raised the point that if any builder violates the terms and conditions, only he/she should be banned or blacklisted for further projects. There must be an exclusive cell/ department of officers and staff, under the UP Apartment Act, to address the disputes related to builders and buyers in Noida Authority,” he said. The chief secretary said that he has noted the points of all the parties. “After a discussion on all the points, we’ll take the decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-admin-seeks-government-s-permission-to-attach-personal-properties-of-builders-101615052889298.html
06-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad hospital sees long vaccine queue as staff ‘late’ by an hour||Ghaziabad: Long queues ensued at the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital on Saturday for the Covid-19 vaccine. It was the only government facility in the district administering the shots on Saturday. Beneficiaries said the staff arrived around 10am even though vaccination was supposed to start at 9am.Vaccination for senior citizens and those having co-morbidities (category 3) is on and the district, during the past three sessions on March 1, 4 and 5, saw 6,749 people take their first dose out of a target of 93,480 for the month. “The staff generally comes around 8.30am. On Saturday, however, they arrived at 10am. There were serpentine queues of beneficiaries who were not maintaining social distance. I requested them to observe precautions,” said Vinod Malhotra, 72, who came with his wife for her vaccination. “Many senior citizens are not used to the Co-WIN portal, so they are registering on the spot. On Friday, the staff provided tokens to beneficiaries for their turn but on Saturday, no token was given,” he added. When contacted, Dr Sanjay Teotia, the chief medical superintendent of the hospital, said: “The staff who administers the vaccination is not from our hospital and has been provided by the chief medical officer (CMO).”District CMO Dr NK Gupta said that the vaccination drive at the hospital has been running for six days while other government health facilities were directed to operate for three days – on Monday, Thursday and Friday.“We will direct staff to ensure there is no delay, and that all Covid-related protocols are observed strictly. Generally, they come early but may have faced some delay on Saturday. I will ask them to ensure the vaccination begins timely. We have observed that attending to a beneficiary sometimes takes as long as 15-20 minutes. This is because about 50% of our 25 centres do not have computers and staff have to access the Co-Win portal on their mobile phones,” he added. According to officials, vaccination is being taken up at 20 private hospitals and 25 government healthcare facilities in the district, including the one at Sanjay Nagar. “During a conference with state health officials on Saturday, we were directed that walks-in should preferably be vaccinated at government facilities while private hospitals should preferably entertain only those who pre-register. They (private hospitals) should entertain walk-ins only if they have slots left,” CMO added. According to officials, at least 19,269 healthcare workers took the jab out of about 25,000 (77.07% coverage) while 14,480 of the 19,269 took their second dose as well till March 5. Of the 18,897 frontline workers, 10,592 (coverage of about 56.05%) took their first dose while 747 of 10,592 took their second dose till March 5 in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-hospital-sees-long-vaccine-queue-as-staff-late-by-an-hour-101615052827590.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pocso court sentences man to 5-year rigorous jail for molesting minor||In a speedy trial, a special Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) court on Friday sentenced a 52-year-old man to five years of rigorous imprisonment, about two-and-a-half months after he molested a 7-year-old girl residing in his neighbourhood.This is the second instance in a week wherein special judge MA Baraliya has concluded a trial in child abuse case in two-and-a-half months. The special judge had on Monday sentenced a 48-year-old man to three years of rigorous imprisonment for flashing a 13-year-old girl on several occasions in October 2020.In the case that concluded on Friday, the man was booked by Deonar police for inappropriately touching a 7-year-old girl in his house. As per the prosecution case, on October 23, 2020 around 4pm, the girl was playing with a boy in the neighbourhood when the accused called her to his house. When the girl went to his house, he gave her ₹5 and moved his hands all over her body. The girl felt uncomfortable and left crying.She narrated the incident to her mother. The mother then lodged a complaint with Deonar police.Public prosecutor Sulbha Joshi examined four witnesses, which included the child, her mother and two investigating officers, to bring home the guilt of the accused. The accused had claimed that he was implicated in a false case by the child’s mother due to previous disputes and quarrels between them. The accused also claimed that the incident was not possible as both his son and his son’s friend were present in the room at the specified time and no such incident took place.The prosecution, however, pointed out that there was no quarrel between the accused and the minor’s mother so as to implicate the accused in a false case. The prosecution argued that the victim was so afraid of him that she did not like to see the accused when she was asked to identify him. “She was shying and concealing her face. Her behaviour proves that she had been sexually molested by the accused,” Joshi had contended.The court, after hearing both sides, held, “Notably, the reaction of the prosecutrix (victim), during recording her testimony, when she was asked to identify the accused, cannot be ignored. She was not ready to see him. When the accused was brought by opening slightly the door of the chamber, she concealed her face in her palm. It was her spontaneous reaction when the turn of identification of accused was there. Her such a reaction indicates that she faced wrong acts by the accused.”The court further negated the defence of the accused that the incident could not have taken place in front of his son and son’s friend. The court observed, “Obviously, accused’s son and his friend were present in the same room, who according to the prosecutrix were busy on mobile. It is possible that they both either didn’t notice what the accused was doing with the prosecutrix or didn’t have courage, even noticing to desist the accused from doing that. So, presence of both didn’t make any difference for the accused to sexually assault upon the girl.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-pocso-court-sentences-man-to-5-year-rigorous-jail-for-molesting-minor-101615052709485.html

06-03-2021||Mumbai||NCB charge sheet based on inadmissible evidence: Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer||A day after the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) filed its charge sheet in the drug case that the agency probed in connection with untimely death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, actor Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer advocate Satish Maneshinde on Saturday said that it appears to be based on inadmissible evidence. NCB has named Chakraborty and 32 others in the charge sheet. “Entire NCB from top to bottom was deployed in unearthing the purported drug abuse in Bollywood, but there is hardly any material against any known faces who were paraded during the investigation,” Maneshinde said, commenting on the 11,700-page charge sheet.NCB has, in the charge sheet, said that Rhea procured and financed narcotic substances for Rajput with the help of her brother Showik. In this regard Maneshinde said, “The court has found no prima facie material, at the stage of bail, of alleged financing drugs etc.”“The charge sheet is a damp squib standing on the foundation of inadmissible evidence and statements recorded under section 67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act even after the Supreme Court judgement in Toofan Singh’s case,” he said, adding, “We will have the last laugh.”NCB, in the charge sheet, has heavily relied on the statements given by 33 accused before the officer. The statements would be corroborated with other evidence such as chats, audio messages exchanged, and relevant bank account entries. The central agency has also claimed that Chakraborty has taken delivery of drugs at her residence, and thus drugs were stored at her house. She has allegedly provided fund for purchase of drugs; thus she has financed an activity related to illicit drug dealings, NCB has claimed. In view of this, NCB said that Chakraborty has facilitated a channel of supply of drugs with Showik’s help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-charge-sheet-based-on-inadmissible-evidence-rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer-101615052528985.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Board aspirants deal with new challenges as exams approach||Over the last few days, 15-year-old Santosh Shirke has been chatting with his class teacher over the phone almost every day. Santosh, a Class 10 student at an aided school in the city, migrated to his hometown in Lanja, Ratnagiri in April 2020 after his father lost his job in a private manufacturing unit in Bandra. A diligent student who has almost always topped his class in the past, Santosh could not attend online classes due to poor connectivity in his hometown. With state board exams drawing close, he now relies on phone calls to teachers and his friends to get his last-minute queries addressed. “I could barely attend a few classes and despite studying hard, some concepts are still difficult to grasp for me. Thankfully, my teachers have been a call away to solve my issues all this while,” he said. With the disturbances caused due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown, children who are set to appear for their Class 10 and 12 board exams are anxious. With schools moving online, their methods of study have also changed significantly. Group studies with friends, doubt solving sessions with teachers, personal tuitions and in person exams are replaced with endless video and phone calls, online exams and peer support over WhatsApp. Vivaan Shah, a Class 10 student at Campion School in south Mumbai, said it has been a difficult year for students like him who are set to write their board exams this year. “To begin with, we cannot make a distinction between home life and school life with school moving online now. This means there are a lot of distractions at every point. If you pick up your phone to attend a class or solve a test, you end up browsing the internet or replying to text messages. Besides that, the breaks that a physical school environment provides by allowing us extracurricular activities is something that we all miss in a home learning environment,” he added. Even as physical meetups are not feasible considering the associated risks, students are finding their way around with the help of technology. For instance, Aashima Soni, a Class 10 student from Hiranandani Foundation School in Thane, said that over all these months, she has relied on online coaching and her friends and school chat groups for academic support. “It is always nice to call or text a friend in case of a query. We have these conversations in person in school but now that schools are online, it is best to take our conversations online too. We solve tests, do revisions and a lot more and keep each other in the loop all the time,” added Soni. At Sanjay Nagar slums in Jogeshwari (East), nearly 50 students are appearing for their Class 10 and 12 exams this year. Local activist Durga Gudilu started conducting guidance sessions for these students and also drew up a daily routine for studying in the common hall of the community. “Children have gone through a lot during all these months — many have lost relatives, many parents have lost jobs or livelihood sources. Our aim was to give these students a boost so that they forget all their anxieties for a while and focus on their exams. We hope that by studying together, they can motivate each other. Our tutors help address their queries too, which adds to their confidence, she added. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will conduct the HSC (Class 12) examinations between April 23 and May 29, 2021 and SSC (Class 10) examinations between April 29 and May 31. CBSE will hold its board exams between May 4 and June 10. While for Council For Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) board students, ICSE (Class 10) exams will be held between May 5 and June 7, and ISC (Class 12) exams will be held between May 5 and June 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-board-aspirants-deal-with-new-challenges-as-exams-approach-101615051808543.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||₹1.2-crore gold recovered from an aircraft at Mumbai airport||The Mumbai airport customs on Thursday found gold worth over ₹1.2 crore in an aircraft. The gold packages were found behind the metal plate in the toilet mirror of the flight that landed in Mumbai from the Middle East. Even with international borders being sealed, smuggling seems to be ongoing in the limited flights operating from few countries. Airport sources confirmed that the air intelligence unit of Mumbai airport customs found three packages of gold from Etihad Airways EY 206 after the flight landed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) on March 4. A senior airport official said, “These packages had gold bars and wet gold dust weighing 3,136 grams, worth a total of ₹12,381,865. The packages were concealed behind the metal plate behind the washroom’s mirror.” According to sources, the gold was recovered on the basis of specific inputs received by intelligence officers. A customs official requesting anonymity said, “The recovery was made on the basis of tip-off and so we were sure of the gold being hidden in the aircraft. However, the modus was one of its kind; so, it was difficult to find the smuggled metal.” Another officer close to the investigation said, “It was only after prolonged search operation that the gold was found in the aircraft’s toilet. There have been many cases in the past where smugglers hide it under the toilet seat, but this was the first case where gold was hidden behind the mirror, giving negligible chance of being caught.” A senior customs official said, “We have been making cases since September, even when the international borders are yet to open. We are investigating the matter, but it is difficult to reach the smuggler in such cases as the airport staffers who have access to all these areas do not usually get caught.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/12crore-gold-recovered-from-an-aircraft-at-mumbai-airport-101615051628827.html

Ghaywal and Marne’s rivalry was part of a gang war that ensued in the city in the early 2010s. They had both been arrested then and acquitted in murder cases in 2020 by various courts. While Ghaywal was sent to two years of externment from Pune within months of his release, Marne was booked under eight cases by various police forces for participating in a rally with scores of cars to celebrate his release from Taloja jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/marne-held-by-pune-rural-police-under-mpda-101615051207528.html
06-03-2021||Dehradun||Chamoli tragedy: Month later, rescue continues; experts say 'no lessons learnt'||After a month of Uttarakhand's Chamoli tragedy that struck on February 7, many questions remain unanswered while the rescue work at Topavan hydel project is still going in.Several studies in the past month, including that by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), have said that the tragedy was because of man-made reasons. The Defence Geo-Informatics Research Establishment - a research body under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) - claimed that human activity was not an immediate cause of the disaster.Experts said that such a tragedy happened primarily due to the presence of humans in vulnerable areas on account of various projects and population surge that has brought people close to the door of the tragedies, and when such natural events happen, they become sitting ducks.Many alleged that the attitude of policymakers to such events over the years shows no sense of urgency even after the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy.Delhi-based activist Ajay Gautam said he had even filed a PIL in the aftermath 2013 Kedarnath tragedy to push the state government to monitor the glaciers. He said he has been fighting legally in the High Court that glaciers like Gangotri should be monitored to ensure there is no recurrence of tragedies like the 2013 Kedarnath one.Also read: BJP holds emergency meeting amid speculation of leadership change Uttarakhand“I will share my own experience on the government’s attitude towards such sensitive issues. In 2017, I filed a PIL in Uttarakhand High Court pointing out that an artificial 1500x250 metre glacial lake had formed at the mouth of the Gaumukh glacier due to piling up of the nearly 30-metre-high debris at the mouth of the stream and if is not cleared in time, another Kedarnath-like disaster could happen,” he said.Gautam said in July 2018, the HC directed the state government to rope in the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology to study the status of the glacial lake after every three months and present the reports to the court. “But nothing like that was done, forcing me to approach the HC again last year and following the court’s strong comments, the state government suspended the executive director of Uttarakhand Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre for non-compliance with the court directions,” he said.After the Chamoli tragedy, the state government has taken or announced many steps concerning disaster mitigation in the state, like setting up siren based water level warning system at Raini village in Chamoli, announcing it will rehabilitate people from disaster-prone four districts to safer places, approving ₹45 lakhs for 15 earthquake sensors and so on. But many are questioning why it took so many years even after a major disaster like the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, in which over 3,000 people are still missing, to take such initiatives.“The most tragic part is that nobody seems to be owning the responsibility for the Chamoli tragedy. Initially, when the tragedy struck, there was urgency from all sides, but now, as time passes, that urgency seems to be missing. And I fear people will soon forget Chamoli tragedy and go about their business as usual,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities.Nautiyal said immediately after the Kedarnath tragedy, the state government should have started work on moving people from vulnerable areas, set up early warning systems and finetune their policies with regard to seeking a balance between development and environment in the fragile Himalayas.Also, a month after the tragedy, 132 people are still missing. The rescuers have so far recovered 72 bodies, including 14 from the Tapovan dam tunnel and 42 body parts, samples of which have been taken for DNA testing to ascertain their identity.Many experts are pointing out the fact that it remains unanswered why in the first place are such hydel projects being built up so close to sensitive glacial regions.Hemant Dhyani, member of the Supreme Court-appointed expert body that studied the impacts of hydropower projects on environmental degradation post the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, said, the main question Chamoli tragedy puts and which is being brushed aside is why such projects were built so close to glaciers, endangering the lives of people.“The people responsible for this tragedy should be held accountable and proceedings as per law should be initiated against them,” he saidDhyani said in 2014, an expert body (EB) had recommended that hydel power projects should not be built in disaster-prone Himalayan valleys north of the Main Central Thrust (MCT). “But those recommendations were not adopted. Even Rishiganga valley is located in the region north of the MCT, which is highly prone to landslides, flash floods and earthquake. The inter-ministerial group (IMG) had also recommended in 2014 that the Rishi Ganga should be left pristine," he said.Some like Congress have questioned why despite all technological means and so many agencies involved in rescue ad search operations, the digging of the tunnel couldn’t be expedited.Uttarakhand Congress president Pritam Singh said the government has failed to expedite the search operation. “Even after monitoring from the top level and involving so many high-tech means, 132 people are still missing. We fear that like in the case of the Kedarnath tragedy, many bodies may not be found at all. The government should take responsibility for what has happened in Chamoli,” he said.Swati Bhadoriya, district magistrate who has been coordinating the rescue and search operations, said, it is wrong to say that the search operation has been slow. “The rescuers are facing very difficult challenges, like water flowing into the muck and big boulders coming their way, which makes digging very difficult. Despite all odds, the rescuers have dug around 200 metres,” she said.Timeline of Chamoli disaster:Feb 7: Snow avalanche and rockfall in Chamoli district caused flash floods. Two under-construction hydel power projects- Rishi Ganga and NTPC's Tapovan washed away. Water flowed over the dams causing havoc, with muck and debris also entering dam tunnels.

06-03-2021||Pune||Non-covid deaths higher in 2020 despite drop in road fatalities||The year 2020 was a pandemic year for Pune with Covid claiming over 4,600 deaths, however, the tally of non-Covid deaths were still higher compared to the previous two years. The fatalities in road accidents were lower as the city remained under restrictions for a large period of the year. In 2020, a total of 33,581 persons died in Pune due to non-Covid reasons while Coronavirus that causes Covid claimed 4,613 lives, taking the overall tally to 38,194, according to statistics released by the birth and death registration department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). In comparison, 2019 saw 32,353 deaths in Pune due to various reasons while in 2018 a total of 31,570 people lost their lives. Experts suggest that during the lockdown, many patients could not visit hospitals and doctors failed to keep a track of comorbidities which worsened their situation and resulted in deaths. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of the Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra state while speaking on the high numbers for 2020, said that due to lockdown last year, many patients avoided consulting doctors. “Many patients with comorbidities could not meet the doctor to test themselves regularly. Due to transport restrictions, many could not visit doctors as well. The high-risk patients stayed indoors without regular follow up which worsened the conditions of many and resulted in fatalities,” said Dr Bhondwe. He also added that as Covid cases increased last year, doctors were instructed to accommodate only patients with serious issues. Vivek Velankar, a city-based activist said that last year, not many patients could come to Pune city for treatment due to the lockdown while at the same time lockdown kept most in their homes, a reason for a drop in death count in 2020. “As there were travel restrictions, there were almost no road fatalities. This was a good sign but many patients who regularly visited Pune for treatment could not come to the city. This has increased complications in many patients,” said Velankar. As per data shared by Pune police, as many as 143 two-wheelers and pillion riders lost their lives in 2020 compared to 206 two-wheeler and pillion riders who died in 2019. Due to lockdown, there was a spike in cases of distress call received by the Connecting Trust, an NGO that works in suicide prevention. “There has been an increase in distress calls. The top three reasons for distress were relationship issues, unemployment and dealing with mental health issues. We also saw an increase in distress emails. We received distressed emails as well during the lockdown. The emails increased to 20 distress emails every month during the first few months of the lockdown. This could be because confidentiality could have been an issue at the time. The idea is for people to know that they are not alone. Emotional support is available whether it is a call or an email,” said Liyaan Sataravala, CEO of Connecting Trust. Dr Kalpana Baliwant, spokesperson and assistant chief of the health department, PMC said that the data reflects people who died in PMC limits. “Many patients were unable to travel to Pune for treatment. Also, deaths from outside Pune are not reflected in the PMC numbers,” said Dr Baliwant.

06-03-2021||Pune||State government passes gunthewari bill to regularise illegal structures until December 2020||The state government on Friday passed a “gunthewari scheme” bill to regularise unauthorised small plots up to December 31, 2020, which will legalise constructions for 20 years under the scheme, a move largely going to benefit recently merged villages in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Earlier, the state government introduced gunthewari on January 1, 2001, under the Maharashtra Gunthewari Developments (Regulation, Upgradation and Control) Act. In the month of January, the state government took a decision in the state cabinet meeting that the state will revive the scheme in a new format and regularise gunthewari construction up to December 31, 2020. Gunthewari is known as a method invoked to measure land as per the gunthewari act, the practice of creating small plots of agricultural land in multiple gunthas (1,089 sq ft area) was illegal and hence, carrying out constructions on gunthewari land was also illegal. The passage of the bill is also being seen as a step keeping in mind the upcoming civic elections. Maharashtra urban development minister Eknath Shinde tabled a resolution in the state assembly session to amend the Maharashtra Gunthewari Developments (Regulation, up-gradation and Control) Act, 2001. The state has continued gunthewari in Maharashtra Gunthewari Developments (Regulation, Upgradation and Control) Act passed in 2001 and only changed the date to December 31, 2020. Sunil Tingre, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) of Vadgaonsheri constituency said, “People cannot afford houses due to high prices. Therefore, they construct houses on small plots. It is not as per corporation rules and regulation. They are always under the fear of action because as per corporation norms it is illegal. Now, the government has given them the opportunity to give them legal status. It is a welcome move.” Merged villages to get maximum benefit?With the passage of the bill, the recently merged 11 villages and proposed 23 villages in PMC limit will receive the maximum benefit from this scheme. According to PMC officials, more than 50 lakh square feet area can be regularised under the scheme. In the 2001 gunethwari scheme, the range of regulation cost of construction on gunthewari land was ₹8,000 to 15,000 depending on the areas and the amount of construction. As per PMC statistics, the civic body received 71,449 proposals for sanctioning. Of those, the PMC sanctioned 60,559 proposals from which the corporation received revenue of ₹32.14 crore from gunthewari. There are 10,888 proposals pending for not submitting necessary documents excluding two court cases. Rajendra Raut, superintendent engineer of the building construction and development department said, “We will have to set up a system after we get a notification from the state government. The rate of gunethwari will be decided by the standing committee. The department will send a proposal to the standing committee and the committee will decide per square feet rate to regularise residential and commercial structure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-government-passes-gunthewari-bill-to-regularise-illegal-structures-until-december-2020-101615047787821.html

PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne presented the annual budget for the year 2021-22 on March 1st. With elections on the corner, some elected members proposed installing CCTV cameras and electric poles in their respective wards. PMC electric department head Srinivas Kandul said, “It is true that many members proposed CCTV and electric poles erecting works but, PMC will not give permission blindly. We would install the CCTV cameras only at those places which are suggested by local police. Even the police would need to take responsibility to monitor it. Only then the PMC administration would allow these works.” Kandul said, “It is true that PMC has covered almost all areas by street lighting. We will not allow a new installation. Only if there is a replacement required, then it is okay. For the last few years, we are avoiding installing decorative poles.” According to Kandul, it has become routine practice for elected members to propose decorative poles unnecessarily. “The media and activists have criticised the move on why PMC is spending money on works supposed to be carried out by the Maharashtra State Electric Distribution Limited (MSEDCL).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-says-no-to-unnecessary-cctv-installations-101615047787318.html

The meeting was held even as the budget session of the state assembly was on in Gairsain.The meeting was attended by party central observers Raman Singh and Dushyant Gautam. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat flew from Gairsain in the afternoon to Dehradun to attend the meeting. Members of Parliament from Uttarakhand - Ajay Bhatt, Naresh Bansal, Mala Rajya Laxmi were also present.It was speculated that several ministers were not consulted before declaring Gairsain as the third administrative division of the state, leaving many disgruntled.Also read: Chamoli floods - Rise in overall temp in 40 years could have led to rock collapseBJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat said the meeting with the two central observers was called by the party high command. “This meeting is being held to discuss and take important decisions with regard to the working committee meeting of the state BJP to be held here on March 13 and 14. The state-wide functions with completion of four years of the state government on March 18 will also be discussed in the meeting,” he said.On the speculations that many legislators and ministers were not happy with the CM, Bhagat said there was no such agenda to be discussed in the meeting.After Rawat left for Dehradun, many BJP MLAs also left the assembly session abruptly to attend the meeting.A ruling party MLA, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The CM had held an emergency meeting on Friday till late night with his close aides including a senior cabinet minister.”“Following the meeting, the CM left for Dehradun on Saturday by a helicopter after being called for the core committee meeting. All the ruling party MLAs have also been called for the meeting, many of whom have left by a chopper. Something big is going to happen in the state politics with just a year left for the next state assembly elections,” said the MLA.A senior minister also hinted towards a likely big development. “This was brewing for the last several months as many party MLAs and leaders have been expressing their unhappiness with the style of CM’s work,” the minister said wishing not to be named.“Not only MLAs but several ministers were also unhappy as often in many big policy decisions, he didn’t consult them. Also, many times, he doesn’t listen to the issues of party leaders,” said the minister.Last year, BJP MLA Umesh Sharma Kau from Dehradun had written to party president JP Nadda about his constituency being neglected as far as development work is concerned. The letter followed a similar allegation made by another party legislator Bishan Singh Chuphal, who had alleged that the bureaucrats were disregarding the elected lawmakers.Another BJP MLA Puran Singh Fartyal is also not happy with the government’s decision to re-allocate the construction work of Tanakpur-Jauljibi (TJ) road to the same contractor who was blacklisted after a probe in 2017. Fartyal was served a show-cause notice for working against party discipline and was also summoned by BJP state president Bhagat in August last year.After the meeting concluded, the leaders ruled out a change in leadership and said all was well within the party. “Only some party issued were discussed. No change in state leadership was on the table,” said Raman Singh, the party’s state in-charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/all-is-well-bjp-holds-emergency-meeting-amid-speculation-of-leadership-change-in-ukhand-101615044949970.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||BJP MP Narayan Rane demands President's rule in Maharashtra||BJP MP Narayan Rane on Saturday demanded the imposition of President's rule in Maharashtra alleging "failure" of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in maintaining law and order and its "inept" handling of the COVID-19 crisis.Rane, a bete noire of Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, said he would write to President Ram Nath Kovind and Union Home Minister Amit Shah demanding dismissal of the state government."The law and order in the state has collapsed, crime against women is on the rise and the economy is in a complete mess. The state government is unable to handle the situation. The state has reported the highest number of COVID-19 deaths," the Rajya Sabha MP alleged.The BJP has sharpened its attack on the MVA government in view of recent controversies, including alleged link of Sena MLA Sanjay Rathod to the death of a woman. Owing to pressure, Rathod resigned last month as a state forest minister.Senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar recently attacked the state government over the post of Assembly Speaker, which has been lying vacant since the resignation of incumbent Nana Patole of the Congress."The election schedule (for Speaker's post) must be announced immediately otherwise there would be President's rule," the BJP leader had said.Recently, the mysterious death of Mansukh Hiren, the purported owner of the vehicle with explosives parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house, triggered a war of words between the opposition BJP and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government headed by the Shiv Sena.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis of BJP on Friday demanded a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the incident.On Saturday, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil alleged that suspicious death of Hiren is prima facie a murder.President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra in November 2019, after no political party was able to prove majority in the legislative assembly after elections, on a recommendation by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.Later, the Shiv Sena joined hands with the NCP and Congress to form a coalition government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-mp-narayan-rane-demands-president-s-rule-in-maharashtra-101615040165114.html

06-03-2021||City||'Jagan government borrowed ₹1.55 lakh cr in 20 months': TDP||As the Andhra Pradesh state assembly is getting ready for the budget session in the last week of March, the ruling YSR Congress party and the main opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) have locked horns, accusing each other of being responsible for the mounting debt burden of the state.In a statement on Friday, Telugu Desam Party politburo member and former state finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the Jagan Mohan Reddy government resorted to indiscriminate borrowings to the tune of ₹1.55 lakh crore in the last 20 months of its rule.Quoting a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report and details obtained from the state finance department through a Right to Information (RTI) query, Ramakrishnudu said the Jagan government had incurred debts to the extent of ₹46,503.21 crore through various budgetary proposals in 2019-20 and another ₹73,912.91 crore during 2020-21 till January end.Also read: Maoists kill man branding him as police informer in Andhra’s Vizag forests“Another ₹34,650 crore was raised through non-budgeted borrowings by various state government corporations. In all, an amount of ₹1,55,066.12 crore was raised in the form of loans in a span of 20 months. Despite raising such massive loans, the Jagan government had not taken up any developmental works,” the former finance minister said.He pointed out that the previous TDP regime headed by N Chandrababu Naidu had borrowed ₹1,30,146.98 crore in five years (60 months). The maximum amount of loans taken was ₹38,282 crore in 2018-19.While several developmental works and infrastructure projects were taken up during the TDP regime, the present YSRC government incurred wasteful expenditure in the name of welfare schemes, he said.“Even this so-called welfare is disruptive and dishonest. For example, Jagan is giving ₹10,000 each to autorickshaw drivers under the Vahana Mitra scheme, but he increased the state cess on diesel and petrol. Similarly in the name of house sites scheme, the YSRC leaders embezzled ₹6,500 crore,” the TDP leader alleged.He pointed out that the Jagan government had done away with several welfare schemes launched by the TDP government, such as Anna Canteens, insurance for farmers, loan waiver for farmers, festival gifts to various communities, subsidising foreign education and unemployment allowance.State finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy admitted that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had gone in for huge borrowings in the last 20 months but also defended the same saying it had to borrow more funds because of the crippling of state finances due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The debts availed by the government indeed are more than the budget estimates but it is not confined to Andhra Pradesh. Every state in the country had to face the situation due to Covid-19,” he said.He said the state’s revenue had come down drastically due to the pandemic and the state had to spend huge money to control the disease.Reddy said the government had taken a conscious decision to continue the welfare schemes despite negative growth. “While the Chandrababu Naidu government had spent borrowed funds on unproductive works, our government has taken loans only to implement welfare schemes for the poor,” Reddy said.He said the direct cash transfer schemes had only increased the purchasing power of the people so that the money would come back into the state economy. “Apart from loans, the state government had an increase in non-tax revenue, apart from grants-in-aid by the Centre,” he said.The minister claimed that the revenue deficit was brought down from minus 12.9 per cent in the first quarter of the 2020-21 financial year to minus 3 per cent by the fourth quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jagan-government-borrowed-rs-1-55-lakh-cr-in-20-months-tdp-101615042296024.html

This has forced the administration to restrict movement and also reintroduce micro-containment zones. Officials believe that rising cases in the district is because of the careless behaviour of citizens, which has led to such a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases.The average positivity rate for the last week of January in the district was 5.8%. This has now gone up to 15%. Apart from the city, a large number of cases are being reported from PCMC too. On Friday, PCMC conducted 3,118 tests and reported 602 new cases - which is a 19.30% positivity rate for the day. The positivity rate is the number of new cases reported for every 100 samples tested. To keep a check on the rising cases the district administration introduced a night curfew in Pune. The municipal corporation, which declared no containment zones in the city on January 1, 2021, has now demarcated 40 micro-containment zones, of which 19 are specific buildings and 21 are housing societies. The most number of cases currently are being reported from Hadapsar, Bibwewadi, Aundh and Kothrud. On Friday, when the city reported 830 new Covid-19 cases, the civic body traced 15,705 contacts of earlier positives, of which 3,124 were high-risk contacts and 12,581, low-risk contacts. To tackle the rising positives the civic body is reopening Covid care and swab centres, which were earlier shut. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We will restart the Covid care centres at Rakshak nagar with 200 beds, and Dalvi hospital with 50 beds, including ICU beds, as cases are rising.

The teams will visit the hotspot areas to check the reasons for the jump in cases in recent days. Maharashtra is among the five states that contributed to 82% of the new cases reported by Saturday morning, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Other states reporting a high number of cases are Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.A health ministry report, cited by news agency ANI, has attributed the upsurge in cases due to “COVID inappropriate behaviour” and gatherings due to recent gram panchayat elections, wedding season and the increased crowd in public transport. "While the exact causes of the surge are not known - since laxity in COVID behaviour is not specific to the state - the possible factors are COVID inappropriate behaviour due to lack of fear of disease, pandemic fatigue; miss outs and super spreaders; and enhanced aggregations due to recent gram panchayat elections, marriage season and opening of schools and crowded public transport," ANI quoted the report. The report also suggested that the state health machinery may have become lax following a dip in the cases of the coronavirus disease after September 2020. Suggesting measures to break the chain of transmission, the report said, "District/state-wise participative plan, engaging the community may yield better results rather than knee-jerk reactions. Revenue machinery needs to take full charge."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-over-10-000-covid-19-cases-for-second-consecutive-day-total-infections-breach-2-2-million-mark-101615040048714.html

Azam Khan's son Abdullah Azam has also been made an accused and ever since the BJP came to power, this family is facing continued problems. They are being framed in fake cases,” Chaudhary alleged.The SP has been supporting Khan since the beginning, he said.The Lok Sabha MP has set up the Johar university and taken steps towards spreading higher education and improving the lives of the youth but he is being humiliated and harassed by the government, the spokesman alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-to-initiate-cycle-yatra-against-bjp-s-oppression-of-azam-khan-101615036737923.html

The accused, identified as Shailendra Kumar of Bihar, was allegedly trying to allure the mother of the brothers to have a relationship with him for about a year. Shiv Shankar Tiwari, 26, said Shailendra had on Friday evening passed indecent remarks at his wife following which they threatened him of lodging a police complaint and getting him evicted from the room. They also took up the matter with Shailendra’s maternal uncle with whom he was putting up. Both of them apologised with Shailendra promising not to repeat such behaviour, it is learnt. On Saturday morning, Shailendra barged into the room of his neighbour, bolted the room from inside and slit the throats of the brothers with a sharp weapon, before hanging himself from the ceiling fan. At the time of the incident, the father of the children was away at work and mother was washing clothes outside. Hearing the shrieks of the brothers, locals gathered and broke open the door after much efforts. The brothers were taken to a hospital where they were declared brought dead. Focal Point SHO inspector Davinder Sharma said they received information about the crime around 11.22am from the police control room and rushed to the spot. “The maternal uncle of the accused is also missing. We are trying to trace him for recording his statement,” the SHO said. Hapless mother tried in vain to save sons Once the accused bolted the room from inside where the brothers were, their hapless mother, Meenu, begged in vain to save their lives. After the tormenting 15 minutes when locals managed to break open the door, she fainted seeing her sons panting. Meenu said she could hear the accused saying “Ab chakhata hu maza’ (now I will teach you a lesson)”. The family had migrated from Uttar Pradesh four years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/migrant-worker-kills-two-sons-of-his-neighbour-in-ludhiana-hangs-self-101615038728067.html
06-03-2021||Kolkata||Actors, sportsmen to writers in TMC's star-studded candidate list for polls||Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Friday released a star-studded candidate list for 291 assembly seats for the upcoming West Bengal elections. While the chief minister has dropped the names of at least 27 sitting MLAs, several new faces, including actors, sportsmen, ex IPS officers and writers, have been given a chance.Here's taking a look at some interesting candidates.Manoranjan ByapariThe award-winning Bengali Dalit writer was born in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in a Dalit family and had migrated to West Bengal when he was three years old. He had even served a jail term for his alleged Naxal links. Raised in refugee camps, the writer never received a formal education. Later, he started pulling rickshaws in Kolkata and even worked as a cook in a school for more than two decades. In 2020, he was made the chairman of the Dalit Sahitya Academy set up by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. He has been pitted from Balagarh in Hooghly, a seat reserved for SC.Ratna ChatterjeeThe estranged wife of Sovan Chatterjee, former mayor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, has been fielded from Behala Purba, the same constituency from where Sovan Chatterjee had won with a TMC ticket earlier. The spat between the couple made headlines when it came to the public domain. Sovan Chatterjee was once a favourite of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee but the rift between the mayor and the CM widened over problems in Chatterjee’s personal life, causing an embarrassment to the TMC. Later, Sovan and his friend Baisakhi Banerjee joined the BJP. Sovan has already expressed his willingness to contest from Behala Purba with a BJP ticket.Also read: Suvendu Adhikari is BJP’s choice against CM Mamata Banerjee on Nandigram seatSayoni GhoshShe joined the TMC along with a slew of celebrities on February 24. The actress was recently embroiled in a controversy over her remarks against the BJP and subsequent trolling. Veteran BJP leader and former Governor of Tripura and Meghalaya Tathagata Roy filed a complaint against Ghosh accusing her of hurting his religious sentiments. Later, she was backed by Mamata Banerjee. A BJP MP also made derogatory remarks against Ghosh and her family for which the BJP later apologised.“I am grateful to Didi (Mamata Banerjee) that she has shown her faith in me. She said that we have young blood and hence we need to work hard. I would stay amidst the people and work for them,” Ghosh told media persons soon after her name was announced as a TMC candidate from Asansol Dakshin. Union minister Babul Supriyo had won the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency in 2019.Humayun KabirA former IPS officer, Kabir had quit as the police commissioner of Chandannagar in January 2021, just three months before his scheduled retirement. He joined the TMC in February. His wife Anindita Kabir is already with the Trinamool Congress. He had made the headlines, a few days before quitting, when he ordered the arrest of three BJP workers for raising ‘Goli Maro’ slogans in a public rally. Kabir started his career as a school teacher soon after completing his masters. He has also authored books and even directed a short film ‘Aleya’. He has hit the headlines several times in the past for arresting some of the most notorious criminals in the state and investigating some of the controversial cases. The TMC has fielded him from Debra, his home turf.Raj ChakrabortyA noted Tollywood director, Chakraborty joined the TMC in February along with a host of other celebrities. On Friday, TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee announced the candidate list fielding Chakraborty form one of the toughest constituencies, Barrackpore. Heavyweight BJP MP Arjun Singh won from Barrackpore.Chakraborty’s challenge is however two-fold. While on one hand he has to face the BJP MP who has much sway in that area, on the other hand being a newcomer in TMC he also has to face the TMC supporters, a section of whom, have already voiced their disgruntlement. Chakraborty, however, sounded confident of his victory and said that he would win the seat and gift it to the TMC supremo. As for the disgruntlement, he said, "Initially some small differences may crop up. But once I visit the constituency, start working with the people and speak to them, I am sure everything would be sorted out".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/actors-sportsmen-to-writers-in-tmc-s-star-studded-candidate-list-for-polls-101615038237031.html

On Friday, 1,767 people tested positive in Pune district, which takes the tally of total active cases 18,401.“We are again getting 50 to 60 calls per day, for the last 20 days. Demand was almost nil in January and early February, but suddenly we are getting many calls. Finding donors is the biggest problem for us as many don’t have the amount of antibodies required to donate plasma, while a few are not willing to give,” explained Dr Rachana Deshpande, Indian Serological Institute, Sadashiv peth.Blood banks are also struggling, as they have got many such names on their list of persons that have been healed from the Covid-19 virus eight months ago. Such persons cannot become plasma donors as antibodies do not stay in the body for such a long time.A recovered Covid-19 patient can donate plasma between 28 days and three months of full recovery.“We are only able to meet 50 per cent of the demand, as we are short of plasma,” said Dr Shankar Mosalagi, blood transfusion officer at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH), where there are 20 calls per day for plasma.Between January and the second week of February YCMH used to only get two-three calls per day.“We are making calls to people every day, but very few are showing an interest in donating plasma,” added Dr Sarika Patil, Aadhar blood centre, Dhankawadi.Plasma dontation in PMC/PCMC as of March 5Number of blood banks providing plasma: 21Total donors: 3,719||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/blood-banks-unable-to-meet-plasma-demand-with-shortage-of-donors-101615038366648.html

A post-mortem has been conducted and the report along with the findings of the probe will be submitted to the district magistrate, Prayagraj’s chief medical officer said.“Taking cognisance of the video, the district magistrate had formed a team to probe the matter. The report will be given to the DM. The probe is underway. Postmortem is being done,” the chief medical officer was quoted as saying by ANI.The incident came into light after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) wrote to the collector of Prayagraj after it received reports of the girl’s death after her parents could not deposit the money required for her treatment at United Medicity Hospital in the city. The hospital allegedly sent the girl and her parents away after her surgery because they could not deposit ₹5 lakh needed for the procedure, according to a report by ANI.The child rights body has asked the district collector to conduct an inquiry into the case and also recommended strict action against the doctors and staff of the hospital. It further asked the district collector to lodge a first information report (FIR) under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, while asking that the kin of the child be also compensated.Satpal Gulati, the vice chairperson of United Group, denied the charges and said the family were not charged money since they were poor. “She was admitted to United Hospital for 15 days. When her condition worsened she was operated on and was kept under observation. The family was not charged any money since they were poor. She was referred to Medical College after she did not recover. Her family took her out the next day,” Gulati was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“Stitching was done but I think she was being treated somewhere else, they may have checked it and the stitches may have opened up. Maybe stitches were cut open for checking,” Gulati added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/3yearold-girl-dies-due-to-medical-negligence-in-prayagraj-up-initiates-probe-101615032950673.html

06-03-2021||Dehradun||Chamoli floods: Rise in overall temp in 40 years could have led to rock collapse||Heavy precipitation in the Chamoli region from February 4-6 and an overall rise in temperature in Uttarakhand in last four decades could have led to the rock collapse which triggered the deadly flash floods in the state last month, according to a study by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.The report by Kathmandu-based ICIMOD, which was released on Friday, found that a crack had formed prior to the incident at the site where the rock detachment led to a rockslide from the Raunti peak.The rockslide brought along with it mounds of earth and snow which could have triggered the flash floods. With a straight slide line of 1.6 km (5500 to 3900 masl), the kinetic energy during the fall generated enough heat to melt the ice.As the debris moved downstream in the Rishiganga river, it pushed running river water ahead of it, including water from small ponding structures along the river path.So far 72 bodies and 30 human body parts have been recovered from different places in the avalanche-hit areas, out of which 41 bodies have been identified. As many as 132 persons are still missing.The ICIMOD is a regional organisation that works on different aspects in the Himalayan-Hindukush region. It has eight members --- India, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal.At the same headwall of the Raunthi peak, a large ice avalanche was previously released somewhere between 19 September and 9 October 2016, which deposited ice and more bedrock in the valley below, the report states.“The resulting destabilisation of the rock due to the lack of ice cover (glacial debuttressing, stress-release fracturing), and increased exposure to solar radiation and hence an increased freeze thaw cycle, in combination with a large snowfall event preceding the event of February 7, 2021 and rapid melt water production, may have favoured the fracturing of rock,” the report states.“This can, however, not explain the depth of the fracture (150 metres), which must have evolved over a longer period of time,” the report states.The ICIMOD report further states that a strong western disturbance passed across Kashmir and northwest India from February 4-6. It was fully charged with convective instability that may have contributed to the heavy precipitation. The Uttarakhand tragedy occurred on February 7.“Numerical simulation of some of the attributes have been carried out which depict strong evidence of heavy precipitation contributing to high flows downstream,” it said.The numerical simulation on February 4 shows heavy precipitation over the region. The western disturbance travelled with relatively slower speed and its stagnancy produced concentrated precipitation, the report states.“Precipitation data derived from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission suggests that there were continuous precipitation events from February 3-5 which resulted in approximately 58 mm of cumulative precipitation. Most of the precipitation in the high altitude areas of Chamoli would have occurred as snowfall,” it states.The temperatures are also rising in Uttarakhand, the report states, saying maximum temperature in the Chamoli area has increased at the rate of 0.032 degrees C per year between 1980 and 2018.Furthermore, January 2021 was the warmest January on record in Uttarakhand for six decades, the report states.“While a hazard event like the flood at Chamoli cannot be directly attributed to climatic changes, the increased thaw-freeze cycle of permafrost could have partially contributed to the event,” it states.A report by the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) also stated that the collapse of a massive rock, which brought down a large amount of earth and snow, may have triggered the flash floods.The debris also blocked the mouth of a stream in the upper reaches of the Rishiganga river. This led to formation of a glacial lake which is being monitored continuously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/chamoli-floods-rise-in-overall-temp-in-40-years-could-have-led-to-rock-collapse-101615027269627.html

There's hardly any material against any known faces who were paraded during the investigations, I wonder why?

We will have the Last Laugh," he added.The NCB filed a case in August 2020 after it received official communication from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), in which there were various chats related to drug consumption, procurement, usage, and transportation.The ED had on July 31, 2020, registered an Enforcement Case Information Report in the late actor's death case after a First Information Report (FIR) was filed by Rajput's father KK Singh against Rhea Chakraborty in Bihar on July 28, last year.Rhea Chakraborty was in a relationship with Rajput at the time of his death on June 14, 2020, when he was found dead in his bedroom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/damp-squib-rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer-on-ncb-chargesheet-in-sushant-singh-case-101615020247967.html

In academic session 2021-22, we will include 20-25 schools in this board,” Kejriwal said.Watch: Delhi to have its own school education board: Kejriwal explains the goalsThis means that the CBSE affiliation of the schools will be scrapped after which the schools will be affiliated to the Delhi board of school education.On the method of selection of schools for the new board of education, chief minister informed that the schools will be selected after discussion with principals and teachers of the schools. He added that the government hopes that within the next 4-5 years, all schools will voluntarily get affiliated to the board.About the constitution of the board of school education, Kejriwal said that the board will have two bodies and will be headed by a CEO. One will be the governing body which will be chaired by Delhi's education minister and the other will be the executive body which will look after the day-to-day functions.Kejriwal added that both the governing and the executive body will have experts from the education sector, bureaucrats, and principals of both government and private schools.Last year, the Delhi government had constituted two committees to prepare the scheme and framework for the formation of the state education board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-have-its-own-school-education-board-cm-kejriwal-101615017795741.html
06-03-2021||Chandigarh||Thakur presents Himachal budget, aims to revive Covid-hit economy||Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur presented the budget for the 2021-22 in the Himachal Pradesh assembly on Saturday. The fourth budget of the BJP government aims to revive the economy of the state that has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The world economy was hit and India and Himachal weren’t left untouched. India’s economy shrunk to -23.9% in the first quarter of this financial year. However, the steps taken by the Centre have put the economy back on track with India seeing a V-shape recovery,” Thakur said. According to estimates, Himachal Pradesh’s economy will register a negative growth of -6.2%, which is 1.5% better than the national average, he said. The per capita income is likely to be ₹1,83,286, which is ₹56,318 higher than the national per capita income, said Thakur. Announcing ₹9,405-crore outlay for development works, the chief minister said that the state planning department will be known as Niti Vibhag. The grant received from Nabard under the rural infrastructure development fund for MLA priority schemes has been enhanced from ₹120 crore to ₹135 crore. The MLA Local Area Development Fund, suspended after the Covid-19 outbreak last year, would be fully restored from April 1. It has been enhanced from ₹1.75 crore to ₹1.8 crore. Salaries and allowances of legislators, cut by 30% in wake of the pandemic, will also be restored. Given the success of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) sponsored crop diversification scheme in five districts, the state government has decided to extend it to all 12 districts. The ₹1,055-crore scheme will be started in 2021-22. A sum of ₹20 crore has been proposed for natural farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/thakur-presents-himachal-budget-aims-to-revive-covid-hit-economy-101615017006159.html
06-03-2021||Other||Startup mantra: Women entrepreneurs who hacked the glass ceiling... and beyond||PUNE Stepping into business, managing personal life, scaling the business is easier said than done. Women are challenged with subtle discrimination while dealing with clients, investors and other stakeholders of their business ecosystem. On the occasion of International Women’s Day, on March 8, HT spoke with women entrepreneurs from startups, and the information technology sector to highlight their experiences on their entrepreneurial journey, their plans for this year and their message to other women entrepreneurs.--------------------------Hemangi VartakFounder, Gifts Galore; and founder, Jungle Belles (wildlife club and tours exclusively for women)“I quit my full-time job after my second daughter in 2008 and did not want to get back into it. I wanted to give equal attention to my home and girls. This is when I got into business in 2009 and started my own company ‘Gifts Galore’. Gifting was a very competitive business - right from large setups to gift shops, were my competitors. It was initially difficult to survive due to low margins in this business. That’s when I started with this novel idea of birthday wishing. This was a unique one which really worked.These had been hard times in 2020 for most of us from the business fraternity and with advertising costs soaring. So, to survive in the competition one needs to find ways to reach new customers as well build a bond with existing customers, as that’s the best way to keep ahead in the competition. And this is exactly where Gifts Galore scores above every other medium.I always had support of my family and my husband when I started. I feel a good backbone system at home is very essential for any woman who steps out for work. After starting the business, it took four years to break even. In recent times, I found an investor as they found potential in my work. I plan to take the Birthday Wishing (bonding with stakeholders) concept to the next level. Message to other women entrepreneurs“There is no limit to what we as women can accomplish”, said Michelle Obama. I would like to say that believe in yourself, find time for your passion that keeps you going and you can accomplish anything under the sun. The achievements might be different for all, but they will surely satisfy the soul.”-------------Renu SalgarkarCo-Founder, Classboat“After working internationally, I realised that I wanted to work on some bigger purpose and contribute to the Indian education system, and towards a student’s life from an early age. So, I came back and started our own venture to create an impact in millions of students’ lives.“Having a supportive family around is a privilege and this gives you energy to navigate every up and down. Me, and my husband, working together towards our life and company mission gives us enormous energy and makes us understand the challenges, as well as successes, of this journey very well. We were always lucky that both of our parents respected our aspirations. However, I think the most important part of being an entrepreneur is your belief in what you are doing. If you believe in what you are doing, everyone will start supporting you and respecting your decision. “Our venture, Classboat, has turned profitable from the first year of operation and has used its positive cash-flow for expansion into 160+ cities of India. Sometime unforeseen changes like Covid have impacted business, but that I consider as a blessing in disguise, to take a step back and think of adding more product lines to add value in our students lives directly and indirectly. Backed by strong data over the last four years, Classboat is now building India’s first artificial intelligence (AI)-based courses platform. This platform is in beta phase and has shown transformation in 300+ students already in the last four months.Message to other women entrepreneurs“I urge all women to realise their dreams and start chasing them. There will be many people who will tell you it won’t happen, but just ask yourself how can it happen? If you be very focused towards your goal, then all the hard times and obstacles become unimportant.”---------------------------------------------------Purva SurseFounder, KYRA Natural Salon“Honestly, I never thought I would enter the beauty business world, specially having done Engineering and a Master’s degree in Computers. I believe my mom has a major role in influencing me to fall in love with beauty and Ayurveda. When I first told my parents about the salon idea, my mom was supportive, but it took me a few months to convince my dad. I showed him how my salon would be different and the ways it can help other people. Finally, when they were on board, I got their full support.“I recently completed formal education in cosmetics from a UK-based school and became a certified organic skincare formulator. Accessing finance was difficult initially, but I started with a small investment. I took a loan from a bank to start my business. I had a pretty good experience with the bank. I would really encourage women entrepreneurs to take the support from banks since they have reduced interest rates for women entrepreneurs. “The recent lockdown was a major turning point in my business. I learned a lot about managing finances. During the lockdown, I started consulting customers online for free and making online videos in order to help them with DIY recipes. I also made fresh, natural, customised skin and hair kits for my clients and started delivering it in the city. This helped me bring in a little revenue, with which I was able to pay my staff. I have now decided to start my own beauty line of natural and organic products that will help people solve their skin and hair related issues.”Message to other women entrepreneurs“If you truly believe in your idea and you are sure that your idea is going to solve people’s problems, then go for it. You will face lot of problems dealing with finances. Being a women entrepreneur is not easy, but fighting against the odds will make you a super business woman. Always aim high and be prepared to work extra hard. Enjoy and live the process. It’s worth it.”------------------------------------------------------------------Snehal LondheManaging director, Payod Industries; Maharashta head of women’s wing of the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DICCI)“I used to work while completing my education. After marriage in 1996, I continued to work and became aware of women’s-related issues as my work profile demanded that we travel to different parts of the country. In 2008 my husband and I, both left our highly-paying jobs and returned to our village Hingangaon in Sangli district of Maharashtra, with the thought of starting our own company. “Convincing our parents was not at all easy. No one was happy with our decision as we took the risk of doing business. It wasn’t easy to avail of finance. Our factory location was in a rural area, we were first generation entrepreneurs and above that, our product was also new. So, we didn’t get any response from block-level banks. So, we decided to bootstrap our venture and took credit from friends, sold our property and used our bank deposits, personal funds, investments for setting up our business.“In 2011, we got chance to present our products at a CII conference held in Pune. A handshake with Ratan Tata is one of our most memorable moments of our entire business journey and we never looked back after that. Recently, the development commissioner of Industries of Maharashtra, sanctioned our Hand Gloves Cluster. We are supporting rural enterprises to grow and I’m happy to share that now 100 of our 500 women employees have become employers. Also, we are thinking about setting up a Gloves Museum so that everyone will get information regarding all types of gloves. We want to create industrial tourism here as well.Message to other women entrepreneurs“Increase your network and speak-up wherever necessary. Trust people and be a solution for someone. Never restrict yourself from doing the right things. Leave your ego aside to achieve your goals. Have a clear vision of your goals. Have patience and be passionate about your Work. Build the people, and the people will build you.”-------------------Sujata SalviCOO, Eviox TechAfter marriage, I decided to explore the entrepreneurial spirit in me. This shift of mindset from being an employee to being an employer was a piece of work initially. My family and husband have been supportive throughout. Proficiency becomes a bit challenging when you have the power to run an organisation, because you get to decide everything. That’s the real test of yourself I would say. “Life workwise has always been a good experience so far. There are a few bad experiences, but they only make you strong and seasoned at the end. One good experience I would truly love to share is that of working on big data project for TCS. It catapulted the best out of the entire team handling multiple teams across the globe. I personally learned a lot.“2021 will be a huge breakthrough as I will be working on my upcoming books and also on business expansion in India.” Message for other women entrepreneurs“A woman must recognise herself and the boundless willpower she is gifted with. She can be a success story in everything she does. Never submit to any failure easily. We build our empire on our own terms so be brave enough to start at any time it’s never too late.”-----------------------------------------------------------Pranoti NandurkarLead, Women Tech Makers, Google Developer Group “In my early college days, around 2005, when social media and learning resources were very limited, we used to travel to Pune from Ahmednagar just to attend seminars or sessions on different technologies. Small cities did not have enough facilities, infrastructure or mentors. There was a huge gap between what is needed by the industry and what we were learning. There I realised the need of a tech community where we can share experiences and help each other grow. And that’s how my journey started.“GDG (Google Developer Group) and WTM (Women tech makers), both are tech communities backboned by Google, where we focus on the latest trends in the industry, workshops and hands-on on new technologies. Women tech makers focuses on diversity in tech. We provide a platform for women to showcase their skills and provide resources which help them to grow in their career. We connect them with women leaders in tech industry, arrange various talks and workshops. This helps our community members to be skilled with the latest technology, and to be motivated in the workforce for longer time.“One of the turning points in my life was getting an invitation and sponsored tour of Google’s headquarters in Silicon Valley. Moreover, I got a chance to meet and interact with Sundar Pichai in person, which is a dream for every techie.“We have panned our International Women’s Day celebration on March 20 and 21. It will be online event you can register on https://iwdindia.inMessage for other women techies“Learn things which are the need of the industry. Showcase your skills and talent. Create and join groups of likeminded people, where you can discuss your new learnings and get feedback. To grow in your career, don’t rely on others to stand up for you because it’s your road, others can walk with you but no one can walk for you.”-----------------------------------------------------------Sneha Sahasrabuddhe Founder, Kovid Bio Analytics (A boutique service provider in healthtech, bioinformatics, edtech and data storage domains)“I am a bioinformaticist by education and love working on projects that challenge my knowledge as well as skill sets from the very beginning of my career. After six years of experience in the IT industry, I felt that my mettle would be better tested while running my own business and it would give me enough challenge and opportunities. “I was two years into my marriage when I founded Kovid BioAnalytics and it was a mutual and well-planned decision between my husband Mandar and I. He was still working to ensure that our income stayed stable, while I stepped into the uncertainty of a start-up venture. Both our parents and our family were extremely supportive of the decision and encouraged, helped and mentored our venture in their respective roles.“I had decided that we would go the bootstrap way, and would fund the business from my own savings, to begin with. When KBA stabilised around 2015, Mandar also joined me as a co-founder. The biggest challenge that we faced as a team was around the middle of 2019, when our US-based clients had to halt their projects owing to some regulatory and business challenges that they faced. This was a major set-back for us. This also gave us the time and opportunity to work on our own cloud-based platform – eDhanvantari, a virtual clinic management system designed specifically for clinics and hospitals in India. eDhanvantari helped us convert the pandemic into a turning point for ourselves, thanks to an excellent team of skilled, brilliant and hard-working folks. “We coursed through the lockdown months working seven-days a week, on service projects as well as two new in-house products – Cloud It and Skool Up. This enabled us to venture outside the healthtech domain into edutech and data storage. Message for other women entrepreneurs“Never Say No!, has been my mantra from day one. The present conditions in India are highly favourable for technology startups. Gone are the days when setting up your business was a challenge for women. We are seeing a lot of entrepreneurial efforts in the hyper-local service space as well. And women can be seen at the fore of these efforts everywhere. My message to them is to go ahead at full throttle, and persevere through the challenges without ever losing hope or spirit. True efforts are always rewarded.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/startup-mantra-women-entrepreneurs-who-hacked-the-glass-ceiling-and-beyond-101615016585347.html

06-03-2021||Chandigarh||Dalai Lama turns down offer to get vaccine jab at home, goes to dispensary||Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama stepped out of his home after a year on Saturday to get first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, 85, who lives at McLeodganj, was given the shot at Zonal Hospital, Dharamshala, early in the morning.Earlier, the district health authorities had planned to vaccinate the Dalai Lama at his home after the Indian government permitted provisions to inoculate the spiritual leader along with his core staff at his residence. “However, His Holiness said he would take the injection at the place where the common people were being inoculated,” said Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati. “It was his decision. We were arranging to vaccinate him at his home,” he added.Escorted by his security and staff, the Dalai Lama arrived at the hospital in Dharamshala at 7am in a motorcade. His followers lined the streets from McLoedganj to the Zonal Hospital to catch a glimpse of their spiritual leader and seek his blessings.Urges people to get vaccinated In a video message after taking the injection, the Dalai Lama said his friends, including doctors, suggested he get inoculated as a preventive measure. “This injection is very helpful. Others should also take it for greater benefit,” he said, adding “I took it, and more people should have the courage to take the injection, too.”He was put under observation for half an hour after being given the shot.The Dalai Lama’s last public appearance was in January 2020 when he attended a five-day Buddhist teaching session at Bodhgaya in Bihar.Following the Covid-19 outbreak, the Dalai Lama cancelled all public engagements in February 2020 but resumed virtual teachings in May.The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese occupation. He moved to McLeodganj in 1960.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dalai-lama-administered-first-shot-of-covid-19-vaccine-101615009505769.html
06-03-2021||Bangalore||BJP MLA backs Ramesh Jarkiholi, say it is a case of blackmail, conspiracy||MP Renukacharya, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator and chief minister B.S Yediyurappa’s political secretary, on Friday said the allegation of sexual exploitation against former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi was a case of “blackmail and political conspiracy”.Speaking to reporters outside the Vidhan Soudha in Bengaluru on Friday, Renukacharya said, “She (the unidentified woman in the case) is not a victim. This is a conspiracy.”Jarkiholi, who resigned from the cabinet demanding an investigation, has been given an injunction against publishing any material related to the incident.“This is neither a sexual harassment nor a rape case...,” said Renukacharya, who himself was accused of sexual harassment by a nurse in 2007.The statements from the MLA came even before the investigation in the case could begin, as police said they are trying to get details on the unnamed woman to verify the complaint.Case filed by ministers?A case was filed by six people on Friday at the city civil court in Bengaluru under the names of six cabinet ministers of the Karnataka government.Though the six names are of incumbent ministers, it remains unclear if the ministers moved the cases on their own or if any other persons did.All six have moved the court in what appears to be a move to restrict the media from publishing or broadcasting defamatory content against them.The six persons whose names are listed as petitioners include Shivaram Hebbar, Dr K Sudhakar, Byrathi Basavaraj, B.C Patil, ST Somashekar and Narayana Gowda, according to the original suit filed at the Additional City Civil and Sessions Judges in Mayo Hall in Bengaluru. All six ministers who have been named as petitioners could not be reached for comment and text messages seeking a response went unanswered.The filing of the case comes days after their ministerial colleague, Ramesh Jarkiholi, was forced to resign from B.S.Yediyurappa-led cabinet after a complaint of alleged sexual exploitation was filed against him.The case has 68 defendants, including all major Kannada and English TV news channels, newspapers among others. The list of defendants also includes Google and other social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Hindustan Times has viewed the copy of the case that has been filed even though there is no clear mention of the exact prayer sought by the petitioners.The names of the petitioners are of the six out of the 17 who had helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) form the government by defecting the H. D.Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government in 2019.Jarkiholi, considered the catalyst of the defection drama, had also helped others to jump ship to the BJP that brought Yediyurappa to power. After the allegations on Jarkiholi, there were unverified reports of similar videos and other sex scandals against other cabinet ministers.The case has been posted for orders on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bjp-mla-backs-ramesh-jarkiholi-say-it-is-a-case-of-blackmail-conspiracy-101615008933446.html
06-03-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru’s BBMP said no potholes on 74 roads. Court ordered survey finds 437||A crackdown by the Karnataka high court following the death of a 19-year-old medical student, and hearings of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) have revealed that there are at least 5,435 potholes, bad roads or bad footpaths in Bengaluru.The data was revealed in a report submitted by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA) to the Karnataka high court. However, these 5,435 may well be a sampling. KSLSA arrived at these numbers by conducting a surprise inspection of 25 roads in the city on the basis of information collected from volunteers.A city-wide survey is expected to show more bad roads and footpaths, and potholes.The report came after the Karnataka high court, in February 2020, directed KSLSA to conduct a survey using volunteers, while hearing a petition filed by Vijayan Menon and others, seeking the court’s intervention to improve the condition of the roads in the city.KSLSA then requested citizens to send photos and videos of the potholes and broken footpaths in their localities.The results contradicted Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) claim, in February, that there were no potholes on 74 roads in the city.KSLSA volunteers chose 25 of these 74 roads for their inspection. The report pointed out that of the 5,435 responses from citizens and the survey, 437 cases were related to potholes and bad roads. The remaining 4,998 cases were related to footpaths. Of the 4,998 footpath-related inputs, 3,531 were about blocked footpaths, 1,443 were about damaged footpaths, and the remaining 24 were about the very absence of a footpathH Shashidhara Shetty, member secretary at KSLSA said during the inspection the committee found at least four roads in Bommanahalli that were not motorable.The HC had come down heavily on BBMP’s inaction following the death of a 19-year-old medical student while trying to avoid a pothole. Tasdeeq Bushra died after her scooter was hit by the truck belonging to BBMP while she was trying to avoid craters on Lingarajapuram-Hennur main road. She died on the spot.On February 8, the Karnataka high court bench pulled up the BBMP regarding Bushra’s death. “Imagine people dying because of potholes on roads. Imagine the plight of the family,” a division bench of Justice BV Nagarathna and Justice MG Uma said during the hearing of a public interest litigation.“Although several orders have been made in this writ petition, the fact remains that potholes are still festering on streets of Bengaluru not only on major arterial roads but even in other smaller roads. It is public knowledge that riders of two-wheelers, as well as four-wheelers, have died during the course of avoidance of potholes while proceeding on roads,” the bench observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengalurus-bbmp-said-no-potholes-on-74-roads-court-ordered-survey-finds-437-101615005776959.html
06-03-2021||City||Owner of SUV found outside Ambani’s house with explosives dead in Thane||Mansukh Hiren, the man who came forward to say the SUV found with some explosives near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, was a vehicle he had reported stolen on February 18, was found dead in Kalwa creek on Friday morning, hours after his family reported he was missing.The police have claimed he died by suicide, but the circumstances and the timing of Hiren’s death are curious.Hiren’s body was spotted stuck amid the silt of the creek by a fisherman at 10.30 am on Friday. The police established his identity only late in the afternoon.Hiren was a resident of Ambedkar Nagar and owned the Classic Motors shop in Naupada. On February 26, a SUV he reported missing on February 18 was found with 20 gelatin sticks, and a threatening note addressed to Ambani and his wife. Hiren came forward soon after the incident to confirm that the SUV was his.He was called for questioning by different agencies since then, claimed his family.On Friday, leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra assembly, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said it was curious that police officer Sachin Vaze, the first on the scene when the explosives were found, was made in charge of the investigation, and then, days later, removed. He added that the person who filed a stolen SUV complaint had been in touch with Vaze.Vaze, who is attached to criminal intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch, said he was not aware of what Fadnavis said, but clarified that he was not the first person to reach the spot where the SUV was found. He added that he knew Hiren because the latter resided in Thane but clarified that he did not meet Hiren recently.“I came to know that Hiren has given written complaint to Thane police commissioner and Mumbai police commissioner two or three days ago that some police officers and reporters were allegedly calling him repeatedly and he felt harassed. I don’t know anything more about it,” Vaze added.The family of Mansukh Hiren refused to accept that he has died by suicide and demanded investigation into his death. His wife, Vimal Hiren, 45, said, “He left home on Thursday evening, informing us that he has got a call from a crime branch official asking to meet him at Ghodbunder Road. He was co-operating with the police and was not stressed over the case. His phone is unreachable since 10.00 am [Friday]. There was no reason for him to take this drastic step. We want an investigation into his death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/owner-of-suv-found-outside-ambani-s-house-with-explosives-dead-in-thane-101614982082288.html

The court also slapped a fine of ₹10 lakh on each of the accused.The death penalty to nine persons in the hooch tragedy in Gopalganj is the first such instance when capital punishment has been given to so many accused in any hooch tragedy.The 13 surviving accused in the August 2016 case were convicted by additional district judge Luv Kush Kumar. The accused were held guilty under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Excise Act of 2016.“They are accused of manufacturing, smuggling and selling liquor,” said public prosecutor Deo Vansh Giri.Nineteen people died in the Khajurbani locality of the district on August 16, 2016 after consuming spurious liquor, four months after the Nitish Kumar government banned sale and consumption of alcohol across the state on April 5, 2016.During a raid in Khajurbani locality, officials recovered more than 500 litres of alcohol.The then District Magistrate ordered imposition of “collective fine” on the locality in a bid to deter the residents, all involved in the illicit liquor trade, from continuing with the trade.The main accused in the case, Rupesh Shukla alias Pandit, meanwhile, is absconding and the court has issued a Red Warrant against him, said Giri. Red warrant is issued when a person named as accused in a case is absconding.In total, 14 persons were named in the FIR after the hooch tragedy but later in the course of investigation, names of four others were added. While Rupesh Shukla is absconding , three others named in the case during investigation are in judicial custody, said Giri.The court also issued a non-bailable warrant against two of the accused and ordered that their properties be attached since the two did not appear before the court on Friday, Giri added.According to special public prosecutor Ravi Bhushan Srivastava, 14 people were named as accused in the illicit liquor case. One of the accused died pending trial.Twenty-one policemen, including three sub-inspectors, five assistant sub-inspectors and 13 constables, of Town police station were dismissed in June 2020 in connection with the hooch tragedy.The Patna high court, however, ordered the reinstatement of five police personnel. On January 6 this year, a bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh set aside the order of the Gopalganj DGP , Gupteshwar Pandey, granting relief to the personnel.Another high court bench of justice Ashutosh Kumar also granted relief to 10 other police personnel on February 4, this year, ordering their reinstatement.There have been eight major tragedies in the state in last few years. The state government has taken a decision in principle that Station house officers ( SHOs) would face suspension and even dismissal from service incase there is a hooch tragedy in their respective area. The excise department has intensified checkings at all state highways and national highways.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nine-get-death-penalty-life-term-for-four-in-2016-bihar-hooch-case-101614981802941.html

Dr Tatyarao Lahane, head, Director of Medical Education and Research, said there was no need to panic. “The deaths have not risen, so we need to exercise caution such as increasing the number of tests and also focus on contact-tracing,” said Lahane. He said if the surge does not subside after four weeks, it would be indicative of a second wave of Covid-19. The number of cases started increasing to 8,000-plus from February 24 onwards. The number of active cases in the state touched 88,838, with Pune leading with 18,401 active cases. Nagpur has 11,552 active cases, followed by Thane and Mumbai with 9,579 and 9,055 cases, respectively. Pune is facing restrictions such as night curfew and enforcement of penal action in case of not wearing of masks. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last Sunday said it was up to people to decide whether they wanted another lockdown or not. He said if people continued to adopt a casual approach, he would be forced to order a lockdown. The authorities have ramped up the vaccination drive; 91,103 citizens were vaccinated on Friday across the state, of which 48,937 were senior citizens above 60 years and 8,274 those in the age group of 45-60 with comorbidities. A majority of beneficiaries (75,051) were administered the first dose, while the rest 16,052 were given the second dose. The total number of people who have been vaccinated in the state has now reached 15,99,118 citizens. Nilesh Jain, a businessmen dealing in automobile spare parts in Nana Peth, said, “People are very casual in their approach and there is no social distancing. The markets are full.” A lockdown has already been imposed in Amravati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-10k-new-covid-cases-for-the-first-time-in-2021-101614973860908.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||‘70 species of waterfowl found at 99 sites along Maharashtra coast’||A two-year study by researchers at the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has recorded a total 70 species of waterfowl, including nine threatened species, at 99 monitoring sites, spread over Maharashtra’s 702-kilometre coastline. Between 2017 and 2019, BNHS conducted a study with the state forest department’s mangrove cell to assess the migratory routes and habitat preferences of water birds wintering along the Maharashtra coast. The study also categorised Maharashtra’s coastal wetlands, which make up 10% of the state’s total wetland area, based on the number of birds observed during the study period. “Of the 99 sites monitored, seven supported over 1,000 water birds, six supported 500 to 1,000 water birds and six others supported 300 to 500 water birds during one or more survey periods,” says the report, a copy of which is with HT. The list of recorded species includes nine from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list of threatened species. These are the Great Knot (which is the only endangered species in the survey); the Asian Woollyneck and Indian Skimmer (categorised as vulnerable); the Black-tailed Godwit , Curlew Sandpiper, Black-headed Ibis, Eurasian Curlew, Eurasian Oystercatcher and Lesser Flamingo (categorised as near-threatened). The study recommends continuous monitoring of all sites “in order to understand the seasonality of use of these sites”. Virender Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell), described BNHS’s findings as “pertinent” and said, “The wildlife department has tabled a proposal with the state to monitor not just coastal wetlands, but all wetlands in the state. The budget for this second study is ₹2.77 crore. We are awaiting in-principle approval.” Of the sites, Akshi beach in Raigad is described as “very important” for “staging and wintering migratory shorebirds” since over 5,000 shorebirds have been counted here. The Great Knot was sighted at Akshi. All monitoring sites outside of the Mumbai bay area recorded consistent numbers during the study period. At monitoring sites located within the Mumbai bay area, researchers recorded substantially larger flocks of water birds, but their counts varied drastically over the course of the study period. For example, Panje wetlands recorded about 2,500 water birds in December 2017, but no birds were recorded in October 2018 “due to high water level and disturbance”. Then, in December 2018, the count rose to over 12,000 water birds. Researchers have attributed these fluctuations to causes originating in human activity, like fishing or land reclamation. At Sewri jetty, for example, the number of visiting birds was impacted by the construction of the trans harbour link, which began during the study period. Coastal wetlands in Maharashtra are important habitats for water-birds migrating along the Central Asian Flyway, an umbrella term that comprises multiple migratory routes spanning 30 countries between Siberia (in the north), west and south Asia, and the British Indian Ocean Territory. “Inland and coastal wetlands of Maharashtra act as refuelling stations for birds that migrate further south and also during their return migration to the breeding sites... As they are the critical bottleneck sites for migratory birds, protecting such sites is of immense importance,” the report states. Researchers at BNHS who worked on this study were not reachable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/70-species-of-waterfowl-found-at-99-sites-along-maharashtra-coast-101614973441147.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The soul of the burger||This is a job that needs confidence. To reach out to people. To talk smartly, and without awkwardness. To be prepared to be snubbed. To answer various queries. And it needs the employee to be well versed in the art of persuasion. And yes, a nice smile is a bonus.Raghav Kumar Jha has a brilliant smile, in fact, that glows about his entire face like a luminous halo. This evening he is stationed beside a zebra crossing in Connaught Place, standing amid a continuous motion of shoppers going about in all directions. Despite the crowd, he is easily noticeable in his uniform. Working in the “sales and marketing” of a burger shop, he is wearing a giant burger about him. Is it styrofoam, or cardboard, or what?Mt Jha simply smiles in response. At 22, this is his life’s second job. “After getting compartment (sic) twice in 9th standard, papa suggested that maybe I should do something else.” So he got a job in a bag-making factory and started bringing his contribution to the family income—his father, he says, sometimes works as a kalakaar (artist) in weddings and similar events. Soon afterwards Mr Jha landed up in his current job. “I was earning very well before the (coronavirus-triggered) lockdown,” he discloses matter-of-factly, without showing any disappointment on his smiling face.Doesn’t he sweat in this attire?He shakes his head.Does he enjoy his job?He answers—“Wherever you happen to be, give your full heart into it.” He explains that his primary task is to walk up to the pedestrians, tell them about the burger, and try to convince them to head to the shop he’s working for.“As I stand, I keep singing songs in my mann (thoughts). That makes me happy. When I’m happy, I gain confidence. Which gives me strength to approach people, who are otherwise complete strangers to me.”And does Mr Jha have any dream? Or does he wish to stay in this “line” for years to come? “Desires and dreams only make a person dukhi (sad),” he says with a smile. And with that unchanging smile, he turns to the crowd, perhaps planning which person to approach next. He will return home, in Kishenganj, at 9pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-soul-of-the-burger-101614973115084.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bank staff dupes 73-year-old, flees with ₹1.3 crore||Andheri police launched a manhunt for a female employee of a private bank for allegedly cheating a 73-year-old man to the tune of ₹1.3 crore by befriending him after she realised that he had substantial amount invested in fixed deposits with her bank. A first information report (FIR) was registered on Friday, three months after the senior citizen submitted a written application to the police.According to the police, the complainant Jeron John D’Souza, a resident of Malwani in Malad, alleged that a woman named Shalini Singh befriended him and after promising to marry him, she cheated him of ₹1.3 crore.D’Souza claimed that his father’s plot near domestic airport at Santacruz was sold to a builder in 2010, and he had received 20% of the sale price which amounted to ₹2 crore. He said he had invested the amount in four equal parts in different banks in fixed deposits. He met Singh while visiting the private bank where she worked. In 2019, D’Souza collected a huge amount by way of interest on the fixed deposits. “Singh thereafter befriended D’Souza and soon the two started meeting in restaurants for lunches and dinners,” said a police officer.In September last year, Singh met D’Souza and proposed marriage. She told him that she would start a business with D’Souza’s money and invest it so that they could divide the profit between them. After this, D’Souza transferred ₹1.30 crore to her in December last year. After receiving the money, the woman stopped meeting D’Souza and answering his calls, according to the complaint.D’Souza realised that he had been cheated and wrote an application to Andheri police as the bank she worked for was located within their jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaibank-staff-dupes-73-year-old-flees-with-1-3-crore-101614973021099.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||After IndiGo, SpiceJet opts for electric taxiing to save fuel||SpiceJet this week became the second low-budget airline after IndiGo to deploy the electric taxiing system, a technology for taxiing in and out of runways without engine power. Experts say the electric taxiing system helps reduce emissions, save fuel and improve efficiency of ground operations. On Wednesday, SpiceJet announced its tie-up with WheelTug which will provide the system. The airline asked WheelTug to reserve 400 production slots for electric taxi system. This will enable the airline to save fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions and noise levels. “By inducting WheelTug into its Boeing 737 operations, the company aims to reduce the fuel burn during taxi. SpiceJet gate and stand operations will be faster and more dependable helping the airline eliminate unexpected long delays affecting the schedule on any given day,” said a SpiceJet spokesperson. The WheelTug system places high-torque motors in the nose wheels of the aircraft. Pilots control the aircraft, perform ground operations without requiring tugs for manoeuvres. Since jet engines are turned off, the electric taxiing system lowers the aircraft’s emissions. A former engineer with a full-service carrier explained that with this system, neither the jet engines nor a tow tractor needs to be used. Last February, IndiGo had signed a letter of intent reserving 1,084 WheelTug systems. A former Airports Authority of India (AAI) official said, “Use of tugs will allow a substantial amount of fuel to be saved. However, giving an exact percentage of fuel consumption will be difficult at the moment.” He added, “Utilisation of aircraft will definitely be better with these electrical tugs.” Electric taxiing is expected to enable aircraft to move in and out of gates faster, which will help optimise the limited tarmac availability at Indian airports. Airlines would be able to run more efficient ground operations and reduce delays caused by ground equipment, which should make it possible for operations to be run more tightly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-indigo-spicejet-opts-for-electric-taxiing-to-save-fuel-101614972900850.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad 2021: Sharjeel Usmani moves Bombay HC to quash FIR||Sharjeel Usmani, former Aligarh Muslim University student leader who was booked by Swargate police at Pune on February 2, has approached the Bombay high court (HC) seeking to quash the first information report (FIR). Usmani was booked under section 153A of the Indian Penal Code for his alleged provocative speech at the Elgar Parishad 2021 conference on January 30. In his petition Usmani claimed the FIR was a political gimmick by advocate Pradeep Gawade, regional secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On February 2, Gawade had submitted a written complaint to Swargate police station against Usmani’s speech, and after a preliminary probe, the police booked Usmani for allegedly making offensive statements against the Hindu community, Indian judiciary and the parliament. In the petition filed through advocate Aditi Saxena, Usmani claimed that the content of his speech was already available in public domain in academic literature. It further stated that a select few statements made by him were taken out of context to lodge the complaint. “The petitioner in his speech has identified a problem in the social construct of this day, and has concluded with a solution to the problem,” says the petition with which the speech is annexed. He submitted that the gist of his speech was to fight hatred with constant dialogue with people who do not share the same ideological views. Refuting the allegations made in the FIR, the petition states, “The FIR does not disclose intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence to attract offence under section 153A of IPC. FIRs of this nature are a protracted modus operandi of misrepresenting what is said beginning with social media and culminating by initiating the criminal justice system.” “This is largely designed to vitiate communal harmony in society and, in effect, curb free speech and in effect by initiating the juggernaut of the criminal justice system redefine the contours of acceptable free speech,” states the petition. In light of these averments, Usmani sought not only to quash the FIR but also sought a stay on the investigation arising out of the said FIR. He has also asked for protection from coercive action pending hearing of the petition. Due to paucity of time the petition which was to be heard by the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale on Friday will be taken up in due course.Elgar Parishad 2021 was organised by Bhima-Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyaan to observe the birth anniversary of Rohith Vemula, a Dalit research scholar of the University of Hyderabad, who had died by suicide in 2016. Apart from Usmani, retired HC judge BG Kolse Patil and retired IPS officer SM Mushrif along with author Arundhati Roy, former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, Dalit activist Satyabhama Suryawanshi from Latur and journalist Prashant Kanojia had attended the conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-2021-sharjeel-usmani-moves-bombay-hc-to-quash-fir-101614972720838.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sanjay Raut refutes allegations by Kalina woman||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Friday refuted the allegations of stalking and harassment made against him by a Kalina-based psychologist and informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the petitioner was like a daughter to him. He further added that the allegations were levelled against him because she thought that he was siding with her husband in their matrimonial dispute. The psychologist had filed a petition seeking directions to the Mumbai Police to take action on three cases registered by her in 2013 and 2018 and to investigate Raut’s role in a 2020 incident wherein the National Commission of Women (NCW) had directed the deputy commissioner of police, zone 8 to take action but nothing was done. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the psychologist’s petition, was informed by advocate Abha Singh that her client was living in constant fear for safety due to inaction by police in the three first information reports (FIRs). The first FIR was filed in Mahim police station in May 2013 after she was assaulted by unknown persons and the second one in June 2013 at Vakola police station after another attack on her. The third FIR was registered in 2018 at Vakola police station after a man was arrested for stalking her. The petition has alleged that the Shiv Sena leader had time and again threatened her and also resorted to harassment by tapping her phone and kept track of her movements by using security guards and the police. The petition also alleged that her social and professional life was disrupted as her husband was told to harass her and later divorce her while her friends and acquaintances were told to distance themselves from her or face dire consequences. Singh submitted that though the NCW had directed the police to register an FIR in 2020, nothing had been done. She also said that it had been eight years since the two FIRs were registered, but no action was taken, and hence the court should issue directions to the police to investigate the matter. Singh submitted as the police did not take any action even after the NCW’s direction to register an FIR against Raut and others, she had to move the HC. Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare for the state submitted that a charge sheet had been filed in one of the complaints and A-summary reports were filed in the two other cases, therefore further investigation was not required and the petitioner’s plea was not maintainable. While refuting the allegations in the petition, senior counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar submitted that the petition was baseless and misconceived. He raised a preliminary objection that if the complainant wanted, she could have approached the magistrate before whom the reports were filed, instead of raising allegations against his client before the HC. Dhakephalker further submitted that the petitioner had made a plea before NCW and she could take further recourse there. “I have no problem against any inquiry being conducted. The charge sheet has been filed. She is a family friend and like a daughter to me. I know the family very well. She and her husband are having matrimonial disputes. She thinks I am siding with her husband, so she is making allegations against me,” Dhakephalkar submitted on behalf of Raut. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed Thakare to give a copy of the charge sheet to the petitioner within two days. “Pending hearing, both sides shall restrain themselves from making allegations outside,” said the bench and posted further hearing to March 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sanjay-raut-refutes-allegations-by-kalina-woman-101614972540666.html
06-03-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder announces enforcement directorate to check illegal mining||Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday announced the constitution of an enforcement directorate, mining, under the command of a senior police officer with adequate police force at his command to take action against illegal mining. Slamming the previous SAD-BJP government for not only patronising illegal mining during his reply to the motion of thanks on the governor’s address, the CM said his government had spent the last four years in setting in order the mining revenues, which the erstwhile regime had allowed to be frittered away.When his government took over, the revenue from mining was as low as R .35 crore annually, which has been enhanced to ₹250 crore - an increase of ₹215 crore, said the CM. Asserting his resolve to bring to book all those involved in the sacrilege and police firing incidents of Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura, Amarinder informed the House that on the recommendations of the commission, constituted by his government to investigate the cases, he informed the House that so far, five police/ civil officials had been identified / nominated for legal action, while five persons had been convicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-announces-enforcement-directorate-to-check-illegal-mining-101614972420891.html
06-03-2021||Chandigarh||Green initiative: Abohar MC to ban plastic-bottled beverages||The sale of plastic bottled beverages, including soft drinks and juices, is likely to be banned within Abohar city limits from March 13 as manufacturers have failed to adhere to the green rule of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) provision notified by the local body.As per Plastic Waste Management Rules (PWMR), 2016, of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, plastic waste generators are liable to pay a plastic user fee to the local bodies.Abohar became Punjab’s first local body that framed a bylaw in October last year to charge compensation for segregation and disposal of plastic waste.Municipal commissioner Abhijeet Kaplish said on Friday that two notices were served to the manufacturers but it did no invoke a response.“The new rule covers online retailers to liquor vends and traders, etc. Companies were asked to share data of their supplies in Abohar to enable us to assess transparent plastic user fees. It is moral jeopardy for the corporation as we impose a penalty and confiscate plastic bags used by small-time vendors, but the corporate sector cold-shouldered its responsibility to pay for safe disposal of plastic generated by them,” said a 2015-batch IAS officer, who has been tasked to improve sanitation levels of Abohar that was ranked the third dirtiest city of India in Swachh Survekshan -2020.He said a notification was issued on Friday stating a ban on the sale of all beverages packed in pet bottles from next week. Similar action will be initiated against other sectors for not adhering to the green rule, he added.“It is mandatory for plastic generators to pay a nominal cess for plastic waste management such as a collection of waste or operation of the disposal facility. The MC needs compensation to improve hygiene standards in the city and the EPR provision will be implemented strictly,” said Kaplish.As per the rule, for the sale of goods in multilayer plastic packaging such as soft drinks, packaged food items with a sale price of more than ₹5, Abohar MC will charge Re 1 to dispose of their plastic waste.Similarly, charges of ₹5 per delivery would be levied online the retailers, food aggregators and courier companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/green-initiative-abohar-mc-to-ban-plastic-bottled-beverages-101614972240473.html

06-03-2021||Chandigarh||Amritsar double suicide: Dismissed woman SI issuing threats from jail: Victims’ kin||The family of a couple, who committed suicide following alleged harassment by a woman sub-inspector (SI) of Punjab Police (now dismissed), have alleged that they were being threatened to withdraw the case. A jeweller, Vikramjit Singh (35), committed suicide by hanging himself in a hotel room in Amritsar in October last year. In his suicide note, and video and audio messages, he had accused sub-inspector Sandeep Kaur and her accomplices of harassment and blackmail. He alleged the accused had extorted around ₹18 lakh from him. The SI was posted at Mehta police station in the Amritsar-rural district. A day after Vikramjit’s death, his wife Sukhbir Kaur (32) ended her life at her residence in Navapind village.Two separate cases were registered against the SI and some other accused in Amritsar city and Amritsar rural police stations. Despite the registration of the cases, no action was taken against the accused for a few days.The police swung into action after the couple’s only minor daughter talked to chief minister Amarinder Singh over phone. Following, this, the CM directed the inspector general (IG-border range) SPS Parmar to take “strict action”. Later, the woman cop was arrested and subsequently dismissed. Victim Vikramjit’s brother Harpreet Singh sent an e-mail to Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on February 26 accusing dismissed woman cop Sandeep Kaur of issuing threats from the jail. Sawinder got the reply on Thursday from the DGP’s e-mail address citing “acknowledgment of the compliment by the IG”. Sawinder alleged that on January 25, Sandeep Kaur called from the jail the mobile number of her brother Samsher Singh, who is also a constable in the Punjab Police. He said Sandeep asked them to take back the case or be ready to face dire consequences. He said another accused Navreet Sandhu, who was suspended as a constable, has also been threatening not to give any testimony in the court. Navreet was accused by Vikramjit, in his suicide note, for posing as a DSP to extort money. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya said, “I haven’t got any complaint in this regard so far, but we have adopted zero tolerance against any such act. Strict action will be taken if any accused is found to be involved in threatening the family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amritsar-double-suicide-dismissed-woman-si-issuing-threats-from-jail-victims-kin-101614971939785.html

When MNS leader Ashok Murtadak, who was wearing a mask, came forward to offer a bouquet, Thackeray signalled him to remove the mask. In addition, there was no social distancing as MNS leaders stood near each other while welcoming their leader.In an interaction with media last Saturday, Thackeray was asked why he was not wearing a mask, to which he had replied, “I will not wear a mask.”Nashik is facing a surge of cases since the past two weeks and authorities are fining citizens ₹1,000 for not wearing masks.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar took potshots at the MNS leader in the legislative council and said, “Some people directly say they will not wear the mask. You will not get Covid-19 but others may get infected because of you.

06-03-2021||Mumbai||Phase 3 of vaccination: Mumbai crosses 50,000-mark in 5 days||The city crossed the 50,000 mark for Covid-19 vaccinations after 22,158 citizens were vaccinated on Friday, taking the total count of beneficiaries from the general public to 58,104 citizens. Of the total, 52,777 are citizens above 60 years old and the remaining 5,327 are aged 45 years and above with comorbidities. Overall, 312,775 citizens, healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) have been vaccinated so far. The vaccination drive for HCWs started in the city on January 16 and vaccination of the general public began five days ago. On Friday, the centralised app Co-WIN, which is monitoring the vaccination drive, once again developed glitches at around 3pm. Several vaccination centres saw large number of people queuing for walk-ins in addition to those with appointments. Some, like Malad resident Tapan Joshi, who accompanied his 70-year-old mother, were not able to get vaccinated despite having appointments. “We were given an appointment at SK Patil Mahanagarpalika General Hospital and we reached at around 1pm on Friday. There was complete chaos and only around 200 tokens were issued. The rest were told to visit the next day for vaccination. With me, around 50 people returned home without vaccination. People were made to wait in stuffy tents without fans and water, which is not comfortable considering they are senior citizens,” said Joshi. Milin Jeste, dean of SK Patil Mahanagarpalika General Hospital, said, “We have to handle walk-ins and those registered with appointments. But we have the overall capacity of vaccinating only 200 or 250 citizens in a single day. Due to this, we have to ask some beneficiaries to come the next day. We are trying to augment our capacity and I have put up a proposal for adding one more booth [at present there are two booths]. In the coming days, our handling capacity will increase.” Meanwhile on Friday, 1,174 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded as well as four deaths. Mumbai’s Covid death toll stands at 11,495 and the total case tally is 331,020, with 9,055 active cases. The city’s recovery rate is 93.52% with 309,591 recoveries and mortality rate is 3.47%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/phase-3-of-vaccination-mumbai-crosses-50-000-mark-in-5-days-101614971460423.html

Residents requested the Oval Maidan Trust to allow walkers and joggers to access the ground as well, as a sports academy was already using the ground.On February 21, BMC observed a high level of occupancy at Oval Maidan at Churchgate. Given an increasing number of Covid cases, it asked the trust to close the ground. On February 26, the Oval Maidan Trust received a letter from deputy director for sports to close down the maidan.Following such complaints, the Oval Maidan Trust approached the municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, requesting him to take action against the Vengsarkar Academy.According to the letter written to the Oval Maidan Trust by the deputy-director of sports and youth services, the trust was asked to close the ground except for sports activities for up to 10 to 15 people. The Vengsarkar Academy said it has been following all standard operating procedure, as per a similar letter issued to all sports academies in the city, by the government, via the Mumbai Cricket Association.Nayana Kathpalia, a trustee of Oval Maidan Trust, said, “We closed the ground on February 26, as per orders from BMC. All gates were closed. One small side entrance was kept open for cleaning purposes, and the academy used this entrance to access the ground. Residents who routinely use the ground approached the trust requesting us to allow walkers and joggers to access the ground as well since sports activities are being allowed. So we approached the municipal commissioner in this regard.”Kathpalia said, “The academy is taking advantage of the clause that allows up to 15 people to practice on the ground. We told the municipal commissioner if cricketers are going to be permitted it will be very difficult for our security to control the general public from entering the ground. Also, in such a case, can the maidan be opened for other cricket pitches too?”Residents also pointed to the trust that the Oval Maidan is used as a crossing, so pedestrians don’t have to go around the entire perimeter outside the maidan to get on the other side.Phiroze Jhaveri, 73, a resident of Churchgate said, “We have been using the maidan for morning walks for many decades now. All senior citizens of our building also go there for walks, many walk their dogs there, and simultaneously cricketers practice there. Now, where will we take our walks? A ground is safer than the road for senior citizens.”Dilip Vengsarkar, managing trustee of Vengsarkar Foundation said, “We have a letter by the state government and they have told us to follow SOPs that not more than 15 people will be permitted in one group. We do not know what kind of concerns residents have raised. We received this letter through the Mumbai Cricket Association. I am running the academy for the past 27 years, and we have produced many cricketers for India and the state. Many kids come from slums. I am giving back to the game and this is the infrastructure we need to do so. All kids wear masks, sanitise their hands, and all SOPs are strictly followed.”Kathpalia pointed out that when the Oval Maidan Trust approached BMC’s A ward office with jurisdiction over the area, they were directed to approach the office of the deputy director of sports for action against the academy.A senior civic officer who did not wish to be named said, “As per the letter, up to 15 sportspersons are allowed to practice on any ground. This is not the BMC jurisdiction as the letter was issued by the deputy director of sports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cricket-academy-using-oval-maidan-despite-ban-claim-residents-101614971040436.html
06-03-2021||Patna||More staff, SOPs in line to get senior citizens to vaccination centres in Bihar||Bihar struggled to get senior citizens and those with co-morbidities between 45 and 59 years of age to the Covid-19 vaccination centres. It could inoculate less than 1 per cent of the target group on the first four days of the third phase of Covid-19 vaccination drive.The low footfall has prompted the state health department to mobilise more technical manpower through districts so that senior citizens were not made to wait for long for verification purposes before taking the vaccine shot. The government is also planning SOPs for elderly women who come to get vaccinated on International Women’s Day (March 8).What also added to the disenchantment of the elderly was the delay in the verification on the CoWIN portal due to technical glitches and connectivity issues, which made the elderly wait for long.“It takes less than a minute for the jab, but 3-5 minutes for verification on the CoWIN portal,” said a health official who did not wish to be named.Also read: 'India wants normal ties with all neighbours, including Pakistan' - MEAThere is one person to verify the documents to authenticate the identity of the beneficiary and upload the medical certificate at a session site. It is this number that the health department plans to increase at session sites so that the vaccination turn-over time is reduced, the officer said.The health department would rope in trained data-entry operators through district magistrates from the primary health centre level and use them for verification purpose to speed up the process at vaccination centres, he added.At few session sites on Thursday, like the one at Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), the drive was organised on the first floor, making it difficult for the elderly beneficiaries to climb the stairs. However, the same was shifted to the ground floor on Friday.“We realised the difficulty some senior citizens had to face in climbing the staircase and I instructed my team to shift the session site for senior citizens on the ground floor,” said NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh.The department was likely to issue instructions that session sites for senior citizens and those with co-morbidities be organised on the ground floor, while for healthcare and frontline workers it may be held on other floors.The health department also encouraged healthcare workers to get their elderly parents and relatives for vaccination while also planning to offer some SOPs to elderly women who come to take the jab on March 8, International Women’s Day.“We have asked all our healthcare workers to get their parents and elderly relatives for the vaccination. We are also planning to give token gifts to elderly women who want to take a jab on International Women’s Day,” said Dr Singh, NMCH.Out of 1.09 crore target group of 60 years and above, Bihar had inoculated 17,749 beneficiaries, which was 0.16 per cent achievement between March 1 and 4. Similarly, out of 16 lakh people with co-morbidities in the 45-59 years age bracket, it managed to vaccinate 3,440, which was 0.21 per cent of the target at the end of day four of their vaccination on Thursday.Efforts to reach Manoj Kumar, executive director of Bihar’s State Health Society, proved futile as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/more-staff-sops-in-line-to-get-senior-citizens-to-vaccination-centres-in-bihar-101614969364415.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra economic survey: Agriculture sector sees 11.7% growth||While all other sectors faced a massive hit owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, agriculture sector is expected to report a whopping 11.7%growth in 2020-21, from 6.1%in 2019-20. The growth is attributed to more than average rainfall, rise in agricultural production and availability of water, electricity and manpower due to the lockdown that affected other sectors. While Maharashtra’s economic growth is expected to be -8% (from 5% in 2019-20) this financial year, the agricultural growth assumes significance. The economic survey of Maharashtra, tabled in both the houses on Friday, has attributed the growth to satisfactory rainfall (113.4% of normal rainfall) and overall increase in agricultural production. “Crop sector is expected to grow by 16.2%, livestock by 4.4% and forestry and logging by 5.7%,” it has stated. The production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, cotton and sugarcane is expected to increase by 60, 14, 28, 33 and 40%, respectively. The state had reported highest agricultural growth rate of 21% in 2016-17, while it was second highest in the past 10 years in 2010-11 at 15.6%, followed by 12.3 % in 2013-14. Experts from the agricultural sector have attributed the growth to the favourable atmosphere during the lockdown imposed in March, after the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak last year. Due to the closure of industrial and commercial units during the lockdown, electricity and water was available to the agriculture amply. The reverse migration to rural areas also resulted in easy availability of manpower, they said. Rajan Kshirsagar, state working committee member of Communist Party of India and farm expert, said, “The marketing of agriculture produce was done easily and effectively. While transportation and mobilization of resources was tough for other sectors, there were no restrictions on agriculture sector, helping it grow freely. It was a natural growth and the government should not pat its back.” Kshirsagar said farmers did not get the benefit of the growth as market prices of the produce were low and wages too were reduced during the lockdown. Mumbai University’s economist Neeraj Hatekar said when there were restrictions on all other sectors, agriculture sector was operational, facilitating the growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-economic-survey-agriculture-sector-sees-11-7-growth-101614970200492.html

Its tentacles have started grappling even the institutions created for the protection of the republic,” said Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI court, Chandigarh, while pronouncing the sentence.The court also imposed a fine of ₹4.5 lakh on Sehgal and ₹2 lakh on Ahlawat. The CBI had booked the two along with 10 others, who were acquitted by court on March 3.Seeking strict punishment for the duo, public prosecutor KP Singh said: “Public servants have a moral obligation to serve the country and its citizens with utmost honesty. Taking a lenient view in such like matters sends a very wrong message.” Agreeing with the public prosecutor and dismissing the duo’s prayers of leniency, the CBI court said: “Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would be more harmful to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in efficacy of law.” Terming corruption as “cancer” and “plague” in a civilised society, court said: “Proliferation of corrupt public servants could garner momentum to cripple the social order if such men are allowed to continue to manage and operate public institutions.” The caseSehgal was booked in April 2012 along with 11 others for abusing his official position and committing forgery and criminal misconduct, in connivance with others, by manipulating the conduct of the examinations held for recruitment of sub-inspectors in central police organisations, intelligence officers in the Narcotics Control Bureau and assistant sub-inspectors in the Central Industrial Security Force. A case under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) read with 511 (offences punishable with life imprisonment), 468 (forgery) read with 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code, and various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered. The CBI said that out of 16 candidates whose seating plan was adjusted, so as to enable them to appear from the same room, seven candidates turned out to be all-India toppers. The chargesheet was filed in October 2013 after two accused, Saurab Kant, partner of Softpro Consultants, who was accused of manipulating the seating order, along with Rajpal, a beneficiary, turned approvers for the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/recruitment-exams-ex-ssc-official-auditor-get-3-yr-jail-for-irregularities-101614970140303.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Economic survey: Maharashtra slips to third position in FDI investment||The state slipped to third position in the first six months of this financial year in terms of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow, according to the economic survey report 2020-21. Statistics for the past few years also indicate the FDI inflow in the state is on the decline with every passing year. The survey has found the state has received ₹27,143 crore in FDI between April and September 2020, which is far less than the neighbouring state of Gujarat, which is currently holding the top position. It has received a whopping ₹1,19,566 crore as FDI in the current financial year (till September), while Karnataka, too, has received ₹27,548 crore, stated the report tabled by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in the Assembly on Friday. Till last year, the state was favourite destination for FDI in the country. In 2019-20, the state had received ₹77,389 crore as FDI, which was around 29% of the total FDI inflow across the country. In 2018-19, it received ₹80,013 crore and in 2017-18, FDI was ₹86,244 crore, which also means the inflow is reducing in the state with every passing year. “We are holding the top position when it comes to FDI inflow in the state. Between April 2000 and September 2020, the FDI inflow of the state was ₹8,18,522 crore, highest across the country. The other states have not received even half of what Maharashtra was getting as FDI. Karnataka has received ₹3,16,145 crore and Gujarat received ₹2,79,691 crore as FDI in the corresponding period,” the senior official from the state industries department said, citing the economic survey report.The decline is registered despite the state’s flexible approach towards attracting more investment. Last year, the state decided to provide ‘Maha Parwana’, a master permission to the new industrial units within 48 hours of application. This permission ensures the investor won’t need any other permission and they can start construction work on the site immediately. It further guarantees that the investor will be provided all statutory permissions required to start business within maximum 30 days from the date of issuance and, if not, will be considered deemed approval. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray recently said Maharashtra has got an investment of ₹1,12,939 crore under Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0 — second installment of the global investors summit — by signing 54 memorandum of understandings (MoUs) in the past one year. The quarterly unemployment rate, according to current weekly status for urban areas, also registered a rise during 2019-20. In the third quarter (October-December 2019) of the last financial year, the unemployment rate was 12.9% between the age group of 15 to 29 years and 5.5% for 15 years and above, but in the last quarter (January-March 2020), it rose to 13.8% and 6.2%, respectively, states the economic survey report. In the current weekly status (CWS) approach, a person is considered part of the labour force if they worked or were available or looking for work for at least one hour during the survey week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/economic-survey-maharashtra-slips-to-third-position-in-fdi-investment-101614970080874.html
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra economic survey: Growth sees a Maha dip amid Covid-19 pandemic||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic that forced months-long lockdown, the state’s growth has slipped in the negative, -8%, in 2020-21, the lowest in history, according to the economic survey report presented in the Assembly by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. This also means the growth has dipped by 13 percentage points in 2020-21 over 2019-20. Barring agriculture, all other sectors, including industry and services, are expected to register a negative growth in the current financial year. The pandemic has had a direct impact on the individual income owing to the loss of income and jobs. This resulted in the reduction in the per capita income to ₹1,88,784 in 20201-21, from ₹202,130 the previous year and ₹1,87,118 in 2018-19. The industry and services sectors are expected to see a-11.3% and -9% growth in 2020-21, from 0.2% and 8.3% in 2019-20, respectively. The agriculture sector is expected to grow by 11.7%, more than last year’s 6.1% in 2019-20. The agriculture sector had reported a growth of 0.7% in 2017-18 and 0.9% in 2018-19. The finance minister is scheduled to present a deficit budget on Monday. Pawar had said a few weeks ago that the revenue deficit of the state is expected to be over ₹1.12 lakh crore owing to the economic crisis amid the pandemic. The economic survey presented on Friday reflects the bleak economic health of the state, said an official from the finance department. The pandemic has also affected the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), which is expected to drop to ₹26,61,629 crore, ₹1,56,925 crore down from ₹28,18,555 crore in 2019-20. It was ₹25,79,628 crore in 2018-19. The debt stock of the state is expected to touch ₹520,717 crore in 2020-21, from ₹464,020 in 2019-20, and is 19.6% of the GSDP. The percentage of fiscal deficit to GSDP is 2.1%. The interest paid on the debts in the current financial year is ₹35,531 crore. The revenue of the state during the current fiscal, was hit badly owing to the pandemic, the report has stated. “The revenue collection between April and December 2020 was ₹1,76,450 crore (or 50.8%) of the estimated receipts of ₹3,47,457 crore in the 2020-21,” the report stated. This means the estimated revenue is expected to report a huge deficit in the current fiscal, badly affecting the spending on development works and social schemes. The state had planned 68.7% of the revenue receipts on development works in 2020-21.The budget had earmarked 17.8% of its funds for capital expenditure. The state has received ₹3,09,881 crore in 2019-20, the report has stated. Mumbai University economist Neeraj Hatekar said the revival of the economy may take one or one-and-a-half years. “We have been studying the industrial units in Dharavi, which are facing shortage of material leading to a hike in its cost. To cut cost, the units have reduced the wages, although 95% of the workers migrated to their native places are back. This is an indicative picture for all other industries. The revival is expected in one or one-and-half-a-year in big cities and in the next six-eight months in smaller cities and towns. To record pre-Covid growth rate, we will have to register a growth of around 13%, which is possible next year, as we are starting at a low base,” he said. Former finance minister and BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar has blamed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. “The figures from the economic survey are disturbing. The dip in the growth rate is a result of the failure of the state government to take corrective steps during the pandemic.” The agriculture growth has been attributed to satisfactory rainfall (113.4% of normal rainfall) and overall increase in agricultural production. “The crops sector is expected to grow by 16.2%, livestock by 4.4% and forestry and logging by 5.7%,” it has stated. The production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, cotton and sugarcane is expected to increase by 60, 14, 28, 33 and 40%, respectively. Manufacturing and construction sectors were hit the hardest as their growth dipped to -11.8% and -14.6% respectively, contributing to the drop in the industry’s growth to -11.3% , the report has stated. It says the pandemic’s impact on trade, repairs, hotels and restaurants and transport will lead to a growth of -9%. “The Maharashtra government has been boasting about the whopping investment brought in the state over the last one year. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray recently announced to have signed memorandum of understanding for investment worth crores of rupees, but the state should ensure that the investment actually materialises. The industry sector will have an impact on other sectors and thus needs to be given due importance,” said Santosh Mandlecha, president, Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-economic-survey-growth-sees-a-maha-dip-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101614969900390.html

06-03-2021||Pune||Citizens suffer as 37 CFCs remain shut since lockdown||City residents are facing serious issues related to getting property tax bill printouts, birth and death certificates and other documents from the 37 Citizen Facilitation Centres (CFCs) across the city as the offices have remained shut since lockdown was announced. According to the PMC administration, the private agency to be appointed for manpower supply at the CFCs is yet to be finalised and the tendering process is not yet completed. Most citizens visit the ward offices where the facilitation centres are located. A large number of citizens need these services for day-to-day work including getting zonal certificates. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) appointed a private agency to look after the running of daily affairs including manpower supply and its contracting term got over in January last year. After the lockdown was announced, the process of appointing a new agency could not be completed. The PMC administration gave a one-month extension to the agency but after that, the PMC found that the numbers of citizens at the main building was increasing due to the unavailability of services at the CFCs. The PMC top officials directed the appointment of PMC staff to look after the CFCs to resolve the imbroglio. The PMC released a fresh tender in August but did not receive a response after which tenders were floated again. Manju Waghmare, a Yerawada resident said, “The CFCs are our lifeline where we go for our work to be done at the earliest. As of today, the citizens are suffering due to the complete shutdown of the CFC and are being forced to travel a long distance to the main PMC building. It is creating a lot of hassles for citizens. I wanted a birth certificate and had to travel to the main office in Juna Bazar to get one. We had informed the ward office, but it has become normal for the PMC and its administration to be least bothered about citizens.” Rahul Jagtap, head, information and technology Department, PMC said “The PMC has outsourced the task of manpower to a private agency and tenders for the same have been approved by the standing committee. The orders for the same will be issued soon and all the CFCs will function effectively from next week.” Box Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) Portal: The PMC aims to revamp its existing portal. Smart City Portal: The smart city portal will provide all the information to citizens about Pune. The PMC is looking forward to generate revenue through various revenue streams like advertising, e-commerce PuneConnect (Online Digital Service Window): Delivers citizen services through the single window over the web, CFC and kiosks to its stakeholders Citizen Support Desk (CSD): The PMC has set up citizen support to address citizen queries and provide support over the call.

06-03-2021||Pune||Mohammadwadi-NIBM annexe residents demand action against speeding bikers||Mohammadwadi-NIBM annexe residents have filed petitions seeking police action against speeding bikers after racing in violation of traffic law has caused a nuisance for days in the area. Residents of NIBM Annexe-Mohammadwadi road have been particularly affected by the night racing stunts by motorcycles driven by youngsters and car drivers who visit the area between 5 pm to 11 pm during the night. Residents maintain that despite complaints to Kondhwa police and the city traffic branch, the crackdown on violators was not taking place which emboldened the lawbreakers. According to citizen groups, the issue of bike racing is an old nuisance, and the residents have been complaining against it since 2018. Two youths had met with a deadly accident and became disabled for a lifetime, a few years ago. Danish Khan, Imperial society resident and social worker said, “The racing can claim lives of riders as well as citizens if timely action is not taken. There is a need to lodge an FIR against the culprits and suo moto it can be done by the traffic police and the local police. We have been complaining about it for a long time, but our pleas remain unanswered. Heavy fines must be levied on the violators as youngsters do not care for the law nor the lives of citizens. If need be their bikes must be seized, and their parents must be summoned to the police station for sending a stern message amongst the wrongdoers.” Daljeet Goraya, secretary, Ganga Kingston society said, “We had filed petitions after petitions with respective police commissioners seeking strict action against the culprits but to no avail. We need a real crackdown on the two-wheeler riders who are making fun of the law and disturbing the peace in the area. Our lives are threatened by the criminal behaviour of the car and two-wheeler riders who are playing with the lives of the citizens.” DCP (Traffic) Rahul Srirame said, “We will take strict action and traffic police personnel will be deployed at the spot where the racing takes place. We will take the strictest measures available as per the law against the two-wheeler and four-wheeler riders who are disturbing peace in the area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mohammadwadinibm-annexe-residents-demand-action-against-speeding-bikers-101614969299496.html

The administration now plans to open the bids within next 10 days, it is learnt.The development comes after it was decided in a high-powered inter-ministerial meeting, held on February 26 and chaired by the Union home secretary, that the privatisation process should continue in those Union Territories where it is in advance stages.Earlier, in February, the administration had put on hold the process in order to seek clarity from the Centre on the company formation and establishment of trust for employees.On Friday, the minutes of the meeting were shared with the administration, with directions to expedite the process.“After the bidding process completes, the administration would have to prepare a cabinet note on it and send it to the ministry of home affairs. The final approval would be given by the cabinet on the company formation and the trust establishment for employees,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity. The trust is to be formed for managing terminal benefits of employees.“The administration has also been directed to consult Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) on the privatisation process, particularly the request for proposal (RFP) document, and make suitable changes in the process as per its advise,” said another senior official privy to the development.Notably, the department of expenditure of the finance ministry has been requested to waive the appraisal process for power distribution company and trust formation, which is required under the Government of India Transaction of Business Rules 1961.Six companies in frayThere are six companies in the race for taking over the electricity department — Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited, Adani Transmission Ltd, Tata Power and Torrent Power.The decision to privatise the electricity department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. An empowered committee was constituted to oversee and implement the process. The administration had assured the Centre that the process would be completed by the end of 2020.However, the first setback came on December 1, when the Punjab and Haryana high court stayed the process on the plea of UT Powermen Union.After nudged by the Centre, the administration approached the Supreme Court on January 12, which stayed the high court order. A day after the SC relief, the administration immediately invited bids from interested firms.Notably, in the UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, the Bombay high court has stayed the process even though bids have been opened and the company finalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-tells-chandigarh-admn-to-speed-up-power-privatisation-101614969241015.html

There are a large number of shops and street vendors who throw garbage on the streets, besides the dry garden waste consisting of leaves and cuttings of trees are thrown on the road or burnt. Even the service road on the highway is in a pathetic condition with garbage being thrown from Bavdhan Budruk,” said Dushyant Bhatia, of Volunteers of Bavdhan Citizens Forum (BCF). The group is continuously raising the issue with the concerned sanitation department and officials, both online and offline, and have raised 100+ complaints. Some are fixed and some are closed without processing. This has become the daily work of citizens for the past few months. Now, however, the residents have run out of patience. They feel that the situation is becoming dangerous for the health of the citizens. It has become difficult to walk on the road and a lot of corners of the roads stink. The citizens posted pictures of garbage around Bavdhan and their expectations from the administration on all social media platforms.

Of this, ₹15,910, or 70% of the total expenditure incurred has been on the 33.5km underground corridor.While the project has been facing controversy since its inception, it is currently facing uncertainty after the Bombay high court (HC), in an interim order, stayed the transfer of land at Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced that the state has decided to shift the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg.As per the report, the state has incurred a cost of ₹2,470 crore on Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and ₹1,996.17 crore on Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E), which are expected to be operational this year. The state has also spent ₹475 crore on Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli). The state plans to build an integrated metro car shed for Metro-3, Metro-6, and Metro-4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarwadavali). However, the HC order has proved to be a major roadblock in the state’s plan. The state also constituted a committee that stated that land at Aarey will prove to be insufficient in the coming years.The cost of the project has also been revised from ₹23,000 crore to ₹32,000 crore.A senior official from MMRDA said, “We have approached the HC again to lift the stay. Kanjurmarg will prove to be the best option given land scarcity in the city.”AV Shenoy from the Mumbai Mobility Forum said that the Centre and the state governments must solve the issue for the benefit of Mumbaikars. “The project is going on well. The only roadblock is the car-shed which is a political issue. The Centre and the state government must have a dialogue to resolve this issue. The more the project is delayed, the cost will increase, adding to the burden of Mumbaiites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15k-crore-spent-on-mumbai-metro-3-maharashtra-economic-survey-101614969180327.html

I do not see any merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed,” the judge said.Haque, through advocate Mobashshir Sarwar, had challenged the appointment of Akhtar, claiming that there were violations of regulations issued by the UGC and also under the JMI Act.Akhtar, through advocate Pritish Sabharwal, had contended that the petitioner had failed to point out a single statutory violation in the appointment process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-dismisses-plea-questioning-appointment-of-jamia-vc-101614967080498.html

Officials who attended the meeting said the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), the agency responsible for the construction of the RRTS corridor, assured the Board that since the section is underground, trees and ecology of the Ridge will not be disturbed.“RRTS is an environment friendly project, which is being designed to reduce pollution and traffic congestion in the National Capital Region. We are committed to preserving the ecology of the Ridge and therefore, strategically no stations, structures or installations have been planned inside the Ridge area,” NCRTC said in a response to HT.It further said, “The 3.65km of Delhì-Gurugram-SNB RRTS section between Munirka and Aerocity stations will pass through the Ridge via underground tunnels at an average depth of approximately 20 metres (about six floors) in such a manner that there will be no impact on the ecology of the Ridge area. Only two ventilation cum emergency evacuation shafts essential for the safety of commuters are planned in locations where there are no trees.”An official who attended the meeting said, on condition of anonymity, “There were 18 projects listed in Friday’s agenda and most of them were cleared. They included the RRTS project because the corridor was underground and did not impact the Ridge. The Board has decided to keep the matter of the Metro corridor on hold for a month.”In Phase 1 of RRTS, comprising 107km from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to SNB Urban Complex (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror), 22.5km will an underground network in Delhi, of which 3.5km is proposed to go through the Ridge.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in its request sent to the forest department in 2019 had stated that for this corridor, a total of 5.55km would fall in the Ridge, of which 20083 square metres was in Mahipalpur (Ridge area), 16,992 sqm was near Indira Gandhi National Open University (morphological Ridge), 11600sqm was in Anandmaye Marg (southern Ridge) and another 2,200 sqm also in the southern Ridge.The DMRC said 8,005 sqm will be utilised to create permanent structures, while the remaining 42,870 sqm will be used temporarily during the construction work and will be returned to the forest department once the section is complete.However, in another letter sent by DMRC to the member secretary of the Board in March 2020, the total Ridge area required was increased to 82,426 sqm, of which 14,324 sqm was to be kept permanently for entry/exits, ancillary buildings and shafts etc, while the remaining 68,102 sqm was to be “restored back after project completion”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ridge-board-allows-3-5km-rrts-portion-through-ridge-area-says-section-underground-won-t-disturb-ecology-101614967020417.html

HT has learnt that the economic survey and outcome budget 2020-21 is likely be tabled on Monday, while the 2021-22 state budget — the seventh by the AAP in its three terms in power — will be tabled on Tuesday.“The events will start on March 12 with a programme at the Central Park in Connaught Place. Events will continue for 75 weeks until 15 August 2022 – when India would celebrate 75 years of Independence. The themes of these events will revolve around the role of Delhi in the Independence movement; how Delhi has evolved since 1947; and the government’s vision for ”Delhi in 2047”. Appropriate allocations will be made in the upcoming budget for these events,” said the senior official, who did not wish to be identified.In its first budget after coming to power in 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had chosen (self-governance) as the theme of the 2015-16 budget. In that budget, the government allocated large sums to welfare schemes such as subsidies on power and water bills. Similarly, the 2018-19 budget was branded a “green budget” because of the large number of allocations towards fighting against air pollution in the capital.“This year’s themes will be patriotism,” said the official quoted above.Another government official said that the total budgeted outlay for 2021-22 is likely to be more than previous year’s ₹65,000 crore -- which was the highest so far.This will be the first budget in Delhi after the Covid-19 pandemic – which, according to government estimates, have caused a 42% revenue loss. For 2020-21, a year marked by three rounds of severe spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the government had pegged revenue receipts at ₹55,309 crore.“In the upcoming budget, allocations for both health and education sectors will increase,” said the second government official, who did not wish to be identified.Last year (2020-21), the government allocated ₹15,815 crore for education — an increase of 1.3% from the 2019-20 budget -- and ₹7,704 crore for the health sector, which was nearly 3% more than the previous fiscal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-budget-theme-this-year-is-patriotism-to-mark-75-years-of-independence-101614966962018.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Gahlot seeks support of residents’ groups on govt’s EV campaign||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Friday appealed to residents’ welfare associations (RWA) in the city to endorse the government’s “Switch Delhi” campaign – an initiative aimed at increasing the registration of electric vehicles (EV) in the capital – and urged MLAs to help RWAs in their constituencies in increasing people participation.“If we want to win this fight against pollution, the whole city will have to come together – just like we came together to fight dengue and Covid-19. It is now time to commit to switching to EVs and to turn this into a mass movement. The Delhi government’s eight-week awareness campaign, Switch Delhi, plans to educate people on the benefits of EV and to encourage residents to switch to EVs. I appeal to all RWAs to participate in the initiative,” said Gahlot in a press statement.It further said, “As elected representatives of the people, we must take the lead. I request all MLAs in Delhi to provide their support to RWAs in their constituencies to be a part of this movement.”While launching the “Switch Delhi” campaign last month, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his government will, in the next six months, change its policy and lease only electric cars for government use. Last week, the government issued an order to all departments to switch to EVs within six months.The campaign is in line with the government’s EV policy, notified last year, to combat air pollution in the capital. The policy aims to ensure that by 2024, 25% of all vehicles registered in Delhi are electric vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ghalot-seeks-support-of-residents-groups-on-govt-s-ev-campaign-101614966961223.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||South corp seeks nod to dump inert waste in Asola sanctuary||The Supreme Court-mandated Ridge Management Board, which conducted its first meeting after the appointment of two independent members on Friday, constituted an expert committee to look into South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) application seeking permission to “dump inert (non-reactive) waste from bio-mining of three landfills — Bhalswa, Okhla and Ghazipur — in the mines of Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary.”Environment experts, however, warned that if allowed, this could lead to “irreparable damage” to the city’s green lungs, which would take several decades to rectify.“The proposal of the SDMC was heard and we will conduct a detailed analysis on whether it is feasible to allow them to dump inert waste there. After a month, the board will look at the findings of the committee and take a final call,” a senior official, who attended the meeting, confirmed.The Delhi chief secretary headed Ridge Management Board in Friday’s meeting decided that an “expert committee” comprising officials from various agencies — including SDMC — will assess whether it is feasible to allow municipal agencies to dump its inert waste on the ecologically sensitive zone.“SDMC’s application was filed on behalf of all the five civic bodies in Delhi. It wanted permission to dump about 265 lakh tonnes of inert waste recovered from bio-mining of the three landfills. Nearly seven trommel machines, which acts as sieves to separate garbage by size for safe disposal, have already been installed in Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla dump yards. We need to deposit the inert waste somewhere,” an SDMC official said on Friday.The official, on condition of anonymity, added that municipalities need four pits at Asola Bhatti, which are around 30 metres deep, to dump their waste. These pits were abandoned about 35 years ago, after the Supreme Court halted mining of ‘red badarpur’ sand for construction activity, due to environmental destruction resulting from it.The SDMC had presented the same proposal before the Ridge Management Board in 2007, which was then rejected by the board. In fact, an environment impact assessment of this proposal in 2003 had also pointed out the long term damage that such large scale dumping would lead to on the flora, fauna and also the underground aquifers in the area.The Bhatti mines is a notified wildlife sanctuary, which comes under the southern leg of Delhi’s ridge. The ridge is home to several protected species, which will be impacted if this proposal gets the go-ahead, environmentalists said.Vimlendu Jha, executive director of environment NGO Swechha, who is also a former member of the Ridge Management Board, said that allowing such dumping on the ridge was “unacceptable”.“The job of the Ridge Management Board is to protect the ridge and not allow such atrocious activities. You don’t need to be an expert to know the kind of damage waste dumping does to the ecology. Not just the trees and soil, the underground water levels, the animals, everything in the area is staring at a grave damage. This proposal has been rejected by the courts, then why are we even considering it? ,” Jha said.In October 2019, the National Green Tribunal had also refused to entertain the application by the SDMC seeking permission for the dumping.Aya Nagar councillor from the SDMC, Ved Pal, had opposed the application in the standing committee meeting of the civic body on Tuesday.“The aquifers below the Bhatti mines hold groundwater that is used by entire south Delhi, Faridabad and Gurugram. This proposal will lead to largescale pollution of the mines with waste from landfills. The sanctuary is a part of my ward and I will not allow this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/south-corp-seeks-nod-to-dump-inert-waste-in-asola-sanctuary-experts-warn-against-move-101614966960481.html

The flight finally took off for Pune around 7pm, after a delay of around 90 minutes during which the aircraft was thoroughly sanitised and fumigated, officials said. IndiGo did not confirm how many passengers or crew members were onboard the aircraft. The airline also did not share how many passengers were in direct contact with the passenger who tested Covid-19 positive.At present, it is mandatory for all flyers from Delhi, Rajasthan, Kerala, Goa, and Gujarat to produce a negative RT-PCR report after landing in Maharashtra.Airport officials, privy to the matter, said the incident took place on flight 6E 286 of IndiGo airlines that was scheduled to take off for Pune from Delhi airport at 5.30pm on Thursday.IndiGo declined to comment on or confirm the incident. However, airport officials aware of the matter, said that after completing boarding of passengers, the flight had pushed back and left the tarmac when the incident took place. It was taxiing to reach the runway when one of the passengers informed the airline crew that he had just received his Covid-19 report, which showed that he had tested positive for the viral disease.“On this, the crew immediately reported the matter to the pilot in command, who in turn alerted the air traffic control and requested a return to the parking bay. The aircraft, that had already reached the runway, was then allowed to return and was parked back at 5.40pm. Meanwhile, medical team at the airport were informed and they reached the aircraft, as the passenger was de-boarded as per standard operating procedures set by the Union ministry of health,” said an official from Delhi airport, who wished not to be named.Officials from Delhi airport, however, also could not confirm if the man was sent into isolation and where.The official said that all other passengers on board were also de-boarded and the aircraft was thoroughly sanitised. “A thorough fumigation was carried out. All touchpoints were sanitized, and the plane was cleaned. Only after that the rest of the passengers were allowed to board again. The flight finally took off for Pune at 7pm, with a delay of one and a half hours,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flyer-declares-he-is-covid-19-minutes-before-take-off-to-pune-flight-turns-back-101614966959756.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 312 fresh Covid cases, 3 new deaths; vaccination drive remains slow||Delhi reported 312 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, crossing the 300-mark for the first time since mid-January. The city had last recorded 340 cases fifty days ago on January 14, according to daily data released by the Delhi government.The city till Friday had witnessed 640,494 total number of cases of the virus, of which 627,797 had recovered or been discharged from hospitals.While the positivity rate has continued to stay lower than 1% since the end of December last year, the increase in the number of daily cases comes amid what seem like new waves of the infection being reported from at least six states in the country —Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka.Delhi on Thursday conducted around 60,000 tests – which is reported a day later in Friday’s health bulletin –of which 312 tested positive, pegging the state’s positivity rate at around 0.53%. Friday’s positivity rate was the highest since January, recorded on January 11 at 0.54%.Just over 60,100 tests were conducted each day on average in March, an increase over the average 58,545 tests conducted each day in February. In January, over 67,100 tests were being conducted each day on average, the government data showed. The number of tests being conducted in Delhi, however, has gone down from its capacity of over 85,000 seen in December just after the city saw its third and worst wave of infection.The positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – reflects the spread of the infection, which is on the rise in the city. Delhi’s average positivity over the last seven days stood at 0.39%, an increase from 0.30% the week before, and 0.24% the week before that. Even though the positivity rate continues to remain below the 5% mark, which experts believe means that the spread of the infection is still under control, the slow rise is worrying.“Any increase in the positivity rate is a cause of concern. There is a need for the government to increase the number of tests to detect those infected at earliest and isolate them. Anybody who has come in contact with a Covid patient should also be tested. This can help in controlling the number of infections before it grows big again,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Experts say that lax social distancing and masking norms, coupled with probable new variants in circulation, might be the reason for the current increase in number of cases, as the sero-surveillance conducted in January had shown that over 56% of Delhiites had antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.“The current rise is likely to be due to variant strains that are more infectious. So, even if 56% of the people have some immunity against the virus, it is spreading quickly among the rest. If that is the case, there could be an increase in the number of cases again, as is being seen in Maharashtra,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).She, however, expressed confidence that the ongoing vaccination drive against the disease might help in keeping he number of hospitalisations and deaths low.On Friday, 21,897 persons received their first shot against the infection and 5,160 completed their two-dose course. There was a rush of people to get the shot at private centres, yet only 67% of the available slots were used on Friday. In government centres, only 28% of the slots were used, reflecting a slow vaccination drive.So far, the disease has killed 10,918 people in the city including the three who died on Thursday. Although the cumulative case fatality ratio – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – has reduced to 1.70% in Delhi, the number of hospitalisations has started increasing again. As on Thursday night, there were 599 persons with Covid-19 admitted to various city hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-adds-312-fresh-covid-cases-three-new-deaths-vaccination-drive-remains-slow-101614966959202.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Woman murders her children, then hangs self in Shakurpur||A woman and her two children — three-year-old boy and four-month-old daughter — were found hanging from the ceiling fan of their home in north-west Delhi’s Shakurpur on Thursday, following a quarrel with her husband, the police said.Usha Rangnani, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said that the probable reason behind the apparent double murder-cum-suicide was the woman’s quarrel with her husband earlier on Thursday over a disagreement on visiting her native place in Bihar.“The woman wanted to visit her village in Madhubani in Bihar to attend a relative’s mundan (head tonsure) ceremony. But her husband disagreed with the plan,” said Rangnani.Another investigator, who didn’t want to be identified, said that the husband had said no to the plans by citing his inability to afford the travel and other expenses that would be incurred while attending the family function. Police, however, said they are probing if the finances of the man was the real reason or there was something more to it.A sub-divisional magistrate will be conducting an inquiry in the matter, police said.The couple lived with their children in a one-room flat on the second floor of a building in Shakurpur. The husband worked at an eatery and also did other side jobs, such as cleaning cars, in residential neighbourhoods.On Wednesday morning, investigators said,the couple had quarrelled once before the husband left for work, said the DCP.When he returned from work around 10.30pm, he found the room locked from the inside and no one responding to his repeated knocks. Moments later, neighbours heard the man’s screams for help.A neighbour said that he heard the man cry for help and rushed to help. On reaching the second floor he found the three bodies hanging. “The two children and their mother was hanging from one fan. The man began breaking down the door, and I joined him,” said the neighbour.Together, they managed to break the door and bring down the bodies.The DCP said that investigations into the triple deaths has been launched and the post-mortem would be carried out after the woman’s relatives arrived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-murders-her-children-then-hangs-self-in-shakurpur-101614966904083.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Fighting disinformation with facts, movies and social media||When student-activist Navkiran Natt, 29, joined the farmers’ agitation in November and watched it grow, she realised the need to counter misinformation on the protests. Thus, the four-page Trolley Times was born and Natt became one of the three editorial team members responsible for collating information and producing the trilingual newsletters.While the printed copies are in Gurmukhi and Hindi, the founders are posting the content in English on their website as well. The first edition was printed on December 18 and since then the circulation has grown from 2,000 to 7,000 copies, and the newsletter is distributed across the three protest sites at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur. Apart from stories on the farmer protests and the contentious farm laws, the newsletter also has cartoons, poems, and opinion pieces written by farmer union leaders.“Many news organisations were derailing the narrative by branding farmers as Khalistani, Maoists, and anti-nationals. We realised there was a need to counter this from within and bring out the plight of the common farmers,” said Natt.Launched as a weekly, Trolley Times became a bi-weekly after the violence during the tractor rally.The seven-member team that brings out the newsletter holds meetings after every edition and decides on a theme for each week and then contacts writers. “The social media circulation of the digital version of our bi-weekly has helped us reach a greater audience. Since we have allowed people to print it and distribute the newsletter without modifications, people have also been translating it into at least five Indian languages and four foreign languages,” said Natt who was a practising dentist till she joined the protest along with her family.The activist pursued her degree in dental medicine from Chandigarh before opting for film studies at Ambedkar University in 2018. Before joining the farmers’ protest, she was working with a US-based non-governmental organization (NGO) on their 1947 Partition Archives as a paid intern. However, once she found her place in the protest, she quit the internship.Natt, who has been associated with the All India Students’ Association (AISA) for over a decade, had also been jailed for protesting against a slum demolition in Chandigarh in 2015. “My parents have also been activists and have been jailed over five times. They too have been camping with me at Tikri since the first day. Having parents who understand the importance of participating in mass movements definitely helps,” she said.The young activist’s day at Tikri involves a variety of tasks including managing logistics, arranging for supplies, cleaning tents, preparing rotis at community langars, managing the libraries, holding discussions with people and also engaging with them at ‘Trolley Talkies’.“When people come and live on the streets during a protest, the roads turns into temporary cities and homes. We had to provide means of entertainment for them. That is why we hold movie screenings showing progressive films and documentaries so that cinema can also be used as a tool of resistance,” she said.Asked about her takeaway from the protests she has been part of, Natt said, “In the past few months, I have learnt that our generation lacks patience. We get agitated that nothing is happening but here farmers are determined that their agitation will bring about a change. It is a lesson I keep close to my heart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fighting-disinformation-with-facts-movies-and-social-media-101614966903485.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Cardiologist all the way from New Jersey has his finger on pulse of protesters||When Swaiman Singh, 34, a cardiologist from New Jersey, joined the farmers’ agitation in November, he did not anticipate that the agitation would go on for 100 days, and beyond.“I’d come to India on five days’ leave, and thought I’d arrange some doctors at the site before leaving. But when I saw the plight of our elderly farmers, I just couldn’t go back,” he said.Singh, who’s been living in the US for 24 years, and had volunteered as a doctor during the Black Lives Matter protest, says he has now left his fellowship programme at the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center midway.Since late November, he has camped at the Tikri protest site, providing free medical assistance to thousands of farmers. He has also started a night shelter, a movie theatre, and a library to lend support to the agitation. Singh and his colleagues call their camp “Pind California” -- famous in the neighbourhood for providing all kinds of assistance to agitating farmers.“Our political leaders have made tall claims of turning Punjab into California in the past, but have failed. By working for our community here, we wanted to create a blueprint on how to provide for the people in a democratic set-up. That was the idea behind setting up schools, medical camps, movie theatre, and shelters, among others,” he said.Singh, who witnessed the violence during the farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day, said several of his team members were injured in clashes between farmers and police that day.Under the banner of his non-government organisation, the Five Rivers Heart Association, Singh said nearly 100 doctors are posted at the protest spots on a rotational basis. They also have around 1,000 doctors on call across the world for tele-consultations, and to help with the medical camps that conduct physical therapy and carry out tests.“The major difference between the protests in the US and here is the way the administration treats protesters; here, the government has cut off the internet, food, water, and sanitation facilities. The gutters are overflowing as there are barely any sanitation workers to maintain cleanliness at these sites. There can be an outbreak of malaria or dengue here at any time, but they don’t care. We have lost over 200 farmers during the agitation so far, and, yet, no one is talking about it,” he said.The cardiologist says he’s barely met his daughter in the past seven months -- first, due to the pandemic, and now because of the protests. “I recently went home for a day (to his home town in Punjab), and she was angry with me for being away. She did not want to let go of me,” he said. “Of course, work and family life have been affected but we are fighting for a greater cause.”There are regular movie screenings at Pind California on revolutionary themes, Singh said. “From Bhagat Singh to Subhas Chandra Bose to Chotu Ram, we focus on showing movies that will inspire people to carry on with this revolutionary fight.”With summer approaching, the team is now working on building bamboo hutments to protect the farmers from the heat and mosquitoes. “If the government thinks that these farmers will tire eventually and go back, they are wrong. Over the past few months, I’ve seen them stand united in their fight to repeal the laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cardiologist-all-the-way-new-jersey-has-his-finger-on-the-pulse-of-protesters-101614966899810.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Football player who runs Singhu’s laundromat||Tony Sandhu, a 43-year-old former football player who represented Punjab at various national competitions in the late 1990s, was among the first few farmers to reach the Singhu Border on November 26. The next day, he and a host of other current and former sportspersons -- some kabaddi players, some wrestlers -- helped set up a stage and organise a langar.About 10 days later, however, Sandhu and his team mates realised that, to camp on a road for months, needs much more than food, tents, or even toilets.“The farmers’ clothes were getting dirty, and had no way to clean them,” said Sandhu, who is from Jalandhar.So he and some fellow sportspersons requested some farmers and locals in the vicinity to arrange for a few washing machines. By December 10, three machines and several packets of detergent arrived. Such is the clout of these sportspeople in the Punjab and Haryana, that machines kept getting added over time.The decision to set up camp at a mall in Kundli, about a 1km from the Singhu Border, came in handy as well. “The mall management provided us water and power to run the washing machines. And we are using our donation funds to pay their water and power bills,” said Sandhu, who, along with his band of compatriots, is now the de facto laundry incharge at the protest.At any point through the day, there are at least six sportspersons handling the machines as thousands of clothes are washed here every day. Sandhu oversees the laundry operations, and services at a langar -- one of the largest ones that caters to about 4,000 people every meal.“Some sportspersons in our team also look after the security at the stage,” said Sandhu.In the last 100 days, several farmers have come and gone, but these sportspersons have faced little trouble.“Whenever we fall short of anything, be it parts of the washing machine, detergent or ration, all I have to do is hand over a list to farmers returning home. They send us everything we ask for,” said Sandhu.Until the Republic Day tractor rally that descended into chaos, Sandhu had returned home just once -- for a single day. After that, he has been back twice to meet his two children, for two days each time. “We are now looking at the possibility of us protesting here for six months, a year or even beyond,” he said.His family does pester him to return -- they know what it is to have relatives gone away for long durations. “There are so many people in my village serving in the army or working in other countries. Sacrifices have to be made to achieve something,” says Sandhu, who took to farming after his career in sports.He is confident that the protests can continue uninterrupted for much longer. “We sportspersons are disciplined people. That is ensuring we don’t get scared by adverse situations, and never stray from the right path,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/football-player-who-runs-singhu-s-laundromat-101614966899204.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||His space to read and debate is now a place for learning||About a fortnight after the protest against three contentious farm laws began at the Singhu border, 27-year-old Sukhwinder Singh Barwa realised that while basic needs such as food, medicines and toilet facilities were slowly being taken care of, the farmers still lacked an avenue to constructively use their time while union leaders held talks with the government.By December 15, Barwa and a bunch of his friends set up “Sanjhi Sath”, a 2,400 square feet space that would house a library, organise a daily discussion where protesters could voice their opinions and share thoughts, and earmark a space to prepare posters.Over time, however, what was then unplanned turned out to be the biggest success -- a school for the children from the nearby slums.“We were occupying the space belonging to the locals. We were using their facilities. We had to find way to repay their debt. So, we decided to educate their children during our stay here,” said Barwa, who is from Punjab’s Roopnagar district.A hundred days into the protest, about 170 children -- aged between three and 13 -- have attended these classes held for three hours (11am to 2pm), six days a week.“There are 10 teachers, mostly older students, who have been imparting lessons up to Class 8,” said Barwa, who takes drawing and painting classes.The heavy barricading at the protest site, specially after the violence during the January 26 tractor rally, led to several most students not being able to attend the “school” for a few days. “But the children were back soon, even if it meant walking a kilometre or two extra,” said Barwa.The library, which is equipped with historical, religious and agricultural books in English, Hindi and Punjabi, apart from a host of newspapers and magazines, remains open through the day; as does the space for painting slogans on posters and banners.When the school ends around 2pm, Barwa and his team start clearing the space to prepare for the discussion, akin to Parliament debates, for two hours every day (6.30pm to 8.30pm).“There are about 200 farmers in attendance every day. Those wishing to put forward their views and suggestions are allotted three minutes each to speak,” said Barwa who moderates these sessions.Friday was the 99th day at the protest site for Barwa, but he said this was just the beginning. “Organising these events is becoming easier by the day. We are ready to face summer heat. What else can shake us. We are here for years, if need be!” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/his-space-to-read-and-debate-is-now-a-place-for-learning-101614966839264.html
06-03-2021||Delhi||Abuse survivor who’s now the first legal port of call||Lawyer Simranjeet Kaur Gill, 34, says she chose to stay back in Mohali when her family moved to Canada a decade ago. “I’ve survived child abuse, and knew that I had to work within the community to address the problem. So I set up an NGO with my cousins to work with child abuse survivors, victims of domestic abuse, and rape victims,” she said.For the last few months, Gill has been helping farmers, particularly women, who have gathered in the thousands at Delhi’s Singhu border to protest against three contentious farm laws that aim to liberalise the agrarian economy. While her work during the initial days of the protest site included raising awareness and mobilising women, Gill and her legal team are now providing legal aid to farmers who are facing court cases, including those filed in connection with the tractor rally on January 26.Though she returned to Mohali in February, her group “Lawyers for Kisan”, continues to work at Singhu. She said she’d fallen ill, and is raring to get back. “While I can’t work with them physically these days, I am connected with my team on social media, tracking the bail applications, and providing legal help wherever necessary. I am waiting to recover so that I can return to the site,” Gill said.She coordinates with 150 lawyers at the three farmer agitation spots – Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur.“Before the violence, we were mainly working with women protesters, running awareness drives, and setting up camps at protest sites to cater to the specific needs of women protesters. We also made efforts to arrange for portable toilets for women. But after the January 26 violence, we realised that we need to focus on arranging legal aid for the protesters,” she said.“We constantly man our helpline numbers and volunteer desks. We have also made announcements from the stage for protesting farmers to come and share any information they have on those arrested and their families. Our group is also in touch with their families,” she said.After the tractor rally violence, Gill and her team visited the trolleys that have been converted into makeshift accommodations and collected information about the events of January 26. “Lot of rumours were floating around on the tractor march. My team spoke to thousands of farmers at the protest site, and I too spoke to at least a hundred of them to record the events of the day so that we could understand what happened that day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/abuse-survivor-who-s-now-the-first-legal-port-of-call-101614966779285.html

06-03-2021||World||Mutated Covid-19 variants responsible for spike in cases across Europe||The virus swept through a nursery school and an adjacent elementary school in the Milan suburb of Bollate with amazing speed. In a matter of just days, 45 children and 14 staff members had tested positive.Genetic analysis confirmed what officials already suspected: The highly contagious coronavirus variant first identified in England was racing through the community, a densely packed city of nearly 40,000 with a chemical plant and a Pirelli bicycle tire factory a 15-minute drive from the heart of Milan.“This demonstrates that the virus has a sort of intelligence. ... We can put up all the barriers in the world and imagine that they work, but in the end, it adapts and penetrates them,’’ lamented Bollate Mayor Francesco Vassallo.Bollate was the first city in Lombardy, the northern region that has been the epicenter in each of Italy’s three surges, to be sealed off from neighbors because of virus variants that the World Health Organization says are powering another uptick in infections across Europe. The variants also include versions first identified in South Africa and Brazil.Europe recorded 1 million new COVID-19 cases last week, an increase of 9% from the previous week and a reversal that ended a six-week decline in new infections, WHO said Thursday.“The spread of the variants is driving the increase, but not only,’’ said Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, citing “also the opening of society, when it is not done in a safe and a controlled manner.”The variant first found in the UK is spreading significantly in 27 European countries monitored by WHO and is dominant in at least 10 countries: Britain, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Israel, Spain and Portugal.It is up to 50% more transmissible than the virus that surged last spring and again in the fall, making it more adept at thwarting measures that were previously effective, WHO experts warned. Scientists have concluded that it is also more deadly.“That is why health systems are struggling more now,” Kluge said. “It really is at a tipping point. We have to hold the fort and be very vigilant.”In Lombardy, which bore the brunt of Italy’s spring surge, intensive care wards are again filling up, with more than two-thirds of new positive tests being the UK variant, health officials said.After putting two provinces and some 50 towns on a modified lockdown, Lombardy's regional governor announced tightened restrictions Friday and closed classrooms for all ages. Cases in Milan schools alone surged 33% in a week, the provincial health system's chief said.The situation is dire in the Czech Republic, which this week registered a record-breaking total of nearly 8,500 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Poland is opening temporary hospitals and imposing a partial lockdown as the UK variant has grown from 10% of all infections in February to 25% now.Two patients from hard-hit Slovakia were expected to arrive Saturday for treatment in Germany, where authorities said they had offered to take in 10 patients.Kluge cited Britain’s experience as cause for optimism, noting that widespread restrictions and the introduction of the vaccine have helped tamp down the variants there and in Israel. The vaccine rollout in the European Union, by comparison, is lagging badly, mostly because of supply problems.In Britain, the emergence of the more transmissible strain sent cases soaring in December and triggered a national lockdown in January. Cases have since plummeted, from about 60,000 a day in early January to about 7,000 a day now.Still, a study shows the rate of decline slowing, and the British government says it will tread cautiously with plans to ease the lockdown. That process begins Monday with the reopening of schools. Infection rates are highest in people ages 13 to 17, and officials will watch closely to see whether the return to class brings a spike in infections.While the UK variant is dominant in France, forcing lockdowns in the French Riviera city of Nice and the northern port of Dunkirk, the variant first detected in South Africa has emerged as the most prevalent in France's Moselle region, which borders Germany and Luxembourg. It represents 55% of the virus circulating there.Austria's health minister said Saturday the UK variant is now dominant in his country. But the South Africa variant is also a concern in a district of Austria that extends from Italy to Germany, with Austrian officials announcing plans to vaccinate most of the 84,000 residents there to curb its spread. Austria is also requiring motorists along the Brenner highway, a major north-south route, to show negative test results.The South Africa variant, now present in 26 European countries, is a source of particular concern because of doubts over whether the current vaccines are effective enough against it. The Brazilian variant, which appears capable of reinfecting people, has been detected in 15 European countries.WHO and its partners are working to strengthen the genetic surveillance needed to track variants across the continent.The mayor of Bollate has appealed to the regional governor to vaccinate all 40,000 residents immediately, though he expects to be told the vaccine supply is too tight.Bollate has recorded 3,000 positive cases and 134 deaths — mostly among the elderly — since Italy was stricken a year ago. It took the brunt in the resurgence in November and December, and was caught completely off guard when the UK variant arrived, racing through schoolage children before hitting families at home.“People are starting to get tired that after a year there is no light at the end of the tunnel,” Vassallo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutated-covid-19-variants-responsible-for-spike-in-cases-across-europe-101615050960051.html

06-03-2021||World||US Senate passes Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 bill on party-line vote||The Senate on Saturday passed President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan in a party-line vote after an all-night session that saw Democrats battling among themselves over jobless aid and the Republican minority failing in attempts to push through some three dozen amendments.The final bill includes $400 billion in one-time payments of $1,400 to most Americans, $300 a week in extended jobless benefits for the 9.5 million people thrown out of work in the crisis, and $350 billion in aid to state and local governments that have seen the pandemic blow a hole in their budgets.The Senate voted 50-49, with no Republicans voting in favor, on what would be one of the largest stimulus packages in US history.The fight is not over as the bill needs to return to the House of Representatives, which approved a slightly different version a week earlier.The standoff within the Democratic party over the jobless benefits and the all-night effort by Republicans to amend a bill that polls show is popular with voters illustrated the difficulty that Biden will have in pushing other policies through a Congress that Democrats control by the narrowest of majorities. The bill is a priority for Biden as the country battles a pandemic that has killed more than 520,000 Americans.The chamber set a record in its longest single vote in the modern era -- 11 hours and 50 minutes -- as Democrats negotiated a compromise on unemployment benefits to satisfy centrists like Senator Joe Manchin, who often walks a delicate tightrope as a Democrat representing a state, West Virginia, that overwhelmingly supported Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election.The extended unemployment payments, which are to be paid out on top of state jobless benefits, proved to be the most contentious part of the bill. The House bill had set the supplemental benefit at $400 a week, but Senate Democrats finally agreed to knock that down to $300.The House bill also featured a measure to more than double the minimum wage to $15 per hour, which the Senate also rejected.Moderate Democrats feared that the higher jobless benefits and minimum wage hike would overheat the economy and hurt businesses in rural states.Senate Democrats used a process called reconciliation to pass the measure with a simple majority rather than the 60 of 100 votes normally required under the chamber's rules.It was unclear whether Democrats will try to use that maneuver on other policy goals such as legislation dealing with climate change and immigration.One Republican, Daniel Sullivan of Alaska, left Washington on Friday night for a family funeral, meaning that Democrats did not need Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote in the normally 50-50 chamber.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-biden-s-1-9-trillion-covid-19-bill-on-party-line-vote-101615051641676.html
06-03-2021||World||Swedish police break up coronavirus demonstration in Stockholm||Swedish police on Saturday started to disperse hundreds of opponents of coronavirus restrictions who staged a protest in the capital Stockholm in defiance of a ban on large gatherings.Police blocked a bridge in the centre of the city and said on their website they were in dialogue with organisers to persuade demonstrators to disperse.TV images showed police shoving some protesters, while the police said one officer had been slightly injured and taken to hospital."Police have taken the decision to break up the non- authorised gathering which is ongoing," Stockholm police said on their website on Saturday.Earlier this week, protest organiser Filip Sjöström told local media that he was expecting around 2,000 people to join the demonstration, which had been announced on Facebook.TV images showed hundreds of people had gathered. According to Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter, demonstrators had travelled from several parts of Sweden, which has a ban on public gatherings of more than eight people.Sweden, which has 10 million inhabitants, registered 4,831 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 26 new deaths, taking the death toll to 13,003.The government said last month that it would cut opening hours for restaurants, bars and cafes and tighten limits on the number of people allowed in shops, in a bid to ward off a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The centre-left government has gradually tightened restrictions since late last year after keeping most schools, restaurants and businesses open, relying primarily on voluntary measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-police-break-up-coronavirus-demonstration-in-stockholm-101615051137096.html

She has become an icon of the protest movement.The exhumation of Kyal Sin has brought fresh outrage from opponents of the coup, who accuse the junta of trying to conceal the fact she was killed by their forces.State television said police, a judge and doctors had exhumed the body and carried out a surgical investigation.They found a penetration wound in the back of the head and a piece of lead measuring 1.2 cm by 0.7 cm in the brain and said that it was different from the tips of bullets used by the police.State television said police had been face-to-face with the protesters and the wound was at the back of the head and that the object which killed Kyal Sin could be fired from a gun able to shoot .38 calibre bullets."Therefore, it can be assumed that those who do not want stability conducted the assassination," MRTV said.On social media, coup opponents described the exhumation as a further insult to Kyal Sin and her family, with the intention of giving a false account of what happened.A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.State television said authorities had asked for the family's permission to exhume the body, but did not say whether it was granted. Reuters was unable to contact the family.Protesters at the scene of the demonstration in Mandalay on Wednesday said they had come under fire from live bullets at the time Kyal Sin was killed.Pictures published by Reuters show that Kyal Sin had the back of her head turned towards the line of security forces in the moments before she was killed.Residents said Kyal Sin's body had been exhumed on Friday by a team who arrived under police and military guard and kept people away from the grave site. The tomb was sealed with fresh cement and discarded rubber boots and gloves and plastic surgical gowns littered the site on Saturday.Kyal Sin was among at least 38 people killed on Wednesday, the bloodiest day so far in attempts by security forces to stop protests against the coup that has prompted daily demonstrations for over a month.The army says it has been restrained in the use of force, but that it will not allow protests to threaten stability.The army said it overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi after the electoral commission rejected its allegations of fraud in an election in November that her party had won by a landslide.Protesters reject the army's promise of new elections and demand the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/body-of-everything-will-be-ok-protester-exhumed-in-myanmar-101615050937602.html

06-03-2021||World||Bye, Bismarck: 144 US cities could lose status as metro areas||Bye-bye, Bismarck. So long, Sheboygan.Those cities in North Dakota and Wisconsin, respectively, are two of 144 that the federal government is proposing to downgrade from the metropolitan statistical area designation, and it could be more than just a matter of semantics. Officials in some of the affected cities worry that the change could have adverse implications for federal funding and economic development.Under the new proposal, a metro area would have to have at least 100,000 people in its core city to count as an MSA, double the 50,000-person threshold that has been in place for the past 70 years. Cities formerly designated as metros with core populations between 50,000 and 100,000 people, like Bismarck and Sheboygan, would be changed to “micropolitan" statistical areas instead.A committee of representatives from federal statistical agencies recently made the recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget, saying it's purely for statistical purposes and not to be used for funding formulas. As a practical matter, however, that is how it's often used.Several housing, transportation and Medicare reimbursement programs are tied to communities being metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, so the designation change concerns some city officials.In Corvallis, Oregon, the state designates certain funding sources to metropolitan statistical areas and any change to the city’s status could create a ripple effect, particularly when it comes to transportation funding, said Patrick Rollens, a spokesman for the city that is home to Oregon State University.“I won’t lie. We would be dismayed to see our MSA designation go away. We aren’t a suburb of any other, larger city in the area, so this is very much part of our community’s identity,” Rollens said in an email. “Losing the designation would also have potentially adverse impacts on recruitment for local businesses, as well as Oregon State University.”If the proposal is approved, it could be the first step toward federal programs adjusting their population thresholds when it comes to distributing money to communities, leading to funding losses for the former metro areas, said Ben Ehreth, community development director for Bismarck.“It won’t change any formulas ... but we see this as a first step leading down that path,” Ehreth said. “We anticipate that this might be that first domino to drop.”Rural communities are concerned that more micropolitan areas would increase competition for federal funding targeting rural areas. The change would downgrade more than a third of the current 392 MSAs.Statisticians say the change in designations has been a long time coming, given that the US population has more than doubled since 1950. Back then, about half of US residents lived in metros; now, 86% do.“Back in the 1950s, the population it took to create a metro area is different than it would be to create a metro area in 2020," said Rob Santos, president of the American Statistical Association.Nancy Potok, a former chief statistician of the Office of Management and Budget who helped develop the new recommendations, acknowledged that officials in some cities will be upset with the changes because they believe it could hurt efforts to lure jobs or companies to their communities.“There are winners and losers when you change these designations," Potok said. “A typical complaint comes from economic development when you are trying to attract investments. You want to say you are part of a dynamic MSA. There's a perception associated with it. If your area gets dumped out of an MSA, then you feel disadvantaged."Officials in some cities said they needed to research the impact of the change. Others were surprised to find their metro was on the list in the first place.“Perhaps they made a mistake,” Brian Wheeler, director of communications for the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, said in an email.While the city of Cape Girardeau, which is on the list, has a resident population north of 40,000 people, as a regional hub for southeastern Missouri, it can have a daytime population of more than 100,000 people, said Alex McElroy, executive director of the Southeast Metropolitan Planning Organization.“It kind of seems misleading," McElroy said of the designation change.In a letter to the federal budget office, the mayor of Opelika, Alabama, urged that the proposal be dropped.“The risk to vital services within our community, our state and the millions of impacted Americans across this country far outweigh any limited statistical value that might be gained from this proposal,” Mayor Gary Fuller said.In a separate proposal, the US Census Bureau is considering a change to the definition of an urban area. The proposal made public last month would use housing instead of people for distinguishing urban from rural. An area will be considered urban if it has 385 housing units per square mile, roughly the equivalent of 1,000 people per square mile, under the new proposal. The current standard is 500 people per square mile.The Census Bureau says the changes are needed to comply with new privacy requirements that aim to prevent people from being identified through publicly released data and it offers a more direct measure of density.Some demographers aren't sold on the idea of changing the definition of a metro area.“It seems like everything is ad hoc, rather than having been determined by serious research," said Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire. “The definitions have been relatively stable since 1950. All of the sudden, they change these, and at least in my mind, there isn’t a compelling research-based process that has driven this decision."In Corvallis, Rollens joked that he was intrigued by the possibility of the city becoming a micropolitan area, suggesting the community could benefit from thinking small.“We enjoy our small-batch craft beers and locally grown produce here in Corvallis, so I have no doubt that we would find a creative way to market our region if we ended up with a ‘micropolitan' designation," Rollens said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bye-bismarck-144-us-cities-could-lose-status-as-metro-areas-101615049930991.html
06-03-2021||World||Car bomber kills prosecutor, bodyguard: Afghan officials||A suicide car bombing killed the Afghan intelligence directorate’s chief prosecutor Saturday, an official said, amid an increase in violence in the war-ravaged country.Sayed Mahmood Agha was on his way to his office in the southern city of Lashkargah when an attacker driving a car full of explosives targeted Agha's convoy, killing him, said Attaullah Afghan, provincial council chief for Helmand province.One of Agha's bodyguards was also killed and eight others, including two civilian passersby, were wounded.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.Afghanistan is experiencing a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings, and other violence as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government continue.The Islamic State group’s local affiliate has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, but many go unclaimed, with the government putting the blame on the Taliban. The insurgents have denied responsibility for most of the attacks.In another incident at the Sheikh Abu Nasre Farahi crossing in Afghanistan’s western Farah province on the Iranian border, at least three terminals storing diesel fuel caught fire, causing a massive blaze that consumed at least two trucks carrying natural gas and fuel, according to Afghan officials and Iranian state media.It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the fire. Taj Mohammad Jahid, western Farah governor told the Associated Press that the Afghan first responders did not have the means to put out the huge fire and had requested firefighting support from Iran, which helped extinguish the blaze.It was the second massive fire incident on on the Afghan-Iranian border in the past three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-bomber-kills-prosecutor-bodyguard-afghan-officials-101615047181666.html
06-03-2021||World||US officer's trial could reopen intersection where George Floyd died||During a group's recent meeting at the now-vacant Speedway gas station near where George Floyd died, children roasted marshmallows on a fire pit while adults discussed topics ranging from activism to snow removal.“Black joy is a form of protest,” said Marcia Howard, one of the group's organizers, referencing plans for celebrating Arctic explorer Matthew Henson as part of Black History Month.But the agenda on this chilly Thursday morning in February quickly segued to more immediate concerns: Who would pick up skis and broomball sticks for an event being planned at a nearby park? And what's to be done about the snow piling up at the site's greenhouse that preserves plants left in Floyd's memory?Such is life at George Floyd Square, the place where former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for about nine minutes. Although many in the community consider the place where the Black man died to be a sacred space, it also has presented some headaches for the city.The square sprang up organically in the days after Floyd’s death. As people gathered to express their grief and anger, including leaving offerings, community members set up barricades of refrigerators, trash cans and wooden pallets to block traffic. The city eventually replaced those with concrete barriers.Amid concerns that the barricaded square was decimating businesses and making the neighborhood less safe at night, city leaders recently pledged to reopen it after Chauvin's murder trial. Jury selection starts Monday, and the trial is expected to stretch into April.The residents and activists who serve as unofficial leaders and organizers of George Floyd Square say they won't step aside unless the city meets their list of 24 demands. Among them: recall the county prosecutor, fire the head of the state's criminal investigative agency, and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on programs to create jobs, combat racism and support affordable housing. They also are demanding that the square remain closed until the trials scheduled for August of the other three officers charged in Floyd's death.Since the city asserted it would reopen the square after Chauvin's trial, the caretakers of the space have declined to talk in detail about negotiations to reopen it. Jeanelle Austin, a racial justice leadership coach and a lead caretaker of the memorial area, said the demands that fall within the city's control aren't unreasonable.“The thing about it is that a lot of the different demands are asks from different people, and Black folks aren’t monolithic,” said Austin, who is Black. “So it’s really incumbent upon our city leadership to really look at the needs behind the asks, and really fulfilling those needs.”A towering steel sculpture of a raised fist dominates the middle of the intersection, a replacement for the wooden sculpture that first went up. Murals memorializing Floyd or marking the struggle against discrimination have overtaken nearly every vertical surface. Warming houses are available at the barricades, and so is hand sanitizer in a nod to COVID-19 safety precautions. A small library, a community closet for clothing and food shelves are among various services available to visitors.Howard, a 47-year-old retired Marine who lives around the corner from the square, was so affected by Floyd’s death that she took a leave from her job as a high school English teacher to more or less watch over the square. Howard said the neighborhood has been largely supportive of volunteers, with many residents cooking food for them.A video on her TikTok account shows a resident’s child giving her a cupcake as the family left the square, bringing Howard to tears.“I haven’t had to grocery shop in six months,” she said.But the support isn't total.Andrea Jenkins, one of two City Council members representing parts of the neighborhood, said some of her constituents have complained about gunshots and the frequent sound of police helicopters overhead.“The neighbors deserve to have a level of comfort that does not include gunshots every night, and muggings and carjackings, and all the violent crimes we have been witnessing in this community,” Jenkins said.Violent crime at the intersection and the blocks immediately surrounding it rose dramatically in 2020, though crime also increased citywide. There were 19 nonfatal and fatal shootings in the area in 2020, including 14 shootings from May 1 through Aug. 31. That’s compared with three shootings in all of 2019 and none during the summer months.Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo last month disputed frequent characterizations of the square as an “autonomous zone” but cited those perceptions as a major reason it must be reopened.Jenkins said officers have been met with “protests, resistance, opposition” that have sometimes led them to avoid policing the area. Howard and other leaders dispute that anyone in the square has impeded officers.A flashpoint of that argument was the fatal shooting of Dameon Chambers at the square when many people had gathered to celebrate the Juneteenth holiday.A city document says emergency services workers were unable to get to Chambers and that police “ultimately had to pull Mr. Chambers to an area where the ambulance could access the area.” The Floyd Square caretakers say it was police who delayed emergency workers, and their demands include an investigation of his death.“The narrative will be, to this day, that the people blocked the EMS,” Howard said. “Show me the bodycam footage of people blocking emergency services vehicles for a dying Black man. You won’t have it, because it doesn’t exist.”Jenkins and others also argue that businesses in the area are being hurt by the street closure. She said business occupancy in the area has fallen from more than 90% last March to “probably less than 50%” nearly a year later, although it's difficult to discern the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on those numbers.The Speedway is now closed, with a sign that once displayed gas prices now showing a countdown to Chauvin's trial, and other storefronts lay vacant. Several businesses do remain open, including a couple of restaurants, a salon and a laundromat.Members of Howard's group say that while they're hoping Chauvin gets convicted, the occupation of the square is about far more than the case against him.“Injustice closed these streets, and only justice can open them back up," Howard said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officer-s-trial-could-reopen-intersection-where-george-floyd-died-101615047156595.html
06-03-2021||World||Open spaces, no pharmacies: Rural US confronts Covid vaccine void||When Charlome Pierce searched where her 96-year-old father could get a Covid-19 vaccine in January, she found zero options anywhere near their home in Virginia. The lone medical clinic in Surry County had none, and the last pharmacy in an area with roughly 6,500 residents and more land mass than Chicago closed years ago.To get their shots, some residents took a ferry across the sprawling James River to cities such as Williamsburg. Others drove more than an hour past farms and woodlands - the county got its first stoplight in 2007 - to reach a medical facility offering the vaccine.At one point, Pierce heard about a state-run vaccination event 45 minutes away, No more appointments were available, which perhaps was for the best: the wait there reportedly could last up to seven hours.“That would have been a daunting task,” she said, citing her father’s health conditions and frequent need to use the bathroom. “I could not have had him sit in a car and wait for something that might happen. We’re not in a Third World country.”As the nation's campaign against the coronavirus moves from mass inoculation sites to drugstores and doctors' offices, getting vaccinated remains a challenge for residents of “pharmacy deserts,” communities without pharmacies or well-equipped health clinics. To improve access,” the federal government has partnered with 21 companies that run free-standing pharmacies or pharmacy services inside grocery stores and other locations.More than 40,000 stores are expected to take part, and the Biden administration has said that nearly 90% of Americans live within five miles of one, from Hy-Vee and Walmart to Costco and Rite-Aid.But there are gaps in the map: More than 400 rural counties with a combined population of nearly 2.5 million people lack a retail pharmacy that’s included in the partnership. More than 100 of those counties either have no pharmacy or have a pharmacy that historically did not offer services such as flu shots, and possibly lacks the equipment or certified staff to vaccinate customers.Independent pharmacies that have traditionally served rural areas have been disappearing, casualties of mail-order prescriptions and more competition from chains like Walgreen’s and CVS with greater power to negotiate with insurance companies, according to Keith Mueller, director of the University of Iowa’s RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis.“There are a lot of counties that would be left out” of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, said Mueller, whose research center compiled the pharmacy data on the 400 counties. “In the Western states in particular, you have a vast geography and very few people.”Challenges to obtaining a vaccine shot near home aren’t limited to rural areas. There is a relative dearth of medical facilities in some urban areas, particularly for Black Americans, according to a study published in February by the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Pharmacy and the West Health Policy Center.The study listed 69 counties where Black residents were much more likely to have to travel more than a mile to get to a potential vaccination site, including a pharmacy, a hospital or a federally qualified health center. One-third of those counties were urban, including the home counties of cities such as Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Detroit and New Orleans.Additionally, the study identified 94 counties where Black residents were significantly more likely than white residents to have to go than 10 miles to reach a potential vaccination site. The counties were mostly heavily concentrated in the southeastern US — Virginia had the most of any state with 16 — and in Texas.The shortage of pharmacies and other medical infrastructure in some of the nation’s rural areas highlights the health care disparities that have become more stark during the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected members of racial minority and lower-income groups.The former drug store in Surry County, where about 40% of the residents are Black, is now a café. No one seems to remember exactly when the Surry Drug. Co. closed, but café co-owner Sarah Mayo remembers going there as a child. Now, she drives 45 minutes to a Walmart or CVS.“I don’t know if more people would take the vaccine” if the pharmacy still existed, Mayo, 62, said. “But at least you would have a local person that you trust who would explain the pros and cons.”Surry County residents also used to pick up prescriptions at Wakefield Pharmacy in neighboring Sussex County until it, too, closed in November. The owner, Russell Alan Garner, wanted to retire and couldn't find a buyer.“We’ve become dinosaurs,” Garner said.In January, Surry County officials saw vaccines arrive in other parts of Virginia that had more people or more coronavirus cases. Fearing doses might not arrive for months, if ever, they began to pressure state officials.In a letter to the governor’s office, Surry joined with surrounding communities to express concerns about vaccine “equity,” particularly for low-income and other disadvantaged populations. Some of those communities said they had reallocated money to support vaccination efforts.“The thing about living in a rural community is that you’re often overlooked by everybody from politicians right on through to the agencies,” said county Supervisor Michael Drewry.Surry County Administrator Melissa Rollins wrote to the regional health district, stating that driving outside the county wasn’t practical for most residents. She said Surry was willing to sponsor a mass vaccination site, had devised a plan to recruit people who could administer shots and make sure that eligible residents would be ready.The first clinic in Surry County was held Feb. 6 at the high school in the small town of Dendron. The school district was inoculating teachers and other staff members when officials with the county and regional health district staff learned of extra doses, prompting a rush to get the word out.Surry already had a waitlist of eligible people through a survey it designed to reach vulnerable residents. It used its emergency alert telephone system, since internet access is spotty.Pierce got the call and quickly headed out with her father, Charles Robbins. It was a 20-minute drive to the high school and a two-hour wait. Pierce, 64, also got a shot, along with about 240 other people that day.Three more vaccination clinics have been held in the county. And the regional health district had administered 1,080 doses there as of March 2. The number makes up the majority of doses that county residents have received, although several hundred received their shots outside of the county.All told, about 1,800 county residents have received at least one dose. That’s about 28% of the population and was almost twice the state’s average rate. About half the people who’ve received vaccines are Black.The Virginia Department of Health said that vaccine distribution has been based on population and Covid rates. But moving forward, the department said it’s considering tweaks to ensure more geographical and racial equity.Pierce and her father were relieved to get their second shots in late February. But she said Surry’s rural character placed it at a disadvantage in the beginning.“I have close friends, people who are essential workers, who’ve had to go as far away as an hour to get a shot,” she said. “You shouldn’t be marginalized by your zip code.”But driving vast distances is a way of life for many in rural areas, said Bruce Adams, a cattleman and commissioner for Utah’s San Juan County, which is nearly the size of New Jersey and overlaps with the Navajo Nation.“I got both shots, and I had to drive 44 miles roundtrip for each one to a public health center,” Adams, 71, said. “I don’t think it’s any more of a problem than anything else we do normally in our lives...going to the doctor, the dentist, getting your haircut.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/open-spaces-no-pharmacies-rural-us-confronts-covid-vaccine-void-101615045770012.html

The following day, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is known as CISA and is part of the Department of Homeland Security, issued an emergency directive in response to “observed active exploitation of these products.” As a result, civilian agencies and departments were directed to apply the patches, or disconnect Microsoft Exchange from their networks, and to look for compromises.Government concern over the flaws continued to build over the course of the week. On Thursday, CISA released an alert stating that it was aware of hackers using tools to search for servers that hadn’t yet been patched. That evening, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote on Twitter that the US is “closely tracking Microsoft’s emergency patch.” He cited “reports of potential compromises of US think tanks and defense industrial base entities.”The specific targets and timing of the hacking remains unknown. Defense Department spokesman John Kirby said the Pentagon is assessing its systems based on Microsoft’s advisory. The cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. found that victims included “US-based retailers, local governments, a university, and an engineering firm.” The version of exchange targeted by hackers is typically run by small businesses, putting them at special risk, according to Allan Liska, an analyst at the firm Recorded Future Inc..A Microsoft representative said the vulnerabilities were disclosed to the company in early January. Microsoft isn’t aware of attacks before then, the representative said.The cybersecurity firm Volexity reported finding attacks leveraging the flaws that date back to as early as Jan. 6. However, CISA urged operators to look for compromises dating back to September, “out of an abundance of caution,” according to a spokesperson.A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a press briefing on March 3 that conclusions on hacks into Microsoft servers should be based on complete evidence and avoid wanton accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flaws-in-microsoft-s-email-software-raises-alarms-white-house-dhs-101615045526320.html
06-03-2021||World||Italian prosecutor seeks life sentences for US students accused of killing||An Italian prosecutor on Saturday demanded life sentences for two young Americans being tried on murder charges after a policeman was killed following a botched drugs sale in Rome.Finnegan Lee Elder, who was 19 at the time, has admitted to stabbing Mario Cerciello Rega in the early hours of July 26, 2019, while his friend Gabriel Christian Natale-Hjorth, then 18, was tussling with another police officer.Under Italian law, anyone who participates even indirectly in a murder can face murder charges.The two Americans, both from California, have said they did not know that Cerciello or his partner, Andrea Varriale, were police officers, telling the court that neither man had identified themselves.Varriale has denied this, testifying that they had shown their two assailants their badges. Cerciello's badge was not found at the crime scene.Elder and Natale-Hjorth were in Rome on holiday at the time and had tried to buy drugs from a local dealer. They have told the court that they were cheated, but managed to snatch a bag off an intermediary as he tried to get away.They subsequently agreed to meet the dealer again to get their money back in exchange for the bag, but instead the two policemen showed up. Neither man was in uniform and Elder has testified that they immediately attacked them, forcing him and Natale-Hjorth to defend themselves."I panicked and believed he wanted to kill me," Italian media quoted Elder as telling the court earlier this month.Police say Cerciello, 35, was unarmed at the time and was stabbed 11 times by Elder with an 18-cm (7-inch) blade.Italian media have reported that the dealer was an informer who had reported the theft of the bag, asking the police to intervene.In a court appearance last September, Elder apologised for the killing.Natale-Hjorth initially told police he had not been involved in the killing and did not know his friend had a knife. However, his fingerprints were found on a panel in the ceiling of their hotel room where the knife had been concealed.Lawyers for Elder and Natale-Hjorth have yet to present their defence. A verdict in the trial is expected in April, legal sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-prosecutor-seeks-life-sentences-for-us-students-accused-of-killing-101615045057758.html

06-03-2021||World||Americans fully vaccinated against Covid-19 still wait for advice||More than 28 million Americans fully vaccinated against the coronavirus will have to keep waiting for guidance from federal health officials for what they should and shouldn’t do.The Biden administration said Friday it’s focused on getting the guidance right and accommodating emerging science, but the delays add to the uncertainty around bringing about an end to the pandemic as the nation’s virus fatigue grows.“These are complex issues and the science is rapidly evolving,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday. “We are making sure and taking time to get this right and we will be releasing this guidance soon.”Such guidance would address a flood of questions coming in from people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19: Do I still have to wear a mask? Can I go to a bar now? Can I finally see my grandchildren?The need has slowly grown since January, when the first Americans began to complete the two-dose series of Covid-19 vaccines then available. Now, more than half of people 65 and older have received at least one shot, according to Andy Slavitt, a senior administration adviser on the pandemic.In Washington state, Raul Espinoza Gomez has 22 grandchildren and great-grandchildren and an appointment Saturday for his second dose of coronavirus vaccine.By Easter, the 77-year-old's immune system will be ready to protect him from the virus. But how the family celebrates will depend on government advice, said Melissa Espinoza, 47, of Carnation, Washington, who plans to drive Gomez, her father-in-law, to get his second shot.“We didn’t gather together as a big family at Christmas," she said. "We go by what the state and federal guidelines recommend. We’ve had family members adversely affected by Covid. We know the risks are severe.”Worried about persistently high case loads and deaths, the Biden administration has condemned efforts to relax states’ virus restrictions and pleaded with the public for several months more patience.The caution has drawn critics, who point to the administration’s own warnings that “fatigue is winning” as evidence that they need to be more optimistic about the path ahead to secure the cooperation of those who are yet to be vaccinated.“I think it’s going to be overly proscriptive and conservative and that’s the wrong message,” former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CNBC Wednesday of the forthcoming CDC guidance. “If we continue to be very proscriptive and not give people a realistic vision for what a better future is going to look like, they’re going to start to ignore the public health guidance.”Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in the Division of Health Policy and Public Health, encouraged the CDC to be clearer about when and how it plans to produce guidelines for the vaccinated.“Making the decision to go by the science is also making the decision that you’re going to have to make a decision, which is really difficult when the science isn’t settled,” he told the AP. “They’re drinking from a firehose of science, and sometimes, it gets messy.”More than 55.5 million Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine, and slightly more than half of those — 28.7 million — have gotten the recommended two doses. The single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot soon will add a couple million more Americans with questions about what new freedoms they can safely enjoy.“I do hope I get to see my great-grandchildren more," said Rolando Solar, 92, who received his second dose in Miami Wednesday. “But I know things will not go back to normal and, for an old man like me, this is as good as it will be.”Tami Katz-Freiman, 65, of Miami, got her second dose three weeks ago, and plans to watch the Miami Film Festival virtually Sunday at the home of unvaccinated friends. All will wear masks.“We didn’t have to discuss it with each other, because it’s very clear to me that when there is a doubt and you don’t have a CDC straightforward rule you better be on the safe side and take care for yourself,” Katz-Freiman said.Three weeks ago, the CDC announced that fully vaccinated people do not have to go into quarantine if they have contact with someone with a confirmed infection (for 90 days after the final shot). But the agency said nothing beyond that, noted Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University.“That (quarantine guidance) seems to imply to me that your chance of contracting Covid-19 and being a carrier to others is pretty low,” said Wen, who previously ran Baltimore’s health department.“(But) we need to focus on what is most relevant to people's lives, and my patients are not coming in and asking me: 'If I'm vaccinated, do I still need to quarantine if I'm exposed?'" she continued.“I’d say the most common question I get is ‘Can I visit my grandchildren?’” Wen said.Experts say it’s understandable that the CDC has been cautious when many scientific questions remain, including how long vaccine-induced immunity lasts, and whether vaccinated people are still able to transmit the virus to others. The answers are important when advising someone what kind of risk they face in different settings, and how much of a risk they are to others.“The vaccines at their best, in the clinical trials, were 95% effective, I didn't say 100%. And that's why we have to keep wearing masks most of the time," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.But CDC has needed to come out with something more for vaccinated people than sticking with the same old mask wearing, social distancing guidance, he added.“People are so eager to do something and they want to see some tangible benefit from the vaccines. Americans are impatient. They want to get on with it,” Schaffner said.Indeed, “there is a real cost to putting off this guidance,” as people turn to their own doctors for advice, or just make their own assumptions and decisions, Wen said.Waiting too long can diminish the agency’s relevance on this kind of matter, said Wen, who believes CDC should have had some kind of guidance in place for vaccinated people back in January.Clearly, vaccinated people should have been encouraged to go get cancer screenings, dental care, or other needed medical appointments. CDC officials also could have said that it’s OK for small groups of fully vaccinated people — maybe two or three couples, for example — to gather together for a dinner or other small gathering, she said.Regarding small gatherings among people who have been fully vaccinated, “the relative risk is so low that you would not have to wear a mask, that you could have a good social gathering within the home,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's leading infectious diseases doctor, during a recent White House briefing.Some experts discussed the possibility that movie theaters or cruise ships or certain other businesses might open up to vaccinated people, and ask for proof of vaccination status. Israel's government has begun issuing a “green pass” vaccination certificate to anyone who has received two doses of Covid vaccine through an accredited vaccination service.“I don’t know if in this country we would tolerate the federal government issue some kind of pass, the way they did in Israel,” Wen said. But businesses might want such passes and they would be an incentive that might help the overall rate of vaccination, Wen said.The only incentive Espinoza's family needed for vaccination was seeing her and her husband hospitalized with Covid-19 this winter. Still recovering, she uses oxygen at home.Vaccination of the family elders means one step closer to returning to traditions they love: Church on Palm Sunday and, a week later, an Easter egg hunt for the kids and a meal featuring slow-cooked barbacoa, a Mexican beef dish.“I hope people will stay home and stay safe as much as possible until we can all get vaccinated and eradicate this disease," Espinoza said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-still-wait-for-advice-101615043536316.html
06-03-2021||World||Myanmar protesters string up women's clothes to slow down police||Protesters in Myanmar have taken to stringing up women's clothing on lines across the streets to slow down police and soldiers because walking beneath them is traditionally considered bad luck for men.The wraparound cloths, known as longyi, are hung on washing lines. Sometimes women's underwear is used too."The reason why we hang the longyis across the streets is that we have the traditional belief that if we pass underneath a longyi, we might lose our luck," said one 20-year-old protester who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals."The younger generation nowadays doesn't believe it anymore, but the soldiers still do, and it's their weakness. So, we might gain more time to run if they come towards us in case of emergency."Videos on social media have shown police taking down the lines of clothes before crossing them. Traditionally walking beneath items used to cover women's private parts is not only bad luck, but emasculating for men.Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.For more than one month, protesters have demonstrated across Myanmar against the Feb. 1 military coup and the arrest of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of others. More than 50 protesters have been killed by security forces.The lines of clothing do not stop police using teargas, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Some protesters have also been killed by live bullets. The army has said it has responded to the protests with restraint.The army seized power alleging fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party. The electoral commission had dismissed its allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-string-up-women-s-clothes-to-slow-down-police-101615042525567.html

Hong Kong representatives, in Beijing for an annual session, say the change is necessary and desirable."Many people in Hong Kong are politically immature," Liao, who sits on both Hong Kong's and China's legislature, said in a telephone interview."They think 'one man one vote' is the best thing, and they take advice from countries that don't even have 'one man one vote'," Liao said, referring to how neither the US President nor the British Prime Minister is elected by a popular vote.The proposed changes, which include expanding the city's Election Committee from 1,200 to 1,500 people and expanding the city's Legislative Council from 70 to 90 seats, will make Hong Kong's electoral system more "representative", and less prone to "dictatorship of the majority", Liao added.Critics say that Beijing would be able to stack the two bodies with even more pro-establishment members, to gain the numerical superiority needed to influence important decisions such as the election of the city's Chief Executive, leaving Hong Kong voters with less direct say in who they want to lead them.People from new industries and services, such as information technology, telecommunications and healthcare, should be brought in as additional members of Hong Kong's electoral collage, said Maria Tam, a senior Hong Kong politician who works with China's parliament on matters relating to Hong Kong's mini-constitution.People who can help Hong Kong's youth take advantage of China's economic development, such as through the national Five Year Plan and plan for the Greater Bay Area, should also be included, she told Reuters by telephone.Tam dismissed concerns that the reforms, aimed at ensuring "patriots govern Hong Kong" will crimp the space for opposition."I don't think it is just going to be unicolor," she said."Anybody who can draw the line between themselves and those who act against the interests of China and Hong Kong would have no problem whatsoever running for election, and winning," she said.Tam Yiu-chung, the only Hong Kong representative in China's top lawmaking body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said separately: "If you are not a patriot, it's going to be hard for you to get in."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-reforms-prevent-dictatorship-of-the-majority-pro-beijing-lawmaker-101615040458559.html

The man, whose name was not revealed, was taken off the aircraft and has been charged with endangering flight safety. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.The Air France flight resumed its journey to New Delhi."We are investigating both his actions and his motives," Angelov told reporters.

Burns has been confirmed by the Senate for five previous jobs over 33 years and is expected to eventually be approved by the full Senate.The hold is a delaying tactic as the Texas senator pressures the administration to sanction ships and companies helping Russia's state energy company Gazprom build the $11 billion pipeline to take gas under the Baltic Sea to Europe via Germany."I’ll release my hold when the Biden admin meets its legal obligation to report and sanction the ships and companies building (Russia President Vladimir) Putin’s pipeline," Cruz wrote on Twitter late on Friday. The move was first reported by Bloomberg.After a year's delay caused by sanctions, Gazprom is racing to finish the pipeline which analysts expect could happen by September. A second vessel, the Akademik Cherskiy, has joined the construction site off Denmark.President Joe Biden believes the pipeline is a "bad deal for Europe" the White House has said. The pipeline would bypass Ukraine depriving it of lucrative transit fees and could undermine its efforts against Russian aggression. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.US lawmakers from both parties who oppose the project believe about 15 ships are helping to build the pipeline. But the State Department last month only sanctioned one ship in a report to Congress required by sanctions law.Forty Republican senators said in a letter to Biden this week that the sanction against the Fortuna vessel will not stop the pipeline, which as of February had about 75 miles (120 km) left to go off Denmark and 19 miles (30 km) off Germany.The State Department is due to submit to Congress another report on Nord Stream 2 on May 16, which could contain more sanctions, though spokesman Ned Price has said sanctions are only "one of many tools" that can be used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-cruz-puts-hold-on-biden-s-cia-pick-burns-over-nord-stream-2-pipeline-101615039165900.html

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry "stressed the need to launch a serious and effective negotiation process" over the dam before a second round of filling expected this summer.Since Bashir was toppled following mass protests in 2019, a military-civilian council has held power in Sudan under a political transition expected to last until the end of 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypts-sisi-visits-sudan-with-dam-diplomacy-security-on-the-agenda-101615028674492.html

Thai courts have denied recent requests for bail for some of the jailed protest leaders."Release our friends," shouted the protesters in unison, as they gathered in front of a criminal court, which was surrounded by barbed wire. A water cannon truck could be seen behind the gates of the court."Abolish 112," they also said, referring to Thailand's lese majeste law, or Article 112 in the Thai criminal code, which prohibits anyone from insulting or defaming the king.A few protesters burned photographs of the king at the rally. Separate groups also led two other protests at other locations in Bangkok.Earlier on Saturday, police warned protesters that they risked being arrested and that police might use harsher measures if protesters became unruly."Protests are illegal. Anyone who joins or invites others to join is breaking the law," Piya Tavichai, deputy commissioner of Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau, told a news conference.Police used rubber bullets for the first time last Sunday, as well as tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters. Ten protesters and 26 police were injured.In a podcast on Saturday morning, the prime minister urged Thais to respect the law and avoid conflict."We have to love each other and be united, not divided, and respect the law," said Prayuth, who first came to power after leading a military coup in 2014.The Royal Palace has declined to directly comment on the protests, but Prayuth and government officials have said that criticism of the king is unlawful and inappropriate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-thai-protesters-rally-to-demand-leaders-release-101615037432932.html
06-03-2021||World||Russian, Chinese hackers targeted Europe drug regulator: Reports||A Russian intelligence agency and Chinese spies were behind cyberattacks on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last year, Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant reported, citing sources close to the investigation into the breach.The Amsterdam-based European drug regulator in December reported a cyberattack in which documents relating to COVID-19 vaccines and medicines were stolen and leaked on the internet.The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday, but Moscow has repeatedly denied western allegations of hacking.China's foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. Beijing has said previously it firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyber attacks.The EMA launched an investigation with Dutch and European law enforcement authorities, but has so far provided no details on who may have carried out the attacks.De Volkskrant on Saturday reported that the EMA was targeted by Chinese spies in the first half of 2020, followed by Russian intelligence agents later in the year.The Chinese gained access by hacking the systems of a German university, the newspaper quoted sources as saying, while the Russians are alleged to have exploited flaws in the EMA's two-step verification login and other types of cyberdefence."A criminal investigation by law enforcement authorities and other entities is ongoing and EMA is of course fully cooperating," EMA spokeswoman Monika Benstetter said in an emailed response, declining further comment.Reuters was not immediately able to reach the relevant enforcement agencies for comment on Saturday's report.The alleged Russian hackers had access to the EMA's systems for more than a month, the sources told De Volkskrant.They were mainly interested in which countries would use the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and how much they would buy, the newspaper added.Pfizer and BioNTech announced soon after the EMA's initial disclosure that documents relating to their vaccine were accessed in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-chinese-hackers-targeted-europe-drug-regulator-reports-101615038008754.html
06-03-2021||World||World divided on India’s proposal to WTO on Covid-19 IP rights. What are the arguments?||The debate around intellectual property rights on vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has gained momentum, especially after four Republican senators urged US President Joe Biden to not accept a proposal by India and South Africa to the World Trade Organization (WTO).The two countries had submitted a proposal to WTO in October 2020, suggesting a waiver for all its members on the implementation, application and enforcement of certain provisions of a 1995 intellectual property (IP) rights agreement in order to boost Covid-19 prevention, containment or treatment.The multilateral agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) provides for copyright, industrial designs, patents and protection of undisclosed information or trade secrets. A temporary TRIPS waiver for certain provisions is supposed to enable greater access to Covid-19 vaccines, particularly in middle- and low-income countries.What are the arguments in favour?Last month, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal expressed hope that the global pharmaceutical industry will show "big heart" and support India’s proposal. Speaking at a FICCI webinar on pharmaceuticals, Goyal said that the waiver could help the world come out of the Covid-19 pandemic much faster and bring back the V-shaped recovery globally.The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has also backed the proposal which has now been co-sponsored by dozens of countries. "If a temporary waiver to patents cannot be issued now, during these unprecedented times, when will be the right time?" the WHO director-general tweeted.Stephen Cornish, general director of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Switzerland, told news agency Reuters that a temporary waiver would enable to scale up the production of Covid-19 vaccines in a number of countries. Cornish said that rich countries are blocking the proposal in the name of business and status quo instead of “putting human lives above profit.”Read | Waive Covid vaccine patents to benefit poor nations, activists sayWhat are the arguments against a waiver?Rich western nations like the US, Canada, and Switzerland, have opposed the waiver proposal that would grant compulsory licensing by overriding Trips patent rules. Patrick Kilbride, senior vice president at the US Chamber of Commerce’s Global Innovation Policy Center (GIPC), said in a statement that proposals to waive IP rights are “misguided and a distraction from the real work”, which, according to him, is reinforcing supply chains and assisting countries to procure, distribute and administer vaccines.“Diminishing intellectual property rights would make it more difficult to quickly develop and distribute vaccines or treatments in the future pandemics the world will face,” he added.Four US Senate Republicans urged Biden to protect American intellectual property, calling the waiver proposal a scheme that would “crush American jobs, end our progress in developing Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, and worsen the pandemic.” In a letter to the US president, Senators Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst, Mike Lee, and Todd Young said that destroying intellectual property would end the progress that led to the “fastest development of life-saving vaccines in history.”“Even if the waiver may—temporarily—result in a few copycats attempting to produce what American companies developed, it would introduce major quality control problems,” they claimed.“Before long, people would lose faith in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Even worse, a post-development elimination of innovation rights would greatly reduce our ability to respond to future pandemics,” the senators further added.On Monday, the WTO General Council received a status report from the Trips council on the IP waiver request made by India and South Africa. The request will be on the agenda of the next formal two-days TRIPS Council meeting scheduled for March 10-11.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-divided-on-india-s-waiver-proposal-to-wto-on-covid-what-are-the-arguments-101615036391622.html

06-03-2021||World||UK takes step that may impact tax loophole favored by big tech||A small provision buried in the budget, unveiled this week by UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, could eventually lead to larger tax bills for multinational technology firms.Sunak’s plan repeals legislation that means companies based in European Union member states could stop benefiting from tax exemptions on intra-group interest and royalties payments. While the immediate impact is small, it potentially removes a barrier to future changes that could target tax haven payments utilized by big tech companies, experts say.“This feels like an important step, albeit small, to help the U.K. curtail tax avoidance via profit-shifting,” said Paul Monaghan, chief executive officer of UK-based Fair Tax Mark, by email.Big tech companies like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have used such royalty payments to lower their tax burden, according to a report from the U.K. think tank TaxWatch. Companies can reduce profits in higher-taxed jurisdictions by having those subsidiaries pay royalties to another corporate body that technically holds the intellectual property and is based in a lower-tax state like Ireland.Such profit-shifting helped big tech companies pay billions of pounds less in annual taxes than they would have if the U.K. portion of global profits corresponded to the share of global sales, the think tank found.A Treasury spokesperson called it a “post-Brexit technical change” that was necessary to prevent EU companies from getting more favorable treatment than businesses based in the rest of the world.“The UK abides by its international obligations including its Double Taxation Agreements, and continues to be at the forefront of global action to tackle tax avoidance, with a series of robust measures in place to tackle profit shifting arrangements,” the spokesperson said.Representatives for Apple and Google didn’t respond immediately to requests for comment.The repeal will only have a 10 million-pound ($13.8 million) impact annually in the next few years, according to government estimates. There isn’t much immediate significance because of various treaties that stipulate reductions in withholding taxes, according to George Turner, executive director of TaxWatch.“The repeal would make it easier for the U.K. to target royalties and interest payments to European tax havens if the U.K. wanted to override tax treaties, as there would not be a second layer of the directive to prevent the override,” Turner said. The decision follows the UK’s exit from the European Union, which means it’s no longer required to follow the bloc’s tax directives, he said.The budget also included other changes that impact the tech sector, including money for a public-private fund to invest in tech startups, and a fast-track visa program for highly skilled researchers.“It’s one small part in a very big story about how policy makers get their heads around the taxation of the digital economy,” said Leo Ringer, a former U.K. government adviser and founding partner of Form Ventures. “The main implication for corporates is one of essentially planning, and cash flow, and making sure they understand what those double taxation treaties look like.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-takes-step-that-may-impact-tax-loophole-favored-by-big-tech-101615034083846.html

In the February tweet, Gorman wrote in reference to an incident in Rochester, New York, where a nine-year-old girl was pepper-sprayed while handcuffed in the back of a patrol car. “We live in a contradictory society that can celebrate a black girl poet & also pepper spray a 9 yr old. Yes see me, but also see all other black girls who've been made invisible. I cannot, will not, rise alone,” Gorman said in a tweet.Gorman made history as the youngest poet in recent history to perform at a presidential election when she performed at Biden’s inauguration on January 20, where she recited her piece “The Hill We Climb.” The poem was seen as a timely call for national unity as it was delivered just weeks after the US Capitol riots."Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one," Gorman read at the inauguration.Born in Los Angeles in 1998, Gorman became the city's youth poet laureate at 16 after which she studied sociology at Harvard and was also named the first-ever national youth poet laureate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-day-an-icon-next-day-a-threat-amanda-gorman-on-being-racially-profiled-101615033791215.html

06-03-2021||World||China’s top leaders leave tough climate decisions to bureaucrats||Slowing global warming comes down to cutting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. There are different ways to get there, but a country's policies flow from that top-level target. China, the world’s biggest polluter, fell short when it unveiled its goal for the next five years.The world’s second-biggest economy said Friday it plans to lower emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 18% by 2025—the same level it targeted in the previous five-plan. The lack of new ambition was conspicuous after President Xi Jinping won international praise in September for pledging to get China to net zero by 2060.The new targets were in line with where current trends show China is heading anyway. Plans to get a fifth of the country’s energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2025 would mean growing its wind and solar generation by an average of 12% a year, about the same rate U.S. installations increased under former President Donald Trump, who actively opposed green energy. The policies may get China to peak emissions by 2030, which is its pledge under the Paris Agreement. But that isn’t enough to help the rest of the world slow global warming in time, according to research by Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. The group estimates that China would have to cap carbon dioxide emissions around 9.3 billion metric tons by 2030 to reach net zero in 40 years. Rhodium Group estimates that China’s energy sector generated 10.2 billion tons of CO₂ last year. China has so far resisted setting an absolute limit on emissions, choosing instead to set targets as a share of growth. After all, it’s still growing at multiple times the rate of developed countries such as the U.S., and emissions will probably continue to rise considerably. China was the only major economy to grow in 2020 after quickly containing the coronavirus outbreak, and accounts for about 30% of global emissions. Climate experts more broadly agree that China will have to reach peak emissions around 2025 if the world has a chance of achieving the Paris Agreement’s aspiration of limiting the average global temperature rise to 1.5ºC from pre-industrial levels. “Everything else risks leaving the heavy lifting to the period after 2030,” said Myllyvirta. China’s top officials largely delegated the difficult decisions to the different ministries and state-owned enterprises that oversee the country’s energy sector. In the coming months, the energy administration will provide specific targets for wind, solar, hydro, oil and coal power use over the next five years. Provincial governments will have to say what they’re going to do. China will also release a five-year climate plan for the first time, led by the environment ministry.China hasn’t released an official roadmap for carbon neutrality, but Friday’s five-year plan is consistent with the two-speed approach proposed by climate researchers at Tsinghua University. They suggested keeping emissions reduction small before 2035, leaving most of the hard work to the second half, when researchers argued cutting emissions — and by proxy slowing growth — will have less of an impact on a wealthier society. They also assume that China will by then be able to rely heavily on new clean energy sources such as hydrogen as technological breakthroughs will have made them cheap enough. Choosing that route will allow the country’s powerful fossil fuel industries to build more capacity and further entrench their place in the nation’s economy. China mines and burns half the world’s coal, and any serious effort to tackle climate change will have to shrink the industry significantly. The five-year plan doesn’t lay out hard targets for cutting coal use, and instead says China will continue domestic production of fossil fuels like coal and oil.The document as a whole illustrates China’s struggle going forward. On one hand, Xi wants to build what he calls an “eco-civilization,” and support for environmental protection is growing among the public. On the other, local governments are already finding ways around Xi’s green agenda and the fossil fuel industry continues lobbying hard for its expansion — for example, seizing on a power shortage this winter to argue for more energy security.   A lot hinges on how much the environment ministry can persuade other ministries and state-owned companies to take China’s 2060 goal seriously. Since taking on the task of reducing emissions in 2018, it has been relatively toothless, though it appears to have gained sway after Xi’s net-zero pledge. The five-year plan sets a target of “basically eliminating” heavy air pollution by 2025, boosting forest coverage to 24%, cleaning up the nation’s rivers, and restoring wetlands. How far China goes in implementing these policies will be a sign of how effective the ministry is becoming. Earlier this year, an “environmental inspection team” from the ministry publicly criticized the powerful National Energy Administration for failing to rein in coal power generation. The language was unusually tough, and showed the top leadership could potentially side more with environmental policies in the next five years, said Dimitri de Boer, chief China representative of nonprofit ClientEarth.There’s also a chance that China could be waiting for global climate talks in November to upgrade its goals. Xi has sought to position himself as a leader on the issue, and China is set to host an important United Nations biodiversity conference this year. It’s also in the midst of rebuilding ties with the U.S. under President Joe Biden, with climate essentially the only area for possible cooperation after disputes over everything from human rights to trade and the coronavirus. During the first phone call between the two presidents, both countries mentioned climate as an area of shared interest. China hasn’t officially submitted its updated Paris commitments for the upcoming COP26 gathering. It’s important to watch if it further strengthens its targets after the U.S. announces its new goals in April, said Li Shuo, a climate policy advisor at Greenpeace East Asia.“China needs to bring its emission growth to a much slower level, and to flatten the emission curve early in the upcoming five-year period,” he said. Still, the nation has traditionally set itself targets that are easily met. “The habit of the Chinese government to under-promise and over-deliver will hopefully preserve space for more ambition,” Li said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-top-leaders-leave-tough-climate-decisions-to-bureaucrats-101615032142842.html

06-03-2021||World||EU warns Beijing to tread carefully on Hong Kong electoral reform||As China prepares to alter Hong Kong's electoral system, the European Union has warned Beijing to "carefully consider the political and economic implications" of any decision to reform the electoral system of Hong Kong saying that the bloc is "ready to take additional steps" in response to any further serious deterioration of political freedoms and human rights in the city.On March 4, the National People's Congress in China announced that it would deliberate on amending the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, according to a statement from the bloc dated Friday. A decision can be expected by March 11."If enacted, such reform would have potentially far-reaching negative consequences for democratic principles and democratically elected-representatives in Hong Kong," the EU said in a statement.The EU stated that the amendment would also run counter to previous electoral reforms in Hong Kong and renege on the commitments enshrined in Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law to introduce universal suffrage in the elections of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council."The EU calls on the authorities in Beijing to carefully consider the political and economic implications of any decision to reform the electoral system of Hong Kong that would undermine fundamental freedoms, political pluralism and democratic principles," the EU said.It added, "As agreed by EU Foreign Ministers, the EU stands ready to take additional steps in response to any further serious deterioration of political freedoms and human rights in Hong Kong, which would be against China's domestic and international obligations."Along with the bloc, the United States has also condemned the continued assaults on the city's democratic institutions.Speaking at the regular press briefing, US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price on Friday (local time) said bringing reforms to Hong Kong's electoral system is an attack on the region's autonomy and freedoms and the democratic processes."The United States condemns the PRC's [People's Republic of China] continuing assault on democratic institutions in Hong Kong," he said.He further said, "The reforms to Hong Kong's electoral system... are a direct attack on Hong Kong's autonomy, Hong Kong's freedoms and the democratic processes, limiting participation, reducing democratic representation and stifling political debate in order to defy the clear will of the people of Hong Kong and to deny their voice in their own government."Less than a year after imposing the draconian National Security Law, China on Thursday launched a legislative process for drastic electoral system reform in Hong Kong, which could benefit the pro-establishment camp and further smother the political opposition in the city.China has planned a fundamental overhaul of the city's normally contentious politics, the New York Times reported.Zhang Yesui, a senior Communist Party official, announced on Thursday that China's national legislature planned to rewrite election rules in Hong Kong to ensure that the territory was run by patriots, which Beijing defines as people loyal to the national government and the Communist Party.Zhang did not release the details of the proposal. But Lau Siu-kai, a senior adviser to the Chinese leadership on Hong Kong policy, has said the new approach is likely to call for the creation of a government agency to vet every candidate running not only for chief executive but for the legislature and other levels of office, including neighbourhood representatives.NYT also reported that the strategy will further concentrate power in the hands of the Communist Party in Hong Kong and decimate the political hopes of the territory's already beleaguered opposition for years to come.The new reforms come months after China passed the nationals security law to quash the resistance to its rule in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-warns-beijing-to-tread-carefully-on-hong-kong-electoral-reform-101615030353323.html
06-03-2021||World||Myanmar: Protests reported in Myitkyina, Myeik and Dawei, tear gas fired||Security forces in Myanmar again used force Saturday to disperse anti-coup protesters, a day after the UN special envoy urged the Security Council to take action to quell junta violence that this week left about 50 peaceful demonstrators dead and scores injured.Fresh protests were reported Saturday morning in the biggest city of Yangon, where stun grenades and tear gas were used against protesters. On Wednesday, 18 people were reported killed there.Protests were also reported in Myitkyina, the capital of the northern state of Kachin, Myeik, in the country’s far south where police fired tear gas at students, and Dawei in the southeast where tear gas was also used. Other places included Kyaikto, in the eastern state of Mon, Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state in eastern Myanmar, and Myingyan, a city where one protester was killed on Wednesday.The escalation of violence has put pressure on the world community to act to restrain the junta, which seized power on Feb. 1 by ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions.Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party led a return to civilian rule with a landslide election victory in 2015, and with an even greater margin of votes last year. It would have taken a second five-year term of office last month, but instead she and President Win Myint and other members of her government were placed in military detention.Large protests have occurred daily across many cities and towns. Security forces responded with greater use of lethal force and mass arrests. At least 18 protesters were shot and killed last Sunday and 38 on Wednesday, according to the UN Human Rights Office. More than 1,000 have been arrested, the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said.Also read: Pressure Myanmar military junta to protect people's freedoms: UN to ASEAN statesUN special envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener said in her briefing to Friday’s closed Security Council meeting that council unity and “robust” action are critical “in pushing for a stop to the violence and the restoration of Myanmar’s democratic institutions.”“We must denounce the actions by the military,” she said. “It is critical that this council is resolute and coherent in putting the security forces on notice and standing with the people of Myanmar firmly, in support of the clear November election results.”She reiterated an earlier appeal to the international community not to “lend legitimacy or recognition to this regime that has been forcefully imposed and nothing but chaos has since followed.”The Security Council took no immediate action. Council diplomats said Britain circulated a draft presidential statement for consideration, a step below a legally binding resolution.Any kind of coordinated action at the UN will be difficult because two permanent members of the Security Council, China and Russia, are likely to veto it.Schraner Burgener earlier this week warned Myanmar’s army that the world’s nations and the Security Council “might take huge, strong measures.”“And the answer was, ‘We are used to sanctions, and we survived those sanctions in the past,’” she said. When she warned that Myanmar would become isolated, Schraner Burgener said “the answer was, ‘We have to learn to walk with only a few friends.’”The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies urged immediate protection for all Red Cross volunteers and health workers.The statement came after video from a surveillance camera that was circulated widely on social media showed members of an ambulance crew in Yangon being savagely beaten after they were taken into custody by police on Wednesday.“We express profound sadness that Myanmar Red Cross volunteers have been injured while on duty providing lifesaving first aid treatment to wounded people, in line with fundamental principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality. Red Cross volunteers should never be targeted," the federation said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-reported-in-myitkyina-myeik-and-dawei-tear-gas-fired-101615010394240.html

You’ve seen those arrive in Accra in Ghana, last week and the Philippines this week… and Ivory Coast as well. And you’re going to see much more of that volume also going out,” he said.Non-governmental organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) had raised concerns that shipments from India would reduce supplies to developing countries.The minister insisted this was not the case and that supplies around the world would also be deployed through the United Nations-backed Covax system.Britain has acquired the rights to around 457 million doses of various vaccines, estimated at three times the total needed to fully vaccinate everyone in the country.While some of the leftover doses may be offered through bilateral relationships, “the bulk of it will be offered through Covax,” Zahawi said.Meanwhile, in an update from Downing Street on Friday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that as of midnight on Thursday, 21.3 million people have been vaccinated in the UK – which is two fifths of the entire adult population of the country.The government has set a July-end target to vaccinate all adults with at least one of two-dose vaccines.“We’re on course to hit our target of offering a first dose to everyone who’s 50 or over, or part of an at-risk group, by April 15.

06-03-2021||World||Pope Francis urges Arab Muslims to embrace Iraq's Christian minority||Pope Francis and Iraq's top Shiite cleric delivered a powerful message of peaceful coexistence Saturday, urging Muslims in the war-weary Arab nation to embrace Iraq's long-beleaguered Christian minority during an historic meeting in the holy city of Najaf.Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said religious authorities have a role in protecting Iraq's Christians, and that they should live in peace and enjoy the same rights as other Iraqis.The Vatican said Francis thanked al-Sistani for having “raised his voice in defence of the weakest and most persecuted” during some of the most violent times in Iraq's recent history.Al-Sistani, 90, is one of the most senior clerics in Shiite Islam and his rare but powerful political interventions have helped shape present-day Iraq.He is a deeply revered figure in Shiite-majority Iraq and his opinions on religious and other matters are sought by Shiites worldwide.Also read: Pope to visit Iraq church damaged by IS militantsThe historic meeting in al-Sistani's humble home was months in the making, with every detail painstakingly discussed and negotiated between the ayatollah's office and the Vatican.Early Saturday, the 84-year-old pontiff's convoy, led by a bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz, pulled up along Najaf's narrow and column-lined Rasool Street, which culminates at the golden-domed Imam Ali Shrine, one of the most revered sites in Shiite Islam.He then walked the few meters (yards) to al-Sistani's modest home, which the cleric has rented for decades.A group of Iraqis wearing traditional clothes welcomed him outside. As a masked Francis entered the doorway, a few white doves were released in a sign of peace.He emerged just under an hour later, still limping from an apparent flare-up of sciatica nerve pain that makes walking difficult.The “very positive” meeting lasted a total of 40 minutes, said a religious official in Najaf, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief media.The official said al-Sistani, who normally remains seated for visitors, stood to greet Francis at the door of his room — a rare honour. Al-Sistani and Francis sat close to one another, without masks.The official said there was some concern about the fact that the pope had met with so many people the day before. Francis has received the coronavirus vaccine but al-Sistani has not.The pope removed his shoes before entering al-Sistani's room. Al-Sistani spoke for most of meeting. Francis was served tea and a plastic bottle of water, but only drank the latter.Francis paused before leaving al-Sistani's room to have a last look, the official said.The pope arrived later in the ancient city of Ur for an interfaith meeting aimed at urging Iraq's Muslims, Christians and other believers to put aside historic animosities and work together for peace and unity.Religious leaders stood to greet him. While Francis wore a mask, few of the leaders on the tented stage did. The meeting was being held in the shadow of Ur's magnificent ziggurat, the 6,000-year-old archaeological complex near the modern city of Nasiriyah.Ur is also the traditional birthplace of Abraham, the biblical patriarch revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews.The Vatican said the historic visit to al-Sistani was a chance for Francis to emphasise the need for collaboration and friendship between different religious communities.In a statement issued by his office after the meeting, al-Sistani affirmed that Christians should “live like all Iraqis, in security and peace and with full constitutional rights."He pointed out the "role that the religious authority plays in protecting them, and others who have also suffered injustice and harm in the events of past years.”Al-Sistani wished Francis and the followers of the Catholic Church happiness, and thanked him for taking the trouble to visit him in Najaf, the statement said.For Iraq's dwindling Christian minority, a show of solidarity from al-Sistani could help secure their place in Iraq after years of displacement — and, they hope, ease intimidation from Shiite militiamen against their community.Iraqis cheered the meeting of two respected faith leaders.”We welcome the pope's visit to Iraq and especially to the holy city of Najaf and his meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani,” said Najaf resident Haidar Al-Ilyawi.“It is an historic visit and hope it will be good for Iraq and the Iraqi people.”Francis arrived in Iraq on Friday and met with senior government officials on the first-ever papal visit to the country, aimed at promoting his call for greater fraternity among all peoples.It is also his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and his meeting Saturday marked the first time a pope had met a grand ayatollah.Nearly 25,000 security forces were deployed in Najaf ahead of the pope's arrival, according to the province's governor.On the few occasions where he has made his opinion known, the notoriously reclusive al-Sistani has shifted the course of Iraq's modern history.In the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion he repeatedly preached calm and restraint as the Shiite majority came under attack by al-Qaida and other Sunni extremists. The country was nevertheless plunged into years of sectarian violence.His 2014 fatwa, or religious edict, calling on able-bodied men to join the security forces in fighting the Islamic State group swelled the ranks of Shiite militias, many closely tied to Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-urges-arab-muslims-to-embrace-iraq-s-christian-minority-101615024570866.html

But many issues have yet to be addressed.Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told the Funke newspaper group in an interview published Saturday that he is “very skeptical as far as travel at Easter is concerned.” Easter falls on the first weekend in April this year.But he said he expects “that we can talk in a significantly more relaxed way about travel and leisure from Whitsun,” on May 23.Braun said that Germany could return to full normality in the summer — if vaccine manufacturers keep to their delivery pledges and no new coronavirus mutation arises “that raises questions over the whole success of vaccination.”Germany so far has given 5.7% of its population a first dose of vaccine and 2.8% two doses. A fall in new coronavirus cases has stalled as a more contagious variant first detected in Britain spreads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-germany-hopes-for-opening-up-by-late-may-101615029041146.html

EU countries started inoculations at the end of December, but are moving at a far slower pace than other rich nations, including former member Britain and the United States.Officials blame the slow progress in part on supply problems with manufacturers.The European Commission and Italy this week blocked a shipment of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine destined for Australia after the drug manufacturer failed to meet its EU contract commitments. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker has been under fire in the EU for its delayed supplies of shots to the 27-nation bloc, which ordered 300 million doses by the end of June. "We are working 24/7 to improve delivery and hopefully catch up to the expectations for Q2," AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot told EU lawmakers in a public hearing in February. The EU is also planning to extend its export authorisation scheme for Covid-19 vaccines to the end of June, two EU sources told Reuters on Thursday.Under the scheme, companies must get an authorisation before exporting Covid-19 shots, and may have export requests denied if they do not respect their EU supply commitments.The European Commission and AstraZeneca were not immediately available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-seeks-access-to-us-produced-astrazeneca-vaccines-report-101615027887133.html

Under Biden, it will soon be worse, more dangerous, and more out of control than ever before. He has violated his oath of office to uphold our Constitution and enforce our laws," wrote the former President.The Biden administration is "grappling with a rapid influx of migrants", with thousands of unaccompanied minors being apprehended in the president's first several weeks in office.The Hill reported that Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have disputed that the situation amounts to a crisis. But the administration is taking additional steps to try to get a handle on the rising number of migrants at the border, including opening additional facilities to house young migrants."President Biden has asked senior members of his team to travel to the border region in order to provide a full briefing to him on the government response to the influx of unaccompanied minors and an assessment of additional steps that can be taken to ensure the safety and care of these children," White House assistant press secretary Vedant Patel said in a statement late Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-immigration-policy-was-inhumane-and-ineffective-jen-psaki-101615003148972.html

A day later, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration released a new set of images captured by an advanced suite of cameras installed on the vehicle.The first drive served as a mobility test, one of many milestones for mission control, assuring the team that the drive system is good to go for surface operations after the rover landed on the Red planet on February 18. “When it comes to wheeled vehicles on other planets, there are few first-time events that measure up in significance to that of the first drive,” Anais Zarifian, Perseverance rover mobility testbed engineer at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement.Mission controllers finished a software update last week to replace the computer program that helped the rover land on the Martian surface with one they will rely on to probe the planet. On Tuesday, the mission achieved another milestone as Nasa engineers unstowed the rover’s robotic arm for the first time, flexing each of its five joints over the course of two hours. The robotic arm will be used for close-up examination of the geologic features of Jezero Crater, an ancient lakebed formed billions of years ago.“Tuesday’s first test of the robotic arm was a big moment for us...when we got confirmation of the robotic arm flexing its muscles, including images of it working beautifully after its long trip to Mars – well, it made my day,” Robert Hogg, Perseverance rover deputy mission manager, said in a statement.Through it all, the rover has been sending images back to Earth. According to the US space agency, the cameras on the mission have already sent around 7,000 images through the Deep Space Network (DSN). In one of the photographs taken from navigation cameras, the wheel tracks were visible after the roundabout, back and forth trek.The team working on the Mars 2020 mission will test and calibrate every system, subsystem, and instrument on the Perseverance rover before the rover begins pursuing its science goals. The rover will be sent on longer drives and jettison covers that shielded adaptive caching assembly and Ingenuity Mars Helicopter during landing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-rover-sends-images-from-its-first-drive-on-mars-101615025339865.html

DVB confirmed the arrest, Bangkok Post reported.The military coup of February 1 halted Myanmar's tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule and has drawn condemnation and sanctions from the United States and other Western countries, amid growing concern among its neighbours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-myanmar-military-junta-to-protect-people-s-freedoms-un-to-asean-states-101615024467396.html

Ten protesters and 26 police were injured."Protests are illegal. Anyone who joins or invites others to join is breaking the law," Piya Tavichai, deputy commissioner of Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau, told a news conference.He said police might not enforce the ban on gatherings immediately, so long as protesters were peaceful and did not trespass on, or vandalise public or private properties. He went on to warn of harsher measures if protesters became unruly.In a podcast on Saturday morning, the prime minister urged Thais to respect the law and avoid conflict."We have to love each other and be united, not divided, and respect the law," said Prayuth, who first came to power after leading a military coup in 2014.Four separate groups of protesters were planning demonstrations on Saturday, while a counter-protest by a pro-royalist group was also planned. Police have said about 4,800 officers would be deployed at the protest locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-police-warn-protesters-risk-arrest-ahead-of-planned-demonstrations-101615021095872.html

The independent Mizzima news service reported the same.A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.State media on Friday questioned reports that the protester had been killed by security forces when they opened fire to disperse a demonstration on Wednesday and said the cause of death was being investigated by "rule of law bodies".Pictures provided to Reuters by a resident who visited the grave on Saturday showed cement that was still drying as well as discarded rubber gloves and boots, surgical gowns and boots. One block appeared to be stained with blood.A witness who lives near the graveyard said he had seen the grave opened using power tools on Friday evening by a team of at least 30 people that arrived with four cars and two police trucks as well as two trucks of soldiers for security."They pulled out the coffin and removed the body and placed it on a bench. They even placed a brick under the head," said the witness, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals."Those who seemed to be doctors wearing the protective cover did something to the body, I think they were touching the head. They took a small piece from the body and showed it to each other," he said.Reuters was unable to independently confirm accounts of what happened.Two other people told Reuters they were warned by locals not the enter the cemetery on Friday as police and military were inside unearthing Kyal Sin’s body.Reuters was unable to contact Kyal Sin's family.Photographs of her body on Wednesday showed a bloody head wound.The state-run Global New Light Of Myanmar newspaper said on Friday that experts had analysed the photograph and concluded the injury was not consistent with being caused by an anti-riot weapon."If it is the injury caused by the riot weapon or live ammunition, it is not possible for the head of the deceased person to be in good condition," it said."The respective rule of law bodies are investigating the cause of her death and more information will be announced in a timely manner."Kyal Sin was among at least 38 people killed on Wednesday, the bloodiest day so far in attempts by security forces to stop protests against the Feb. 1 coup that has prompted daily demonstrations for over a month.The army says it has been restrained in the use of force, but that it will not allow protests to threaten stability.The army said it overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi after the electoral commission rejected its allegations of fraud in an election in November that her party had won by a landslide.Protesters reject the army's promise of new elections and demand the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grave-of-slain-everything-will-be-ok-protester-disturbed-in-myanmar-101615022169927.html

Zuali told Reuters on Saturday that she was "waiting for the direction" from the India's Ministry for Home Affairs in New Delhi.Although there have been instances recounted on social media of police joining the civil disobedience movement and protests against the junta, this is the first reported case of police fleeing Myanmar.In the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Myanmar authorities said they had information on eight police personnel who had crossed into India. The letter listed details for four police, aged between 22 and 25 years, including a female officer."In order to uphold friendly relations between the two neighbour countries, you are kindly requested to detain 8 Myanmar police personnel who had arrived to Indian territories and hand-over to Myanmar," the letter said.India's federal home ministry and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-asks-india-to-return-eight-police-who-fled-across-border-101615017917108.html
06-03-2021||World||Iraqi Shiite leader reaffirms coexistence after meeting pope||After his historic meeting with Pope Francis on Saturday, Iraq’s top Shiite cleric affirmed that religious authorities have a role in protecting Iraq’s Christians and said they should live in peace and enjoy the same rights as other Iraqis.For its part, the Vatican said Francis thanked Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and the Shiite people for having “raised his voice in defense of the weakest and most persecuted” during some of the most violent times in Iraq’s recent history.He said al-Sistani’s message of peace affirmed “the sacredness of human life and the importance of the unity of the Iraqi people.” The Vatican said the historic visit was a chance for Francis to emphasize the need for collaboration and friendship between different religious communities.Pope Francis met Saturday with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, one of the most senior clerics in Shiite Islam, in Iraq's holy city of Najaf to deliver a joint message of peaceful coexistence, urging Muslims to embrace Iraq's long-beleaguered Christian minority.In a statement issued by his office after the meeting, al-Sistani affirmed that Christians should “live like all Iraqis, in security and peace and with full constitutional rights." He pointed out the "role that the religious authority plays in protecting them, and others who have also suffered injustice and harm in the events of past years.”Al-Sistani wished Francis and the followers of the Catholic Church happiness, and thanked him for taking the trouble to visit him in Najaf, the statement said.Al-Sistani is a deeply revered figure in Shiite-majority Iraq and and his opinions on religious and other matters are sought by Shiites worldwide.For Iraq’s dwindling Christian minority, a show of solidarity from al-Sistani could help secure their place in Iraq after years of displacement — and, they hope, ease intimidation from Shiite militiamen against their community.The historic meeting in al-Sistani's humble home was months in the making, with every detail painstakingly discussed and negotiated between the ayatollah's office and the Vatican.When the time came, the 84-year-old pontiff’s convoy, led by a bullet-proof vehicle, pulled up along Najaf’s narrow and column-lined Rasool Street, which culminates at the golden-domed Imam Ali Shrine, one of the most revered sites in the world for Shiites. He then walked the few meters (yards) to al-Sistani’s modest home, which the cleric has rented for decades.A group of Iraqis wearing traditional clothes welcomed him outside. As a masked Francis entered the doorway, a few white doves were released in a sign of peace. He emerged just under an hour later, still limping heavily from an apparent flare-up of the sciatica nerve pain that makes walking difficult.The “very positive” meeting lasted a total of 40 minutes, said a religious official in Najaf, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.The official said al-Sistani, who normally remains seated for visitors, stood to greet Francis at the door of his room, a rare honor. Al-Sistani and Francis sat close to one another, without masks, with their hands on their laps. A small table was between them with a box of tissues on it.The official said there was some concern about the fact that the pope had met with so many people the day before. Francis has received the coronavirus vaccine but al-Sistani has not.The visit was being carried live on Iraqi television, and residents cheered the meeting of two respected faith leaders.”We welcome the pope’s visit to Iraq and especially to the holy city of Najaf and his meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani,” said Najaf resident Haidar Al-Ilyawi. “It is an historic visit and hope it will be good for Iraq and the Iraqi people.”Francis arrived in Iraq on Friday and met with senior government officials on the first-ever papal visit to the country, aimed at promoting his call for greater fraternity among all peoples. It is also his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and his meeting Saturday marked the first time a pope had met a grand ayatollah.Nearly 25,000 security forces were deployed in Najaf ahead of the pope’s arrival, according to the province’s governor. Rasool Street was emptied of its usual bustle to clear the path for the pope’s arrival. As soon as his motorcade left a swarm of people rushed to the street, filling it up again to see him off.On the few occasions where he has made his opinion known, the notoriously reclusive al-Sistani has shifted the course of Iraq's modern history.In the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion he repeatedly preached calm and restraint as the Shiite majority came under attack by al-Qaida and other Sunni extremists. The country was nevertheless plunged into years of sectarian violence.His 2014 fatwa, or religious edict, calling on able-bodied men to join the security forces in fighting the Islamic State group swelled the ranks of Shiite militias, many closely tied to Iran. In 2019, as anti-government demonstrations gripped the country, his sermon lead to the resignation of then-prime minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi.Iraqis have welcomed the visit and the international attention it has given the country as it struggles to recover from decades of war and unrest. Iraq declared victory over the Islamic State group in 2017 but still sees sporadic attacks.It has also seen recent rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias against U.S. military and diplomatic facilities, followed by U.S. airstrikes on militia targets in Iraq and neighboring Syria. The violence is linked to the standoff between the U.S. and Iran following Washington's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear accord and its imposition of crippling sanctions on Iran.Francis’ visit to Najaf and nearby Ur traverses provinces that have seen recent instability. In Nasiriyah, where the Plains of Ur is located, protest violence left at least five dead last month. Most were killed when Iraqi security forces used live ammunition to disperse crowds.Protest violence was also seen in Najaf last year, but abated as the mass anti-government movement that engulfed Iraq gradually petered out.A heavy security presence was also awaiting Francis in Ur, where the pope was to preside over an interfaith meeting later Saturday. Ur, with its ancient ziggurat, is the traditional birthplace of Abraham, prophet common to Christians, Muslims and Jews.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqi-shiite-leader-reaffirms-coexistence-after-meeting-pope-101615017671302.html
06-03-2021||World||Thumbs Down: Democrat Senator Kyrsten Sinema evokes 'Maverick' McCain||Democrat Senator from Arizona Kyrsten Sinema voted against the motion to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour on Friday. With this she joined 50 Republicans and 6 other Democrats, as well as 1independent Senator who voted against the motion causing it to fail. But it was the way she voted against the motion that caught everyone’s attention.In a video footage which has been widely shared on social media, Sinema can be seen standing on the House floor, flashing a ‘thumbs down’ when her name was called to vote. Her move reminded many of the famous Republican Senator from Arizona, late John McCain, who voted in the same way in 2017 for repealing the Affordable Care Act.Before Sinema, here’s the last Arizona senator to make such a dramatic gesture out of a thumbs down. Best rendition of it ever: pic.twitter.com/NSWAodhR55Sinema's name trended on Twitter alongside McCain's but other than the theatrics, the thumbs down vote of both the senators is being compared as both voted against their own parties.In a statement, Sinema said that she believes the minimum wage hike should be worked on as a separate issue and not with the Covid-19 relief bill. "No person who works full time should live in poverty. Senators in both parties have shown support for raising the federal minimum wage and the Senate should hold an open debate and amendment process on raising the minimum wage, separate from the Covid-focused reconciliation bill," Sinema said.pic.twitter.com/a2VkwKcY8rThe amendment was introduced by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and backed by other progressive senators. Through the amendment, Sanders said that the current $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage will be gradually increased to $15 over five years, starting with an increase to $9.50 this year.US Congress has not passed a minimum wage increase since 2007 and even then it was not a standalone bill but was included as an amendment to a defense spending bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thumbs-down-democrat-senator-kyrsten-sinema-evokes-maverick-mccain-101615017053287.html
06-03-2021||World||Pope to visit Iraq church damaged by IS militants||The scenes are seared in the memory of the Rev. Ammar Altony Yako: A church that for decades has been the pride of the town of Qaraqosh, a center for Christian life in Iraq, stood badly scarred.Yako saw it in 2016 when Qaraqosh was liberated from more than two years of Islamic State group rule. Scrawled on a wall was the proclamation, the "Islamic State will remain.” Strewn amid the rubble in a courtyard were bullet-riddled mannequins and other telltale signs of a militants' makeshift firing range for target practice.On Sunday, a new scene will play out for the world to watch at the Church of the Immaculate Conception and new memories will be created. Where the extremists once damaged, Pope Francis will now pray.“I never could have imagined that his holiness, the pope, would visit this church, not even in my dreams,” said Yako, who has been overseeing reconstruction at the church. “It's a very, very unexpected event and a very happy one.”It is also one rich in symbolism.Coming amid a pandemic and security challenges, the pope's historic trip is taking him to Christian communities, like Yako's, ravaged by the IS onslaught in 2014. Christians in the area were forced to escape ancestral towns and villages as the militants swept through northern Iraq. Many have since scattered abroad, their exodus fueling existential anxieties about Iraq's already dwindling Christian population.Many hope the pope's trip can focus attention on their struggles and send a message of encouragement, but they also point to security, economic and social challenges deterring many Christians from returning.Even now, some returnees wrestle with one particularly fraught question: Stay, helping keep ancient communities alive, or seek better lives abroad if they can?Religious and historic sites of all kinds — including mosques, tombs, shrines and churches — suffered under IS. The extremist group damaged or destroyed whatever it considered contrary to its interpretation of Islam.For Christians, the IS reign dealt a blow to a population already shrinking since the security breakdown and rise of militancy that followed the 2003 U.S.-led war in Iraq prompted many to leave. Iraqi Christians belong to various churches — such as Chaldean, Syriac, Assyrian and others -- and trace the roots of their faith in the country back almost to the dawn of the religion itself.In Qaraqosh, the Syriac Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception — “al-Tahira al-Kubra” in Arabic — became a symbol of its community's losses, and now of its efforts to bounce back.After the area was taken back from IS, walls in the church were found charred, crosses broken, prayer books burned and the tower damaged, Yako said.“It was so painful to see the church where we prayed and that we saw as part of our history looking like that,” he said. “At the same time, there was happiness that at least we were able to return and see it once more.”Scars were erased as restoration happened with the help of international Christian organizations, Yako said. But some were kept to bear witness to the IS era, including pockmarked walls in the courtyard.The church was built between 1932 and 1948. Local farmers set aside money from their harvest and women donated pieces of gold jewelry to help fund it, Yako said.“Its construction was reliant on people volunteering and donating. Just like people think of building their own homes, they were building the house of God,” he said. “We call it the mother church.' Everyone feels like this church is their mother.”More recently, local artists and others have been helping spruce up the church.On 14 church windows, one artist has painted scenes from the Way of the Cross, evoking Jesus' suffering on his way to be crucified.Sculptor Thabet Mekhael made a statue of Virgin Mary, her palms open and her head adorned with a crown. The statue, around 4 meters (13 feet) tall, now stands atop the church's tower surrounded by four crosses and looking out over Qaraqosh.“The statue is a symbol of return and a symbol of our presence as Christians,” Mekhael said. “We've rebuilt the tower and made it even prettier than before.”On a recent day, Sister Hayat Alkasmosa of the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena, Iraq was among a group of volunteers hard at work sweeping and mopping the church's floor.“This church is like the heart of the area,” she said by phone. “It's our life, our heritage, our mother.”Alkasmosa's voice cracked with emotion as she recalled crying when she learned the pope would visit Qaraqosh, also known as Bakhdida or Baghdeda.“There's a need for this kind of peace and consolation,” she said. “His presence is healing.”Francis' stop at the church, she said, will send a poignant message:“Darkness cannot triumph and evil cannot win,” she said. “The last word is not for death; the last word is for life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-to-visit-iraq-church-damaged-by-is-militants-101615016162513.html
06-03-2021||World||Speedy Covid-19 variants power virus surge sweeping Europe||The virus swept through a nursery school and an adjacent elementary school in the Milan suburb of Bollate with amazing speed. In a matter of just days, 45 children and 14 staff members had tested positive.Genetic analysis confirmed what officials already suspected: The highly contagious coronavirus variant first identified in England was racing through the community, a densely packed city of nearly 40,000 with a chemical plant and Pirelli bicycle tire factory a 15-minute drive from the heart of Milan.“This is the demonstration that the virus has a sort of intelligence, even if it is a single-cell organism. We can put up all the barriers in the world and imagine that they work, but in the end, it adapts and penetrates them,’’ lamented Bollate Mayor Francesco Vassallo.Bollate was the first city in Lombardy, the northern region that has been the epicenter in each of Italy’s three surges, to be sealed off from neighbors because of mutant versions that the World Health Organization says are now powering another uptick in infections across Europe. The variants also include versions first identified in South Africa and Brazil.Europe recorded 1 million new Covid-19 cases last week, an increase of 9% from the previous week and a reversal that ended a six-week decline, WHO said Thursday.“The spread of the variants is driving the increase, but not only,’’ said Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, citing “also the opening of society, when it is not done in a safe and a controlled manner.”The so-called U.K. variant is spreading significantly in 27 European countries monitored by WHO and is dominant in at least 10 by the agency's count: Britain, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Israel, Spain and Portugal.It is up to 50% more transmissible than the virus that surged last spring and again in the fall, making it more adept at thwarting measures that were previously effective, WHO experts warned.“That is why health systems are struggling more now,” Kluge said. “It really is at a tipping point. We have to hold the fort and be very vigilant.”In Lombardy, which bore the brunt of Italy’s spring surge, intensive care wards are again filling up as more than two-thirds of new positive tests are of the UK variant, health officials said this week.After putting two provinces and some 50 towns on a modified lockdown, Lombardy's regional governor announced tightened restrictions on Friday and closed classrooms for all age groups. Cases in Milan schools alone surged 33% in a week, the head of the provincial health system said.The situation is dire in the Czech Republic, which registered a record-breaking total of nearly 8,500 patients in the hospital with Covid-19 this week. Poland is opening temporary hospitals and imposing a partial lockdown as the variant has grown from 10% of all infections in February to 25% now.Kluge cited Britain’s experience as cause for optimism, noting that well-considered restrictions and the introduction of the vaccine have helped tamp down the variants there and in Israel. The vaccine rollout in the European Union, by comparison, is lagging, mostly because of supply problems.In Britain, the emergence of the more transmissible strain sent cases soaring in December and triggered a national lockdown in January. Cases have since plummeted, from about 60,000 a day at the peak in early January to about 7,000 a day.Still, a study shows the rate of decline slowing, and the government says it will tread cautiously with plans to ease the lockdown. That process begins Monday with the reopening of schools. Infection rates are highest in people ages 13 to 17, and officials will watch closely to see whether the return to class brings a spike in infections.While the U.K. variant is dominant in France, forcing lockdowns in the French Riviera city of Nice and the northern port of Dunkirk, the variant first detected in South Africa has emerged as the most prevalent in the Moselle region, which borders German and Luxembourg. It represents 55% of the virus circulating there.The South Africa variant also is predominant in a district of Austria that extends from Italy to Germany, with Austrian officials announcing plans to vaccinate most of the 84,000 residents to curb its spread. Austria is also requiring motorists along the Brenner highway, a major north-south trucking route, to produce negative test results.The South Africa variant, now present in 26 European countries, is a source of particular concern because of doubts over whether the current vaccines are fully effective against it. The Brazilian variant, which appears capable of reinfecting people, has been detected in 15 European countries.WHO and its partners are working to strengthen the genetic surveillance needed to track variants across the continent.The mayor of Bollate has appealed to the regional governor to vaccinate all 40,000 residents immediately, though he expects to be told the supply is too tight at the moment.Bollate has recorded 3,000 positive cases and 134 deaths — mostly among the elderly — since Italy was stricken a year ago. It took the brunt in November and December, in the fall resurgence, and was caught completely off guard when the variant arrived, racing through school-age children before hitting families at home.“People are starting to get tired that after a year there is no light at the end of the tunnel,” Vassallo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/speedy-covid-19-variants-power-virus-surge-sweeping-europe-101615015850251.html
06-03-2021||World||Countries urge WTO to destroy US intellectual rights on any Covid-19 innovations||Four top Republicans Senator on Friday urged US President Joe Biden not to accept a proposal by India and South Africa to the World Trade Organisation to waive anti-Covid-19 vaccine patents to boost its supply. “India, South Africa and other countries are presenting a proposal at the World Trade Organisation to waive all intellectual property rights for any innovation related to Covid-19," the group of four Republican Senators wrote in a letter to Biden.“The proponents of this scheme argue that if we just destroy the intellectual property developed by American companies, we will suddenly have more manufacturers producing Covid-19 vaccines,” they said.In the letter, Senators Mike Lee, Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst and Todd Young urged Biden to reject the upcoming proposal at the WTO.“But the opposite is true. By destroying the intellectual property of every American company that has worked on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, we would be ending the progress -- started under Operation Warp Speed -- that led to the fastest development of life-saving vaccines in history," the Senators wrote.They alleged that some countries believe that they would benefit from seizing America's intellectual property.“But this is a mistake,” they said.“Waiving all rights to intellectual property would end the innovation pipeline and stop the development of new vaccines or boosters to address variants in the virus. It also wouldn't increase the supply of vaccines because of the tremendous time and resources needed to build new manufacturing plants and acquire the knowhow to produce these complex medicines,” they said.“Even if the waiver may temporarily result in a few copycats attempting to produce what American companies developed, it would introduce major quality control problems,” the Senators said.“As a global leader and a force for good, we can do a lot to help other countries overcome the virus. But destroying our rights to intellectual property wouldn't advance our mission of fighting the virus -- it would make the problem worse, for America and for the world,” they wrote.“The end of this pandemic is in sight. More than 50 million Americans have been vaccinated, and cases have declined by more than 75 percent from their recent high. We stand ready to work with you to bring an end to this deadly crisis and urge you to take a strong stand against this scheme that would halt our progress,” the Senators said.Also read: Waive Covid vaccine patents to benefit poor nations, activists sayIn a statement, the US Chamber of Commerce’s Global Innovation Policy Centre (GIPC) senior Vice president Patrick Kilbride said the proposals to waive intellectual property rights are misguided and a distraction from the real work of reinforcing supply chains and assisting countries to procure, distribute and administer vaccines to billions of the world’s citizens.“Diminishing intellectual property rights would make it more difficult to quickly develop and distribute vaccines or treatments in the future pandemics the world will face,” he said.Early this week, hundreds of American civil society organizations and three top Congressmen urged Biden not to block the waiver to Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organisation, a move they said would boost the treatment of coronavirus patients worldwide.“The Covid-19 pandemic knows no borders and the need for vaccine development and dissemination across the globe is critically important. The TRIPS waiver raised by India and South Africa at the WTO would help the global community move forward in defeating the scourge of Covid-19 by making diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines available in developing countries,” Congressman Rosa DeLauro, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee told reporters at a news conference.The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires countries to provide lengthy monopoly protections for medicines, tests and technologies used to produce them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-urge-wto-to-destroy-us-intellectual-rights-on-any-covid-19-innovations-101615003134645.html
06-03-2021||World||Increasing evidence that Myanmar's military forces are shooting to kill: Report||Over 50 people have been killed in the crackdown by Myanmar military on those protesting against the February 1 coup. According to a CNN report, photos of the victims' wounds and conversations with their family members point towards the possibility that the military is now shooting to kill.The report quotes Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for Research, Emerlynne Gil as saying that since the government is silent on the usage of shoot to kill tactics, it may be possible that it has authorised it. "Everything points to troops adopting shoot to kill tactics to suppress the protests, and with silence from the military administration, there is a growing consensus that this has been authorised by the government," Gil said in a statement.Also Read: 38 killed on ‘bloodiest day’, says UN envoyThousands of people across the country are agitating against the detention of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was taken into custody on February 1, when the military took over for a year after declaring a state of emergency in response to its claims of election fraud.When the National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi’s party, won a landslide victory in the second general election after decades of army rule, the military and its political factions demanded that authorities investigate allegations of mass voting fraud. Despite Myanmar’s election commission's statement that the process of voting was transparent and fair, the military did not back down.Also Read: With wish to donate organs, Kyal Sin, 19, dies fighting military rule in MyanmarIn the resistance that has now entered its fourth week, Wednesday was the bloodiest day.

"If anything, security forces appear increasingly brazen in their deployment of lethal weapons with each passing day," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/increasing-evidence-that-myanmar-s-military-forces-are-shooting-to-kill-report-101615015194413.html
06-03-2021||World||US labour market stronger than before, but road to full recovery remains long||The US economy created more jobs than expected in February as falling new Covid-19 infections and additional pandemic relief money from the government boosted hiring at restaurants and other services businesses, firmly putting the labour market recovery back on track.Though job growth momentum is expected to build in the months ahead amid an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and more fiscal stimulus, it will probably take several years for the labour market to heal from the deep scars inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, which is now in its second year.The Labour Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed at least 4.1 million Americans have been out of work for more than six months, accounting for 41.5% of the unemployed population in February. Another 3.5 million have permanently lost their jobs."There remains easy fuel for strong payroll gains in coming months as the reopening gains momentum," said Robert Rosener, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. "But there is much further to go before conditions are consistent with maximum employment."Nonfarm payrolls surged by 379,000 jobs last month after rising 166,000 in January. Payrolls fell in December for the first time in eight months. The economy has recouped 12.7 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in the pandemic recession.Also read: Bank of America says US economy is hurt by a lack of workforce diversityEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast February payrolls increasing by 182,000 jobs. Restaurants and bars hired 286,000 workers last month, accounting for 75% of the payrolls gain. There were also increases in employment at hotels and motels and at amusements, gambling and recreation establishments. Altogether, leisure and hospitality employment jumped by 355,000 jobs.Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, increased further. Healthcare and social assistance also added jobs, and retailers hired 41,000 workers. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 21,000 jobs. About half of the factory job gains were in transportation equipment, despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has forced some automakers to cut production.But construction employment decreased by 61,000 jobs because of bitter cold across the country. Government payrolls dropped by 86,000 jobs, with losses concentrated at state and local governments. The diffusion index, or measure of private industries expanding, jumped to 57.0 from 48.4 in January.The surge in hiring follows on the heels of a strong rebound in consumer spending in January, which prompted economists to sharply upgrade their growth estimates for the first quarter.A decrease in daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations and nearly $900 billion in stimulus provided by the government at the end of December are driving the revival in economic activity and hiring. That has stoked inflation fears.The White House is not backing down on President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan. Economists have warned the massive package, combined with the Federal Reserve's near zero interest rates and bond purchases, could cause the economy to overheat.US Treasury yields have jumped as investors see higher inflation."We will always be rooting for more job growth for more Americans across the board," National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told CNBC. "We think that if we pass this rescue plan right now we could be poised for really strengthening the economy and getting to full employment significantly faster than most forecasters estimate without this plan."Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday again brushed aside the inflation concerns, saying he expected the US central bank "will be patient" until the economy is "very far along the road to recovery."Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices were mixed.PLENTY OF SLACKEven as the labour market recovery is regaining steam, ample slack remains. Though the unemployment rate fell to 6.2% last month from 6.3% in January, it continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being "employed but absent from work." Without this problem, the unemployment rate would have been 6.7%. It is about 9.5%, including people who have given up the search for work.A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 11.1%. Unemployment remains high among Blacks and Hispanics, as well as Americans without a high school diploma and college degrees.The labour force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was steady at 61.4% in February. The participation rate has tumbled from 63.3% in February 2020, with women accounting for the biggest share of dropouts.According to Census Bureau data, around 10 million mothers living with their own school-age children were not actively working in January, 1.4 million more than during the same month in 2020."The Fed wants a 'broad' recovery in the labour market across income and racial groups," said Joseph Song, a US economist at Bank of America Securities in New York. "So while there is meaningful improvement, the labour market is far from returning to normal."With the lower-wage leisure and hospitality industry accounting for 94% of payrolls growth last month, average hourly earnings gained 0.2%. Unseasonably cold weather shortened the average workweek to 34.6 hours from 34.9 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-labour-market-stronger-than-before-but-road-to-full-recovery-remains-long-101614998808041.html
06-03-2021||World||WHO incapable of holding China accountable for coronavirus, says dissident||The chances of a deeper investigation on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and holding Beijing accountable will depend a great deal on Joe Biden administration, said Jianli Yang, a Chinese dissident and son of a former Communist Party leader, a former political prisoner in China, adding that he WHO is incapable of demanding transparency from the communist country regarding Covid-19.Jianli, in an opinion article for The Hill, wrote that it is the lesson learned after the World Health Organization (WHO) team's visit to China produced no answers to key questions about how and where the coronavirus started."The WHO is still incapable of transparency regarding China and Covid-19," said the dissident."When the virus began to spread last year, allegations abounded that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which collected extensive virus samples, may have caused the outbreak by accidentally or deliberately leaking the virus into the community. China strongly rejected that possibility. The WHO team said the accidental laboratory leak hypothesis does not explain how the virus was introduced to the human population and indicated this is an area for future study. Unfortunately, this is akin to giving China a clean chit," he wrote.The WHO team, post the trip, said that the initial findings suggest that the introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway and one that will require more studies and more specific targeted research."This obfuscates the fact that the virus was first identified in China and the only thing to be investigated is its origin there. When experts from 10 countries arrived in China on January 14, the Chinese government put limits on their research into the outbreak and prevented the WHO scientists from speaking with reporters," he wrote.The team's mission was an initial step in tracing the virus's origin, Jianli pointed out adding that the Chinese state media and scientists have emphasized the theory that Covid-19 arrived in Wuhan through imported frozen food -- an attempt to bolster Beijing's claim that the virus did not originate in China."If the objective is to trace the earliest instances of the virus in Wuhan, the next logical step would be to trace its origin locally and not assume China's theory that the virus was imported from overseas," the former political prisoner wrote.Jianli said that the chances of a deeper investigation will depend a great deal on the Biden administration's geopolitical interest in pursuing the WHO report to its logical conclusion."The WHO team's visit to China is a consequence of global pressure, but follow-up action could be marred by the inconclusive report. Lack of data is a factor, but we should not lose sight of the larger picture of China's control over the WHO," he wrote further in his opinion article for The Hill.Chinese scientists refused to share raw data that might bring the world closer to understanding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, independent investigators for the World Health Organization in February.The New York Times reported that the investigators who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to Wuhan, China said disagreements over patient records and other issues were so tense that they sometimes erupted into shouts among the typically mild-mannered scientists on both sides.The investigation by the WHO was undertaken after a cluster of patients exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms emerged in Wuhan in December 2019, a new coronavirus was identified to be causing the disease, which later became known as Covid-19, and triggered the global pandemic that infected over 90 million people and killed more than 1.9 million, reported Sputnik.After the outbreak, then US President Donald Trump blamed China for the global Covid-19 pandemic by calling the new coronavirus "Chinese Virus"Then US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Friday said the pandemic was avoidable adding that Beijing did not reveal vital information about the virus, which would have helped scientists to save the world from the disease.Pompeo, in a statement said the United States has "repeatedly called for" a transparent and thorough investigation into the origin of Covid-19. Understanding the origin of this pandemic is essential for global public health, economic recovery and international security.China has been criticised widely across the world for its alleged role in the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected over 116 million people across the world. More than 2.5 million people have lost their lives to the virus.While some accuse it of being complicit, others deem it culpable in the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-incapable-of-holding-china-accountable-for-coronavirus-says-dissident-101615011990333.html
06-03-2021||World||Pak PM Imran Khan threatens party lawmakers ahead of Vote of Confidence||After suffering a massive setback in the Senate election, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is set to face a vote of confidence in the National Assembly has threatened his party lawmakers to follow the party line or face action.This comes after Khan said that he will sit on "Opposition benches" if lawmakers said they have no confidence in him. "Raise your hand and send me out of the government and I will go to the opposition," he said adding, "I will sit on the opposition benches if I lose the vote."Khan's party Pakistan -- Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) -- has 157 members in the 342-member National Assembly. Opposition Pakistan Muslim Leauge-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples' Party have 84 and 54 members, respectively.In a letter addressed to "All Members of the Parliamentary Party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf in the National Assembly of Pakistan" regarding the "Vote of Confidence", Khan wrote, "You are required to take part in the voting on the resolution for a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister as per the directions of the party.""The party head may declare any member to have defected from the political party and forward a copy of such declaration to the election commission in case he or she votes or abstains from voting contrary to the direction issued by the party in the vote of confidence in the Prime Minister under paragraph ii of clause b of Article 63A of the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan," he added.The President of Pakistan has summoned the National Assembly on March 6, 2021, at 12.15 pm in the Parliament House, in the country's capital for the purpose of requiring Khan to obtain the vote of confidence from the National Assembly under clause 7 of the Article 91 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.The decision to go for a trust vote came after a candidate from Imran Khan's party lost a crucial Islamabad senate seat to Pakistan People's Party (PPP) leader and former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani by a slim margin of five votes.Khan is not the first Pakistani Prime Minister to face a vote of confidence in the National Assembly.In fact, under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, all prime ministers of Pakistan, from 1985 to 2008, received a vote of confidence from the National Assembly. These included the late Benazir Bhutto, Nawaz Sharif, Mir Zafarullah Jamali, Chaudhry Shujaat, Shaukat Aziz, and Yousuf Raza Gilani, reported Geo News.But Imran Khan is also the second in the history of Pakistan who has sought for a 'voluntary' vote of confidence.Muhammad Khan Junejo was the first prime minister in the parliamentary history of the country to receive a vote of confidence from the National Assembly, which he received on March 24, 1985, under General Zia-ul-Haq's Revival of Constitution of 1973 Order (RCO), reported Geo News.Under the RCO, the president appoints the prime minister at their discretion and the prime minister must obtain a vote of confidence from the National Assembly within 60 days of their appointment.Pakistan's Constitution states that if the president feels that the prime minister has lost the confidence of the majority of the parliament's members, then he will direct him to seek a vote of confidence and this vote is taken through an open ballot.Imran Khan, under all circumstances, must have the support of a simple majority of 172 lawmakers in the National Assembly, according to Article 91(7) of the Constitution. However, since the NA-75 seat lies vacant after its by-election results were nullified by the Election Commission of Pakistan, he will need the support of 171, reported The News International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-threatens-party-lawmakers-ahead-of-vote-of-confidence-101615012268585.html
06-03-2021||World||London is lagging on vaccines and UK cannot afford that||The UK is way ahead of the rest of Europe on inoculating its people against coronavirus, but the metrics for its biggest population center and economic engine are looking a little less compelling.London, the metropolis of 9 million, is lagging other British regions on vaccine take-up. A study published this week also suggested infections were rising last month while the rate of decline nationally was slowing.It’s partly down to demographics and geography as more people move around the city while sheer population density makes social distancing harder. Yet there are also signs that London, the epicenter of what turned into Europe’s most deadly outbreak, may be getting too complacent as the government plots a way out of lockdown.Mayor Sadiq Khan warned on Friday there are four times the number of Covid-19 patients in the UK capital’s hospitals than when restrictions were lifted last summer, and the much-vaunted vaccination program has not yet reached all of the most vulnerable Londoners.The Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker shows 24% of residents of the city have received at least one shot compared with 31% for the country as a whole.“Now is not the time to take our foot off the pedal, risking a surge in infections or the spread of variants,” Khan said in an emailed response to questions. “We still have some way to go.”The issue for Britain is that defeating the pandemic means defeating it in London. While Boris Johnson’s government is focused on improving the economic prospects for regions elsewhere, the capital makes up almost a quarter of the UK economy and is the main engine for growth.The number of people out of work in London jumped to 7% in the fourth quarter from 4.5% a year earlier despite government programs to safeguard jobs. More than a million residents were claiming Universal Credit social security payments in January, an increase of about 150% on a year earlier.A lower take-up of vaccines in the city could also slow the UK rebound. The government is prioritizing the elderly and London lags all other regions in England across eligible age groups, and especially among 75- to 79-year-olds where many regions have already vaccinated everybody in that category.In parts of central London, just over 60% of eligible people have received at least one jab, compared with 97% an hour’s drive away in the affluent area of Surrey Heath.Health professionals are trying to boost vaccinations among some ethnic minority communities, which are more likely to have received misinformation urging them not to be inoculated. A survey by the British Red Cross published last month found people from Black Caribbean, Black African and Pakistani backgrounds in particular were less likely to take the jabs.“We are continuing to reach out to eligible groups, working with local authorities, care homes, faith and community groups and others to encourage uptake of the safe, effective vaccines which will help save lives,” said David Sloman, regional director of the National Health Service in London.Complicating efforts to reopen the economy is that some of those who have been vaccinated are breaking lockdown rules, potentially spreading the virus and increasing the risk of more mutant strains emerging.As a new variant took hold earlier this year, more than 29% of people in the capital are estimated to have ended up with antibodies, the highest rate of any region in the UK, the Office for National Statistics estimated this week. The number of people going to work and traveling around the city has steadily increased as more people ignore the national lockdown introduced in early January, according to data compiled by Google.People are mixing more because they are focused on the government’s dates for reopening the economy, said David Nicholl, a hospital consultant and spokesman for the Doctors’ Association UK.“It is a risk,” he said. “We need to see the figures crushed down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-is-lagging-on-vaccines-and-uk-cannot-afford-that-101615010564312.html
06-03-2021||World||30,000 US agencies hacked by Chinese cyber espionage units: Report||At least 30,000 US organizations including local governments have been hacked in recent days by an "unusually aggressive" Chinese cyber-espionage campaign, according to a computer security specialist.The campaign has exploited recently discovered flaws in Microsoft Exchange software, stealing email and infecting computer servers with tools that let attackers take control remotely, Brian Krebs said in a post at his cyber security news website."This is an active threat," White House spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said when asked about the situation during a press briefing."Everyone running these servers needs to act now to patch them. We are concerned that there are a large number of victims," she added.After Microsoft released patches for the vulnerabilities on Tuesday, attacks "dramatically stepped up" on servers not yet updated with security fixes, said Krebs, who cited unnamed sources familiar with the situation."At least 30,000 organizations across the United States including a significant number of small businesses, towns, cities and local governments -- have over the past few days been hacked by an unusually aggressive Chinese cyber espionage unit that's focused on stealing email from victim organizations," Krebs wrote in the post.Also read: US downplays possibility of sharing Covid-19 vaccines with MexicoHe reported that insiders said hackers have "seized control" of thousands of computer systems around the world using password-protected software tools slipped into systems.Microsoft said early this week that a state-sponsored hacking group operating out of China is exploiting previously unknown security flaws in its Exchange email services to steal data from business users.The company said the hacking group, which it has named "Hafnium," is a "highly skilled and sophisticated actor."Hafnium has in the past targeted US-based companies including infectious disease researchers, law firms, universities, defence contractors, think tanks, and NGOs.In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft executive Tom Burt said the company had released updates to fix the security flaws, which apply to on-premises versions of the software rather than cloud-based versions, and urged customers to apply them."We know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems," he added at the time.Microsoft said the group was based in China but operated through leased virtual private servers in the United States, and that it had briefed the US government.Beijing has previously hit back at US accusations of state-sponsored cyber theft. Last year it accused Washington of smears following allegations that Chinese hackers were attempting to steal coronavirus research.In January, US intelligence and law enforcement agencies said Russia was probably behind the massive SolarWinds hack that shook the government and corporate security, contradicting then-president Donald Trump, who had suggested China could be to blame.Microsoft said Tuesday the Hafnium attacks "were in no way connected to the separate SolarWinds-related attacks."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/30000-us-agencies-hacked-by-chinese-cyber-espionage-units-report-101614997591868.html
06-03-2021||World||Biden first executive in decades to not hold formal Q&A session so far into term||No news conference. No Oval Office address. No primetime speech to a joint session of Congress.President Joe Biden is the first executive in four decades to reach this point in his term without holding a formal question and answer session. It reflects a White House media strategy meant both to reserve major media set-pieces for the celebration of a legislative victory and to limit unforced errors from a historically gaffe-prone politician.Biden has opted to take questions about as often as most of his recent predecessors, but he tends to field just one or two informal inquiries at a time, usually in a hurried setting at the end of an event.In a sharp contrast with the previous administration, the White House is exerting extreme message discipline, empowering staff to speak but doing so with caution. Recalling both Biden’s largely leak-free campaign and the buttoned-up Obama administration, the new White House team has carefully managed the president’s appearances, trying to lower the temperature from Donald Trump’s Washington and to save a big media moment to mark what could soon be a signature accomplishment: passage of the COVID-19 bill.The message control may serve the president's purposes but it denies the media opportunities to directly press Biden on major policy issues and to engage in the kind of back-and-forth that can draw out information and thoughts that go beyond the administration's curated talking points.“The president has lost some opportunity, I think, to speak to the country from the bully pulpit. The volume has been turned so low in the Biden White House that they need to worry about whether anyone is listening," said Frank Sesno, former head of George Washington University's school of media. “But he’s not great in these news conferences. He rambles. His strongest communication is not extemporaneous.”Other modern presidents took more questions during their opening days in office.By this point in their terms, Trump and George H.W. Bush had each held five press conferences, Bill Clinton four, George W. Bush three, Barack Obama two and Ronald Reagan one, according to a study by Martha Kumar, presidential scholar and professor emeritus at Towson University.Biden has given five interviews as opposed to nine from Reagan and 23 from Obama.“Biden came in with a plan for how they wanted to disseminate information. When you compare him with Trump, Biden has sense of how you use a staff, that a president can’t do everything himself,” Kumar said. “Biden has a press secretary who gives regular briefings. He knows you hold a news conference when you have something to say, in particular a victory. They have an idea of how to use this time, early in the administration when people are paying attention, and how valuable that is.”The new president had taken questions 39 times, according to Kumar’s research, though usually just one or two shouted inquiries from a group of reporters known as the press pool at the end of an event in the White House's State Dining Room or Oval Office.Those exchanges can at times be clunky, with the cacophony of shouts or the whir of the blades of the presidential helicopter idling on the South Lawn making it difficult to have a meaningful exchange.“Press conferences are critical to informing the American people and holding an administration accountable to the public,” said Associated Press reporter Zeke Miller, president of the White House Correspondents' Association. “As it has with prior presidents, the WHCA continues to call on President Biden to hold formal press conferences with regularity.”White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday defended the president's accessibility to the media and suggested that a news conference was likely by the end of March.“I would say that his focus is on getting recovery and relief to the American people and he looks forward to continuing to engage with all of you and to other members of the media who aren’t here today,” Psaki said. “And we’ll look forward to letting you know, as soon as that press conference is set.”The president’s first address to a joint session of Congress — not technically a State of the Union address but a speech that typically has just as much pomp — is also tentatively planned for the end of March, aides have said. However, the format of the address is uncertain due to the pandemic.The president has received high marks for two major scripted addresses, his inaugural address and his speech marking the 500,000th death to COVID-19.Having overcome a childhood stutter, Biden has long enjoyed interplay with reporters and has defied aides’ requests to ignore questions from the press. Famously long-winded, Biden has been prone to gaffes throughout his long political career and, as president, has occasionally struggled with off-the-cuff remarks.His use of the phrase “Neanderthal thinking” this week to describe the decision by the governors of Texas and Mississippi to lift mask mandates dominated a new cycle and drew ire from Republicans. That created the type of distraction his aides have tried to avoid and, in a pandemic silver lining, were largely able to dodge during the campaign because the virus kept Biden home for months and limited the potential for public mistakes.Firmly pledging his belief in freedom of the press, Biden has rebuked his predecessor’s incendiary rhetoric toward the media, including Trump's references to reporters as “the enemy of the people.” Biden restored the daily press briefing, which had gone extinct under Trump, opening a window into the workings of the White House. His staff has also fanned out over cable news to promote the Covid-19 relief bill.And while Biden’s own Twitter account, in a sharp break from Trump’s social media habits, usually offers rote postings, his chief of staff Ron Klain has become a frequent tweeter, using the platform to amplify messages and critique opponents.Delaying the news conference and joint address also, symbolically, have kept open the first chapter of Biden's presidency and perhaps extended his honeymoon. His approval rating stood at 60% in a poll released Friday from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Tobe Berkovitz, a professor at Boston University’s college of communications, said Biden’s “rope-a-dope” strategy was right for the moment.“Presidential press conferences are not on the top of the agenda for Americans who are worried about Covid and the economic disaster that has befallen so many families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-first-executive-in-decades-to-not-hold-formal-q-a-session-so-far-into-term-101615008420909.html
06-03-2021||World||New California law aims to put kids in class. Will it work?||California’s public schools can tap into $6.6 billion in a plan Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Friday to try to pressure districts to reopen classrooms by the end of March. Educators, parents and lawmakers question whether it will work.After nearly a year of distance learning for most K-12 students during the coronavirus pandemic, parents in the nation’s most populated state say they are frustrated and losing hope their children will see the inside of a classroom this year.“Is this money going to be a motivator? I don’t know,” said Dan Lee, a father in San Francisco, a city that sued its own school district to reopen classrooms. “We throw money at them, we sue them, we shame them. They still haven’t moved.”The law does not require school districts to resume in-person instruction. Instead, the state is dangling $2 billion before cash-strapped school boards, offering them a share only if they start offering in-person instruction by month's end. The rest of the money would go toward helping students catch up.“This is the right time to safely reopen for in-person instruction,” said Newsom, who faces a likely recall election this year, fueled by anger over his handling of the pandemic.Getting students back into classrooms has been a fraught issue nationwide, pitting politicians against powerful teachers unions. Each state has handled it differently.In contrast to Newsom’s let-schools-decide approach, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown on Friday issued an executive order mandating all K-12 public schools offer in-person learning by mid-April.In Chicago, the fight to reopen public schools in the nation’s third-largest district nearly resulted in a teachers' strike last month over COVID-19 safety plans. Chicago and New York City, the nation’s largest school district, have now reopened classrooms to elementary school students, but neither city has a plan for high school students.In California, the new law has attracted bipartisan support and scorn in equal measure, with the Democratic governor and lawmakers saying it marked an important step forward but was far from perfect.Teachers from some of the biggest districts have come out against it, saying schools can't reopen until infection rates drop and enough educators have been vaccinated.Among them is the powerful United Teachers of Los Angeles, whose members voted Friday to reject what they called an unsafe return for the second-largest district in the nation. This week, the union slammed the reopening plan as “a recipe for propagating structural racism" by benefiting wealthier, whiter areas with lower infection rates.“This vote signals that in these most trying times, our members will not accept a rushed return that would endanger the safety of educators, students, and families,” union President Cecily Myart-Cruz said.While California businesses have opened and closed through the ups and downs of the pandemic, many school boards have not been willing to return students to classrooms as they have struggled with the costs to implement safety standards and negotiations with teachers unions.But as the rate of new coronavirus cases continues to fall and more people are getting vaccinated, politicians and parents have been pressuring districts to return to in-person learning before the end of the school year.The new law is California’s first attempt to do that on a statewide scale.Newsom signed it via Zoom, unintentionally mimicking how most of the state’s 6.1 million public school students have been learning for the past year. The irony was not lost on Newsom, who said the virtual ceremony was necessary to include officials scattered across the state. He highlighted the struggles he and lawmakers had in negotiating the plan.“When you look at 58 counties, a thousand-plus school districts, this truly is a challenge at a scale no other state in the country is faced with,” Newsom said.To be eligible for the money, most districts will have to offer in-person learning for all elementary school grades. But the law does not require a return to classrooms for most middle and high school students and does not mandate how long the students must be in classrooms.That's prompted fears that some districts could return students just one day per week and still be eligible for the money.OpenSchoolsCA, a parents’ group that has advocated for in-person schooling, called the legislation “another failed attempt" at reopening classrooms that won’t be enough to persuade many districts, especially in large cities.In San Diego, mother-of-two Liz Ingle is already fearful of what the fall will bring.“We’re all feeling like if we don’t get all of our kids on campus before the end of the year, the chance that they’re going to open in hybrid in fall is more likely,” Ingle said.She doubts the plan, which gives schools the option of opening or not, will compel districts to move any faster.“We’ve already seen that when they have choices they don’t move very quickly,” said Ingle, who plans to join one of several rallies next weekend to mark the anniversary of schools closing.The new law also sets aside $4.6 billion for all districts to help students catch up, 85% of which must be used for in-person learning.“We’re going to go home to our districts and beg all of our (school) districts to open up,” said Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat from San Francisco, where public schools have stayed closed despite one of the lowest Covid-19 rates in California.The San Francisco school board drew national scorn this year for focusing on renaming 44 schools it says honored racially insensitive figures, including Abraham Lincoln, rather than working to reopen classrooms. It has since paused the renaming.The foot-dragging prompted many parents to switch to private schools that are holding in-person classes or move out of the city.Melissa Nemer, a San Francisco mother of two, plans to move to a suburb this summer. She has watched relatives in New York City, Denver and the Minnesota suburbs send kids back to school as hers remain stuck in distance learning.“There are no dates for reopening, there is no timeline, there’s nothing,” Nemer said. “Enough is enough."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-california-law-aims-to-put-kids-in-class-will-it-work-101615007890917.html

06-03-2021||World||China abandons 24-year experiment with open Hong Kong elections||For almost a quarter of a century, Hong Kong stood as the one place under Beijing’s rule with open elections. A landslide loss just over a year ago may have finally convinced China to end the experiment in democracy.In late 2019, Hong Kong’s democratic opposition rode the momentum of historic protests to win an unprecedented 85% of the seats on local district councils. More significantly, the victory gave them scores more votes on the 1,200-member committee that selects Hong Kong’s leader -- making it harder for Beijing to guarantee a loyal replacement if Chief Executive Carrie Lam left office.On Friday, China laid out sweeping plans to prevent similar surprises in future Hong Kong elections, requiring candidates for office to be “patriots” and reportedly removing district councilors from the next leadership vote. The proposal, which lawmakers in Beijing are expected to pass within days, signals a dramatic rejection of the democratic institutions China had tolerated in the former British colony since regaining sovereignty in 1997.When the next election will even happen is unclear. Local media including the South China Morning Post reported that authorities would delay a vote to choose members of the city’s 70-seat Legislative Council until September 2022, after postponing it last year, ostensibly due to the coronavirus pandemic.“The Chinese authorities have reached the limit of their patience, and they’ll no longer accept an effective pro-democracy movement,” said Joseph Cheng, a democracy activist and former political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong who relocated to Australia last year. “They’ll no longer accept any serious checks and balances.”The election overhaul is just the latest effort by Beijing to remake Hong Kong after the 2019 unrest, which saw as many as two million protesters join peaceful marches and increasingly radical pro-independence demonstrators clash with police. The National People’s Congress imposed a sweeping security law on the city last year, leading to the arrest of some 100 opposition figures and activists, prompting sanctions from the US.Despite US. and UK claims that China is violating its treaty commitments to maintain Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” until 2047, President Xi Jinping has pushed to tighten control. The campaign illustrates the challenge China poses to President Joe Biden’s pledge to work with American allies to check the global erosion of democratic institutions.State Department spokesman Ned Price on Friday called the proposed election changes a “direct attack” on Hong Kong’s freedoms.“If implemented, these measures would drastically undermine Hong Kong’s democratic institutions,” Price told reporters.Senior Chinese lawmaker Wang Chen told NPC deputies Friday that the election changes were necessary to prevent “anti-China forces” from “seizing the Legislative Council and seizing the jurisdiction over Hong Kong.” Lam, who was appointed by China, pledged in a statement to carry out the overhaul to make sure the government’s critics don’t “harm Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.”The official Xinhua News Agency on Saturday said effective measures must be taken to “plug loopholes” and “eliminate shortcomings” in Hong Kong’s electoral system. Over the years, anti-China forces have used these loopholes to seek to seize the city’s governance and endanger national security, it said in a commentary.Hong Kong democracy has always sat on shaky ground, with the British colonial government only allowing the first direct Legislative Council elections in the last days of its rule in 1997. When China took over, they rolled back the last democratic reforms by outgoing Governor Chris Patten and implemented a system to ensure that his Chinese successors were Beijing loyalists.China allowed the experiment to continue for two decades, agreeing in 2010 to allow a majority of legislative seats to be directly elected and carrying out talks for an eventual public vote for chief executive. Still, seats were distributed in the government’s favor, meaning pro-democracy candidates never won a majority even though they routinely got more than half of the vote.The landslide district elections in November 2019 showed that the opposition had finally built an organization that could overcome Beijing’s advantages at the ballot box. In the months ahead, opposition leaders set their sights on a bigger prize: the Legislative Council. They crafted a plan they called “35-plus” to win a majority and vote down Lam’s budget, forcing her to resign.The plan clearly alarmed Beijing. Authorities announced that they would delay the September election for a year. Then, earlier this week the government charged 47 organizers and participants in a primary to select legislative candidates with “conspiracy to commit subversion” under the security law, allegations that carry a sentence as long as life in prison. Most of the group were jailed without bail ahead of a trial.“Beijing is so fearful of Hong Kong people that it is not enough to arrest and deny bail to those who participated in the 35-plus campaign,” said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of the department of political science at the University of Notre Dame. “It wants to make sure that it can control all future elections.”Under China’s plan, the committee that selects the chief executive would be “adjusted and improved,” replacing opposition district councilors with officials picked by the Communist Party. Beijing is also seeking to eliminate five citywide “superseats” on the Legislative Council, which were the only ones that could be voted on by all 7.5 million people, Now TV reported.Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer on Hong Kong politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the city would likely to return to a period resembling the 1970s, when residents engaged in less formal “pressure group politics” to influence the colonial government.“In the past two or three decades, we’ve had opposition politics,” Choy said. “But in the future we may not have these kind of politics, because democrats may be excluded from parties and even the legislature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-abandons-24-year-experiment-with-open-hong-kong-elections-101615007306113.html

But under the Senate bill, the phaseout stops at $80,000.Under the House bill, the cash payment for married couples phased out between $150,000 and $200,000. But under the Senate bill, the phaseout stops at $160,000.Most Americans will still be getting the full amount under either bill. The median household income was $68,703 in 2019, according to the US Census Bureau.Roughly 8 million fewer households will get a check under the Senate bill compared with what the House passed, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Centre.$15 MINIMUM WAGE REMOVEDThe Senate bill does not include an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025.The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the minimum wage increase violated strict budget rules limiting what can be included in a package that can be passed with 51 votes rather than the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster.MONEY FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTSThe Senate bill also provides $350 billion for state and local governments but adds the stipulation that the money can only cover costs incurred by the end of 2024. The Senate bill also prohibits states from using the money to offset tax cuts, nor can it be used to shore up a pension fund. The bill also requires that small states get at least the amount they received under virus legislation that Congress passed last March. Lawmakers are looking to focus the money on covering costs and revenue shortfalls arising from the pandemic.MORE MONEY FOR HOSPITALSHospital trade groups lobbied senators to tack on more money for hospitals to help maintain sufficient staffing and purchase personal protective equipment while caring for large numbers of critically ill patients.The Senate bill adds $8.5 billion for rural providers for Covid-19 relief.AID FOR THE JOBLESSThe House bill extended federal unemployment benefits until Aug. 29 and increased that aid to $400 a week. That’s on top of what beneficiaries are getting through their state unemployment insurance program.The Senate bill would extend the enhanced unemployment benefits through Sept. 6 at $300 a week. Also, the first $10,200 of benefits would non-taxable. The provision applies to households with incomes under $150,000.HEALTH INSURANCE HELPWorkers who lose their job can remain on their company’s health plan for up to 18 months under a law known as COBRA, but they typically must pay the full monthly premium.The House bill temporarily subsidized 85% of the insurance premiums, which can be expensive. The Senate bill will include a 100% subsidy of COBRA health insurance premiums to ensure that the laid-off workers can remain on their employer health plans at no cost through the end of September.OTHER WINNERSAmtrak would get an additional $200 million on top of the $1.5 billion in the House bill. There’s also an additional $510 million for homeless services under the Federal Emergency Management Agency and $175 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. All Covid-19 student loan relief would be tax-free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-come-out-with-own-version-of-1-9-trillion-covid-19-relief-bill-101615003113080.html

I was going to the restaurant but ran back when the blast shook and covered the area with smoke," resident Ahmed Abdullahi, who lives near the site, told Reuters.Somalia's state-controlled Radio Mogadishu reported there was also destruction of property and that police had cordoned off the area.No one claimed responsibility for the blast.Islamist group al Shabaab frequently carries out such bombings in Somalia and elsewhere as part of its campaign to topple the Horn of African country's central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-20-killed-30-wounded-by-suicide-car-bomb-in-somalia-capital-101614993176175.html
06-03-2021||World||Democrats split on jobless benefits slows Covid relief bill in Senate||Democrats set aside one battle over boosting the minimum wage but promptly descended into another internal fight Friday as the party haltingly tried moving its $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill through the Senate.Hours after asserting they’d reached a deal between party moderates and progressives over renewing emergency jobless benefits, lawmakers said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was apparently ready to support a less generous Republican version. Work on the Senate floor ceased for over eight hours as Democrats sought a way to salvage their unemployment provision.Manchin is probably the chamber’s most conservative Democrat, and a kingmaker in a 50-50 Senate that leaves his party without a vote to spare. With Democrats’ slim majorities — they have a mere 10-vote House edge — the party needs his vote but can’t tilt too far center without losing progressive support.The episode tossed fresh complications into the Democrats’ drive to give quick approval to a relief bill that is President Joe Biden’s top legislative goal. And while they still seemed likely to pass the package, the problem underscored the headaches confronting party leaders over the next two years as they try moving their agenda through Congress with such slender margins.“People in the country are hurting right now, with less than two weeks from enhanced unemployment checks being cut,” Biden said at the White House, referring to the March 14 end to the current round of emergency jobless benefits. He called his bill a “clearly necessary lifeline for getting the upper hand" against the pandemic.The relief legislation, aimed at battling the killer virus and nursing the staggered economy back to health, will provide direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans. There’s also money for Covid-19 vaccines and testing, aid to state and local governments, help for schools and the airline industry, tax breaks for lower-earners and families with children, and subsidies for health insurance.The package faces a solid wall of GOP opposition, and Republicans used the unemployment impasse to accuse Biden of refusing to seek compromise with them.“You could pick up the phone and end this right now," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of Biden.The standoff and a host of eleventh-hour deals Democratic leaders were cutting with rank-and-file lawmakers reflected the delicate challenge of navigating the precariously divided chamber.The House version of the massive relief package provides $400 weekly emergency unemployment benefits — on top of regular state payments — through August.In a compromise with moderates revealed earlier Friday, Senate Democrats said that would be reduced to $300 weekly but extended until early October. The plan, sponsored by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., would also reduce taxes on unemployment benefits.Later, lawmakers said Manchin was backing an alternative by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, that would provide $300 weekly benefits until mid-July.“I don’t know where he is,” No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois, said of Manchin’s latest stance on jobless benefits. Asked if Democrats could simply accept the GOP’s version, Durbin said: “We don’t want to. We want to get this wrapped up.”That was a nod to Democrats' need to move the overall relief bill once again through the House, which has a large numbers of liberals. It approved an initial version of the legislation last weekend, which the Senate has since changed.Manchin has been a leading voice among moderates trying to rein the relief bill’s costs. Democratic leaders were trying to reach some agreement with Manchin, and his office did not return requests for comment.“I feel bad for Joe Manchin. I hope the Geneva Convention applies to him,” No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters about the pressure on the West Virginian.Before the unemployment benefits drama began, senators voted 58-42 to kill a top progressive priority, a gradual increase in the current $7.25 hourly minimum wage to $15 over five years.Eight Democrats voted against the proposal, suggesting that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other progressives vowing to continue the effort in coming months will face a difficult fight.But eight hours after that minimum wage roll call began, it still hadn’t been formally gaveled to a close as all Senate work ceased while Democrats struggled to resolve their unemployment benefits problem.The next step would be a mountain of amendments, mostly by GOP opponents, virtually all destined to fail but designed to force Democrats to take politically awkward votes.Republicans say the overall bill is a liberal spend-fest that ignores that growing numbers of vaccinations and signs of a stirring economy suggest that the twin crises are easing.“Our country is already set for a roaring recovery," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in part citing an unexpectedly strong report on job creation. “Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning.”Democrats reject that, citing the 10 million jobs the economy has lost during the pandemic and numerous people still struggling to buy food and pay rent.“If you just look at a big number you say, ‘Oh, everything's getting a little better,'" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “It's not for the lower half of America. It's not."In an encouraging sign for Biden, a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 70% of Americans support his handling of the pandemic, including a noteworthy 44% of Republicans.Friday's gridlock over unemployment benefits gridlock wasn't the first delay. On Thursday Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., forced the chamber's clerks to read aloud the entire 628-page relief bill, an exhausting task that took staffers 10 hours and 44 minutes and ended shortly after 2 a.m. EST.Democrats made a host of other late changes to the bill, designed to nail down support. They ranged from extra money for food programs and federal subsidies for health care for workers who lose jobs to funds for rural health care and language assuring minimum amounts of money for smaller states.In another late bargain that satisfied moderates, Biden and Senate Democrats agreed Wednesday to make some higher earners ineligible for the direct checks to individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-split-on-jobless-benefits-slows-covid-relief-bill-in-senate-101614991210354.html

The new notification allowed both burials and cremations.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"Today we buried two of them and there will be five more to be buried,” Silva told reporters.He said the burials were allowed as per the guidelines for burials issued by the Director General Health Services on Thursday.The government did not allow burials for almost a year despite protests from the country's Muslim and Christian religious minorities.The policy was also condemned by international rights groups who urged the government to follow the guidelines on Covid-19 dead bodies issued by the WHO, which recommended both cremations and burials.The government allowed burials late last month. However, the implementation was held back until the health authorities issued guidelines.The government's designated burial site at Iranathivu islet in the north eastern region faced opposition from the residents.On Friday, two Muslim-dominated local councils in the eastern region had come forward to provide a burial site and accordingly the two bodies were buried in the Ottamavadi area in the eastern Batticaloa district.When the Iranathivu residents protested against burying the Covid-19 dead there, the government said they were also looking for alternative sites.The Muslim and Tamil minority political parties had decried the government's forced cremation policy against the Muslim religious funeral rites as racist.However, the government maintained that burials of victims could endanger the water table.For 10 months, the Muslim and Christian minorities in the country and international rights groups lobbied the government to end the policy of forced cremations.The cremation of bodies is forbidden in Islam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-buries-first-covid-19-victims-after-long-standoff-101614990387197.html

But Lau Siu-kai, a senior adviser to the Chinese leadership on Hong Kong policy, has said the new approach is likely to call for the creation of a government agency to vet every candidate running not only for chief executive but for the legislature and other levels of office, including neighbourhood representatives.The New York Times reported that the strategy will further concentrate power in the hands of the Communist Party in Hong Kong and decimate the political hopes of the territory's already beleaguered opposition for years to come.The new reforms come months after China passed the nationals security law to quash the resistance to its rule in Hong Kong.The electoral restrictions would be likely to further smother the opposition, which has been battered by arrests and detentions since Beijing imposed the security law in June.On Sunday, in the most forceful use of the security law so far, the police charged 47 of Hong Kong's most prominent democracy advocates with conspiracy to commit subversion after they organised an election primary in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-condemns-china-s-move-to-alter-hong-kong-s-electoral-system-calls-it-direct-attack-on-autonomy-101614989309784.html

Mo Brooks, a congressman from Alabama, all spoke at a rally which preceded the January 6 attack on Congress by Trump supporters seeking to block the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's election victory."Unable to accept defeat, Donald Trump waged an all out war on a peaceful transition of power," Swalwell said in a statement announcing the lawsuit."He lied to his followers again and again claiming the election was stolen," the congressman said, "and finally called upon his supporters to descend on Washington DC to 'stop the steal.'""The defendants assembled, inflamed and incited the mob, and as such are wholly responsible for the injury and destruction that followed," Swalwell said.The suit demanded unspecified monetary and punitive damages to be determined at a jury trial.Swalwell was one of the impeachment managers for Trump's trial in the Senate on the charge of inciting insurrection.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives for his role in inciting the attack on the Capitol but acquitted by the Senate.Thompson and the NAACP, a civil rights organization, filed suit against Trump, Giuliani and two right-wing groups, the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, last month.Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, responded to the latest lawsuit in a statement to The Washington Post. "Eric Swalwell is a low-life with no credibility," Miller said.Trump State Dept appointee arrestedMore than 300 people have been arrested so far for their role in the storming of the Capitol, which left at least five people dead.Among the latest arrests was Federico Guillermo Klein, 42, a Trump appointee to a low-level State Department job.Klein, who resigned from the State Department on January 19, a day before Trump left office, was arrested by the FBI on Thursday after a review of video of the Capitol attack.In a criminal complaint obtained by The New York Times, an FBI special agent said Klein, wearing a red "Make America Great Again" hat, is seen assaulting police officers with a riot shield.According to the complaint, Klein worked at the State Department since 2017 on Brazilian and other Latin American affairs and had a Top Secret clearance.He is believed to be the first member of the former Trump administration to directly charged in connection with the ransacking of the Capitol.Klein faces multiple charges including assaulting police officers, obstructing an official proceeding and disorderly conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-another-lawsuit-over-us-capitol-attack-101614988315763.html

During a news conference Friday, Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, shared photos of its tracks over and around small rocks.“I don't think I've ever been happier to see wheel tracks and I've seen a lot of them," said engineer Anais Zarifian.Flight controllers are still checking all of Perseverance's systems. So far, everything is looking good. The rover's 7-foot (2-meter) robot arm, for instance, flexed its muscles for the first time Tuesday.Before the car-size rover can head for an ancient river delta to collect rocks for eventual return to Earth, it must drop its so-called protective “belly pan” and release an experimental helicopter named Ingenuity.As it turns out, Perseverance landed right on the edge of a potential helicopter landing strip — a nice, flat spot, according to Rieber. So the plan is to drive out of this landing strip, ditch the pan, then return for Ingenuity's highly anticipated test flight. All this should be accomplished by late spring.Scientists are debating whether to take the smoother route to get to the nearby delta or a possibly tougher way with intriguing remnants from that once-watery time 3 billion to 4 billion years ago.Perseverance — Nasa's biggest and most elaborate rover yet — became the ninth U.S. spacecraft to successfully land on Mars on Feb. 18. China hopes to land its smaller rover — currently orbiting the red planet — in another few months.Nasa scientists, meanwhile, announced Friday that they’ve named Perseverance’s touchdown site in honor of the late science fiction writer Octavia E. Butler, who grew up next door to JPL in Pasadena. She was one of the first African Americans to receive mainstream attention for science fiction. Her works included “Bloodchild and Other Stories” and “Parable of the Sower.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-new-mars-rover-hits-dusty-red-road-21-feet-in-first-test-drive-101614987769910.html

Police opened fire and one man was killed, witnesses and a doctor told Reuters.On Thursday, police broke up rallies with tear gas and gunfire in several cities but their crackdown was more restrained than on Wednesday, when the UN said 38 people were killed in the bloodiest day of protests. At least 55 people have been killed since the February 1 coup.Condemnation of the coup and subsequent violence has come largely from the West.

06-03-2021||World||Pandemic origin: WHO to publish report on Mar 15||The international investigation into the Covid-19 pandemic’s origins in China will publish its report in the week of March 15, the World Health Organization’s chief has said.The report was originally due to be published in two stages: an initial summary in February followed by the full text. However, they will both now be released at the same time, said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“I know that many member states are eager to see the report of the joint WHO-led study on the origins of the Sars-CoV-2 virus -- and of course so am I,” Tedros said in a speech to the UN health agency’s member countries on Thursday.“The team is working on its final report as well as an accompanying summary report, which we understand will be issued simultaneously in the week of the 15th of March.Rest assured that when the reports are ready, we will ask the expert team to share the reports with member states ahead of their release, and to brief you on the findings.” The first Covid-19 cases were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. The international investigation in the city only began in January 2021 and wrapped up last month. A team of international scientific experts spent four weeks in Wuhan visiting sites linked to early cases.Demand for new probeThe controversy over the investigation organised by the World Health Organization and China about the origins of Covid-19 heated up as a group of scientists called for an independent probe to consider all hypotheses and nail down whether the virus came from an animal.A group of more than 20 signatories said in an open letter published by the Wall Street Journal that the existing mission isn’t independent enough and demanded a new probe to consider all possibilities over the origin.Half of the joint team are Chinese citizens whose scientific independence may be limited, they said.Experts believe the disease originated in bats and could have been transmitted to humans via another mammal.Although the mission to Wuhan failed to identify the source of the virus, the experts were dismissive of the theory that it leaked from a virology laboratory in the city at a press conference before leaving China.However, when the team leadership returned to Geneva, Tedros said that, “all hypotheses remain open”.The WHO has faced criticism since the outbreak of the pandemic that it has been too deferential to China. Former US President Donald Trump advanced the theory that the virus might have escaped from a high-security virology lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus was first detected.The mission followed months of negotiation with China. Stung by criticism that they initially covered up the extent of the crisis, Chinese state media and officials have promoted the theory that the virus didn’t start in the country, but was brought in.The scientists who signed the open letter included the lab scenario among the possibilities. Signatories include Steven Quay, chief executive officer at Atossa Therapeutics Inc., which develops treatments for breast cancer and Covid-19, while Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, co-organised the letter.None of the signatories were members of the WHO-backed mission. China’s foreign ministry said Friday there had been top Chinese experts on the team that went to Wuhan to look into the virus’s origins, and that China hoped other nations could cooperate on similar inquiries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-origin-who-to-publish-report-on-mar-15-101614973967474.html
06-03-2021||India||SSR drug case: NCB files charge sheet, names Rhea Chakraborty, others as accused||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Friday filed a 11,700-page charge sheet before a special court under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in connection with the drug case that the agency probed in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput (SSR).The charge sheet names in 33 accused, including Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, and Kshitij Ravi Prasad, a former executive producer of Dharma Productions. So far, 25 of the accused have been released by various courts on bail, whereas the remaining eight are still behind bars, said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB.NCB recovered six kgs of contraband from some of the accused and also seized ₹35 lakh in Indian and foreign currency. Also Read | Sushant’s sister Shweta says she’s ‘falling into an abyss’ waiting for closureThe agency in the charge sheet has reiterated its stand that Chakraborty and Showik were actively involved in procuring and financing narcotic substances for Rajput, and invoked charges of financing and harbouring an offender under the NDPS Act against the siblings. Some others are also accused of being part of drug distribution channel.The central agency has listed statements of around 160 witnesses in its endeavour to prove the case. It has also submitted supporting documents, voice messages and chats exchanged by and between the accused. These statements would be corroborated with other evidence such as chats, messages and bank transactions, said an NCB officer.An NCB officer said statements of actors Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor also form part of the charge sheet, but their names do not appear in the list of witnesses cited by the agency.The agency has added relevant portions of chat of Chakraborty, Showik, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant; indicating that Chakrborty and Showik were actively involved in procurement of narcotic substances, for which payments were mostly done by Chakraborty.Miranda has, in his statement to NCB, said that in the first week of November 2019, he contacted Karamjeet Singh Anand for marijuana and told him to deliver the contraband to Prim Rose, Juhu. He paid Anand ₹2,500 in cash for one packet of weed and gave it to Showik Chakraborty.In the last week of November 2019, he again gave a packet of ganja to Showik. Payment for both the consignments was made from Sushant Singh Rajput’s fund. He further disclosed that he had told Anand to deliver two packets of weed for SSR and the same were delivered in the fourth week of January 2020.Miranda also said that on March 17 last year, acting on the directions of SSR, Suryadeep and Showik told him to buy ganja from Zaid Vilatra and Suryadeep forwarded Vilatra’s contact through WhatsApp and also handed over Rhea Chakraborty’s ATM card to withdraw ₹10,000.NCB has claimed that in last week of November 2019, the delivery of drugs was made at Chakraborty’s residence with her consent. “Thus Chakraborty facilitated her house to Rajput for consumption of drugs and this is a violation of the provisions of NDPS Act,” said an officer.The probing agency has also claimed that Chakraborty took delivery of drugs at her residence, thus drugs were stored at her house. Hence NCB states that Rhea has facilitated a channel of supply of drugs with the help of her brother Showik.The NCB started the probe in drugs-related aspects of Rajput’s death after the Enforcement Directorate stumbled upon WhatsApp chats disclosing drug procurement and consumption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ssr-drug-case-ncb-files-charge-sheet-names-rhea-chakraborty-others-as-accused-101614929935845.html

06-03-2021||India||Union minister proposes collection drive for beautification of Jagannath Temple||Wary of the Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal walking away with all the credit of beautification of major temples like the Jagannath Temple in Puri, the opposition BJP in Odisha now proposes to start a fund collection drive for the 12th century iconic temple on the lines of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.In a letter to Puri king Gajapati Dibya Singha Deb, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan urged him to launch and lead a mass fund collection drive to enable contribution by crores of devotees of Lord Jagannath and Odias all over the world for the development of the ₹3200 crore Jagannath Temple heritage corridor.“The drive should be transformed into a revolution in which all the Hindus across the globe would get a chance to serve Lord Jagannath both physically and through donation for the development of the 12th century shrine,” wrote Pradhan, drawing parallel to similar efforts for the proposed Ram Temple in Ayodhya town of Uttar Pradesh. He also assured the Centre’s help in waiving off income tax on the funds from the devotees in the country as well as abroad. Besides, several banks will come forward to extend their help in this regard,” he said.Last week, the 45-day-long nationwide Ram Temple Nidhi Samarpan campaign managed to collect nearly ₹2100 crore for the construction of Ram Mandir, at least ₹1000 crore more than what the fundraisers had estimated initially.Pradhan, who recently donated ₹1 lakh to the Jagannath Temple, requested the Gajapati to act like a bridge between the Centre and state for smooth operation of the fund collection drive. Pradhan's appeal to the Puri king came a day ahead of BJP's Bhubaneswar MP Aparajita Sarangi taking out a heritage walk through the old town area of the city dotted by numerous heritage temples demanding that the state government should not bulldoze and demolish heritage structures in the periphery of monuments during beautification drives.Sarangi, who last week wrote a long letter to chief minister Naveen Patnaik seeking answers on why the state administration bulldozed several heritage mutts around Jagannath Temple over the last 2 years, said people in Puri are aghast that mutts associated with the most revered saints have been razed to the ground in Puri.“People are left with a sense of disbelief that Mathas/heritage monuments which were so closely associated with our religious belief system, integral to the daily and special rituals of Lord Jagannath, have been demolished,” she said.Political analysts said Pradhan's letter to the Puri king and the Bhubaneswar MP's heritage walk is a clever attempt by the BJP not to allow BJD to walk away with all the credit on the temple front.“BJP does not want to be seen as opposing the beautification drive of temples. Pradhan through his letter to the Puri king wants to ensure that BJP remains a part of the temple beautification drive. In a deeply religious state like Odisha, BJP is acutely aware of the importance of the temple card. While the NMA draft bylaws on heritage temples put a brake on the BJD's plan, it wants to endear itself to the Odia people through a fund collection drive for Jagannath Temple,” said political analyst Rabi Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-proposes-collection-drive-for-beautification-of-jagannath-temple-101615053421492.html

06-03-2021||India||Need to develop military into ‘future force’: PM Modi at top commanders’ meet||Addressing the country’s top military leadership in Kevadia, Gujarat on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the need to develop the Indian military into a “future force” in the backdrop of the swiftly changing technological landscape, break down civil-military silos and expedite decision making, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement.Speaking on the concluding day of the Combined Commanders’ Conference at Kevadia in Gujarat, the PM asked the three services to rid themselves of legacy systems and practices that are no longer relevant. He also appreciated the “resolute dedication” shown by the armed forces over the past year while dealing with the challenging situation on the northern border and also the Covid-19 pandemic.Issues discussed during the conference included a review of the country’s security situation at a time when India’s borders with China and Pakistan are in focus, the military’s operational readiness, the ongoing theaterisation plans and aspects related to modernisation and indigenisation, officials familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named.Chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat briefed the PM about the discussions that took place during the three-day conference.The PM stressed the importance of enhancing indigenisation in the national security system, not just in sourcing equipment and weapons but also in doctrines, procedures and customs, the statement said. The PM also told the top commanders to optimise manpower planning in both military and civilian parts of the national security architecture.“The Combined Commanders’ Conference at Kevadia was a fruitful one. There were extensive deliberations on various strategic subjects. Highlighted the need for making India Aatmanirbhar in the defence sector and reiterated the Government’s support for it,” the PM tweeted.The PM’s remarks during the top conference are extremely relevant in terms of how the military must develop going forward, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). The focus on technology, rethinking reliance on legacy systems, and indigenisation is absolutely vital, he said.“The PM’s call for a review of civil-military structures is also addressing an area that has hobbled a cohesive national approach to strategic planning. The one area I would be cautious about is the message to indigenise procedures and customs followed by the armed forces. Current military customs and traditions have created a powerful ethos in our military that does not need any unnecessary tinkering,” Hooda said.The conference was held at a time when India and China are negotiating disengagement in eastern Ladakh and the military is putting finishing touches to its theaterisation plan. It also comes on the back of Indian and Pakistani militaries announcing that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the Line of Control from the midnight of February 24.The scope of the conference was expanded this year to make it “a multi-layered, interactive and informal event”, with the added participation of 30 officers and soldiers of various ranks from the three services. Middle-rung officers, junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) took part in the conference for the first time.The prime minister appreciated the inclusion of the JCOs and the NCOs in this year's conference.The military’s theaterisation was one of the key topics discussed at the conference, HT has learnt. On the eve of the conference on March 4, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat said India’s military leadership will have to more than match the political vision that has mandated the creation of theatre commands. He said service parochialism will have to make way for a combined services outlook to take theaterisation forward.The Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command are set to be launched by May. India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts - these will be rolled out by December 2022. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.The conference was attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, the CDS, the three service chiefs, secretary-ranked officers from the defence ministry and top military officials.The conference was traditionally held in Delhi till 2014. In the past, it has been held on India’s solitary aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Indian Military Academy, Dehradun and Air Force Station, Jodhpur.Noting that the country will be celebrating 75 years of its independence next year, the PM asked the military brass to use the occasion to undertake activities that inspire the country’s youth. He also said “brave veterans” should also be involved in the celebrations.“Every Indian is very proud of our armed forces. Their courage is remarkable. Urged the armed forces to think about various reforms that would make the forces even stronger. Also discussed ways to integrate brave veterans in the celebrations to mark 75 years of Independence,” the prime minister said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-develop-military-into-future-force-pm-modi-101615052575231.html

The desk is the world's first-ever help desk for that community, a press release claimed. Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanar, who inaugurated the desk, said it is a historic day as the community has suffered through their life due to discrimination. "We get hurt for small things that happen occasionally. But the transgender community has been suffering discrimination all through their life. The help desk is a small step towards a great journey. It will herald a huge difference," the release quoted him as saying. Noting that the idea of the help desk came from the community itself during a meeting 10 days back, he said the entire credit for the initiative must go to the community. The police are only facilitating it, he said. Among others, the desk would work towards inclusiveness of the community facilitating their journey towards a dignified life, he said. The desk was set up by Cyberabad Commissionerate in collaboration with Society for Cyberabad Security Council and Prajwala (NGO), the release said. According to the release, the desk would be managed by a police liaison officer and a transgender person who is designated as the community coordinator. The desk would be the focal point for grievance redressal among the community in the Commissionerate. The desk would provide support to file cases in offences related to violence or discrimination. Among other services, the desk would provide counselling, legal aid, life-skills, soft skills training, job placements, and referral linkages to welfare schemes in partnership with the Department of Women and Child Welfare and District Legal Services Authority, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transgender-help-desk-set-up-at-police-station-in-hyderabad-101615051867115.html

06-03-2021||India||As farmers protest completes 100 days, Cong says ‘100 days of BJP's arrogance’||As the farmers' protest against the Centre's new farm laws completed 100 days, the Congress on Saturday said the period was a "black chapter" in India's democracy for the treatment meted out to the protesters and also marked 100 days of the ruling BJP's "arrogance".Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at the Centre over the farmers' protest and said nails were laid at Delhi's borders for those, whose sons risk their lives at the country's borders.His attack came after the farmers' agitation completed 100 days with the protesting union leaders asserting that their movement is far from over and they are "going strong".In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said, "Whose sons risk their lives at the country's borders, for them nails have been laid at the borders of Delhi. 'Annadaatas' demand their rights, government commits atrocities."Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three new farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The government has denied allegations that it is trying to put an end to the MSP and the "mandi" (wholesale market) systems through the new laws. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also assured the farmers that the MSP system would continue.Farmer leaders have made it clear that they would not settle for anything less than a repeal of the new agriculture laws.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the Centre in a tweet in Hindi.She said, "100 days of farmers' struggle, of fight for rights, of respect for 'annadaatas', of the path shown by Gandhiji, Sardar (Vallabhbhai) Patel, Nehruji, (Lal Bahadur) Shastriji, Shaheed Bhagat Singh."With the hashtag '100DaysOfBJParrogance', she said, "100 days of BJP government's arrogance, of assault on farmers, of lies and scorn for farmers."Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the defeat of the BJP in the upcoming assembly elections in four states Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam, and and Union Territory Puducherry will lead to the victory of the farmers."The Modi government is blinded by the arrogance of its majority. It sees nothing but selfish power. Democracy is run in a 'public' way, not 'arbitrary way'," he said.The defeat of the Modi government in these states will open the way for the farmers getting minimum support price and the withdrawal of "anti-farmer black laws", Surjewala said in a statement."Let us pave the way for 'BJP's defeat' and 'victory of the country'," he said.The BJP government has crossed all limits of "cruelty and barbarity" in dealing with the protesting farmers in these last 100 days, Surjewala alleged."Farmers were hit by water cannons in the bitter cold, roads were dug, sticks were used on them, tear gas shells were fired. Not only this, attempts were made to book them under the anti-terrorism laws and even spikes of nails and thorns were put in their way," he said.The farmers tried their best to resolve the issue through talks but the government having an approach of 'Hum Do, Humare Do' paid no heed to their pleas, the Congress leader said.He alleged that the Modi government is aware that the three laws will "destroy" the mandi system, farmers will not get MSP and their lands will be "usurped", but it is only interested in helping its crony capitalist friends.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the protesting farmers have been braving all odds -- of nature and the might of the State -- for the last 100 days."They have braved all kinds of insults heaped upon them by the government and pro-government media. Today, what we are witnessing is an attempt to wipe out the narrative of the farmers, to wipe out the narrative of their protest from the media," he alleged at a press conference here."Each one of us, whichever category we may belong to, have our own struggles and that is the awareness on which the government depends," Khera said.There is one section of the society that has found time to come out and protest -- farmers -- against these "black laws" and they are "our voice", he added."The country has seen through this government's efforts for headline management...a cornered regime is there and how it will react now is for us to wait and watch," the Congress leader said."The farmers have called this day a black day. We think this is a black chapter in our democracy, where everything was done to disrupt this peaceful protest. They (farmers) were demonised, all kinds of conspiracies were hatched against them, but they stayed on," he added.The Congress demands that the three new farm laws should immediately be repealed, Khera said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-farmers-protest-completes-100-days-cong-says-100-days-of-bjp-s-arrogance-101615050572330.html
06-03-2021||India||Supreme Court to begin limited physical hearing on trial basis from March 15||The Supreme Court will begin limited physical hearing of old/regular matters on three days in a week beginning March 15 where lawyers will have the option to either appear in person or argue through videoconferencing.A circular was issued in this regard by the Supreme Court Secretary General on March 6 stating that the hearing of cases through the hybrid mode is a pilot scheme carried out on an experimental basis following requests to restart physical hearing of cases received from Bar Associations. Even a Committee of Judges of the Supreme Court comprising the top seven senior most judges had held wide-ranging consultation with lawyer bodies and recommended to start limited physical hearing in August last year. Lawyers were asked for consent but only three to four lawyers consented which led to the plan being junked.In January this year, Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde ruled out any reopening of courts for the present. Sitting in a three-judge bench composition, CJI remarked, “We have received medical advice from medical authorities that it is dangerous for people to congregate at this time. If physical courts are started, the number of fatalities will increase.”The present circular issued by SC Secretary General said, “As a pilot scheme, the final hearing/regular matters listed on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays may be heard in the hybrid mode, as may be decided by the Hon’ble Bench, considering the number of parties in a matter as well as the limited capacity of the Court rooms.” All other matters, including fresh matters listed on Mondays and Fridays shall continue to be heard through video/tele-conferencing mode, the circular added.As per Covid-19 norms, only 20 people per courtroom will be granted entry. The lawyer or litigant appearing in person who wishes to appear through physical hearing will be required to give their option in advance, latest within 24 hours of the weekly list being published or by 1 pm the following day of the weekly list being out. The weekly list for the coming week is generally out by Friday of the previous week. In case the advocate/litigant makes no specific request for physical hearing by the stipulated time, it shall be presumed that counsels for the party seek to appear through video/teleconferencing mode.If the bench receives requests for physical hearing in a case where the number of lawyers are more than the average working capacity of 20 in a courtroom, the matter shall invariably be listed for hearing through videoconferencing. In a case listed for hybrid hearing, every party to the case will be allowed to have an arguing counsel, the advocate-on-record (one who files the case in Supreme Court), and a registered clerk to carry the files/books required during arguments.Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) President Shivaji Jadhav said, “Our demand was to begin full-fledged physical hearing of cases and not limited physical hearing. We are happy at least this has started. But consent from lawyers may not be forthcoming in cases where a stay is operating or where the client has defaulted on payment of fees. However, this was much needed as the litigants and lawyers were suffering a lot in the post-lockdown phase.”Entry into the courtroom for the physical hearing will require lawyers to make “special hearing passes” to be issued by the SC Registry. They will be permitted into the courtroom ten minutes prior to the beginning of their case. Till then they will be seated in the bar longue or library. After following the sanitization procedures, on entering the courtroom, the lawyers/litigants will be required to maintain minimum prescribed physical distancing norms by sitting on chairs at the earmarked places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-begin-limited-physical-hearing-on-trial-basis-from-march-15-101615048093301.html
06-03-2021||India||Nepal Police hand over body of Indian man killed in firing in Pilibhit||The body of the young man allegedly killed in firing by the Nepalese Police was handed over to Indian authorities after several rounds of talks following which his family performed the last rites here, officials said on Saturday.Govinda Singh, 24, was shot at Thursday in a village in Nepal near the India-Nepal border. His body was given late Friday night after a post-mortem examination by Nepalese authorities, said Pilibhit Superintendent of Police Jai Prakash Yadav.He said Nepalese officials were terming it a case of smuggling, but locals maintain the firing took place following a minor argument.Though authorities had initially said Nepalese Police had fired at three people, police said late Friday that the incident in a market in Nepal's Kanchanpur district involved four men, all in their 20s. They were from Bhumidan Raghavpuri Tilla Chaar village in Pilibhit and were working in a field near the border.While Govinda was killed, Gurmez Singh, 29, was injured and referred to Lucknow's King George's Medical University for treatment. Two of them, Resham, 22, and Pappu Singh, 27, managed to escape and were questioned at Pilibhit’s Kamlapuri guest house in the presence of senior officials.Nepalese officials had alleged that the four entered Nepal for the smuggling of narcotics. They also claimed to have recovered "brown sugar", a pistol and a machine used to print fake currency notes from Govinda Singh.According to SP Yadav, the body was handed over to Indian authorities on Friday after a post-mortem examination in Nepal and the family performed the last rites at night itself.He said several rounds of talks were held with Nepalese authorities on Friday and the administration has sent its report to the state government.The Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) has also sent a detailed report of the incident to the Union government, he said.Yadav refused to comment on the smuggling charge, saying it is part of the investigation.However, family members of the deceased termed the Nepalese Police's version of events unfounded and far from the truth.Gurdev Singh, Govinda Singh's uncle, told officials in Pilibhit that the four men had been working in a field between Pillar No. 38 and 39 adjacent to the Nepal border for the past 12 days. He alleged that the firing happened on the Indian side of the border and the Nepalese Police took the body with them. Nepalese Police fired at them after Govinda had an argument with them while going for work, he said.While the first shot was fired in the air, the second one hit Govinda, who fell on the spot and a third hit Gurmez Singh, according to the uncle. Resham and Pappu Singh managed to escape, Govinda's family claimed.Bareilly zone Additional Director General of Police Avinash Chandra said the statements of the family are being examined. Nepalese officials have also assured an impartial inquiry into the incident, he said.In view of the prevailing tension, patrolling has been intensified on the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-police-hand-over-body-of-indian-man-killed-in-firing-in-pilibhit-101615049353537.html
06-03-2021||India||AIADMK, DMK yet to close deal with key allies for Tamil Nadu assembly polls||The DMK on Saturday moved forward in its ongoing seat-sharing exercise with allies by giving six seats to MDMK though a deal with the Congress and CPI(M) was elusive, while the ruling AIADMK's negotiations with DMDK remained inconclusive. The MDMK would, however, contest on the rising sun symbol of its partner DMK according to the pact inked today by the leadership of both parties. This is the first time the MDMK would face the Tamil Nadu Assembly election together with the DMK since it was founded in 1994 after Vaiko was ousted from the then M Karunanidhi-led DMK. Vaiko, when asked if his party has given a list of preferred constituencies to DMK, said 'no.' On agreeing to contest on the 'rising sun' symbol, which is a 'change of heart,' he said it was due to practical reasons. The MDMK chief had previously said his party would contest on a separate symbol. A party would be allotted a single, common symbol by the Election Commission only if it contested from at least 12 constituencies and if not, there was a possibility of separate symbol in each of the six segments, he said. To avert such a scenario and considering practical aspects like less number of days to campaign, the party decided to contest on the rising sun symbol, he said. He hit out at the 'Sanathana forces,' a reference to the BJP, and praised Stalin as a very capable leader for the post of Chief Minister. The DMK has allotted 23 seats to allies. MDMK, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and CPI have got six each, the IUML three and Manithaneya Makkal Katchi two. After the second round of talks, CPI(M) state secretary K Balakrishnan said the number of seats indicated by the DMK for allocation to his party was not agreeable and hence they have conveyed their preference. He hoped for a resolution soon on seat sharing with DMK. Asked if his party could get more than the six seats earmarked by the Dravidian party for its ideological sibling CPI, he said there was no question of comparison with any other party. The Marxist party leader said negotiations with the DMK centred around the allocation for his party and not a word had been spoken by them on what was set part for others. The AIADMK allocated 20 seats to BJP succumbing to pressure from it, he alleged and compared the ruling party-led combine to a 'scrap' shop. While the Congress party held interviews for ticket aspirants here, there was no progress on finalising seat sharing with the DMK. Similarly, the AIADMK's negotiations with allies the DMDK and former Union Minister G K Vaasan led Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) were yet to reach the finalisation stage. An ally of the AIADMK, MLA Karunas-led Mukkulathor Pulippadai walked out of the alliance and vowed to work against the ruling combine in 84 constituencies where the Mukkalathor community held a sway. Kamal Haasan-led Makkal Needhi Maiam too held interviews for aspirants and indicated backchannel talks with the Congress party which appeared miffed with the offer of less number of seats (22) by the DMK. MNM's general secretary Kumaravel hinted at talks "at different levels," with the Congress and declined to elaborate. Seeman's Naam Tamizhar Katchi is going solo for the election. While the AIADMK concluded interviews for party ticket aspirants in a single day on Thursday, the DMK completed the exercise, which commenced on March 2, today. The ruling party late Friday night signed a pact with the BJP allotting it 20 Assembly seats and the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat. The saffron party has named its senior leader, Pon Radhakrishnan, also a former Union Minister as the candidate for the Kanyakumari bypoll, ahead of Union Home Minister Amit Shah's campaign there on Sunday. Stalin, after addressing a mega public meeting tomorrow at Tiruchirappalli, would resume campaign on March 12 from Salem, home to Chief Minister K Palaniswami and cover Dindigul and Madurai the next day. It is part of his sixth phase of 'Stalin in your constituency' campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-dmk-yet-to-close-deal-with-key-allies-for-tamil-nadu-assembly-polls-101615047373196.html

While hearing the oral submission made by the counsel, the bench observed that inter-state roads could not be blocked and added that the state government should abide by the Centre’s guidelines on inter-state travel, according to the report.The bench also said that the Karnataka government should facilitate an infrastructure to check the RT-PCR test reports of travellers arriving from Kerala at the border points rather than sealing them. “If you want to create infrastructure for checking of reports etc you can do it. Otherwise, you cannot simply keep the roads closed like this. Create infrastructure and allow,” it added.The Centre’s counsel said during the hearing that the government had not ordered for the closure of roads under its guidelines and roads would have to be kept open. “As far as testing is concerned that only district authorities can take a decision, there is no restriction for the movement of any person. The order issued is extended till March 31,” the counsel pointed out.Karnataka had sealed several roads and national highways with Kerala on February 22 after the former had seen the emergence of two Covid-19 clusters in Bengaluru. People from Kerala were only allowed entry after they produced a negative RT-PCR test report which was not older than 72 hours.In what was seen as an immediate response to this, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 23 and sought the Centre’s intervention on these new restrictions imposed. Vijayan mentioned that people, vehicles carrying essential goods and patients going for medical treatment faced ‘undue hardships’ at Karnataka’s borders due to these rules. He also said that the inter-state travel restrictions opted by states were contrary to those of the Centre. “I request your urgent intervention in this matter so that the hardship of people from Kerala travelling to the neighbouring state of Karnataka can be avoided,” the Kerala CM’s letter read.However, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar clarified that the state government had not restricted inter-state travel with Kerala. Attaching a copy of Vijayan’s letter to PM Modi and the Karnataka government’s circular, Sudhakar said, “However, as a precautionary measure, guidelines have been issued that travellers entering Karnataka from Kerala must mandatorily possess a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-modify-covid-travel-restrictions-with-kerala-k-taka-govt-to-hc-101615043850372.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his first dose at AIIMS on Monday morning. Those above 45 with comorbidities are also eligible but parliament doesn't keep a health record of its members.“For the welfare of Members of Parliament, a Covid-19 vaccination centre has been set up in Parliament House Medical Centre from March 9,” said an internal circular of the Lok Sabha.The vaccines would be administered on all working days by a trained healthcare worker.While the government is encouraging the targeted population to take the vaccines, the vaccination in the parliament complex would be entirely voluntary. Though the MPs have to undergo mandatory RTPCR tests to attend the session, the vaccination will be voluntary. Family members of the MPs too, will get vaccines.“2 vaccination centres have also been set up for the family members of MPs, one at CGHS Dispensary North Avenue and the other at CGHS Dispensary South Avenue. Members can undertake vaccination in their respective constituency also,” said the circular.According to parliamentary data, 36% Lok Sabha MPs are above 60 years of age. The Rajya Sabha, popularly called as the House of the Elders, naturally has more eligible candidates with 62% of its MPs above that age bracket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-centre-for-eligible-mps-set-up-inside-parliament-complex-101615040159813.html

Their dependents include spouses, sons (till the age of 25 or when they start earning, whichever is earlier), unmarried/divorced daughters, parents with a monthly income of less than ₹9,000 and special children for life.The number of dependents is around 2.3 million but only those who meet the eligibility criteria will be able to get the shots at service hospitals, said people familiar with ESM issues. The same applies to dependents of serving military personnel.Also read: Maharashtra reports over 10,000 Covid-19 cases for second consecutive dayCitizens above 60 years of age and those above 45 suffering from comorbidities are being covered during the current phase of vaccination.The vaccination drive for eligible veterans will kick off at service hospitals next week.“The process is likely to commence next week after the completion of registration of Armed Forces medical facilities on Co-WIN platform. Guidelines for the same will be issued in a few days,” the army said in another tweet.Some veterans - aged over 60 or 45 with comorbidities - have already got themselves vaccinated at government-approved centres after the drive for the general public began on March 1.Roughly 20,000 centres that are currently being used for the vaccine drive are hospitals, private as well as public, while many primary and secondary health centres at present are kept out of the programme.The government is planning to more than double the number of vaccination centres and reach deeper into rural parts of the country, as reported by Hindustan Times on Saturday.Government data shows 1.4 million doses were administered on Thursday, a record for the country, but a breakdown shows only about half of this number (700,000) was of people from the general public who became eligible to get doses on March 1. The remaining were health and frontline workers, who were the first in line to get doses when the drive began on January 16, and 330,000 were second booster shots.The makers of the two vaccines that India is using, the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, told the Delhi High Court on Thursday that they have excess stocks but supplies can be made available only upon the government’s permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-for-veterans-to-begin-at-service-hospitals-next-week-army-101615039993077.html

We will not step back," said a protester in Sonipat.Farmers held protest at the KMP Expressway near Mandothi village in Jhajjar district. Some people from nearby villages joined them."We are holding our protest in a peaceful manner,” said a farmer, adding that they were also observing “black day” on Saturday.Protesting farmers said the government should withdraw these laws.Farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, while addressing a gathering on the KMP Expressway, asked the Modi government to withdraw these laws.This agitation will certainly put pressure on the central government, he said.Farmers claimed that their five-hour protest remained peaceful.Sonipat Superintendent of Police Jashandeep Singh Randhawa said arrangements were made for traffic diversions.Heavy vehicles were diverted from Panipat and others from Ganaur to Delhi, said officials.Traffic was also diverted from Murthal via Sonipat city to Narela and Bawana and from Bahadurgarh to Baghpat, they said.Officials said traffic resumed at KMP expressway after famers lifted their blockade at 4 pm.In Palwal district also, farmers staged a 'dharna'.At some places in Haryana, farmers even put up black flags atop roof of their houses as a mark of their protest against the government for not withdrawing the farm laws.The 136-km Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway is also known as the Western Peripheral Expressway.The 53-km Manesar-Palwal section was inaugurated by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari in 2016 and 83-km Kundli-Manesar section was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018.The KMP Expressway was built to decongest the ever-busy roads of Delhi, especially by reducing the number of trucks entering the national capital, thus helping to curb pollution.It provides high-speed link between northern Haryana and southern districts and gives uninterrupted high-speed link for traffic, especially commercial traffic, from Haryana to neighbouring states.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-block-expressway-in-haryana-as-agitation-completes-100th-day-101615038071546.html
06-03-2021||India||Himachal Pradesh budget 'directionless', says Congress||Himachal Pradesh Congress on Saturday termed the state budget presented by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur as "directionless", saying the government has failed to give relief to the people from rising inflation.Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said the budget presented in the HP Assembly was a "half-baked document" in which false promises had been made to the people of the state."The state government presented a deficit budget in the assembly in which there is no mention of the total debt on the state and gap funding," he added.Thakur presented his fourth budget in the HP Assembly on Saturday. He said the ₹50,192 crores budget for 2021-22 is ₹1,061 crore higher than ₹49,131 crore in the last fiscal despite the COVID-19 crisis.Observing that it is unfortunate that the state government did not mention any of these points in the budget document, he said such things have not happened in the past.Agnihotri said though the chief minister claimed to have presented a tax-free budget, there were chances that the government will impose taxes during the year to meet revenue deficit gap.The document was also silent on loans or funding for the schemes that were announced in the budget, he said.The leader of opposition accused the BJP government of not providing any relief to the people from rising inflation and said the government should have lowered VAT on petrol and diesel to ease the burden of price-rise.Besides, the government should have provided subsidy on LPG gas cylinders as the people were bearing the brunt of rising prices, he said.  Agnihotri further stated that the state government had only refurbished the central government schemes in the budget and was giving false hopes to the people.The leader of opposition also took on the government on the promise of filling 30,000 functional posts and said the decision would pave way for back-door entry in jobs in the state.Agnihotri said,"The state government had made new false promises to the people of the state while it hadn't delivered on schemes that were announced in the last budget."The state has recorded negative growth but the chief minister has tried to lure people by presenting old schemes in a refurbished manner," he said, adding the budget was directionless and a half-baked document.The leader of opposition added that the Congress will demand a white paper from the state government on fiscal health of the state as the government had indulged in financial mismanagement in its three-year tenure.Lone Communist Party of India (Marxist) MLA Rakesh Singha also termed the budget "fictional" and said the chief minister has made big announcements without any provision of funds.Singha said there was complete mismatch between the Economic Survey and budget presented by the BJP government.The budget is good at the micro level as the state government had announced to increase in wages of employees in various sectors but there is nothing on the macro level, he added.Singha said, "It was also not clear where the government will source funds and how the deficit will be covered and from which scheme of the budget. It seems that the BJP government will resort to backdoor taxes on the people later."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-pradesh-budget-directionless-says-congress-101615036851845.html
06-03-2021||India||Senate works through night with virus aid on path to passage||The Senate worked through the night and past sunrise Saturday on Democrats' showpiece $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill after a deal between leaders and moderate Sen. Joe Manchin on emergency jobless benefits broke a logjam that had stalled the package.The compromise, announced by Manchin, D-W.Va., and a Democratic aide late Friday and backed by President Joe Biden, cleared the way for the Senate to begin a marathon series of votes on amendments before eventual approval of the sweeping legislation. The bill then would return to the House, which was expected to give it final congressional approval and send it to Biden to sign.Biden’s foremost legislative priority is aimed at battling the killer pandemic and nursing the economy back to health. It would provide direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans and money for Covid-19 vaccines and testing, aid to state and local governments, help for schools and the airline industry and subsidies for health insurance.Shortly before midnight, the Senate began to take up a variety of amendments in rapid-fire fashion. The votes were mostly on Republican proposals virtually certain to fail but designed to force Democrats into politically awkward votes. It was unclear how long into the weekend the “vote-a-rama” would last.By daybreak Saturday, senators had worked through more than a dozen amendments without substantially changing the overall package.The lengthy standoff underscored the headaches confronting party leaders over the next two years — and the tensions between progressives and centrists — as they try moving their agenda through the Congress with their slender majorities.Manchin is probably the chamber’s most conservative Democrat, and a kingmaker in the 50-50 Senate. But Democrats cannot tilt too far center to win Manchin’s vote without endangering progressive support in the House, where they have a mere 10-vote edge.Aiding unemployed Americans is a Democratic priority. But it’s also an issue that drives a wedge between progressives seeking to help jobless constituents cope with the bleak economy and Manchin and other moderates who have wanted to trim some of the bill’s costs.Biden noted Friday's jobs report showing that employers added 379,000 workers — an unexpectedly strong showing. That's still small compared with the 10 million fewer jobs since the pandemic struck a year ago.“Without a rescue plan, these gains are going to slow," Biden said. “We can’t afford one step forward and two steps backwards. We need to beat the virus, provide essential relief, and build an inclusive recovery."The overall bill faced a solid wall of GOP opposition, and Republicans used the unemployment impasse to accuse Biden of refusing to seek compromise with them. “You could pick up the phone and end this right now,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of Biden.But in an encouraging sign for Biden, a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 70% of Americans support his handling of the pandemic, including a noteworthy 44% of Republicans.The all-night amendment process did little to change the outcome.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, sought to swap in Republican centrists’ $650 billion alternative proposal, which Biden had panned as inadequate. That and other amendments failed, including one from Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., on the Keystone XL pipeline.One proposal that did pass, from Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., would require schools, within 30 days of receiving money from the bill, to develop publicly available plans for in-person instruction. It appeared designed to fend of Republican criticisms that Biden’s package does not do enough to swiftly reopen schools.The House approved a relief bill last weekend that included $400 weekly jobless benefits — on top of regular state payments — through August. Manchin was hoping to reduce those costs, asserting that level of payment would discourage people from returning to work, a rationale most Democrats and many economists reject.As Friday began, Democrats asserted they'd reached a compromise between party moderates and progressives extending emergency jobless benefits at $300 weekly into early October.That plan, sponsored by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., also included tax reductions on some unemployment benefits. Without that, many Americans abruptly tossed out of jobs would face unexpected tax bills.But by midday, lawmakers said Manchin was ready to support a less generous Republican version. That led to hours of talks involving White House aides, top Senate Democrats and Manchin.The compromise would provide $300 weekly, with the final check paid on Sept. 6, and includes the tax break on benefits.Before the unemployment benefits drama began, senators voted 58-42 to kill a top progressive priority, a gradual increase in the current $7.25 hourly minimum wage to $15 over five years. Eight Democrats voted against that proposal, suggesting that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other progressives vowing to continue the effort in coming months will face a difficult fight.That vote began shortly after 11 a.m. EST and was not formally gaveled to a close until nearly 12 hours later as Senate work ground to a halt amid the unemployment benefit negotiations. It was among the longest votes in modern Senate history.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chided Democrats, calling their daylong effort to work out the unemployment amendment a “spectacle."“What this proves is there are benefits to bipartisanship when you're dealing with an issue of this magnitude," McConnell said.Republicans criticized the overall relief bill as a liberal spend-fest that ignores that growing numbers of vaccinations and signs of a stirring economy suggest that the twin crises are easing.“Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning.” McConnell said.Democrats reject that, citing the job losses and numerous people still struggling to buy food and pay rent.“If you just look at a big number you say, ‘Oh, everything's getting a little better,'" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “It's not for the lower half of America. It's not."Friday's gridlock over unemployment benefits gridlock wasn't the first delay on the relief package. On Thursday Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., forced the chamber's clerks to read aloud the entire 628-page relief bill, an exhausting task that took staffers 10 hours and 44 minutes and ended shortly after 2 a.m. EST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senate-works-through-night-with-virus-aid-on-path-to-passage-101615035927466.html

06-03-2021||India||CBI launches probe into smuggling of rotten betel nuts to India||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has launched a probe into a scam involving alleged evasion of customs duty worth ₹15,000 crore annually in the smuggling of substandard Betel Nuts/Areca Nuts in the garb of SAARC Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA) and South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA).The agency has registered a First Information Report (FIR) naming unknown officials of Central Excise and Customs and unknown private persons for causing huge losses adding up to several hundred crores to the government exchequer. The High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, had ordered a CBI probe in the matter on February 25 on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which claimed that substandard, unsafe and unfit Betel Nuts/Areca Nuts were being smuggled to India by fake persons using fake bills.Areca nut is widely consumed in India, particularly in the form of pan masala and gutkha.As per the agreements under SAPTA and SAFTA, concessions are exchanged vide preferential rates on customs duty so as to promote mutual trade and the economic cooperation amongst the member countries. The customs duty at the rate of 13% is applicable on Betel Nut of origin of member countries whereas 113% customs duty is levied in case of non-member countries. The members include India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The CBI FIR, reviewed by HT, states that “Unscrupulous traders, in connivance with the public servants, are indulged in smuggling of betel nuts/areca nuts of Indonesian origin falsely claiming the same to be originating from member countries, on the basis of fake Certificates of Origin, bogus and undervalued bills/invoices and forged clearance certificates and thus causing evasion of Customs Duty to the tune of ₹15,000 crore annually.”Explaining the modus operandi, CBI FIR, lodged on Friday, adds - “Such illegal imports of Indonesian betel nuts are purportedly facilitated by fake entities registered in India, Indonesia and SAARC countries. Moreover, rotten betel nuts are being imported under the guise of cashew peels (combustible material) to circumvent the lab test”.In June 2016, a stock of 23 wagons of substandard and hazardous betel nuts, smuggled internationally in the name of fake importers, was detected by Railways, Nagpur unit.Instead of taking action, the concerned Customs department officials didn’t look into the matter earnestly and extended favours to the traders involved, CBI FIR says.Subsequently, a Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) probe in 2017 revealed import of betel nuts and evasion of customs duty in Nagpur. The four consignments investigated by DRI were related to smuggling of consignments of 106.11 MTs (metric tonnes), 109.273 MTs and 81.42 MTs of betel nuts of foreign origin from Indo-Myanmar border, and confiscation of 40 MTs of trucks carrying betel nuts on way to Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-launches-probe-into-smuggling-of-rotten-betel-nuts-to-india-101615034098942.html
06-03-2021||India||Oppn questions probe into death of 'owner' of vehicle found near Ambani's house||A day after the purported owner of the vehicle with explosives parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house was found dead, the opposition BJP said on Saturday that it appeared to be a murder and questioned the investigation by police.Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said the Sena-led Maharashtra government should not be put in the dock over the death of a prime witness, but finding out the truth was imporant for the coalition government's image.Mansukh Hiren (46), who the police had said was the owner of the stolen Scorpio with gelatin sticks parked near Ambani's residence in south Mumbai on February 25, was found dead in a creek in neighbouring Thane on Friday morning.Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who belongs to the NCP, announced transfer of the probe to the Anti-Terrorism Squad on the same evening. He also said Hiren was not the owner of the SUV but was in its possession for carrying out some interior work."It is wrong to politicise this death and put the government in the dock. There are doubts whether Mansukh Hiren's death was a suicide or murder. He was an important witness in the case," Raut said here."The home department should unearth the truth at the earliest. It is important for the prestige and image of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government," he said.On the transfer of the probe from the Mumbai crime branch to the ATS, the Sena leader said the BJP wanted the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe it, but it would not guarantee that the case would be solved immediately."The home minister has handed over the case to the ATS, which is capable of solving it. Let us have faith in it," Raut said.State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, on the other hand, questioned the "seriousness of the probe"."Prima facie he was murdered. But I have my doubts about the seriousness of the investigation," Patil told reporters.He also accused the state government of "promoting criminalisation of politics"."In less than two years, several ministers have faced serious allegations but none of them stepped down, except the recent resignation of forest minister," he said.Forest minister Sanjay Rathod resigned earlier this month after his name was linked to the death of a young woman in Pune."It gives an assurance to criminals that they can join politics and get protected. The BJP protested strongly due to which the MVA government was forced to accept Rathod's resignation," Patil said.Ashish Shelar, another BJP leader, questioned the presence of an "encounter specialist" police officer at Hiren's autopsy."His presence is suspicious as he is neither part of Thane police nor the ATS. It gives impression that there is something this government wants to hide," he said.Shelar also asked what prompted the home minister to hand over the probe to the ATS shortly after praising the job done by the Mumbai crime branch and Thane police.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Sandeep Deshpande demanded inquiry by a sitting judge.As per police, Hiren, who was in vehicle spare parts business, went missing after leaving his shop in Thane around 8.30 pm on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-questions-probe-into-death-of-owner-of-vehicle-found-near-ambani-s-house-101615034681638.html
06-03-2021||India||Smriti Irani attacks Rahul Gandhi, accuses him of 'insulting' people of Amethi||Union Minister Smriti Irani launched a scathing attack on former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday, accusing him of "insulting" the people of Amethi by comparing voters in the north with those in Kerala.The Amethi MP, who laid the foundation stone for a bus stand in Tiloi, said the people of the town gave Gandhi immense love for 15 years despite him "not doing anything for its development"."It is wrong for Rahul Gandhi to say that there is a lack of understanding among the people of Amethi than those in Kerala. I believe that there is no dearth of understanding in the people of Amethi. Rather it is in Rahul Gandhi," she said.Her remarks come after Gandhi at a public gathering in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram recently said, "For the first 15 years, I was an MP in the north, I had got used to a different type of politics. For me, coming to Kerala was very refreshing as suddenly I found that people are interested in issues, and not just superficially, but going into detail."Attacking the Gandhi family, Irani said a political family of the country ruled Amethi for 30 years but never thought about its development."Instead of developing Amethi and opening a medical college here, they continued to get their guest house constructed," she claimed.Talking about farmers, Irani said in 2013, when Gandhi's party was in power only 800 farmers got the benefit of minimum support price in Amethi while in 2020, as many as 23,800 farmers benefitted from MSP here.The Union minister said it is a matter of concern that there was not a single fertilizer rack centre in Amethi and claimed that the farmers had to face lathis for fertilizers.She said after the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh, a fertilizer rack centre was formed in Gauriganj in Amethi and construction work for a bypass and over bridge started in the town.Irani said the benefits of development schemes are reaching the common man directly, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sammann Nidhi has given financial strength to the farmers and people have benefitted directly from Ayushman Bharat Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana and Saubhagya Yojana.Earlier in the day, she took part in a ground-breaking ceremony of the bus stand to be constructed in Tiloi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-attacks-rahul-gandhi-accuses-him-of-insulting-people-of-amethi-101615029626682.html
06-03-2021||India||Centre asks states witnessing spike in Covid-19 cases to accelerate vaccination||The Centre has asked states and union territories witnessing surge in new Covid-19 cases and high active caseload to continue with the strategy of "test, track and treat" that had yielded rich dividends at the height of the pandemic and accelerate vaccination for priority population groups in districts reporting higher infections on mission mode.In a meeting held on Saturday, they have been asked to collaborate with private hospitals to open up vaccination time-table for a minimum of 15 days and maximum of 28 days at a time.They have been asked to increase the share of RT-PCR tests in districts dependent on high levels of antigen testing, refocus on surveillance and stringent containment of those areas in selected districts which are seeing cluster of cases and carry out an average close contact tracing of minimum of 20 persons per positive case.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and NITI Aayog Member (Health) Vinod K Paul on Saturday interacted with health secretaries and mission directors of the National Health Mission of Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and the union territories of Delhi and Chandigarh, the Union Health Ministry said."These states and UTs have in the recent past seen increased positivity and increased number of daily positive cases," it underlined.They reviewed the ongoing public health measures of surveillance, containment and management of Covid cases in wake of the steep rise in daily new cases of Covid and the high number of active caseload being reported from these eight states and UTs, the ministry said in its statement.In a detailed presentation, it was pointed out that nine districts in Delhi, 15 in Haryana, 10 in Andhra Pradesh, 10 in Odisha, nine in Himachal Pradesh, seven in Uttarakhand, two in Goa, one in Chandigarh continue to be of concern as these districts are seeing a decrease in total tests being conducted, low share of RT-PCR tests, increase in weekly positivity and low number of contact tracing of the Covid positive cases.These together can pose high risk of transmission to the neighbouring states and UTs. A granular analysis of the Covid-19 response in the districts was shared with the states and UTs for further action, the statement said.States were specifically asked to continue with the effective strategy of 'test, track & treat' that had yielded rich dividends at the height of the pandemic, improve overall testing in districts reporting reduction in testing and increase share of RT-PCR tests in districts dependent on high levels of antigen testing.They have been asked to refocus on surveillance and stringent containment of those areas in selected districts which are seeing cluster of cases, carry out an average close contact tracing of minimum of 20 persons per positive case and focus on clinical management in districts reporting higher deaths, the ministry in the statement.They have been asked to actuate their health infrastructure to provide effective clinical management to all the patients as a surge in cases also affects the case fatality rate in those districts."Accelerate vaccination for priority population groups in districts reporting higher cases. Make optimal use of the available vaccine doses and focus on critical districts," the ministry said.They have been asked to collaborate with the private hospitals to open up vaccination time-table for a minimum of 15 days and maximum of 28 days at a time and promote Covid-appropriate behaviour through communication and enforcement, the statement said."Stress was laid on prompt isolation and on medical supervision of those active cases presently in home isolation for early identification of progressive deterioration of the disease. The states were also asked to actively watch out for super-spreading events and share their best practices in breaking the chain of transmission," the statement stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-asks-states-witnessing-spike-in-covid-19-cases-to-accelerate-vaccination-101615031393538.html

However, with the Law Secretary of Goa having been appointed to hold charge as State Election Commissioner, it is but natural that given the sordid manner in which the announcement of the elections was done, the State Election Commission is not functioning as an independent authority, but behaving like a stooge of the Government," he stated.Chodankar said that the civic poll process cannot be halted and then restarted and if stopped, then the entire process has to be initiated all over again.The elections for 11 municipal councils and the Corporation of City of Panaji (CCP) will be held on March 20 and counting will be held on March 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cong-demands-state-election-commission-to-suspend-civic-polls-till-sc-order-101615020725361.html

They reviewed health measures for surveillance, containment and management of Covid-19 cases in the wake of increased positivity and increased number of daily infections in the recent days in these areas. According to the health ministry, a high active caseload is being reported from these eight states and UTs.The health ministry said it was pointed out that nine districts in Delhi, 15 in Haryana, 10 in Andhra Pradesh, 10 in Odisha, nine in Himachal Pradesh, seven in Uttarakhand, two in Goa, one in Chandigarh continue to be of concern as they are witnessing a decrease in the number of tests being conducted, low share of RT-PCR tests, increase in weekly positivity and a low number of contact tracing of the Covid-19 positive cases. “These together can pose a high risk of transmission to the neighbouring States and UTs,” the ministry warned. The Centre told states to promote Covid-19-appropriate behaviour through communication and enforcement and continue with the effective strategy of ‘test, track and treat’ that yielded rich dividends at the height of the pandemic. They were asked to improve overall testing in districts reporting a reduction in testing and increase the share of RT-PCR tests in districts dependent on high levels of antigen testing.The central panel asserted states must refocus on surveillance and stringent containment of areas that have clusters of cases and must carry out an average close contact tracing of a minimum of 20 people per positive case.The states must focus on clinical management, actuate their health infrastructure to provide effective clinical management to all the patients as a surge in cases also affects the case fatality rate. They also need to accelerate vaccination for priority population groups, make optimal use of the available vaccine doses and focus on critical districts, according to the health ministry statement. State authorities can also collaborate with the private hospitals to open up vaccination time-table for a minimum of 15 days and a maximum of 28 days at a time, the government has said.The states were also asked to actively watch out for super-spreading events and share their best practices in breaking the chain of transmission.As of Saturday, India’s active caseload reached 180,304 with a single day spike of 18,327 cases of the coronavirus disease. The active cases currently account for 1.61% of the nation’s total positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/return-to-test-track-treat-fundamentals-centre-to-states-reporting-covid-19-resurgence-101615027304762.html

They stayed back for three months hoping they would return with their brides once their visas are cleared. Little did they realise that their wait will continue two years on.The visas were initially denied on technical grounds and remained pending as tensions heightened between India and Pakistan after the February 2019 Pulwama attack prompted New Delhi to conduct a cross-border airstrike. Pakistan retaliated and captured an Indian pilot before releasing him two days later. But tensions persisted with regular cross-border firing.India and Pakistan's reaffirmation of commitment to a cease-fire along the border held out hope for cross-border couples like the Bhatis who have been forced to live separately for the want of visas.Vikram Singh Bhati looked forward to being united with his wife as the Centre also promised last month to grant visas to Pakistani women married to Indians. But to his shock, the Indian high commission in Pakistan denied his wife, Nirmala Bai, a visa again. The last thing that he imagined was that Bai's passport has been blacklisted even as she never visited India before.Vikram Singh Bhati said he was shocked when he was informed that the visa application of his wife has been rejected. “I am clueless about the reason why the government has blacklisted the passport of my wife. She never visited India or any other country. Even the passport of my wife was issued after our engagement," said Singh, who has not even seen his son who was born in Pakistan.He said on February 9, the Indian high commission asked Pakistani women married to Indians to submit their documents for visas after Union minister Kailash Choudhary, who represents Barmer in parliament, intervened on their behalf.Choudhary said he has been informed about the blacklisting of Bai’s passport. “I am looking into the matter. "I have been informed that Vikram’s wife never visited India, so there may be some technical error in declaring her passport black-listed. I have asked the officials of the external affairs ministry to sort out this case on humanitarian grounds,” said Choudhary.Nehpal's wife was luckier and has been granted a visa.Barmer and Jaisalmer are located along the border with Pakistan’s Sindh province where a bulk of Pakistani Hindus are concentrated. Cross-border marriages among common in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-years-on-pakistani-woman-still-waits-for-indian-visa-to-unite-with-husband-101615027625995.html

However, with only 90-92 seats, Congress believes offering more seats will be 'problematic'."It is true that our discussion has not yet concluded. The Left Front and Congress had a discussion and we arrived at a solution. But ISF appeared in the scene and the question of leaving them some seats arose," Bhattacharya told ANI."Though I told them repeatedly not to give them so many seats because it's a new party and we do not know their organisational strength, the Left offered them 30 seats. Now the problem is that they (ISF) are asking Congress for more seats. We have only 90- 92 seats. How we are going to offer them more?" Bhattacharya added.The Congress party believes that giving them seats means cutting down on their own, and if they cannot get more seats from the Left front, it will be difficult."To resolve this problem, the party president Adhir Ranjan Choudhury should talk to the Left Front chairman directly. We have narrowed down some seats but we don't have much time left and we have to solve this at the earliest," Bhattacharya said.The candidate list of the Sanyukt Morcha consists of the Left front, the Congress party and Furfura Sharif's Indian Secular Front (ISF). They announced their candidate list for the first two phases on Friday at Alimuddin.However, crucial seats of Nandigram, Pingla and Egra, Daspur is on hold and yet to be announced.Also watch: 'Right person now in the right party’: JP Nadda on Dinesh Trivedi joining BJPChairing the press conference on Friday, Left Front chairman Biman Bose said that there were a few lists where the final decisions are yet to be taken.The elections for the 294 Assembly seats in West Bengal will begin on March 27.

The government is also thinking to bring a law to check this kind of mischief, he added."It is not confined to only politicians. Celebrities from various walks of life are subjected to this kind of conspiracy. Both mainstream media and social media platforms are being misused to broadcast misinformation and fake news," he said.A total of six ministers in the B S Yediyurappa government on Friday moved a Bengaluru court seeking a stay against media outlets from publishing or broadcasting anything defamatory against them.The six Karnataka ministers have moved to Civil Court here in connection with a sex tape case allegedly involving Ramesh Jarkiholi, who recently resigned as minister. A case was registered against Karnataka Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi on Tuesday for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman.Sudhakar further claimed if there is truth in allegations then no one can be protected but a smear campaign to tarnish image and goodwill is not acceptable."If there is truth in allegations, no one can be protected. Culprits must be punished. No one is above law. But smear campaign to tarnish image and goodwill is not acceptable. Those who feel they are victimised can go to court and seek justice. But there is a new trend to indulge in hit-and-run allegations. This is unethical, immoral and illegal," said Dr Sudhakar.He further said that the only reason to move the court for the injunction is to prevent any attempt of defamation."The victims have not come forward to lodge compliant or approached courts for justice. There must be a thorough investigation in the case," the minister added."In the recent case, it is being reported that videos have been uploaded from Russia and other countries. Isn't it sounding weird? There seems to be a deliberately planned conspiracy behind this. It is quite natural for those in public life to be cautious about their image and goodwill. Any defamatory content must be checked for its veracity. If found true I have no objection to broadcast it 24 hours," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/approached-court-to-prevent-hit-and-run-smear-campaign-says-karnataka-minister-101615025248658.html

Advocate Ankur Chhibber appeared for the petitioner and submitted that they have repeatedly made representations to the MHA to take action against the said association. However, no action has been taken, the petitioner submitted.The high court noted the reference made in a CIC order dated January 7, 2021 that the MHA has taken a specific position that this association is not a recognised association.The plea stated that on the representation of one the petitioner, CIC communicated that "MHA has not recognised or approved Central IPS Association (CIPSA), hence, Police-I Division, Ministry of Home Affairs has no comments to offer in the matter."The petitioner, through this plea, has prayed for quashing the order dated January 7, 2021.The petitioner has alleged that the respondents (despite admitting that the MHA has not recognised or approved the Central IPS association) has not taken any action against the erring officers and has simply disposed of the representation by stating that the ministry has no comments to offer in the matter.The petitioners have prayed for the court's direction, directing the respondents to immediately disband the said illegal association, freeze their bank accounts, register an FIR against the office bearers and their members as well as initiate departmental inquiries against such officers who are part of the said organization in violation of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966 as well as All India Service Rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-mha-on-plea-seeking-to-disband-central-ips-association-101615021722538.html

The deceased was identified as Korra Piluku, a Koya tribal farmer.According to G K Veedhi police sub-inspector Pasupureddy Anish, a group of Maoists barged into the house of Piluku in Kothapalem and attacked him with lethal weapons in front of his wife and four children.They told his family that he had been acting as an informer of the police, despite several warnings and so he had to be killed.The police denied the allegations of the Maoists that Piluku was one of their informers. r. “In fact, he had earlier worked as a member of Maoist militia and surrendered to the police a couple of years ago. We do not know why the Maoists killed him,” Anish said.The SI said the Maoists had not left any letter or note with the family before killing him. “We are yet to bring the body to the hospital for autopsy, as it is deep in the forest. We have booked a case and are investigating,” he said.The Maoists had asked the tribal villages to boycott the gram panchayat elections held last month, but the district administration, with the help of the police, conducted the elections successfully. In G K Veedhi block, more than 56 per cent of tribals exercised their franchise, ignoring the poll boycott call given by the Maoists.The G K Veedhi block is considered to be a stronghold of the Maoists belonging to Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zone (AOBSZ) and regularly witnesses exchange of fire between them and the police forces.In September 2018, the Maoists killed two former Telugu Desam Party MLAs Kidari Sarveshwar Rao and Siveri Somu alleging that they were supporting the bauxite mining in the tribal areas. A year later, the police shot dead three Maoists who were believed to be involved in the killing of the two TDP leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-kill-man-branding-him-as-police-informer-in-andhra-s-vizag-forests-101615022431987.html

Later all three phones were located and seized. But the agencies could not trace the expensive phone worth ₹1.13 lakh which the customs now claim was later traced to Vinodini Balakrishnan, the people added.The people said after the smuggling case came to light in July last year, the user stopped using this phone before it was allegedly traced to Vinodini Balakrishnan through a sale code and SIM card. She has been asked to appear at the Customs office in Kochi.The Balakrishnans were immediately unavailable for comments. The copy will be updated when they respond to requests for a response to the summon.Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was forced to resign from the party post last year after his son, Bineesh, was arrested in drug smuggling and money laundering cases in Bengaluru.At least five central agencies including the National Investigation Agency are probing the gold smuggling and related cases.The customs department cited Suresh and told the Kerala high court on Friday that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, three ministers of his Left Democratic Front cabinet, and the Speaker of the assembly were aware of the smuggling.Vijayan and the ruling CPI(M) dismissed the allegations as a “cheap poll-time gimmick” ahead of elections in the state next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-leader-kodiyeri-s-wife-summoned-by-customs-for-builder-s-smartphone-gift-101615019171782.html

06-03-2021||India||100 days of farm laws protest: Farmers block major expressways. See pictures||The farmers' protest against the three new farm laws completed 100 days on Saturday. The three borders of the national capital- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - have been the main locations of the protest where farmers from all across the country had come and settled to protest against the Centre until the laws are repealed.To mark the 100th day of the landmark protest, protesting farmers' unions decided to observe March 6 as the 'Black Day'. As part of the protest, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha called for the blocking of the KMP (Kundli–Manesar–Palwal) expressway or the western peripheral for five hours between 11am and 4pm.Here is how the road blockade is going on:Even with several rounds of talks between the farmers' representatives and the government, deadlock still persists. No conclusion has come out of the talks and the farmers are adamant on their demand of withdrawing the three contentious laws.Women too have been a part of the movement since its beginning. As the protest entered its 100th day, women in large numbers came forward to continue the protest by taking part in blocking the KMP expressway.The protest has "reinforced the identity of women farmers”. "Women farmers have been able to assert themselves and make their presence and participation felt," PTI quoted Kavitha Kuruganti of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee as saying.Farmers have also blocked the eastern peripheral expressway in Ghaziabad to observe the 'Black Day'. Farmers have been concerned that the laws will take away the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and will do away with the 'mandi' system as well. One of their demands is a legal guarantee of MSP.Protesting farmers are marching on the KMP expressway with the flag of the farmers' unions to agitate against the laws. Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Friday accused the government of introducing the laws for the benefits of its corporate friends and said that the government is working as the puppets of the businessmen. He also highlighted that the godowns were built first and the laws came after."The government is working as a puppet in the hands of industrialists, the government is doing what the traders are telling them. Godowns were built first, laws were made later," Tikait's tweet, in Hindi, read.The farmers from all across the country, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-farm-laws-protest-farmers-block-major-expressways-see-pictures-101615011636078.html

However, the farmers fear that the legislation will end the mandi system where they are they have assured of the minimum support price for their produce.The agitating farmers want the Centre to repeal the laws, meanwhile, the government has assured that it is ready to make amendments and claimed that laws will give farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country.While the protests have been mostly peaceful, a brief spate of violence on January 26 led to the death of a protestor and many policemen being injured. Following the violence during the tractor rally, Delhi police put barricades around the protests sites of Ghazipur and Tikri borders. They also installed barbed wire to restrict the movement of the protesting farmers.Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Congress' Rahul Gandhi who has been supporting the protests since the beginning, criticised the Centre over the controversial laws. He alleged that the government is torturing the farmers who are fighting for their rights."Nails have been laid at the Delhi borders for sons of those who sacrifice their lives on the borders of the country. 'Annadata' ask for their rights, government tortures!"

In BJP's clarification, however, there is no dismissal.Two names that have been doing the rounds are Mithun Chakraborty, who was a Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP till 2016, and Indian cricket board president Sourav Ganguly. The speculations are two-fold: they are likely to attend PM Modi's mega-event and also likey to join the BJP.On Mithun Chakraborty, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said he is welcome to attend the event. But it will be an event of only PM and the public. Terming PM Modi the biggest celebrity, Vijayvaargiya said, "We will welcome those coming in public, including Mithun Chakraborty.""If he joins, it will be good for both the party and the state. And if he shares the stage with PM Modi, then people of Bengal will be happy," West Bengal BJP vice president Arjun Singh said. On whether there has been any discussion regarding this among the party workers, he said, "I am not the authorised person."Speculations around Mithun were triggered when the actor hosted RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat at his Mumbai home recently. But dismissing any political angle in it, Mithun said he had a "spiritual relationship" with Mohan Bhagwat."I have a spiritual relationship with him. It is a very deep spiritual relation. There was a plan that he would come to my home when he visits Mumbai. It so happened that I returned to Mumbai from Lucknow after a shoot and he too is in Mumbai. So 'jud gaye hum (we connected)'," he told reporters.On Ganguly joining the BJP, a speculation that has been going around for quite some time, West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said he had no idea about this and this was not discussed in the meeting of the core committee either.But will Ganguly be present at PM Modi's Brigade rally? BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said Sourav Ganguly is most welcome, if he decides to attend the programme, his health permitting."We know Sourav is under rest at home. If he considers attending the meeting, health and weather conditions permitting, he will be most welcome. If he is present, we think he will like it. The crowd will also like that. But we don't know. It is for him to decide," Bhattacharya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-brigade-rally-bjp-clears-air-about-mithun-chakraborty-sourav-ganguly-101615011435946.html

The past decade has seen promising trends in the US-India defence trade and technology relationship, he said, adding if confirmed, he will work to sustain these trends, including through a focus on major procurements and high-end technology. Responding to a question on India, Kahl said if confirmed, he would continue to operationalise India’s status as a “Major Defence Partner” by positioning the US and Indian militaries to cooperate more closely to advance shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region. “To this end, I would support efforts to strengthen interoperability, expand bilateral and multilateral security cooperation across the region and deepen defence trade and technology sharing,” he said. He added that he would also leverage regular senior-level bilateral and multilateral engagements with likeminded partners to bolster the relationship. “To continue elevating the US-India partnership, I would prioritise a few promising areas of cooperation. These include deepening information-sharing and mutual logistics operations, growing our defence trade and technology relationship, and expanding high-end cooperation in the maritime domain, including in the Indian Ocean region and southeast Asia,” Kahl said.“Importantly, I would also seek to expand multilateral cooperation with like-minded partners in the region, including through the Quad, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) mechanisms, and other regional engagements,” he added.Responding to questions from Senators during his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Kahl said the biggest opportunity is the growing concern and recognition that a more assertive China has produced. “That is, I think that a lot of our allies and partners are nervous. Frankly, I think that the pandemic and China's early cover-up of the pandemic, and some of its heavy ended, wolf warrior diplomacies during the pandemic have also created opportunities for us to lean in with countries who are increasingly worried about Beijing,” he said. “I could not agree with you more about the importance of emphasising our alliances and our partnerships.It is one of the biggest asymmetric advantages that the United States has. No other global power has a network of allies and partners that we have. And if I'm confirmed, a huge part of my job will be in nurturing those relationships,” he added. The United States has enormous opportunities in the Indo-Pacific, he said. “I think that the last administration made some important strides in this area, as did the Obama administration. I think we have opportunities to work not just with our treaty allies like Japan and South Korea and Australia and the Philippines, but with countries like Singapore and Vietnam and others in ASEAN. And I think there are growing opportunities with India. So, I actually think this is an area where we have an enormous possibility,” Kahl said. Senator Jack Reed, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said the US must take a long term approach to strategic competition with China, a challenge Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has appropriately described as the pacing threat for the Department of Defense. “Competing effectively with China requires that we develop new technologies to rival China's advancements in new operational concepts to ensure the desired effect against Chinese aggression,” he said. According to Kahl, China is the only country in the world that can challenge the United States systematically that is in the economic domain, the technological domain, the military domain, and frankly, in shaping international order more broadly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-border-tensions-reflect-growing-chinese-aggression-kahl-101615003767429.html

Here's a recap of this 2018 case||An Alwar Court in Rajasthan is scheduled to hold the final hearing of the Alwar lynching case on Saturday. The court on Monday had denied further arguments in the case and had decided to hold the final hearing of this 2018 caseHere is a recap of the caseRakbar Khan was allegedly killed by people who claimed to be 'gau rakshaks' in suspicion of cow smuggling.On July 20, 2018, the youth, a resident of Haryana, was killed in Alwar while transporting cows to his village Kolgaon.He had allegedly purchased the cows from Ladpura village and were taking the cows to their home through a forested area in proximity to Lalawandi village when they were attacked by the mob.Rakbar and his friend Aslam were beaten up. While Aslam managed to escape, Rakbar succumbed to his injuries and died in an Alwar hospital.Also read | PM Modi to address Combined Commanders' conference in Kevadia todayDharmendra Yadav, Naresh Kumar, Paramjit Singh and Vijay Kumar — all residents of Lalawandi village — are the accused in the case as per the FIR registered in the Ramgarh police station of Alwar.The victim's (Rakbar) mother had also accused the Additional Sessions Judge adjudicating the trial of favouring the accused in the case and had so demanded the transfer to a different court last week, PTI reported petitioner’s counsel Qasim Khan as saying.The state government had appointed a special public prosecutor in the lynching case.The case is said to follow the lines of the previous Pehlu Khan lynching case of Alwar when Khan, along with his son and companions, were beaten and killed in the same fashion by self-proclaimed 'gau rakshaks' on suspicion of cattle smuggling. The Pehlu Khan incident took place in 2017, sparking nationwide outrage. The local court had acquitted six out of nine accused on the basis of lack of evidence in Pehlu Khan lynching.

06-03-2021||India||SC seeks Centre’s response to trace Army captain in Pakistani jail since 1997||The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to inform it within four weeks about the whereabouts of an army officer who went missing 2 years ago and is believed to be in a Pakistani jail.The top court’s direction on Friday came on a petition by an 84-year-old woman whose son went missing during a patrol at Indo-Pakistan border near Rann of Kutch in 1997.Not limiting it just to the officer in question, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) asked the lawyer appearing for the woman to compile a list of similarly placed officers of the Indian armed forces still languishing in Pakistani jails. The court is expected to hear the matter next on April 23.The petitioner, Kamla Bhattacharjee informed the Court that during the past 23 years neither has she been able to communicate with her son nor has she received any specific information about her son’s location. The petition states that her son, Captain Sanjit Bhattacharjee was part of a platoon patrolling along the Indo-Pak border in the Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. On April 19, 1997 Captain Sanjit along with Lance Naik Ram Bahadur Thapa went missing while 15 others belonging to the platoon returned to their camp. The captain’s family was informed the same day he went missing.Four days later, the Army informed the family that the captain had been apprehended by Pakistani authorities and remained untraceable. The same year the Army came across a radio intercept confirming that captain Bhattacharjee was captured by Pakistan Rangers and subsequently handed over to the Pakistan Army. In 2004, the Army issued a letter informing that the missing officer was presumed to be dead. Yet in 2010, Army prepared a list of 54 missing prisoners of war in which captain Bhattacharjee’s name was included.Representing the mother of the petitioner, advocate Saurabh Mishra informed the court that all that the petition seeks to achieve is a direction to the Centre to take necessary action for the search and release of captain Sanjit Bhattacharjee languishing in Pakistan jail without any criminal case lodged against him.“The Petitioner’s son has been deprived of his fundamental right under Article 21 i.e. right to protection of life and personal liberty, which has been described as the heart of fundamental rights,” the petition statedThe bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde while issuing notice apprised the petitioner’s lawyer to research on similarly placed Indian prisoners of war in Pakistan jails. “We are told there are more persons who are similarly situated. I was consulted in a similar case that came up from Nagpur. I believe they are still not free,” said CJI Bobde. The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian sought responses from the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of External Affairs.In 2019, the Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan told the Parliament that 83 Indian prisoners of war are languishing in Pakistan jails. Even the Government and Army have claimed helplessness as Pakistan denies the presence of Indian POWs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-to-trace-army-captain-in-pakistani-jail-since-1997-101614997774302.html

Her video is a message to all Muslims to end the dowry system as it is illegitimate and forbidden," he said.The 23-year-old woman allegedly jumped into Ahmedabad's Sabarmati river soon after she shot the video in which she is seen troubled due to her relationship with her husband. The woman's husband was arrested on March 1 for abetting her suicide.According to news agency PTI, the FIR lodged by the woman's father at Sabarmati Riverfront (West) police station says that the accused had allegedly tortured her and told her "die if you want to, and send me a video."Days after the alleged accused was arrested, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi expressed grief over the incident and said harassing a woman over dowry was no sign of manhood. "I appeal to all of you, irrespective of your religion, to put an end to the system of dowry. If you are a man, you should know that harassing your wife is no sign of manhood," Owaisi said while addressing the AIMIM cadre.He furthered his attack on the family of the woman's husband and said they should be ashamed for putting her through the torture. "What kind of men are these that hit women and demand dowry? You can fool the world but you can't fool the god," he said. If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

In a complaint filed with Bengaluru police, social activist Dinesh Kalahalli had claimed that the minister had sought sexual favours from the woman seen in the video. After the footage went viral, Jarkihol resigned from the cabinet on Wednesday.The order was issued after hearing an injunction suit filed by Jarkiholi’s lawyers on Wednesday. The suit had named 68 media houses, channels and others.“The Defendant Nos. 1 to 14, 16 to 68 are hereby restrained by an order of an exparte ad¬ interim injunction from telecasting or publishing or broadcasting or distribution in any form or manner of the contents of the alleged C.D. or any other material, negatively, referring to the Plaintiff leading to defamatory act, his dignity assassination or creating sarcastic views about him in any manner including showing the footages and pictures involving negative spectrum, till the next date of hearing,” read the order.This order of injunction, however, added that publishing the authenticated and true news, after due verification, without making any defamatory remarks against the plaintiff, will be allowed.Meanwhile, Dinesh Kalahalli, who had refused to appear before the police citing threat to his life, appeared before Cubbon Park police on Friday.

06-03-2021||India||British envoy says farmers' protest is India’s 'internal issue'||Ahead of a debate on the farmers’ protest in the UK Parliament on March 8, British high commissioner Alex Ellis on Friday described the stir as an “internal issue” that has to be resolved by the Indian government.However, Ellis pointed to UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab’s remarks during a visit to New Delhi last December about Indian politics resonating in British domestic politics because of the presence of a large Indian diaspora, and said such matters are likely to be debated around the world as India’s significance grows.Asked about the planned debate in the British Parliament at his first media briefing since taking over last month, Ellis described the protest by farmers against three farm laws as an “internal issue for India”. The debate was scheduled in response to a public petition and “issues related to India are quite regularly debated in our Parliament”, he added.“This is something which is done by Parliament...the government has to participate and the government has to answer. But it’s really parliamentarians, as you’d expect, raising issues of concern to them and their constituents,” Ellis said.“But the government views something like the farmers’ protest as an internal Indian matter. We observe it, of course, but that is for India to resolve,” he said.Ellis said more such debates around the world should be expected as India takes on a greater role on the global stage.“As the Indian diaspora grows, and it’s very successful in many countries in the world, you’re going to see more of this. I think it’s one of the things that as India grows, as India becomes more international (and) ever more significant in the world, there will be more debates about Indian issues,” the envoy said.Noting that Raab had said “your politics are our politics”, Ellis explained that “things that happen in India have ripples in the UK, partly because you do have such a big diaspora community”.According to British parliamentary convention, petitions that garner 10,000 signatures on the UK government and Parliament website get a response from the government. Petitions that get 100,000 signatures are almost always debated.Influential UK lawmakers such as Claudia Webbe and Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi have been at the forefront of efforts to raise the farmers’ protest in the British Parliament. In the face of pressure from the British MPs, Raab raised the farmers' protest with his Indian counterpart during his visit to New Delhi in December.Asked about the debate in the UK Parlaiment, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing that Indian missions around the world are providing accurate information on the farmers’ protest to the people and governments of their host countries.“In this context, the Indian high commission and consulates in UK have provided information on the three farm bills to the British government, lawmakers, civil society and others,” he said.They are also giving information on the Indian government’s efforts to engage the farmers’ unions on the three laws and to resolve the issue through talks,” he added.The government’s handling of the farmers’ protest, which began on November 26 last year, has been criticised by lawmakers and political leaders in several countries. The government has defended the three new laws as necessary for long overdue reforms in the agricultural sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-envoy-says-farmers-protest-is-india-s-internal-issue-101614994765429.html

06-03-2021||India||‘No teeth’: SC wants stricter OTT rules||A day after it sought “screening” of content on over the top (OTT) platforms, commenting that some even air pornography, the Supreme Court on Friday said that the central government’s recently notified redressal and regulatory mechanism for such companies “do not have teeth” and asked them to consider a legislation that could also provide for “prosecution”.The court, while hearing a pre-arrest bail plea by Amazon Prime’s content chief Aparna Purohit (which it eventually granted) in connection with the ongoing investigation in Uttar Pradesh against the web series Tandav, used the words “screening”, “regulation” and “legislation” with reference to the content, leading to fears that it could mean not just the certification and grievance redressal envisaged in the government regulations, but even censorship.“These rules do not have any teeth. They do not have any provision for prosecution, etc. These are just some guidelines. This is no satisfactory mechanism,” commented a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy after going through the new rules that were notified by the government on February 25.The bench was emphatic in telling solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the government: “Without legislation, you cannot control it (content on OTT platforms). Your rules are only in the nature of guidelines. There are no effective guidelines on screening or taking action against those who do not comply with the guide lines.”Mehta agreed with the court, saying: “No censorship, and self-regulation seem to be the idea behind the new regulations. But we can come up with a draft within two weeks on the suggestions that have come from the court. We are trying to balance everything. We can come up with something for the court’s consideration. This certainly needs examination.”Giving two weeks to the government to come back with its response, the bench then formally recorded in its order that one of the issues that has caught its attention is “uncontrolled and unscreened viewing of films” on Amazon Prime Video and other OTT platforms.“The rules do not list anything about the appropriate action to be taken against those who do not abide by the guidelines. Solicitor general says the government shall give further and appropriate consideration for any regulations or legislation to be brought and that shall be placed before the court,” stated the order.Meanwhile, the bench also granted protection from arrest to Purohit in connection with the first information report lodged in Greater Noida on the condition that she would continue cooperating with the investigators in this case as well as in another one lodged at Lucknow.Both FIRs were against the top Amazon Prime executive (and others associated with the show) for alleged derogatory depiction of Hindu deities and promoting religious enmity through the series. The scenes that caused offence have since been deleted, and the makers as well as the OTT company have apologised.Purohit had to approach the SC after the Allahabad high court on February 25 declined to give her protection from arrest while noting that “such people make the revered figures of the religion of majority community source of earning money in a most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of the country”.Representing Purohit in the apex court, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi and Sidharth Luthra, succeeded in convincing the bench that she has been assisting with the investigations and already been given pre-arrest bail by the Allahabad high court related to the FIR at Lucknow.Rohatgi, on his part, also urged the S-G to watch the web series and suggest deletions, if any. “Let the solicitor watch it and we will remove whatever he says. This court or the S-G, let anybody watch and tell us and we are willing to remove any other objectionable part. We have already removed two scenes,” he said.At this, the bench retorted: “We will see if the Union of India comes up with some other regulations or legislation.”Rohatgi then referred to the comments made by the bench a day ago. “This court observed that there is porn on these platforms. Let me tell you that (Amazon) Prime or Netflix don’t show pornography at all.”Mehta told Rohatgi that the court meant “pornographic” and not “porn”. The banter continued as Rohatgi kept up: “I can show 1,000 movies and there is no pornographic material at all. There are some great movies on these platforms in fact. I watch them every evening.”To this, justice Bhushan replied: “Mr Rohatgi, we are not saying great movies are not shown. But we are concerned about some other content.”As Rohatgi requested Mehta to watch movies and shows on the OTT service providers, Luthra quipped that the S-G might not have the time for fun. Rohatgi was quick to respond: “The solicitor sends me jokes in the evening every day. He certainly has time to watch movies too.”On February 25, the Centre notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, that will govern online content. The rules envisage a three-tier regulatory framework, which will apply to social media, digital media, and OTT companies: self-regulation; a body like the Press Council of India headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court; and, at the apex, an oversight body of the government, with an interministerial committee to ensure adherence to the norms.Besides, OTT platforms will also have to self-classify the content into five age-based categories: U (Universal), U/A 7 years, U/A 13 years, U/A 16 years, and A (Adult), in addition to providing a mechanism of parental lock in their services.The rules have also brought OTT platforms and the digital news organisations under the ambit of section 69A of the Information Technology Act, authorising the information and technology secretary to block public access to a specific content without giving the platform an opportunity of hearing, in case of an emergency.Nikhil Pahwa, a digital rights activist and founder of mobile and digital news portal Medianama, said: “Why should there be a separate law to regulate streaming services when what is illegal is already illegal under the existing laws. Such a license raj will destroy the flexibility for streaming services, e-commerce providers, etc, to innovate, shape-shift.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-teeth-sc-wants-stricter-ottrules-101614984717011.html
06-03-2021||India||Widen network, say experts as India aims to boost Covid vaccination drive||The government is planning to more than double the number of coronavirus vaccination centres and reach deeper into rural parts of the country, targeting a massive expansion that experts believe is possible only if policies are relaxed and India’s vast immunisation infrastructure is tapped into.Government data shows 1.4 million doses were administered on Thursday, a record for the country, but a breakdown shows only about half of this number (700,000) was of people from the general public who became eligible to get doses on March 1. The remaining were health and frontline workers, who were the first in line to get doses when the drive began on January 16, and 330,000 were second booster shots.The roughly 20,000 centres being used for the vaccine drive at the moment are hospitals, private as well as public, while many primary and secondary health centres at present are kept out of the programme.The makers of the two vaccines India is using, Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, told the Delhi high court on Thursday that they have excess stocks but supplies can be made available only upon permission of the Union government.“Currently there are about 20,000 vaccination centres functional across the country, and the plan is to take it up to at least 50,000 and eventually it could even be 100,000. The numbers will automatically increase to reach closer to the target of 5 million vaccinations per day,” said Dr NK Arora, member, National Task Force on Covid-19 matters.“The focus will be on adding more centres in smaller cities and rural areas as bigger cities already have adequate number of centres functioning. Also, not just increasing centres, the focus will also be on effective utilisation of existing centres. If you see, we have been able to utilise just about half of our capacity at the moment and that needs to be ramped up first,” said Arora.In all, India has given about 18 million doses of Covaxin and Covishield to people in three priority groups: health care workers, frontline workers (such as police and military), and people above the age of 60 (or those older than 45 with a certain set of illnesses that raise their risk of death in Covid-19 infections).Experts, however, say the pace is still significantly short of what India needs not only to cover its vast population of high risk groups but also avert a second wave of infections.“Although it is heartening to see an increase in pace, it is sort of under accomplishment to go at this rate as India has the capacity to cover 7-10 million per day. Covering 10 million a day will ensure that we will cover the entire vulnerable population within a month,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian institute of Public Health. “Given the proactive and strong leadership shown by India so far in tackling Covid-19 so far, the ambitious goal to cover within 30 days will take us ahead of the virus. This ambition is a necessity, not for any records,” he added.In absolute terms, the 14. million doses given on Thursday in India has only been eclipsed by the US, which has been administering roughly 2 million doses a day on an average over the last week. Both countries have a similar target population at the moment: India is seeking to cover 300 million most at risk while the US is aiming to get doses to its entire population of 330 million.In India’s case, however, after the immediate target is achieved, a larger section of the remaining 1 billion population will still need to the vaccinated.“It (vaccine drive) is being scaled up and the number of vaccinations has increased significantly over the past few days. In fact, between March 1 and 4, the numbers have gone up from about 600,000 to at least 1.4 million. It will further increase in coming days,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary.Arora, too, said the country was easily capable of vaccinating people at a much faster rate. “For polio we vaccinated at least 170 million children in a week, so 300 million is not an impossible number. It is very much doable and we will do it,” he added.A second expert said tapping into the immunisation network for Covid-19 may not be easy. “For Covid immunisation drive, the government has involved private players in a big way, unlike the universal immunisation programme that is largely government dependent. It would have been a good idea to involve national immunisation network resources but we need to keep in mind that there is also routine immunisation to take care of. The government needs to balance out Covid vaccination drive and routine immunisation drive,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.A third expert highlighted the need to ensure adequate supplies. “The scale up is happening and if you see the numbers during the past few days, the numbers have grown significantly; almost doubled. The government focus is also to reach rural areas and while opening it up like they do under regular immunisation programme will be ideal, it also depends on the vaccine supplies. They can’t expand unless the vulnerable population is covered,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, founder, Medanta Hospital.Another expert flagged the need to ensure vaccine coverage across the country is more equitable. “Once we get to rural India, there may be less demand and also weaker supply channels. That could slow down the coverage,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director, Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widen-network-say-experts-as-india-aims-to-boost-drive-101614983519071.html
06-03-2021||India||New Delhi rejects report as ‘misleading, misplaced’||India on Friday rejected a report by the US government-funded NGO Freedom House that downgraded the country’s status as a democracy and free society to “partly free”, describing it as “misleading, incorrect and misplaced”.A detailed statement from the government rebutted points raised in the report titled “Freedom in the World 2021 - Democracy under Siege”, and pointed out that “many states” in the country were ruled by parties other than the one at the national level, and that the election process is free and fair and conducted by an independent election body.“This reflects the working of a vibrant democracy, which gives space to those who hold varying views,” the statement said.The external affairs ministry, which too rejected Freedom House’s report, also took exception to the depiction of Jammu and Kashmir in the map used in the document.“The political judgements of Freedom House are as inaccurate and distorted as their maps,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing.“For example, on the Covid-19 situation, there is a widespread appreciation in the world of our response, of our high recovery rate, and our low fatality rate,” he added.“India has robust institutions and well-established democratic practices. We do not need sermons, especially from those who cannot get their basics right,” Srivastava he said.The report said India “appears to have abandoned its potential to serve as a global democratic leader”, and that the country’s fall “from the upper ranks of free nations could have a particularly damaging impact on global democratic standards”.Freedom House’s reports for 2018, 2019 and 2020 rated India as “free”, though the country’s scores on a scale of 100 declined in this period from 77 to 71. In the latest report, India has a score of 67. The report mentioned last year’s Delhi riots, the country’s management of Covid, internet shutdowns, and the action under the Foreign Currency Regulation Act against Amnesty International.On the issue of “discriminatory policies against Muslims” and last year’s riots in northeast Delhi, the government statement said all citizens are treated “with equality as enshrined under the Constitution...and all laws are applied without discrimination”. Due process is followed in law and order matters, “irrespective of the identity of the alleged instigator”.In the case of the riots, the law enforcement machinery “acted swiftly in an impartial and fair manner” and “proportionate and appropriate actions were taken to control the situation”.On the use of the sedition law, the statement said “public order” and “police” are state subjects and the responsibility for maintaining law and order, including investigation and prosecution of crimes, rests primarily with state governments. “Therefore, measures as deemed fit are taken by law enforcement authorities to preserve public order,” it said.The statement, while referring to the government’s response on human rights organisations, said the Constitution provides adequate safeguards for protecting human rights, while the National Human Rights Commission and state commissions work to protect such rights. The national panel also works to investigate and make recommendations in cases of violation of rights.The statement said the government attaches “highest importance to the safety and security of all residents...including journalists”, and has issued a special advisory to states on the safety of journalists. “Discussion, debate and dissent is part of Indian democracy,” it added.Temporary suspension of telecom services, including the internet, are governed by the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, and such suspensions need the authorisation of the secretary in the ministry of home affairs or of the secretary in-charge of the home departments in states. The “temporary suspension of telecom/internet services is resorted to with the overarching objective of maintaining law and order under strict safeguards”, it said.It pointed out Amnesty International received permission under the FCRA Act only once and that too 20 years ago. Since then, Amnesty International had been denied FCRA approval despite its repeated applications. “However, in order to circumvent the FCRA regulations, Amnesty UK remitted large amounts of money to four entities registered in India, by misclassifying the remittance as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” it said. This “malafide rerouting of money was in contravention of extant legal provisions”, it added.The statement also defended the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, saying a nationwide lockdown was put in place across the country as any “mass movement of people would have spread the disease rapidly”. The government took various measures to ensure people didn’t face “undue distress”, such as allowing state governments to use the State Disaster Response Fund for providing food, healthcare, shelter to homeless people and migrant workers, and a relief package of ₹1.7 lakh crore that covered migrant workers.“The lockdown period allowed the government to ramp up production capacity of masks, ventilators, Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits etc and thereby effectively prevent the spread of the pandemic,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-delhi-rejects-report-as-misleading-misplaced-101614981484335.html
06-03-2021||India||OCIs need nod for Tablighi, journalistic work: Centre||Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders can’t undertake Tablighi Jamaat, journalism, research or mountaineering activities without special permission from the Centre, according to rules prepared by the Union home ministry.A home ministry spokesperson said these rules prepared by the Foreigners’ Division were part of a brochure issued on November 15, 2019. The rules were consolidated and notified on Thursday.The OCI cardholders, including PIO cardholders, are foreign nationals holding the passport of another country and are not citizens of India.According to the notification, starting from March 4, OCI cardholders are “entitled to multiple entry lifelong visa for visiting India for any purpose provided that they will have to take a special permission or a Special Permit from the competent authority or the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer or the Indian mission concerned for undertaking any research; any Missionary or Tabligh or Mountaineering or Journalistic activities; internship in any foreign diplomatic missions or foreign government organisations or to take up employment in any foreign diplomatic missions here; or to visit any place which falls within protected or restricted or prohibited areas as notified by the Central government”.There was a crackdown on activists of the Tablighi Jamaat – an organisation that works to exhort Muslims to follow Islam as it was practised during the times of Prophet Mohammed – in March-April 2020 during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, after one of their gatherings in Delhi turned into a superspreader event.The notification said OCI cardholders will be exempted from registering with the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer or Foreigners Registration Officer for a stay of any length in India, but they must inform authorities by email whenever there is a change in their permanent residential address and their occupation.Like NRIs, OCI cardholders can appear for the national entrance tests such as NEET, JEE (Mains) and Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced), or other tests to make them eligible for admission only against any NRI seat or any supernumerary seat, provided the cardholder shall not be eligible for admission against any seat reserved exclusively for Indian citizens, the notification said.They can also purchase and sell immovable properties in India, other than agricultural land or farm houses, and pursue professions such as doctors, dentists, nurses, advocates, architects, chartered accountants and pharmacists according to provisions of applicable relevant statutes or laws.Milan Vaishnav, a South Asia expert with Carnegie Endowment for International Piece, said, “I think the new rules regarding OCI cardholders should be seen in conjunction with the recent leaked GoM report on combating “anti-India” media and popular narratives. By circumscribing the activities of OCIs, the government hopes to exert a tighter grip on the narrative. The irony, however, is that if OCIs are deterred from writing or researching about India, the narrative will be defined by those who are even more far-removed from the realities on the ground.” He does not have an OCI card yet but is in the process of applying for one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ocis-need-nod-for-tablighi-journalistic-work-centre-101614981055910.html
06-03-2021||India||K’taka ministers move court against airing of ‘defamatory content’||Six cabinet ministers of Karnataka have moved the city civil court in Bengaluru in what appears to be a move to restrict the media from publishing or broadcasting “defamatory content” against them.The six ministers include Shivaram Hebbar, Dr K Sudhakar, Byrathi Basavaraj, B.C Patil, ST Somashekar and Narayana Gowda, according to the original suit filed at the Additional City Civil and Sessions Judges in Mayo Hall in Bengaluru.All six ministers could not be reached for comment and text messages seeking a response went unanswered.The filing of the case comes days after their ministerial colleague, Ramesh Jarkiholi, was forced to resign from B.S.Yediyurappa-led cabinet after a complaint of alleged sexual exploitation was filed against him.The case has 68 defendants, including all major Kannada and English TV news channels, newspapers among others. The defendants list also includes Google and other social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Hindustan Times has viewed the copy of the case that has been filed even though there is no clear mention of the exact prayer sought by the petitioners.The six leaders who have moved the court are the same who had helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) form the government by defecting the H. D.Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government in 2019.Jarkiholi, considered the catalyst of the defection drama, had also helped others to jump ship to the BJP that brought Yediyurappa to power for the fourth time in the state.After the allegations on Jarkiholi, there were unverified reports of several similar videos and other sex scandals against other cabinet ministers.The developments are not helping Yediyurappa, who has spent the last two years in power dousing one crisis after another, managing expectations of the turncoats and scrambling to get some revenue to the cash-starved state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-ministers-move-court-against-airing-of-defamatory-content-101614980718399.html
06-03-2021||India||India set to achieve Paris pact targets before deadline: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said India is set to achieve its targets under the Paris climate agreement well before the deadline while emphasising that behavioural change was the most powerful way to fight climate change.“Friends, it would make you all happy that over the last seven years India’s forest cover has grown significantly. The population of lions, tigers, leopards and waterfalls have grown. These are great indicators of positive behavioural changes. It is this changes that convince us that India is well on track to achieve its Paris Agreement targets well before the target date of 2030,” Modi said at the virtual event CERAWeek 2021, an annual energy conference organised by IHS Markit.India is a signatory to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As part of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), India has three quantitative climate change goals -- reduction in the emissions intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) by 33 to 35% by 2030 from the 2005 level, achieving about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 and creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.PM Modi on Friday received the CERA Week Global Energy and Environment Leadership Award instituted to recognise commitment of leadership on solutions and policies for energy access, affordability and environmental stewardship.“It is with great humility that I accept the CERA Week Global Energy and Environment Leadership Award. I dedicate this award to the people of our great Motherland, India... I dedicate this award to the glorious tradition of our land that has shown the way when it comes to caring for the environment,” he said.Modi said a close bond between nature and people was central to Indian culture and people of India were leaders when it came to caring for the environment. “Nature and divinity are closely linked. Our gods and goddesses are associated with some or the other tree or animal. Trees and animals are also sacred,” he said.He said Mahatma Gandhi was the greatest environment champion to have ever lived. “If humanity had followed the path given by him we would not have faced many of the problems we do today,” he said.Explaining India’s tradition of water conservation, he urged people to visit Mahatma Gandhi’s hometown of Porbandar in Gujarat where underground tanks were constructed about 200 years ago to save rainwater.Speaking about Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of trusteeship, he gave the concept of “consumption with compassion”. At the core of trusteeship were “collectiveness, compassion and responsibility” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-achieve-paris-pact-targets-before-deadline-pm-modi-101614980359379.html
06-03-2021||India||CM in 1st list; DMK-Cong hit stalemate||The ruling AIADMK on Friday announced candidates for six constituencies for the upcoming assembly election, including those of chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam while the opposition DMK allocated six seats to the Communist Party of India (CPI), a day after it gave the same number to the VCK.The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) announced that Edappadi Palaniswami will contest the Edappadi constituency in his home turf of Salem district, while deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam will contest Bodinayakanur. The two leaders are seeking re-election from the seats they won in the 2016 assembly elections.The other names include fisheries minister D Jayakumar who will contest Royapuram and law minister CV Shanmugam from Villupuram. Former minister SP Shanmuganathan will contest Srivaikuntam and legislator S Thenmozhi has got the reserved constituency of Nilakottai.The AIADMK is seeking a third consecutive term in these elections to be conducted in a single phase to 234 assembly seats on April 6.The party late on Friday declared that the BJP will contest on 20 assembly seats and the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat, where bypolls are due. It has also allotted 23 assembly seats to the PMK but is yet to reach a seat-sharing pact with the DMDK.On Wednesday, former AIADMK interim general secretary V K Sasikala announced her decision to step aside from politics, a huge relief to the present AIADMK leadership of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam.On the other hand, the DMK’s stalemate continued with its main and long standing ally, the Congress, on seat sharing. According to party leaders, state Congress chief KS Alagiri was upset at the DMK not offering an adequate number of seats.“He was so upset with the way the DMK treated us in the first round of seat-sharing talks. When he brought up the question of the Congress’s self- respect, he couldn’t speak anymore and there was just silence in the room,” said a senior Congress leader on condition of anonymity.“Then everyone rallied for him. Congress members spoke up saying we will all support the decision whether he wants to break up the alliance with the DMK or stay.”The Congress sought more than 40 seats in the first round but the DMK offered 18, which later went up to 24.“They’re also saying 27 now but all these are just floating figures, nothing is concrete,” said the Congress leader.The DMK camp said the Congress had to understand that they were allotted 41 seats in the 2016 elections when there were fewer allies in the coalition.“We have to accommodate seven parties now and if the Congress was seeking this for a Lok Sabha election, it would have been different. Since it’s an assembly election, the DMK wants to contest a high number of seats so that we have a comfortable majority,” said a DMK leader not wishing to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-in-1st-list-dmk-cong-hit-stalemate-101614979715293.html
06-03-2021||India||EC orders removal of PM’s images from vaccine certificates: Officials||The Election Commission has asked the Union health ministry to ensure that the photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is removed from the Covid-19 vaccination certificates in the four states and one Union territory headed for polls, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.Saying that the photos violate the model code of conduct, the EC told the health ministry that “the point of the model code of conduct is to ensure a level playing field, this goes against that as it can count as undue publicity,” one of the people said. The development came days after the EC sought a response from the ministry on a complaint of Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien who said that through the certificates, the PM was “exploiting his post and powers”.The health ministry in its response said that the vaccination systems were designed before the elections were announced, the person cited above said. “The ministry explained that the certificates were being issued as per the ongoing scheme. The model code of conduct kicked into force later. And certificate is system generated,” the person said citing the response of the ministry.The EC announced the poll schedule for West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry on February 26.The person said it was imperative that the photographs are removed from certificates distributed in the poll bound states, adding that the system can continue in other states.India kicked off the second phase of its vaccination drive on March 1 by expanding the vaccine coverage to people over 60 years of age and those over 45 with significant comorbidities.O’Brien’s complaint, accessed by HT, stated that the use of the Prime Minister’s image on the certificates is a clear violation of part VII (Party in Power) of the Model Code of Conduct. “The party in power whether at the Centre or in the State or States concerned, shall ensure that no cause is given for any complaint that it has used its official position for the purposes of its election campaign and in particular…(4) Issue of advertisement at the cost of public exchequer in the newspapers and other media,” O’Brien said in the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-orders-removal-of-pm-s-images-from-vaccine-certificates-officials-101614978855923.html

06-03-2021||India||NIA probes Jamaat-e-Islami’s Jammu and Kashmir chapter||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has launched an investigation against the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), Jammu & Kashmir, and its office-bearers on allegations that they support terror activities in the Valley in association with the Hizbul Mujahideen and other terror outfits at the behest of Pakistan, people familiar with the matter said.In its first FIR registered against JeI, J&K a few weeks ago, the central anti-terror probe agency invoked terror charges on specific information that the organisation was funding and supporting anti-India activities with an ultimate goal of secession of J&K from India, the people cited above added.The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) banned JeI after the Pulwama terror attack in 2019, in which 40 Indian troopers were killed and which brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. Over 100 JeI, J&K members, including its chief Abdul Hameed Fayaz were arrested by the J&K Police at that time. Fayaz continues to be behind bars.An NIA officer, who asked not to be named, said they will “examine the funding of Jamaat-e-Islami [J&K] over the years, its properties, its links with separatist leaders and terror outfits – particularly Hizbul Mujahideen, since several members of the Hizb’s cadre at some point were JeI members”.JeI, J&K is intrinsically linked with United Jehad Council (based in Pakistan) which is the “umbrella organisation” of all major terrorist outfits, he added.When JeI, J&K was banned under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on February 28, 2019, the Centre said: “JeI [J&K] stands for securing right of self-determination/independence from Indian dominion. However, its militant wing headed by Mohammad Yousuf Shah alias Syed Shah-ud-Din (formerly Ruken JeI) stands for merger of J&K with Pakistan. In order to achieve its goal, JeI is operating through Kashmir Centre at Lahore, for giving International publicity drive to the ongoing movement where one Mohammad Sofi alias Safi (Ruken JeI) having clandestinely exfiltrated is co-ordinating the activities of JeI related militant groups as well.”The government added: “At the international level, its activists like Ghulam Nabi Fai, Executive Director, Kashmir American Council USA and Syed Nazir Geelani (London based) are spearheading the anti-Indian campaign aimed at secession of the Jammu & Kashmir from Union of India. These people and their organizations issue press statement about baseless alleged human rights violations in order to malign the Indian forces combating terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir.”The Jamaat-e-Islami came into existence in 1941, spearheaded by Moulana Abul Alla Madoodi and with its headquarters at Lahore. After Partition, JeI Hindi separated from this body and established its headquarters in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh.A branch was established in Jammu & Kashmir in 1945 and Pir Saad-ud-Din as its Amir (chief).The Jamaat-e-Islami was formed in 1941, with its headquarters in Lahore, under the leadership of Moulana Abul Alla Madoodi. After the partition, the outfit was split into three separate independent organisations based in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, each.According to Indian agencies, the JeI has maintained that J&K is a disputed territory.JeI Hind, headquartered at Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur, advocates for the righteous way for peace and abiding well-being.“The aims and objectives of the party at the time of its inception were to propagate Islamic teachings and creation of an Islamic State with life based on Shariat. However, after the accession of Jammu & Kashmir with India, JeI, J&K started to follow the instructions and directions imparted by JeI of Pakistan and began to question the accession of the J&K with Union of India,” according to a ministry of home affairs document seen by HT.The document added that the Hizbul Mujahideen, constituted in 1989, is the military wing of JeI, J&K.“With the aforesaid political ideology, this militant outfit has been indulging in acts of armed violence for more than two decades now and is the biggest subversive group spearheading the current secessionist movement in the valley, with Pak/POK support in terms of arms training, supply of arms and ammunition and guidance. Both JeI and Hizb-ul-Mujahedeen (HM) are currently engaged in increasing their influence through vicious means including merger of smaller militant groups with it,” the document added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-probes-jamaat-e-islami-s-j-k-chapter-101614973701557.html
06-03-2021||India||YSRC bags all 6 MLC seats unopposed; silent on abolition of legislative council||The ruling YSR Congress party in Andhra Pradesh has won all the six seats in the state legislative council without any election, taking its strength in the 58-member council to 20.On Thursday, the last day for filing of nominations for the six MLC seats under MLAs’ quota, only YSRC candidates filed their papers and the opposition Telugu Desam Party stayed away from the contest as it does not have enough numbers in the assembly to field its candidates.As a result, all the six YSRC candidates – Balli Kalyan Chakravarthy, Challa Bhagiratha Reddy, Mohammad Iqbal, Duvvada Srinivas, C Ramachandraiah and Kareemunnisa – are elected to the stat3e legislative council unanimously.“An official declaration of the elected candidates will be done on March 8, after the last date for withdrawal of nominations,” an official in the state legislature secretariat said.Of the six YSRC members, Kalyan Chakravarthi is the son of former Tirupati MP late Balli Durgaprasada Rao and Bhagiratha Reddy is the son of former MLC Challa Ramakrishna Reddy. Both Durgaprasada Rao and Ramakrishna Reddy died of Covid-19 in the last six months.Interestingly, the election of the six YSRC members comes at a time when a resolution adopted by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the state assembly in January 2020, seeking abolition of the legislative council, is still pending with the Union home ministry.During the adoption of the resolution on January 27 last year, the chief minister strongly pitched for the abolition of the legislative council stating that it had become a burden on the state exchequer and a stumbling block in the government’s efforts to pass crucial bills.Jagan took the decision to abolish the legislative council with the TDP, which had 30 members in the 58-member council as against 10 members of YSRC, stalled the passage of several bills, including the most crucial bill for the formation of three capitals for decentralisation of administration and also the one on introduction of English medium in the government schools.He also argued that the state government was incurring ₹60 crore annual expenditure on the council and a poor state like AP could not afford it.Subsequently, the number of YSRC members in the legislative council gradually started going up, as the vacancies arose. Former TDP MLCs Dokka Manikya Varaprasad and Pothula Sunitha, who resigned from their posts, got re-elected to the council on YSRC tickets. Two other YSRC leaders – Pandula Ravindra Babu and Zakia Khanum-- were nominated to the council under the governor’s quota, taking the YSRC tally to 14.By June, the YSRC is expected to get absolute majority in the legislative council when some more sitting members complete their term. There would be 10 vacancies under local bodies’ quota and the YSRC is expecting to win all of them, besides three more seats under the Governor’s quota.“By June 9, the YSRC is going to get absolute majority in the state legislative council. We are sure to win all the seats in the elections to be held for the vacant seats,” government whip G Srikanth Reddy said.Asked whether the state government has dropped its resolution sent to the Centre seeking abolition of the legislative council, Reddy said no such decision had been taken. “It is for the Centre to take a decision. Till such time, filling up of the vacancies arising in the council is a Constitutional obligation,” he said.A senior YSRC leader, quoting anonymity, said the Jagan government will not pursue the matter with the Centre on abolition of the council. “When we get enough strength in the council, why should we insist on the abolition? At the same time, we shall not withdraw our proposal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrc-bags-all-6-mlc-seats-unopposed-silent-on-abolition-of-legislative-council-101614973288491.html
06-03-2021||India||Andhra CM Jagan Reddy urges SC to restart Amravati land scam probe||The Andhra Pradesh government told the Supreme Court on Friday that the probe into the Amravati land scam involving the state’s former Advocate General and daughters of a sitting Supreme Court judge, should go on and the state has no objection if the same is court-monitored and handled by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The statement came forth in a petition filed by Andhra Pradesh government challenging an order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which imposed a blanket ban on media in September 2020 to report on contents of the first information report (FIR) registered by state’s Anti Corruption Bureau. The FIR disclosed the alleged role played by former Advocate General Dammlapati Srinivas and 12 others in purchasing land in Amravati - the proposed state capital – at a throwaway price. On November 25 last year, the Supreme Court had lifted the media gag order imposed by the HC.When the matter came up before a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy on Friday, the bench adjourned it to April 7 as it had no time for a full fledged hearing. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan who appeared for the state government told the Court that it was willing to concede to three demands put forth by the alleged accused. “No coercive action will be taken against the accused. Let the case be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation and it can be court-monitored. These are some assurances we are willing to give that will cover nearly three quarters of the case of the other side. But let the investigation continue.”The bench said, “The other side have heard what you have said. They will respond to your suggestion by the next date of hearing.” This is not the first time the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government has offered to transfer the case to CBI. In September 2020, Reddy had met Union Home Minister Amit Shah and requested the Centre to order a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in Amravati land deals during the previous Telugu Desam Party (TDP) regime.Presently, the case investigation has been stalled by the same order of the High Court by which the media gag was imposed. The apex court has not disturbed the directions of the HC staying investigation and no coercive action against Srinivas. The top court, however, restrained the High Court not to finally decide the writ petition pending before it.As per the FIR, between June and December 2014, speculation was rife about Amravati being the prospective new capital of the state. Srinivas was Additional Advocate General from June 2014 to May 2016 and Advocate General from May 2016 to May 2019. Preliminary probe by ACB revealed that Srinivas was privy to information about exact location of future capital and with an intention to make pecuniary gain, his brother-in-law acquired close to 16 plots near Amravati. Some of these plots were sold to Srinivas, his wife and father-in-law at the same rates at which it was purchased from landowners. Certain plots were similarly sold to other individuals named in the FIR, which included close relatives of a senior Supreme Court judge, Justice NV Ramana.Action in this case began on March 23, 2020 when the state government wrote to Union Government seeking probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into alleged irregularities in allotment of land at Amravati. This was based on findings of a Cabinet sub-committee in December 2019. A special investigation team was constituted in February 2020 which too got stayed by the High Court. On September 5, a fresh complaint raising the same allegation was filed that was marked to ACB. A preliminary enquiry led to lodging of FIR on September 15.Srinivas told the Court on the previous date that as the state’s law officer he appeared in several criminal cases lodged against the present Chief Minister. His lawyers argued that it was “absurd to say that a law officer had prior knowledge of the exact location of capital” and told the Court that he was forced to approach the HC as secret investigation was started against him by digging information from income tax department and registration of FIR in order to “defame and scandalize” his reputation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-jagan-reddy-urges-sc-to-restart-amravati-land-scam-probe-101614972457100.html

On Thursday, as many as 1776 cases were reported from Indore.Indore divisional commissioner Pawan Sharma said, “In all 106 samples have been sent to Delhi to check for the new strain in February. The six people, who have tested positive for the new strain, don’t have any national or international travel history. This is a serious issue because the infection of the new strain spreads very fast. Earlier, the new strain was confirmed in two people, who had returned from UK in January.”Sharma said the numbers of active cases are increasing by the day. If the condition doesn’t improve in the next three days, we have to write to the home department to seek permission to impose night curfew in the district.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also held a review meeting on Friday to discuss with the divisional commissioners the steps being taken to contain the spread of the infection.After Indore, the highest number of active cases have been reported from Bhopal, Jabalpur, Betul, Ujjain and Chhindwara on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-new-cases-of-uk-s-covid-19-strain-found-in-indore-warning-issued-101614971477658.html
06-03-2021||India||Container Corporation of India to push production, end dependency on China||State-run Container Corporation of India (Concor) on Friday said it will no longer depend on China for its requirements for containers and will meet its need for around 8, 000 containers from domestic manufacturers.“As of now, all containers are imported because there is no manufacturing capability in India. We want to push India as a manufacturing hub for containers… Our requirement is 8,000 containers every year for the next five years. This is enough to support the start of manufacturing in India,” V Kalyana Rama, chairman and managing director of Concor, said at a press conference on Friday.Concor, which spends about ₹200 crore annually on procurement of containers, has already given a developmental order for 1,000 containers each to Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) and Braithwaite & Co -- both public sector undertakings. Concor said it will soon issue tenders for the remaining 6,000 containers wherein only domestic firms will be able to participate as per certain government rules.He added that it is important that containers made in India are globally competitive as there is a huge demand for containers in the global market. However, currently, there is a cost difference of about 25-30 per cent in containers made in India and abroad. “We need to see how we can reduce the cost of production to compete globally,” he said.He also added that two companies are developing prototypes currently and testing results should be out by next month||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/container-corporation-of-india-to-push-production-end-dependency-on-china-101614970449671.html
06-03-2021||India||BJP releases first list of 70 candidates for Assam polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), heading the coalition government in Assam, released a list of 70 candidates on Friday for the first two phases of the assembly polls in the state.National general secretary of the party Arun Singh released the list in Delhi in the presence of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Assam unit president Ranjeet Kumar Dass and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.As per the seat-sharing formula decided after several meetings in Delhi over the past two days, the BJP will contest 92 of the total 126 seats while alliance partner Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) will contest 26. Eight seats have been allotted to new ally United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL).Voting for the election to the Assam assembly would take place in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6. Names of the remaining BJP candidates will be announced later.Sonowal will contest his present constituency Majuli while Dass and Sarma would contest the Patacharkuchi and Jalukbari seats (which will go to the polls in the third phase) respectively. Dass represented the Sarbhog seat in 2016.“The decision to allot the Patacharkuchi seat to our state unit chief was taken as per the wishes of local party workers. Hence respecting their demand, Dass would contest a new seat,” Sarma said.In the first list, 11 of the BJP’s sitting MLAs have been replaced with new faces. There is speculation that upset with denial of tickets, several of these legislators could join other parties or contest as independent candidates.Two former Congress ministers, Gautam Roy and Ajanta Neog, who joined the BJP a few months ago were given tickets from the Katigorah and Golaghat seats, respectively.The alliance partners decided not to give a ticket to former chief minister and AGP founder Prafulla Kumar Mahanta from the Barhampur seat, which he has been winning consecutively since 1991.Mahanta who was undergoing treatment in Delhi returned to Guwahati on Friday. There is speculation that a miffed Mahanta might split the party and field candidates on 15 seats or even join the Congress-led alliance.Mahanta’s seat will be contested by the BJP this time. The saffron party will also have candidates in three other seats, Lakhimpur, Kamalpur and Naharkatiya, which the AGP won in 2016. Similarly, the AGP got the Raha and Chabua seats won by the BJP five years ago.Addressing the press conference, AGP president Atul Bora announced the names of the 26 seats the party would contest, without disclosing candidates’ names. The list of seats allotted to the UPPL and its candidates will be announced later in Guwahati.In 2016, the BJP fielded candidates on 84 seats and won 60 while the AGP contested 24 and won 14. The Bodoland Peoples’ Front, which was part of the BJP-led coalition but joined the Congress-led grand alliance this time, won 12 of the 16 seats it contested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpreleases-first-list-of-70-candidates-for-assam-polls-101614968219326.html
06-03-2021||India||Kerala CM and Speaker knew about gold smuggling, HC told||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, three ministers of his LDF (Left Democratic Front) cabinet and the Speaker of the assembly were aware of the gold and dollar smuggling activities routed through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram, the customs department told the Kerala High Court on Friday, citing the main accused in the case, Swapna Suresh.In the affidavit customs commissioner Sumit Kumar said the accused (Suresh) revealed in her statement that the CM and the former consular general had close connections and were part of several illegal monetary transactions. He added that Suresh also claimed that former principal secretary of the CM M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was the main link between politicians, consulate officials and the smuggling syndicate. She further said that since she knew Arabic she was often called to translate their conversations, the affidavit added.The submission created a stir in the poll-bound state (elections are on April 6), with the chief minister and his CPI(M) dismissing it as a “cheap poll-time gimmick”.The Congress (it heads the UDF, the LFD’s main rival in the state) and the BJP sought the immediate resignation of the chief minister. “He has no right to continue in power for a minute. He has brought shame to the state,” said opposition leader, the Congress’ Ramesh Chennithala. “The CM and his ministers’ involvement is clear now. Vijayan can’t cling on to power now,” said BJP president K Surendran.Those named in Suresh’s statement, given last year to a magistrate under Section 164 of the Indian Penal Code, may be asked to explain things by the Enforcement Directorate, which on Friday, filed a fresh application in court seeking copies of the customs department’s affidavit and Suresh’s statement.Sivasankar has already come under fire for his connections with Suresh, was arrested, and is now out on bail.“The respondent (Swapan Suresh) clearly stated about the improper and illegal activities of the CM, three ministers and the Speaker. She also further stated about the involvement and kickbacks received by high-profile persons from various deals,” said the customs affidavit.HT has reviewed a copy of the affidavit. “The role of former principal secretary (M Sivasankar) in acting as the link between the high-profile politicians of Kerala and UAE consulate officials as well as some others in co-ordinating illegal financial dealings under the cover of various activities and projects of the state government was also revealed by her (Suresh),” it said.“She has stated with clarity about smuggling of foreign currency at the instance of the Chief Minister and Speaker.” .The customs filed this affidavit in response to a petition by the state government challenging certain remarks made by the chief judicial magistrate court (economic offence) in Kochi. Presently lodged in women jail in Thiruvananthapuram, Suresh requested the court last year to provide special security to her in jail and family members outside. A senior official of the customs said the Speaker, P Sivaramakrishnan will be summoned next week for questioning.The CPI(M) said central agencies are trying to discredit the state government. The party has announced protest rallies outside customs offices at several cities in response. “BJP has unleashed central agencies on Kerala in an effort to torpedo our unprecedented development. The Congress is in cahoots with them. People will not bow down to such anti-Kerala elements,” tweeted the Chief Minister. “It is move to denigrate the state and CM,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.The sensational gold smuggling case came to light last July after customs seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram as diplomatic baggage. Later the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and at least four other central agencies are part of the probe now. The NIA and other agencies arrested 30 persons in connection with the case including the CM’s former principal secretary, M Sivasankar, and questioned a minister and many others. The central agencies also filed cases related to the smuggling of dollars and other crimes related to the main offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-and-speaker-knew-about-gold-smuggling-hc-told-101614968159305.html
06-03-2021||India||'Quad summit to become feature of Indo-Pacific engagement': Morrison||The leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad are set to hold their first summit in a virtual format this month, with the US administration taking the initiative to set up the meeting, people familiar with developments said on Friday.Confirmation about the meeting came from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who told a news conference that he had discussed the matter with US President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in recent conversations.“So, I am looking forward to that first gathering of the Quad leaders. It will be the first-ever such gathering,” he said in response to a question from a reporter on whether he had received an invitation for the meeting.The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the virtual summit is expected to be held on March 12.There was no official word from the Indian side on the development.Also read: 'India wants normal ties with all neighbours, including Pakistan' - MEAThe US had also taken the lead in organising the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the Quad on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions across the region. That meeting had reiterated the group’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.Formed in 2007, the Quad was revived in 2017 as a gathering of senior officials of the four countries. It was upgraded to the level of the foreign ministers in September 2019, reflecting the desire of the four countries to work more closely on shared interests in the Indo-Pacific and India’s comfort with the group.Morrison told the news conference that the four Quad leaders are looking forward to the first virtual summit and follow-up face-to-face meetings.“This will become a feature of the Indo-Pacific engagement but it’s not going to be a big bureaucracy with a big secretariat and those sort of things. It will be four leaders, four countries working together constructively for the peace, prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific, which is good for everyone in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.“It’s particularly good for our ASEAN friends [and] those throughout the southwest Pacific to ensure that they can continue with their own sovereignty and their own certainty for their own futures,” he added.Morrison said the Quad Summit was one of the first things he and US president Joe Biden had discussed when they spoke on phone on February 3. The Quad, he added, was central to ongoing arrangements between Australia and the US.“The Quad is very central to the US and our thinking about the region and looking at the Indo-Pacific also through the prism of our ASEAN partners and their vision of the Indo-Pacific,” he said.Biden and US secretary of state Antony Blinken had made clear that their re-engagement in multilateral organisations is “key to building stability and peace in the Indo-Pacific”, Morrison said. “We share that view, we encourage that view, and we strongly welcome that view,” he added.The move to hold the first Quad Summit fits in with the Biden administration’s position that China is its biggest security challenge and competitor on the global stage.While the former Trump administration had talked of formalising and expanding the Quad, questions have been raised on whether the Biden administration will adopt a more cautious approach to the group as a counter-balance to China.Chinese officials have likened the Quad to a “mini NATO” and said its activities are aimed at targeting third parties, a charge rejected by the four members of the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-virtual-quad-summit-to-promote-prosperity-stability-of-indopacific-101614966986134.html
06-03-2021||India||Natural hazards, infra development magnified Chamoli disaster: ICIMOD||Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has underlined the link between the February 7 glacier breach disaster in Uttarakhand’s Rishi Ganga river with infrastructure development, particularly the construction of hydropower projects in the higher reaches of the Himalayas.In its analysis of the disaster published on March 3 titled “Understanding the Chamoli flood: Cause, process, impacts, and context of rapid infrastructure development” by cryosphere experts, hydrologists, climate scientists have concluded that the Hindu Kush Himalayas are a multi-hazard environment and that hydropower projects, apart from amplifying disaster risk, impact environmental flows, water quality, and the health of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. On the other hand, these projects are also facing risks from climate change-related flow variations, extreme events, erosion and sedimentation, and glacial laker outburst floods (GLOFs)/ Landslides Dammed Outburst Flood (LDOFs).Also Read | Experts slam claim that human activity not behind Chamoli disasterThe analysis is significant because the Defence Geo-informatics Research Establishment, under Defence Research and Development Organisation, had recently said the tragedy was not “immediately” a human-induced disaster. “There is a need to look upon the demographic pressures in a systematic way but as far as this particular tragedy is concerned in our preliminary investigations the role of human activity is not the immediate cause... It [glacial breach] was far away from the area where several constructions [NTPC hydel power project in Tapovan and Rishi Ganga hydel plant] are taking place,” said Lokesh Sinha, director of DGRE.“HKH is a multi-hazard environment. Often these hazards are of a cascading nature with multiple hazards interconnected with a primary hazard trigger and a chain of secondary and tertiary hazards. Human interference in the mountain environment is rapidly increasing. Mountain settlements are increasing in size and land use patterns are changing. Infrastructure such as roads and hydropower projects are rapidly penetrating mountain landscapes. The interplay between natural hazards with human settlements and infrastructure is an important aspect, which can significantly escalate the impacts of event like the Chamoli flood,” ICIMOD said in its analysis.A cascading disaster is a common phenomenon observed in the Hindu Kush Himalayas region and one of the prominent recent examples is the Uttarakhand flood of 2013, which started with heavy rainfall and caused a chain of events, including landslides, flash floods, and the Chorabari lake outburst and debris flow, which killed more than 6,000 people and damaged roads, bridges, and buildings, the analysis said, adding that “Similar hazard events or in combination with other geophysical processes can damage several hydropower stations, which can be further exacerbated with future floods in the context of global climate change also suggest that snow avalanches involving wet snow even in winter will occur more frequently in the mountainous regions.”There are 105 existing hydropower projects (HP) (≥ 40 MW) with an installed capacity of 37 GW, 61 projects (≥40 MW) currently under construction (39 GW) and 890 projects (≥10 MW) in various stages of planning (242 GW) in the Karakoram-Himalaya region. Most of the existing hydropower projects were built in the past two or three decades. Now projects are gradually moving upstream where the exposure to mountain hazards is high, the chances of multiple hazards happening in combination and occurring more frequently, and cascading effects can create compounding impacts on the system.Overall, ICIMOD has concluded that the Chamoli flood was not caused by a GLOF as there were no significant glacial lakes in the area. The flood was triggered by a massive rockslide just below Ronti peak, of ~22 million m3 of rock mixed with ice and snow. The energy of the fall melted the ice creating the source of flood. This also remobilised the debris and ice on the valley floor and created an excessive flood wave. A couple of days prior to the flash floods, a strong western disturbance had resulted in heavy precipitation, which may have increased the flood magnitude downstream.The disaster and related debris flow are likely to have caused damage to four hydropower projects along the Rishi Ganga, Dhauliganga and Alaknanda river path. The Rishi Ganga Hydropower Project (13.2 MW) near Raini village, located 14km downstream from the impact site was the first to be hit by the debris after the rockslide. The unfinished Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Project (520 MW) , 8km downstream from Rishi Ganga Hydropower Project, was the second hydropower plant hit by the flood. The Vishnuprayag Hydro Electric Project 35km downstream and Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydro Electric Project 55km downstream may have also been impacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/natural-hazards-infra-development-magnified-chamoli-disaster-icimod-101614942658848.html
06-03-2021||India||Didn’t expect a bed of roses, but the armed forces groomed me: Lieutenant General Madhuri Kanitkar||Her journey in the Indian Army began at a time when cadets still marched in traditional sarees to become officers. Clad in a smart uniform with her hair up in a bun, Lieutenant General Madhuri Kanitkar’s (AVSM, VSM) voice asking everyone, “How’s the Josh?!” reverberated through the NCC auditorium filled with cadets and officers of the armed forces attending the exclusive screening of National Geographic’s Women’s Day special film - Women of honour : Destination Army. Being the senior most woman officer in the Indian Army, Kanitkar is the third woman to attain this position. Serving in the defence for a span of thirty seven years in capacity of a medical professional, Dr Kanitkar’s life hasn’t exactly been a bed of roses. “When you’re working in any job the challenge is to balance your family and professional life. In the army it probably compounds more because you’re always on the move because of postings, and you’re moving your children and your family too and if you don’t have your spouse with you the difficulties seem more,” shares Kanitkar who had to stay away from her husband to serve the nation for many years.Not one to accept defeat, Kanitkar’s journey as a woman officer in the armed forces to rising to such a celebratory rank was successful because of her resilient attitude of taking everything in her stride! “Every time there was a challenge, I overcame it and said to myself ‘Ab yeh karliya toh ab main kuch bhi kar sakti hun,’ till the next challenge came and then the next, until today when I look back and say I think it was all worth it,” she shares adding, “Today the Army’s processes are so pro women! Postings are helped out. 24 years me and my husband were not posted together but I stand here being an empowered woman because I have the support of the army and my husband and I think that is what is important. And with each of these challenges I felt that I was becoming a stronger person.”When Kanitkar joined the armed forces, which still remains to be a feel dominated by male presence, was she mentally prepared for every challenge that would come her way and as an organisation, is the Indian Army gender sensitive? “I feel I came in the Indian army with my eyes open and I was not expecting a bed of roses so there were difficult times but the armed forces groomed me. It’s an organisation which toughens you and gives you an opportunity to become an officer, remain a lady, do your profession, and the whole nation looks up to you. Indian army is one of the most respected organisation, it’s the safest places to work in and you’re really respected. You’re respected not for a women, you’re respected as an individual as an officer and then you’re also a women,” shares Kanitkar.It’s natural to wonder how it feels to be a woman in a force where you’re surrounded by men at high ranks in a field that tests your mental resilience and physical strength. The armed forces is now slowly seeing an increase in the presence of female youngsters, “Your gender doesn’t matter. Soldier doesn’t have a gender. When I was the dean, the dean did not have a gender. Gender is something in our mind but we use that gender because that gender is power. We have an extra X chromosome. We have the ability to multi task and a fire in our belly and we are here to prove that we can do everything along side with our dream.” Author tweets @fizzybuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/didnt-expect-a-bed-of-roses-but-the-armed-forces-groomed-me-lieutenant-general-madhuri-kanitkar-101614934316431.html
