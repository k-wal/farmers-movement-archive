Whether it was ISRO espionage case of 1990s, Suryanelli sex scandal, ice cream parlour case, solar cheating and latest gold smuggling case, these scandals play a crucial role in making or breaking governments in the most literate state, poll history of the shows.No election passed in Kerala without a scandal. And in most cases a woman with a dubious past played the lead role. The ruling Left was always first to cash in on such scandals, but this time it tastes its own medicine in the gold smuggling case. In the latest gold smuggling case, the key accused is Swapna Suresh, who held key positions while allegedly sewing up a strong network with the help of the powerful smuggling lobby, investigators have said.“While the earlier Congress regime was involved in the solar scam, the present government is neck-deep in the gold smuggling case. In the first, Saritha Nair was the main accused and in the second Swapna Suresh. Both, Congress and CPI(M), have massive appetite for scandals,” said Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman last week, while addressing a rally in Ernakulam. True, it is Saritha Vs Swapna this time.“There is a certain element of spinning in some cases particularly when the Left was in the opposition because its propaganda machinery is strong. Some scandals are totally fabricated like the spy case. But some of the recent scandals have more merit because they are backed by documents,” said G Pramod Kumar, a political observer and former advisor of the United Nations Development Programme. He said controversies and scandals were part of the state polity in the last three decades and mushrooming digital media also played its part in amplifying them.ISRO spy case (1994)In 2019, the Kerala government had handed over an additional compensation of ₹1.30 crore to former scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Nambi Narayanan (80) to settle the two- and a -half- decade- old ISRO espionage case in which he was implicated by state police and other agencies. The Supreme Court- ordered three-member judicial panel is still probing the conspiracy angle of the scandal that blew up a top scientist’s career and reportedly delayed the country’s cryogenic project.The sensational case surfaced in 1994 and the then chief minister K Karunakaran was forced to quit after a section of his Congress party led by A K Antony and Oommen Chandy revolted against him as the name of then senior police officer Ramon Srivastav cropped up in the case. It was alleged that two senior scientists of ISRO, Nambi Narayanan and D Sasikumaran, had sold space secrets for money and sexual favours. Two Maldivian women were also arrested in connection with the case. Srivastav was then the inspector general of police (IGP).However, in 1998, the Supreme Court quashed the case after accepting the CBI inquiry report that the case was cooked up. When the espionage case was unearthed, Narayanan was in charge of the cryogenic division. He was the first to introduce liquid fuel rocket technology. The country’s space technology had to suffer badly due to the espionage case, Narayanan said in one of the interviews pointing to a larger conspiracy in the case.Known as the ISRO spy case, it generated enough heat and dust and many books were written over the sensational issue and it affected the political career of former CM K Karunakaran also. It is a different story though that the Communists, who ballooned the scandal, finally paid the compensation to him after two- and a –half- decades. In 2019, the country had conferred him with the second highest civilian award Padma Bhushan. In two subsequent polls, Lok Sabha in 1999 and assembly in 2001, the spy case was hotly debated.Suryanelli scandal (1996)The case relates to the abduction of a 16-year-old girl in Suryanelli village in Idukki district by a bus conductor in 1996 in the guise of love. After staying with her for many days, he handed over the minor to a woman named Usha, second accused in the case and S S Dharmarajan, the prime accused. According to the prosecution, she was taken to different places by the accused and presented to 41 persons for monetary benefits. Her plight came to light after she was admitted to a hospital with some diseases.The accused include many influential people-- four businessmen, two advocates, two politicians, two railway employees and a nurse. On Sept 2, 2000, a court in Kottayam convicted 31 accused with jail terms ranging from four to 13 years and acquitted four persons. But in 2005, the high court acquitted all except the main accused, Dharmarajan, and the verdict was challenged in the Supreme Court by the state government.In 2013, the SC set aside the high court verdict and ordered a retrial. A year later (2014), the Supreme Court awarded jail to 23 accused (seven to 12 years) and acquitted seven persons and awarded life term to main accused Dharmarajan. Former deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha P J Kurian’s name also cropped up in the case but he was given a clean chit by the apex court. In the 1999 Parliament poll and 2001 assembly elections, the Suryanelli case was debated and the CPI(M) used it to paint Congress leaders in a bad light. They coined enough slogans and epithets to blame its opponents. Later, the victim was given a government job and a house. The 42-year-old recently told a news channel that stigma still hounds her.Ice cream parlour case (1997)The case surfaced in 1997 after the deaths by suicide of two teenage girls in north Kerala’s Kozhikkode. During investigation it was found that these girls were allegedly lured by an ice cream parlour owner, also a woman, and pushed into to flourishing sex racket. An NGO Anweshi, led by former Maoist leader K Ajitha, took up the case alleging a number of high and mighty were involved in exploiting girls. Prominent among them was Muslim League leader P K Kunhalikutty, who was a minister in the UDF government. In 2005, he was forced to resign from the Ooomen Chandy government.But later, different courts absolved him of all charges. But the case came to focus again in 2011 after Kunhalikutty’s kin alleged that he paid a huge sum of money to silence some of the victims. Then the LDF government led by V S Achuthanandan later ordered a fresh probe into the alleged sabotage bid. It also failed to make much impact after the special investigation team filed a closure report in the court. Later, Achuthanandan filed a new complaint in Kerala high court questioning the SIT decision to close the case and it is still pending before the court.Though the sensational case failed to make any headway, the CPI(M) used it to the hilt to target its political opponents. Later in one of the interviews, Kunhalikutty said it hounded him so much that he even contemplated suicide but his intense faith in his religion dissuaded him. At least in two assembly elections, the ice cream parlour case stirred the pot.Solar case (2013)Last month the Kerala government handed over the solar case, which virtually led to the fall of Oommen Chandy regime five years ago, to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Main accused in the scandal, Saritha Nair petitioned chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan last year, complaining that she was yet to get justice in the sexual assault cases she filed against many Congress leaders and she wanted a central agency probe. The government dusted out her complaint to checkmate the opposition barbs in the gold smuggling case.The solar cheating case relates to an alleged con woman Saritha Nair, her second husband Biju Radhakrishnan, who was later convicted in a murder case, floated a fictitious company called ‘Team Solar’ in 2013 and cheated many, promising them stakes in the firm and heavy returns after selling imported solar panels. They allegedly cultivated good sources in corridors of power and flaunted their contacts to attract investors.The cheating case came to light in 2014 and 60 cases were registered against the two accused. Then CM Chandy had sacked two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names cropped up in the case. Later, the main accused Nair raised sexual assault charges against many Congress leaders including then CM Chandy, K C Venugopal, Adoor Prakash MP, A P Anil Kumar, Hibi Eden MP and others. She alleged she was sexually exploited for favours rendered to her.Nair was convicted in eight cheating cases but she is out on bail. Two months ago, she also figured in another cheating case. She allegedly took money from some youth promising them government jobs. She was not arrested in the case by the government, fearing that her contention in the solar case may weaken. Though the state government pressurised the CBI, it is yet to take up the case and Chandy, who is leading Congress’ bid to return to power, said he was ready for any probe.Also Read: Kerala minister says notices to investment fund board 'cheap poll gimmick'Gold smuggling case (2020)Last in the series, the gold smuggling case came to light last July after 30 kg gold was seized from a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic baggage from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.After recovery of concealed gold, a person who came to receive the consignment, P S Sartih Kumar, a former employee of the consulate, was arrested by the customs. Later, the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Later, NIA arrested main accused Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bengaluru.The case took a political colour after CM Pinarayi Vijayan fired his close aide M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, for his alleged liaison with Suresh. He was later arrested by the Enforcement Directorate and got bail after three months in judicial custody.Soon juicy and spicy stories started appearing in the media. During investigation it was found that her degree certificate was also fake, and she was close to many other politicians. Another secretary of the CM, higher education minister K T Jaleel and many others were also grilled by central agencies. At least five central agencies are involved in the probe now. Subsequently, many other irregularities like kickbacks in the Life Mission project and money laundering case also came to light.Also Read: EC meets revenue officials ahead of assembly pollsOpposition trained its gun on the CM alleging his office was aware of the thriving smuggling through the consulate office, which was going on for more than a year. There are intelligence reports that more than 500 kg gold was smuggled into the country in a year.“The CM sacrificed his secretary to get away from the case. If the case was investigated properly, his role would come to light. Now the case has been put on back burner due to a tacit understanding between the state and the central governments,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, adding that weakening the case was part of home minister Amit Shah’s pet project of “Congress-mukt Bharat”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/espionage-to-smuggling-scandals-spice-up-every-poll-in-kerala-101614779113974.html
03-03-2021||News||Why 2021 political rhetoric is no match for 1962 fighting in Ladakh||While a slanging match between the ruling government and opposition over Chinese aggression in East Ladakh is part of political play in a democracy, the official history of the 1962 war places the ongoing standoff in the western sector in a proper perspective with cold and brutal facts. “History of The Conflict with China, 1962” was released by the Narasimha Rao government in 1993 with a foreword by one of India’s most illustrious civil servants Narender Nath Vohra, who was Defence Secretary at that time.Although the document is voluminous and covers the fighting in western, central and eastern sectors, the seventh chapter called “Fighting in Ladakh” presents a very sobering read to any Indian. Consider this:There is a strong view that the PLA is dragging its feet over disengagement in Gogra-Hot Springs and Depsang Bulge area. But PM Modi’s government has made it clear that for the restoration of normal bilateral ties, there has to be complete disengagement and de-escalation. Any selective disengagement has been ruled out by India.While the Gogra-Hot Springs stand-off is part of the current PLA aggression, the issue of patrolling rights of the Indian Army in Depsang Bulge is part of the 2013 legacy, when the PLA blocked the ingress route by making a stand at Raki and Jeevan nullah.Even though the PLA wants an advantage in Gogra-Hot Springs and Depsang bulge area, it is seriously wary of the Indian Army after the August 29-30, 2020 action taken under the leadership of Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat and Army Chief MM Naravane on the south banks of Pangong Tso. On that day, the two countries nearly came to war after the Indian army commanders atop Rezang La-Rechin La ridge threatened to fire at the advancing PLA tank regiment which was trying to dislodge the Indian troopers. The PLA figured the Indian army commanders weren’t going to back down and promptly halted the brazen military manoeuvre. History was made that day as this is neither the army of 1962 nor is the political leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-2021-political-rhetoric-is-no-match-for-1962-fighting-in-ladakh-101614758945822.html
03-03-2021||Other||HC registers PIL on vaccination of judges, lawyers and court staff||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday registered a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) to examine the issue of Covid vaccination for members of the judiciary, employees, court staff and advocates.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli took note of a communication sent by the chairman of Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), Ramesh Gupta who had sought directions to the concerned administrative/ medical authorities to make available necessary infrastructure in court premises, particularly in medical dispensaries and other “appropriate places conducive for vaccination”.The lawyers’ body had also sought vaccination of the members of the judiciary, the employees/staff working in the courts, as well as the advocates who throng the courts to attend to their cases, by treating them as well, as frontline workers.The court accepted the contention of the BCD and said that “prima facie there is weight in the claim made by them for declaring all persons associated with the judicial functioning, which includes the Judges, the court Staff and the lawyers as frontline workers, so that they could receive vaccination on priority, and without limitations of their age or physical condition”.The court issued notices to the Centre, ministry of health and family welfare, and the two vaccine manufacturers -- the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.The bench said that there is a clear pattern emerging that the number of Covid-19 cases increases with greater intermingling and congregation of people. It noted that the premises of the Delhi high court and some of the district courts are air-conditioned and with increased footfall, there is likelihood of the rate of infection amongs those who attend the courts spiking, once the full-fledged physical functioning of courts in Delhi resumes.“We may observe that the co-morbidities enlisted by the government to accommodate persons falling in the age group of 45 to 60 years, are serious conditions from which the Judges, the court staff and advocates may, or may not, be suffering.“Even if, they are not found to be suffering from one of the co-morbidities, it does not mean that the risk of their contracting the disease and suffering serious health issues – including fatality, does not exist. To examine the aforesaid aspects, we are inclined to register this communication of Ramesh Gupta, chairman, Bar Council of Delhi dated March 1 as a Public Interest Litigation,” the bench said in its order.It said that the need of the hour is to vaccinate the masses on a war footing so as to secure the life and health of all those who step out of their homes to attend to their avocations and professions. It said that courts, by their very nature, are places which have very high density congregations of people on a daily basis.“Hundreds and thousands of cases are listed in any given court complex every day. Apart from judges, the court staff – which is substantial, and advocates – who have to attend to their respective cases, and a large number of litigants visit courts in which their cases are listed, on a daily basis. Since, the cases listed on any given day are mostly different from those listed on the previous day, or the next day, the litigants visiting the Courts constitute a different group from day to day to a great extent,” it said.It asserted that such peculiarity exposes the judges, court staff, and the lawyers functioning in the court system to the risk of contracting the disease from not only each other, but also from the large number of litigants who visit the courts every day to attend to their cases.“In fact, the number of persons visiting a court complex – such as the Tiz Hazari courts on any given day, may well be in excess of the number of persons visiting and thronging the hospital for treatment of patients,” it said citing an example.The matter will be now heard on March 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcregisters-pil-on-vaccination-of-judges-lawyers-and-court-staff-101614795332788.html

I think, time has come to tell them to focus on academics and all of us should work towards achieving excellence in our university,” Kumar told PTI.The JNUTA on Monday had alleged that the delay in appointing the new V-C was “deliberate” in order to further extend Kumar’s term. The teachers’ body also said that for the first time in the history of the university, teaching staff salaries have been delayed by a month. It had also raised concerns over the changes in admission process, recruitment process and other functioning at the university under Kumar’s tenure.Kumar’s five-year controversial tenure as the V-C officially came to an end on January 26, but the government has asked him to continue till a successor his found.While he did not share as to by when a regular V-C will be appointed, Kumar said he will continue to hold office until a replacement comes. “The JNU Act states that the current vice chancellor will continue in office until a new vice chancellor takes over,” he said. “The executive council has to choose two experts, and they’re given to the ministry. We have done our job. So, whatever the process that takes place, that the ministry will take care of,” he said.Rejecting concerns raised by the JNUTA about his tenure, Kumar said the governance system of the university had only strengthened in the last five years.“If anybody is saying that this university has not progressed, they are misrepresenting, and it is only those people who want to see this university get destroyed…it is only those people who are spreading this misinformation.“During the last five years, we have been following all university statutes, regulations and ordinances in letter and spirit. And we have also been following all the UGC notifications and rules. And this is what has strengthened the governance system in the university,” he said.Responding to the JNUTA’s allegation that it was under him that the teachers did not receive their salaries on time, for the month of February, he said, “Yes, there was a delay of one day. Yesterday, all the staff members were issued their salaries. And today, we already have received the funds from UGC in our bank. And the salaries are being dispersed to everybody.” Kumar said that while he was welcoming of “dissent, and protests”, he is wary of spreading “false propaganda”.According to Kumar, the admission process, which is being taken care of by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for the last few years, had made the exercise “transparent and accessible”. “In fact, as part of the National Education Policy, most of the entrance examinations in future will be conducted by the NTA. So, I fail to understand their logic, why they are (JNUTA) against JNU working with NTA to conduct the entrance examinations,” he said.Talking about JNUTA’s opposition to the establishment of management and engineering colleges, the V-C said, the move was meant to “broaden the academic programs of the university”.Kumar said that barring this “small cross-section of faculty members”, the entire student and teacher community of JNU “was appreciative of a large number of reforms that we have carried out, whether they are academic reforms, or administrative reforms”.“We respect dissent, we respect protests. We want to provide every opportunity for them to freely express their opinions, but, there is a difference between people who are perpetually creating confusion by spreading false propaganda, and those who want to genuinely express their disagreement with something. So we need to separate these two. This university is known for debate discussion, and freedom of expression, and we will continue to protect that,” he said. Reacting on the V-C’s statement, JNUTA secretary Moushumi Basu said, “JNUTA condemns this spin which is being manufactured by the V-C -- a few teachers bringing a bad name to the JNU. A large section of the faculty is opposing the arbitrary decisions taken by this V-C. Many issues raised by JNUTA are already declared illegal by the high court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-spreading-false-propaganda-says-jnu-v-c-jagadesh-kumar-101614795212742.html
03-03-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 cases reported among students, parents urge schools to hold online exams||In light of Covid-19 cases being reported among school-going children, school administrators are taking extra precautions to ensure student safety as parents are now apprehensive about sending children to school. Public and private schools in the national capital had reopened for students of classes 9 to 12, between January and February, after remaining shut since March 2020 when the pandemic had hit the country.Parent association groups said students in at least two Delhi schools has tested positive for Covid-19 after attending in-person classes. Adding to their worries is a recent report from Karnal, Haryana, that 54 students there had contracted the disease after attending school. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said 78 persons, including 54 students, had tested positive on Tuesday. He said school authorities have been alerted and affected blocks have been declared as containment zones. Classes and other activities have also been suspended.On Monday, Queen Mary’s school postponed exams for classes 9 and 11 and closed its campus for a week after a student allegedly tested positive for Covid-19, two days after attending school. The announcement came after a group of parents protested outside its campus on Monday. The school denied all allegations of social distancing norms not being followed on the premises.Parent groups organised protests outside multiple schools on Wednesday as well. Aprajita Gautam. president, Delhi Parents Association said parents are also questioning the need for in-person exams for students of classes 9 and 12. “We have been getting messages that schools are trying to suppress information if a student tests positive for Covid. Our association had received mails and calls from parents saying they are worried about sending their children to school,” said Gautam.“When parents from Venkateshwar International School got to know that a student tested positive for Covid-19, 200 parents submitted a memorandum to the school on Monday morning asking the school to allow students to take the exams online. After the protest, the school allowed the online option,” said Gautam.The parent of a class 11 student at the school, requesting anonymity, said exams were supposed to begin from Wednesday. “School officials said they weren’t clear about the reports of the said student and wanted to hold offline exams. Teachers in contact with the child didn’t quarantine themselves. My child had interacted with that student and since there was no school transport, many students had gone back home together. We were worried and asked for online exams but the school dismissed our concerns at first. Later, they agreed and sent a note late Tuesday night,” said a parent.Manisha Sharma, principal of Venkateshwar International School, in Dwarka’s Sector 10, said the school had not received any formal communication from the parents about the student’s Covid-19 status.“We circulated a note among parents that such a rumour was going around. We informed them that the student had attended classes for one day, over 15 days ago. There are provisions for offline and online classes. So, there is no chance of students or staff being under risk,” she said.The school said it held “special weekly meetings” with support staff and stakeholders to ensure that proper sanitisation and Covid-19 protocols were being implemented.“We have to address concerns of anxious students who don’t have devices and wanted to take the exams in the offline mode. Our support staff are well trained and we have ensured that everything -- from doorknobs and handles to staircase and balcony railings -- is thoroughly sanitised and there is no risk to anyone’s health,” she said.Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, which was one of the first private schools in the capital to reopen for board students on January 18, said their school has ensured that they don’t deviate from Covid-19 protocols, which helped in mitigating parent concerns.“Instructions are being repeated every day to ensure that the guidelines are strictly followed and there is no lapse. We do the orientation with parents and students on a regular basis. We have also requested parents not to attend social gatherings as children have their exams. Even if parents have to go out, we have asked them to ensure that children are following safety norms for their own sake,” said principal Alka Kapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-cases-reported-among-students-parents-urge-schools-to-hold-online-exams-101614795152895.html
03-03-2021||Delhi||AAP wins four of 5 municipal wards in by-polls, BJP draws a blank while Cong wins one||: A year ahead of elections to Delhi’s municipal corporations, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday won four out of five wards in civic bypolls held on February 28, while the Congress bagged one seat, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been the ruling party in the three MCDs for 14 years now, drew a blank.Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal said the result were a positive message for his party ahead of the 2022 contest. “The results show that the people of Delhi trust the AAP’s model of good governance,” he said, before accusing the BJP of corruption and misgovernance in the three municipal bodies.In terms of overall vote share, the AAP got 46.1% of the total votes cast. The Congress and the BJP got 27.29% and 21.84% respectively, according to election commission data.Out of the five seats that went to bypolls on February 28, AAP retained three seats that it had won in the 2017 municipal polls, and gained one from the BJP, while losing one to the Congress.The bypoll results are a blow to the BJP -- the party lost all seats with margins varying from 2,700 to 7,000 votes, which are significant given the sizes of wards, indicating the people’s dissatisfaction with the performance of the civic bodies.Of the five wards, the AAP pushed the BJP to second place in four -- Kalyanpuri (margin of 7,043) and Trilokpuri East (margin of 4,986) in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation; and Rohini-C (margin of 2,985 votes) and Shalimar Bagh (margin of 2,705) in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.While the first three were won by the AAP in 2017 municipal polls, too, Shalimar Bagh was won by the BJP in the last municipal polls.The AAP, however, lost Chauhan Banger ward (one of the few wards with a large Muslim population) in east Delhi to the Congress by a margin of 10,642 votes. The five seats fell vacant after four councillors won the assembly elections in 2020 representing the AAP, and one -- Renu Jaju, former BJP councillor from the Shalimar Bagh ward -- died two years ago.During its bypolls campaign, AAP had hit out at the BJP for corruption, mismanagement and flawed policies, which, it alleged, has landed the corporations in a crisis. The BJP, on the other hand, was blaming the ruling party in the Capital for paralysing the corporations by not giving funds on time.“The BJP should resign from the municipal bodies after this miserable defeat and let the municipal polls happen in Delhi right now. People have lost their trust in the BJP. They believe that only the AAP can bring a positive change in the municipal corporations,” AAP’s incharge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak said on Wednesday.Accepting defeat in the bypolls, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said: “We accept the people’s verdict. But this is not the end. We will analyse the results and see where we went wrong. We still have a lot of time to prepare for the municipal polls.”While the Congress won just one seat, Chauhan Banger, the party’s vote share improved as compared to the 2020 assembly polls. Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said: “The impressive show by Congress in the by-elections and the victory in Chauhan Banger ward has raised the party’s overall vote share from 6% (in the last Assembly elections) to 22% now.”Rahul Verma, a fellow with the Centre for Policy Research, said, “In terms of overall figures, the AAP was in power in four of these five municipal seats, and they will continue to be in power in four. It has lost one seat and gained one. There is not much difference as far as the numbers are concerned. However, I would still say the party has much better prospects in the 2022 municipal polls. They have won the assembly polls with a huge majority for two terms now and the party machinery has strengthened at the grassroots level.”Tanvir Aeijaz, associate professor in the department of political science at Ramjas College, said, “These are local elections where the candidate matters a lot. In these elections, local issues are of real importance. People have seen and benefitted from AAP’s model of governance. The bypoll result indicates that people are happy with it.”Delhi has 272 municipal wards -- the north and south Delhi corporations have 104 wards each and the east corporation has 64 wards. The BJP has a majority in all three of them with 64, 70 and 47 councillors, respectively. If all three of them are taken together, the AAP and the Congress have 49 and 31 councillors, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-wins-four-of-5-municipal-wards-in-by-polls-bjp-draws-a-blank-while-cong-wins-one-101614795092804.html

While IT industry bosses termed the government’s new law as regressive, industrialists based in Manesar questioned the legality of the quota and said that they were looking for possibilities to challenge the government decision in a court of law as it will enable “another era of inspector raj in the state”. Haryana governor, Satyadev Narayan Arya, on Tuesday had given his assent to Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, which provides for 75% reservation in private sector to job seekers in the state which have a salary of less than ₹50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms. The quota will initially be applicable for 10 years, after it is notified by the government. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who made the job quota a central plank of his election campaign in 2019, on Wednesday said the state government will begin a massive employment campaign from next month for youths of the state to benefit, as per their qualification and skills. Chautala, however, also made it clear that the government will make an exemption in the reservation if the company fails to find a local skilled employee. He said the youth of the state will be entitled for jobs of chowkidar, security guard, clerk, steno clerk, and others which offer a monthly salary of ₹50,000. Stating that there is a provision of penalty if the firms violate rules of this law, he said private companies will have to mandatorily give complete details of their registration and employees on the portal. More than 300 Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Gurugram that has emerged as one of the largest IT and ITes hub in the country with several top companies setting up operations in the last two decades. It is also home to large auto and auto part makers such as Maruti, Hero Moto Corp and Honda, while garment exports also forms a major chunk of industry.Vinod Sood, managing director, Hughes Systiqe and chair, NASSCOM, Haryana, said that the new law and will send a very wrong message to MNCs and IT companies, which are headquartered abroad. “While all other states in India are coming up with forward-looking policies, this reservation will create a perception that Gurugram is no longer a business-friendly destination. Companies abroad don’t want to get into such technicalities and their immediate response would be to expand or shift to Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad. The reservations might have some caveats, but optics are too bad, and don’t augur well for the city” said Sood. IT companies also said that instead of imposing reservations there is need to train local youths and skill train them for these jobs. “We at Nagarro appreciate the desire of the Haryana government to create jobs for local youths. However, it is ironic that an industry that competes around the world and brings nearly ₹5 lakh crore in foreign exchange into India will have to deal with these restrictions that may hamper its operations and efficiency. We are also nervous that the current scope of reservations may be expanded later. We believe the best way to expand opportunities for Haryana’s youth is equipping them with skills,” Manas Fuloria, CEO, Nagarro, a city-based IT company. Industrialists based in Manesar were also worried that the job reservations will bring back the era of ‘inspector raj’ and it would be difficult to run industrial units. “Where are the workers in Haryana who are experts in leather cutting, fabric stitching, cutting, weaving. These jobs need talent and is mastered when generations work on the same skill set. This move will destroy the export industry and other manufacturing units in Gurugram and Haryana. We are looking for options to challenge this move in a court of law,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association, who heads an export company. The Confederation of Indian Industry’s Haryana chapter said that Haryana was already facing a tough competition in attracting industrial investment as other states are offering liberal industrial policies and employment incentive schemes. The government’s new move will prove to be quite the deterrent to bring in new investments and expansion of existing businesses. “The law mandating job reservation in private sector in Haryana will act as a blow to the industry-friendly image of Haryana. This law is detrimental to the economic growth of Haryana and will impact existing businesses present in the state by slowing down investments and further deteriorating the state’s ease of doing business ranking,” said Anadi Sinha, vice chairman, CII Gurugram zone and group president - HR and corporate affairs, Minda Industries Ltd, which has large presence in the city. Director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Chandrajit Banerjee, too released a statement which read, “At a time when it is important to attract investments at state level, the Haryana government could have avoided imposing restrictions. Reservation affects productivity and industry competitiveness. We hope the state government of Haryana re-looks at the legislation. With Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat’ we look forward to an integrated and mobile labour market within the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/industrialists-term-haryana-s-job-reservation-move-regressive-may-challenge-law-in-court-101614795032843.html
03-03-2021||Gurugram||Over 25 acres of Aravalli land encroached in Faridabad||A little over 25 acres of forest land in Ankhir village of Faridabad’s forest division have been encroached upon, with the construction of a boundary wall and a gate, officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Raj Kumar, the divisional forest officer for Faridabad forest division said, “We have learnt from locals that almost 25 acres of forest land have been illegally encroached upon in Ankhir village of the division and we will be investigating the matter.” The land in question is notified under special sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, which extends protection against land-use change to specified Aravalli patches, forests and trees. “This is an old issue where construction has been demolished two-three times earlier also and a case was lodged. Damage reports have also been filed in this case. We will once again probe the matter as we have learnt that a gate has been set up and the encroached area is being increased,” Kumar said. Ankhir is one of the two villages in Faridabad district (the other being Mewla Maharajpur), where over 90% of the village common land is notified under the PLPA. As per previous Supreme Court orders, this accords the land legal “forest” status, with protection under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Sarvadaman Oberoi, a city-based legal and environment activist, said, “There has been a construction of a new kuccha road, large-scale felling of trees and construction of walls in the Aravalli hills of Ankhir village in Faridabad district. Around five farmhouses covering about 25 acres have been made. The said area presents an encroachment in a hitherto fairly dense forest area and creates a block to the movement of wildlife due to its long length. The area falls in mushtil 19 and 20, as per the revenue record of Ankhir village.” He said that on the northern front, a 470-metre wall has been built and on the western side, a 230-metre section has been constructed. With internal divisions on the plot, at least three gates are visible through satellite data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-25-acres-of-aravalli-land-encroached-in-faridabad-101614794555712.html

03-03-2021||Gurugram||Four held for murdering two children in Meerut||The police on Wednesday arrested four persons for allegedly murdering two children of a 37-year-old woman by throwing them into a canal near Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. The bodies of the children, who were reported missing since February 27, were recovered early Wednesday, the police said. The woman was also allegedly pushed into the canal but rescued by locals.The police said that the main suspect, identified as 33-year-old Sonu Yadav, the woman’s live-in partner, decided to throw them in the canal due to domestic problems. Hitesh Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Manesar), said that the incident took place on February 27 after a scuffle broke out between the couple. Yadav is alleged to have forcefully taken the woman and her kids, along with his family members in a car. “They threw them in running water and returned to Gurugram the following day. The woman survived after locals rescued her but despite attempts, they could not rescue the children. The woman approached us and filed a complaint following which four teams were formed and sent to different locations,” he said. According to the police, Yadav had started living with the woman after her husband’s death two years ago. They were having problems as Yadav was not fond of the children, aged 2 and 6 years, whereas the woman was pressurising him to marry her and ensure her financial security, the police said. The woman also threatened to implicate Yadav in a fake rape case, it has been alleged.The suspects were identified as Sonu Yadav (33), his brother Pradeep Kumar (33), cousin Sachin Kumar (22), and his mother Ravita Devi (55). The police said Yadav worked as a pizza delivery guy and lived in Bhangrola village along with the woman and his parents. “The teams spent more than eight hours a day in the canal for three days after we received the complaint. On Wednesday early morning, the water level was controlled and we managed to recover the bodies and conducted raids to arrest the suspects,” said ACP Yadav. A case under sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Kherki Daula police station. “Gurugram police had brought Yadav to Meerut who showed them the spot where he had thrown kids in the Upper Ganga Canal. Soon after, divers were deployed and the girl’s body was fished out from Jani while the boy’s body was recovered in Modinagar of Ghaziabad,” said Keshav Kumar, superintendent of police (Rural), Meerut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-held-for-murdering-two-children-in-meerut-101614794555241.html
03-03-2021||Gurugram||Private hospitals asked to assign slots for vaccination registration||Private hospitals and government facilities designated as Covid-19 vaccination centres have been directed to assign vaccination sessions on the Co-Win portal 15 days to one month in advance, to help people reserve appointments online by choosing the date and location most convenient to them, according to the district health department officials. Officials said that private hospitals will also have to keep slots open for walk-in beneficiaries throughout the week, as the department added 30 more private hospitals to the existing list of 10. At government facilities, vaccination will be held four times a week, on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. “As directed by the union ministry of health and family welfare on Wednesday, the focus will be on walk-in registration, as it (response) has been high. Private and government vaccination centres will have to keep the slots between 9am and 5pm 100% open for walk-in beneficiaries,m along with those who have scheduled their appointments,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, who attended the health ministry’s meeting. The process to book an appointment for Covid-19 vaccination on the Co-Win portal became operational from Tuesday evening in Gurugram. The appointment has to be fixed at least a day in advance for the vaccine shot, said officials. To check the online beneficiary registration, a special vaccination session was set up on Wednesday by the district health department at the Sector 31 polyclinic. At least 219 people above the age of 60 years took the vaccine shot, of whom 42 had fixed their online appointments Tuesday evening through Co-Win, while the rest were walk-ins and were registered on the spot. Besides, 29 people aged 45 to 59 years having co-morbidities took the shot, of whom nine had made online reservations and 20 were walk-ins. For Thursday’s vaccination drive, private hospitals already have an advance list of self-registered vaccine beneficiaries. “At least 70 people have done advance self-registration for the vaccination drive to be held on Thursday. We have been doing registration at the site too for walk-in. The process will start at 9am tomorrow (on Thursday) and hopefully, things will move smoothly so that beneficiaries above 60 years of age do not have to wait too long,” said Dr Anjali Kaul, medical superintendent, Artemis Hospital.According to doctors of Narayana Hospital, at least 41 people have made appointments for vaccinations on Thursday. “Walk-in registration is for beneficiaries reaching the vaccination centre directly without prior registration. The hospital is prepared to cater to nearly 300 vaccine beneficiaries in a day. In one go, a batch of 30 people will be allowed to enter, to ensure social distancing,” said Dr Swadesh Kumar, consultant and head of emergency, Narayana Hospital. In a meeting with the Covid Vaccination Centre (CVC), attended by managers of private hospitals at the Mini Secretariat on Wednesday, hospitals were asked to follow standard operating procedures to avoid crowding at vaccination sites.As per the directions, each centre should have separate rooms for registration and verification of documents, vaccination and observation for 30 minutes.

03-03-2021||Gurugram||Environmentalists protest against mining in Aravallis at Haryana Bhawan, ahead of SC hearing||Ahead of a Supreme Court (SC) hearing on the Haryana government’s plea to allow mining in the Aravallis of Gurugram and Faridabad, environmentalists in the city have raised concerns over significant adverse impact on groundwater recharge capacity and wildlife if mining activity resumes.Citizens and students protested outside Haryana Bhawan in Delhi on Wednesday against the state government’s plan. The protesters also submitted a letter addressed to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar that stated, “Haryana has the lowest forest cover in India, just 3.62%. Most of this is concentrated in the Aravalli hills in south Haryana and some in the Shivaliks in the north. Aravallis in Haryana have been under huge attack from illegal felling of trees and encroachment… Legalising mining in the Aravallis will lead to severe environmental impacts threatening the survival of millions of people living in Gurugram, Faridabad, Delhi-NCR as well as the wildlife that call these forests home.” “The Supreme Court had banned mining in the Aravallis these last few years. Until now, mining was going on illegally in Haryana. Legalising mining threatens the mere existence of these historic and environmentally vital hill ranges. Aravallis with their natural cracks and fissures have the potential to put 2 million litres of water per hectare in the ground every year,” a statement by the protesters said. Anil Grover, the additional advocate general of Haryana, said that large-scale unemployment in Haryana caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and high cost of procurement of raw material for construction have necessitated the state government to request the Supreme Court to allow mining in Faridabad. “In 2011, the Supreme Court discussed the aspect of a rehabilitation plan with the Attorney General of India who had then submitted that the ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) can convene an urgent meeting of all parties and plans would be considered. Thereafter, in 2013, the rehabilitation and reclaiming plan was submitted through the then assistant inspector general of forests, MoEF. We have requested the apex court to approve this plan and allow us to conduct mining following environmental and all other necessary clearances,” said Grover. In 2009, the SC imposed a blanket ban on all mining of major and minor minerals in the eco-sensitive Aravalli hills in Faridabad, Gurugram and Mewat. The court then said, “The actual mining operation in the 600 ha of land in Faridabad shall commence on submission of the rehabilitation and reclamation plan by the state and its approval by this Court. It shall be done at the earliest and preferably within a period of six months.” In October last year, the state government appealed to the SC to allow the resumption of mining in the Aravallis of Gurugram and Faridabad. A hearing in the matter is scheduled for Thursday.Neelam Ahluwalia of the Aravalli Bachao Citizens Movement, who led the protest on Thursday, said, “We citizens demand that mining in the Aravallis should not be legalised. The state government should withdraw the regressive Punjab Land Preservation Act Amendment Bill of 2019, remove illegal encroachments from the Aravallis and grant forest status to 50,000 acres of Aravallis which have no legal protection...”Speaking on the issues, RK Chauhan, joint director of the department of environment, said, “We have not received any update in this matter so far… Our role starts when mining is approved for a particular area and environmental clearances are to be given.” Officials of the Mines and Geology department of Haryana declined to comment as the matter is sub judice. Chetan Aggarwal, a city-based environmentalist, said, “In the past 11 years, since mining was banned in Haryana, forests have regrown and wildlife numbers have also increased in the area. A report by the Wildlife Institute of India from 2017 also shows improvement in the presence of wildlife. If mining is started again, the whole ecology will be impacted. Additionally, the forests of Faridabad have already faced mining more than its carrying capacity in the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/environmentalists-protest-against-mining-in-aravallis-at-haryana-bhawan-ahead-of-sc-hearing-101614794553328.html
03-03-2021||Gurugram||Police to auction Sube Singh’s properties after court lifts stay||After a local court on Tuesday vacated the stay on plots seized from Sube Singh, a suspected gangster wanted by the police for multiple criminal cases, police officials said they will go ahead with their plan to auction the properties, estimated to be worth ₹6 crore. Singh is wanted in more than a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion in Gurugram and Rewari. The police departments of the two districts have announced rewards amounting to ₹4 lakh for information leading to Singh’s arrest. He was declared a proclaimed offender by a district court in April 2018. His wife, who was a sarpanch, is also believed to be on the run for the past two years, the police said. Singh’s mother has been fighting the case in court.Singh’s properties comprise of two plots, one of 1.3 acres in Bar Gujjar village near Manesar and another of 0.8 acres in Manesar industrial area, the police said. In 2019, the district administration tried to auction the properties twice with an aim to weaken the financial base of the gangster, who is allegedly on the run. However, no one showed up to buy the land at that time. The police said they would now restart the auction process. Gurugram police seized the property of Singh in January 2019. Police commissioner KK Rao said that he got a police post constructed on one of the plots the same year. “The police announced an auction of two properties of a wanted gangster, but before it could be sold, the family members got a stay from a local court in March 2019. He was a close aide of Kaushal (a Gurugram gangster) but due to financial issues, they parted ways and started independent operations. It is the first of its kind initiative to curb the financial muscle of criminals in the district,” he said. The police said that while one of the plots was Singh’s ancestral property and was used for farming, the other one was purchased three to four years ago. Rao said the entire auction process will be carried out under police surveillance and they will ensure that buyers are not targeted or harmed by the gangsters. “We wrote to the tehsildar on Wednesday to start the process and to place an advertisement for the same. The auction will be announced for the next week,” said Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Manesar). Yadav said that despite the properties being attached by the police in February 2019, the auction failed and a stay order followed. An auction was planned twice, at Bar Gujjar village and Manesar, but no interested buyer showed up. “It has already happened twice as people wait and watch for the reaction from the gangster’s family members. It seemed that people were scared to even come to witness the auction process. This time, we are inviting more people through tenders,” said Yadav. The police have prepared a list of more than 50 gangsters whose properties will be attached in court this year. A team of revenue officials has submitted a list of verified properties of the gangsters whose assets are to be attached. The police said the move is aimed at diminishing the financial muscle of criminals across the district. The police, in 2019, announced the decision to seize ill-gotten properties of criminals and auction the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/police-to-auction-sube-singh-s-properties-after-court-lifts-stay-101614794552758.html

03-03-2021||Noida||Greater Noida begins survey to identify eligible people for affordable housing scheme||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida authority has started a survey to identify people eligible for the Centre’s affordable housing scheme. The authority will build 10,000 housing units meant for economically weaker section (EWS) in the city, officials said.Once eligible people are identified, the authority will rope in private developers for the project, the officials said. To make the project economically viable, the authority will allow the selected developers to use 10% of the total housing project for commercial purposes, the officials said. However, work on the project will start only after the adequate number of applicants will apply for the scheme. For the survey, the authority has invited applications from interested people via advertisements till March 17, along with ₹5,000 demand draft to be submitted with the form.“The authority will get the verification of all applications done by a government agency that will verify if the applicant belongs to EWS category or not. Then we will decide the further action on the project to be launched on public-private partnership,” said Santosh Kumar, office on special duty, Greater Noida authority.The authority will offer additional floor area ratio (FAR) in order to construct more units (other than EWS flats) so that the developer can earn revenue and deliver the affordable houses, said the officials.Under the scheme, the central government offers ₹1.5 lakh fund for one unit having a covered area of 30 square metres while the state government gives ₹1 lakh. The remaining expenditure will be borne by the developer or a group of developers, the officials said.The authority has decided to allot land in sectors 1, 2 and 3 in Greater Noida West. Though a developer will get to build additional units in a housing project to make profit, the EWS units should be at least 35% in the project, said the officials.The authority will give an opportunity to small developers, who can take up three, five and ten hectares to develop such units. Small developers can also form a consortium for the project, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-begins-survey-to-identify-eligible-people-for-affordable-housing-scheme-101614794253495.html
03-03-2021||Noida||GDA plans e-bike project for local commute in Indirapuram and Raj Nagar Extension||Despite two failed attempts, the Ghaziabad Development Authority is not ready to let go of its project to ply e-bikes in the city to improve last mile connectivity and reduce traffic congestion.In December last year and this January, the authority invited private players to bid for the chance to develop infrastructure and ply 200 e-bikes in Indirapuram and Raj Nagar Extension. But none turned up. Officials say this may be because the two areas, although well-planned, were heavily congested and businesses may have felt it would not be profitable.“We now plan to float it again and rope in e-bikes to run from different destinations in the two localities. Under the plan, residents can hire e-bikes on an hourly basis. This will benefit the environment and residents who have to travel short distances,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of GDA. “We may offer land for the purpose of developing stations and will also deploy a profit-sharing model.”He said that residents can pick up an e-bike from their nearest centre and travel to their intended destination like markets, banks and other local facilities and leave the e-bike at the designated place. The city today heavily depends on auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and personal vehicles for travel within city limits. “The authority must take up the project aggressively as it will help reduce carbon footprints and ease local commuting. Once the pilot project gains momentum, the number of e-bikes should be increased and project should be taken up for other localities as well,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. “Even the bicycle culture is growing fast in European countries and it should also be promoted in the city. We already have cycle tracks developed in different localities and also in Indirapuram and these should be properly maintained.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gda-plans-e-bike-project-for-local-commute-in-indirapuram-and-raj-nagar-extension-101614794252784.html
03-03-2021||Noida||31 dilapidated government school buildings demolished in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad basic education department, with the help of the public works department (PWD), has completed the demolition of 31 dilapidated government school buildings in the district, officials said on Wednesday. The basic education department identified 33 such buildings in the past nearly two months.The department has further identified 125 small structures in various schools which are to be assessed for structural safety, the officials said. The directions for the identification of dilapidated school buildings were given by the UP government days after a roof collapse incident at a cremation ground in Muradnagar on January 3 when 24 people were killed. “Taking up the seriousness of the issue, we came across 33 different buildings which were in as many schools, but these were old buildings and not used to hold classes. At all the 33 locations, new buildings were constructed but the old ones had also stood. So, with the help of assessment made by the PWD engineers, we got 31 such buildings demolished and also auctioned the debris,” said BB Chaudhary, basic education officer, Ghaziabad. He said that two remaining structures will also be assessed by the PWD and action will follow. The district at present has 451 government schools under the basic education department with enrolment of about 85,000 students. Of late, a few videos and photographs of old structures in some of the schools in Loni and other areas went viral over social media. “Upon this, we received further directions to inquire the issue. Thereafter, we came to know that the videos and pictures showed the old buildings but not the new ones which got constructed. In furtherance to this, we have also identified 125 small structures such as toilets, storerooms, kitchen shed and even extra classrooms. The PWD officials have been asked to assess the condition of these structures and advise suitable action,” Chaudhary said. The officials of PWD said that their teams helped out the basic education department in review of old buildings and the rest of the structures will also be taken up. “We surveyed the old buildings on the basis of site inspections where conditions like breaking of plaster, damage to reinforcements, seepage of water and peeling of surface plaster, among others, were checked up. Thereafter, the old buildings surveyed by our teams were recommended for demolition,” said Manish Verma, executive engineer of state PWD. The incident at Muradnagar had happened at Ukhlarsi cremation ground where a contractor was hired by the Muradnagar Nagar Palika for construction of sheds but one of the main shed collapsed on January 3, leading to the death of 24 persons who had come to attend a funeral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/31-dilapidated-government-school-buildings-demolished-in-ghaziabad-101614794193217.html
03-03-2021||Noida||Noida traffic police to paint unique numbers on auto-rickshaws for better tracking||From Thursday, the Noida traffic police will begin registering auto-rickshaws for colour codes that will help show its area of operation. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic) Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the district had three zones for auto-rickshaws, Noida, Kasna, and Dadri. An auto-rickshaw registered in Noida, for example, is permitted to ply only within a 16-km radius there. But this rule is frequently breached, he said. “We will provide the auto-rickshaws with a unique serial number that will be painted on the rear of the vehicle in red, green and yellow paints for the regions. This way they can be easily identified, will ensure discipline and also commuters’ safety,” he said. The colour for each region was yet to be decided.Traffic police said when auto-rickshaws breach their limits, it will lead to overcrowding on the roads in these zones.The registration drive will be conducted at Noida Sector 37 and Pari Chowk. Police said that they will verify the credentials of vehicle, its driver and its owner and only then paint the number.“This way we can easily trace the vehicle if a crime takes place in an auto-rickshaw or a commuter forget their valuables in the vehicle,” Saha said.Last week, a 30-year-old Gautam Budh Nagar resident was allegedly raped while she was on her way back from work in Ghaziabad. She had boarded an auto-rickshaw from Lal Kuan, which allegedly drove her to a secluded spot in Hapur instead. Police arrested three suspects in the case.There are around 18,000 autos in Gautam Budh Nagar that ply in Noida, Greater Noida, Dadri, Kasna and Jewar area. Besides, there are also auto-rickshaws permitted to ply in the national capital region (NCR), which police said, will not be included in the colour code scheme.Chaudhury Om Prakash, president Noida Auto Union, said that they were not informed of the exercise. “We support the colour coding exercise, but not the 16-km limitation. A person will need to hire two autos to travel from Noida to Greater Noida and vice versa if this comes into effect. This does not appear practical. Delhi is bigger than Noida/Gautam Budh Nagar but it has a single permit for autos. We also demand a single permit in G B Nagar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-police-to-paint-unique-numbers-on-auto-rickshaws-for-better-tracking-101614794192785.html

The company said it will carve out smaller residential plots and sell them.“There has been much demand among homebuyers for plots. We hope to raise ₹2,300 crore in selling the land that we have. We will repay ₹1,000 crore loan from banks, clear the ₹300 crore dues with the Greater Noida Authority and use the remaining ₹1,000 crore to finish 7,000 residential units,” said RK Arora, chairman of Supertech Limited.The company has 21 acres in Greater Noida, 19 acres in Yamuna Expressway, six acres in Ghaziabad, around 40 acres in Gurugram and the rest in Meerut and Rudrapur.“We had reserved these lands to be used in future for group housing purposes. But we will carve out plots in view of rising need for the plotted development. We will develop roads, drains, parks and other basic facilities at earliest in areas, where we will offer plots to buyers,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/supertech-to-raise-2-300-crore-to-deliver-7-000-flats-101614794132761.html
03-03-2021||Noida||Noida authority to hold camps for registering flats||In three months, the Noida Authority will hold camps in housing societies to help homeowners register flats that had not been transferred from realtors.It directed realtors to ensure all documents were ready from their end.In Noida, all properties, be it a flat or a plot, are leased for 90 years. The flat is transferred under a tripartite lease-deed between the realtor, buyer and the Noida Authority.According to the authority’s, there are around 20,000 occupied units without the lease-deed. The Uttar Pradesh government on March 1 directed the Noida Authority to execute the lease-deed. The delay had already cost the exchequer, and homeowners who had been living in the units for at least five years did not have title documents.“The authority has directed the realtors to set up the camps at their respective premises. We will provide all support in this regard,” said Rajesh Kumar officer on special duty of the Noida authority.Homeowners will need to ready stamp papers, allotment letter and their Aadhar number.On Wednesday, the authority’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari met with officials of eight prominent developers. She asked them to prepare for the camps and also directed them to clear all dues owed to the authority to become eligible to execute the lease-deed.But the confederation of real estate developers association of India (Credai) said the onus was on the authority in this regard.“Developers cannot clear the dues until the Noida authority implements the Supreme Court order that directed it to charge only 8.5% interest on dues. That has not happened so far,” said Prashant Tiwari president of Western UP chapter of Credai and promoter of Prateek Group who had met Maheshwari in the meeting.The Noida authority has appealed in the Supreme Court against its order and the hearing is scheduled for June 6Then there is the issue of stamp fee. The authority, during the meeting, allowed developers to execute a sub-lease if they were not able to clear the dues to it in one go. “We are ready to execute the sub-lease,” said Amit Kumar, executive director of AIMS Max Gardenial Developers Private Limited, who was also part of the meeting with Maheshwari. “But the homeowners do not want to execute it to evade the stamp fee (which is 7% the sale amount). We have requested the authority to issue notices to homeowners so that they come forward to execute the deed.“The authority and the UP government have tried to get the sub-lease deed done in the past too. But the developers do not pay the financial dues delaying the execution of the flats and buyers continue to suffer,” said Abhishek Kumar president of Noida Extension flat owners’ welfare association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-to-hold-camps-for-registering-flats-101614794012772.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the day temperature was 4°C above the season’s average. The minimum temperature for the city was almost similar at 17.9°C against 17.1°C on Tuesday. According to weather analysts, proper ventilation due to the rise in mercury and good wind speed helped in dispersion of the pollutants from the region.According to IMD, the mercury may slightly rise further in the next few days but will oscillate around 14°C as minimum and 30-32°C as maximum for Safdarjung, Delhi, which is also average for NCR. For NCR, as per reading at Safdarjung station, the minimum temperature was recorded at 13.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees higher than the season’s average and the maximum at 30.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees above the season’s average.“The mercury is likely to rise for the next few days until March 7 when the region may see light rains. The wind speed will remain moderate and north-westerly,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.Meanwhile, the air quality of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida improved and entered ‘moderate’ zone after oscillating in-between ‘poor’ to ‘severe’ category since February 7. “The wind speed will remain good though may drop slightly on March 5 and 6 due to an approaching western disturbance. The ventilation will be good,” said Srivastava.According to CPCB, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday was 168 against 153 a day earlier, both under ‘moderate’ category. The AQI of Greater Noida improved to 189 against 218 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 198 against 218 a day earlier. An AQI up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to oscillate between ‘satisfactory’ and lower end of ‘poor’.“Surface winds are high but forecasted to slow down by tomorrow. Although day is becoming warmer, AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate towards the high end of moderate to lower end of the poor category by tomorrow. But AQI will not stay in poor for a longer time and likely to marginally improve thereafter and forecasted to oscillate between poor and moderate category on March 5 and 6,” said a SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mercury-on-rise-in-noida-air-quality-improves-101614793773453.html

03-03-2021||Pune||Residents demand restrictions on heavy vehicles inside Narhe||The death of the 19-year-old nursing student girl has shocked the residents of Narhe and surrounding areas and demand has been made to ban for ban heavy vehicles on residential roads by local residents. On March 1, a student was crushed under the water tanker in Narhe near Abhinav College Road. The victim is identified as Sakshi Appa Bate (19), a resident of Dhayari. Bate’s friend Ragini Balaji Kankulee (19) who was riding with her suffered minor injuries. “From the last 10 years, the movement of heavy vehicles has increased inside the Narhe area as newly developed residential housing societies and educational institutes have come up here. Daily around hundreds of heavily loaded trucks with construction material and water tankers pass through the narrow roads with considerable speed. There have been several past incidents in which people have died and seriously injured. So now our demand is that some strict implementations should be imposed like restricting heavy vehicles during daytime just like other major roads in the city,” said Prakash Vanjare, a local resident and secretary of Bhushan Pride housing society. Currently, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, colleges and schools are closed in the Pune district, but before lockdown, there was a heavy movement of students across the Narhe area. There are more than 10 small and big educational institutes in this area and over 100 residential housing projects. Most of the students live in private hostels and Paying Guest (PG) facilities, while many snack centres and hotels have come up here to cater to the daily food need of students. Sushant Kute, ex-sarpanch and current member of Narhe gram panchayat said, “We are a developing area and earlier we had appointed security guards at main chowks and points on the road inside the Narhe village to monitor the traffic. Now, as our village is going under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) jurisdiction things are changing, but that doesn’t mean heavy vehicles will be allowed to speed and kill innocent people on road. We will now hold a meeting of all our gram panchayat members, if from now onwards any heavy vehicle is found speeding on the road, first we will try to create awareness through a dialogue. And if it is found that the same person is committing the same mistake repeatedly, then a police FIR will be lodged against the driver as well as the owner of the vehicle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-demand-restrictions-on-heavy-vehicles-inside-narhe-101614793053248.html
03-03-2021||Pune||Demand to increase EBC hostels in the state||After colleges in the state reopened on February 15 after almost a year’s gap, students have started coming back to Pune, Mumbai and other major cities to resume offline studies. One of the major issues that students are facing is accommodation, for the students belonging to the economically backward class (EBC) category the state government has given only 11 hostels across the state. Surprisingly, way back in 1973, the then state education department had issued orders to provide hostel facilities to all the EBC students in the state. But until now no new hostels were built or extended by the state government for these students. “Today, thousands of students come to Pune and Mumbai for their education and studies and the majority of the students from rural areas are economically backward. They are from the farmers’ family and cannot afford the heavy fees of private hostels or the rent for a separate home. So, for such students, the state education department had issued a circular in 1973 for building hostels in which it is clearly stated that hostels should be provided with free lodging and boarding to the students,” said Amar Ekad, president of Cops students’ organisation, Maharashtra state. “Detailed information of how these hostels should be, the strength of students and the functioning are given in this order. But in the last so many years none of the educational officers worked on it and gave hostel facilities to EBC students. We are following up on this issue and repeatedly sent official letters to the state education department to start the process of building hostels across the state for EBC students.” he added. In the order issued by the state education department on July 3, 1973, it is stated, “A section for the warden, senior clerk, junior clerk, peon, maidservant, watchman, sweeper, cook, part-time visiting medical officer should be there at the hostel. An amount of ₹60,000 should be sanctioned per annum to per hostel.” Maharashtra director of higher and technical education, Dhanraj Mane said, “The demand raised by students has been forwarded to the higher officials at the education department and accordingly further action will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/demand-to-increase-ebc-hostels-in-the-state-101614793052685.html
03-03-2021||Pune||Admissions under RTE begin, registrations open until March 21st||The admissions under the Right to Education (RTE) have begun from Wednesday, according to the school education and sports department. Parents can now register under the RTE until March 21. According to the education department, there are 9,431 schools across Maharashtra with over 96,629 vacant seats in the state. For Pune district, 985 schools have registered under the RTE and there are 14,773 seats available for interested candidates. The education department has urged parents to take part in the admission process to ensure that each child gets a seat. Last year, due to the pandemic, many RTE seats remained vacant and so this year the education department has urged parents to fill the forms. As the process of registration started on Wednesday, parents who filled the form faced a few glitches. Mukund Kirdat, city-based education activist and member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said that parents faced technical errors while filling the preferences.“There were some technical glitches. A major issue was that of location. Especially, for Parents filling the form from Warje, they were shown the Aundh region. The education department has made the region in such a way that this has caused inconvenience to many parents. Also, some schools in rural parts are still with the Zilla Parishad (ZP) so the parents are not able to locate these schools on the map while giving their preference,” said Kirdat. While talking about the fewer number of seats under the RTE in Pune district, Kirdat highlighted that each year the number of vacant seats should increase, but the picture is different.“It is because many schools do not register with the education department. The department should declare the names of those who did not register with them. Also, there are a lot of loopholes that schools exploit. The education department should take stern action against these schools,” said Kirdat. Dinkar Temkar, in-charge of RTE Maharashtra said that on day 1, around 12,000 parents have registered under the RTE. “There have been no grievances as of yet where parents have struggled to fill the forms. The vacant seats are less this time as last time also the seats were less. There are fewer admissions at English medium schools already and so there are fewer vacancies this time as well,” said Temkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/admissions-under-rte-begin-registrations-open-until-march-21st-101614792993873.html

The other arrested man was identified as Vrushabh Andekar, a relative of the gangster, and the two have been remanded to police custody until March 6 by a local court, according to police inspector (crime) Harshvardhan Gade of Khadak police station. “The attack on the complainant was ordered by Andekar. We have arrested two so far. We are looking for the others,” said PI Gade. The incident allegedly happened on the night of February 21 when Andekar’s aides allegedly chased the complainant Onkar Kudale (21), a resident of Dhankawadi area of Pune, and one of his friends over a long-standing rivalry that Kudale had with Andekar’s gang members. One of Kudale’s friends has spent time in jail for the attempted murder of Andekar’s gang members, according to his complaint. The rivalry has also resulted in a firing incident in Kondhwa. On the night of February 21, as the complainant and his friend were leaving from his parents’ house in Bamboo Ali in the Ganeshpeth area, Vrushabh Andekar, a relative of Bandu Andekar, arrived there along with Suraj Ashok Vadu, Swaraj Vadekar, Aditya Ukrande and five to six unidentified people. The group attacked the complainant and his friend with sharp weapons in hand and chased them. The two then found a stack of bamboos and hit behind it while their attackers swung their weapons in the air and terrorised the people in the area where the two were hiding. The complainant and his friend were allegedly scared of registering a complaint but eventually lodged one on Tuesday and a case was registered. A case under Section 307, 143, 147, 148, 149, 506(2), 109, 507 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 37(1) with135 of the Maharashtra Police Act and Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act was registered at Khadak police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bandu-andekar-in-police-custody-in-attempted-murder-case-101614792993343.html
03-03-2021||Pune||Fake toll racket: Seven arrested for issuing fake receipts, siphoning crores||Five contractors were among 11 toll plaza workers booked by Pune rural police for printing fake toll plaza receipts and siphoning money to the tune of ₹3 crore over the past few months, according to Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of Pune rural police. He was speaking about the arrest of 7 of the 11 accused in the case on Wednesday. The arrested men were identified as Suresh Prakash Gangawane (25), Akshay Tanaji Sanas (22), Shubham Sitaram Dolare (19), Sai Ladurao Sutar (25), Ajay Kashinath Chavan (19), Sanket Jaiwant Gaikwad (22), and Amol Dhanaji Konde (36), according to the police. They have been remanded to police custody while the police are looking for other accused. Among the arrested, Konde is a contractor while the others are employees at a lower level. Along with Konde, the four other contractors were identified as Vikas Anna Shinde, Manoj alias Dada Dalvi, Satish Margaje, Hemant Bathe, according to SP Deshmukh. The method of cheating was detected on two toll plazas - Khed Shivapur and Anewadi. While an overall audit report of Anewadi toll plaza is awaited, an audited transaction detail report for February 24 at Khed Shivapur toll plaza revealed that 2,000 fake receipts for a total of ₹3, 80,000 toll amount were issued on that day alone. The police therefore suspect that the siphoning began in the last week of December 2020 and so far, toll receipts worth ₹2,28,00,000 have been issued at Khed Shivapur toll plaza. “They used a laptop and normal printer to print these receipts. The set up was probably at the toll plazas. A daily audit is also done on these tolls. We got complaints from drivers that the receipts issued every time they pass are varying in size and font and other specifications. So, we started investigation in it. We are awaiting an audit report from Anewadi,” said SP Deshmukh. A case under Section 420, 467, 468, 471, 408, and 34 of Indian Penal Code is registered at Rajgad police station of Pune rural police.

A recommendation for preventive action against Ghaywal was made to the district collector of Pune and was later approved, according to a statement issued by the rural police. SP Deshmukh was speaking during a press conference called to announce the detention of the gangster from Sant Dnyaneshwar colony in Shastrinagar area of Kothrud, Pune. “We are looking to see if the cases against him can be reopened if new evidence comes forth. We are looking into grounds for appeal if we find the evidence,” said SP Deshmukh. Ghaywal, who was detained under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act, was sent into detention at the Yerawada central jail. He was externed from Pune in December 2020 and was booked in at least 12 cases of which he was acquitted in eight cases, according to Pune rural police. Ghaywal is a known rival of Gajanan Marne, another gangster from Kothurd area who was recently released from Taloja jail after being acquitted in two murder cases registered against him in November 2014 after two aides of Ghaywal were killed in Pune. A gang war had ensued in the city at the time. The two committed organised crimes and have been booked in several cases between 2000 and 2003.

03-03-2021||Pune||Open inquiry into Jal Yukta Shivar receives poor response from complainants||The four-member panel set up by Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government during December last year to probe alleged irregularities in Jal Yukta Shivar scheme has received only four complaints from Pune, prompting BJP to claim that inquiry is driven by politics. During the open inquiry session in Pune on Tuesday, only four complaints were presented before the panel, which has now decided to hold another round of hearing on March 5. The Pune district had witnessed over 22,500 small and medium works related to water conservation under Jal Yukta Shivar. The panel received complaints pertaining to inferior work or faulty design as well as the difference between work proposed on paper and the one carried out on the ground. Balasaheb Chaudhary who had collectively filed multiple complaints from Purandar tehsil said that many complaints were about irregularities in the works such as the proposed size of bundhara (channel) differing with actual size on the ground. There were also complaints about the faulty construction of bundhara. Instead of getting stored into it, water slipped from the bundhara. Anil Shaymrao Kadam, who raised complaints related to work from Bhor and Velhe tehsil alleged that most expenses were made on making Continuous Contour Trenches (CCT) while the quality of the work was compromised. He said most parts of bundharas were broken, while another complaint was about improper outlets disproportionate to the storage capacity. BJP claimed that the MVA government has been exposed after ordering an inquiry with a political motive. “The government ordered probe for good work keeping in mind the vendetta. The open inquiry has exposed the government as only four complaints were received,” said BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye. Jal Yukta Shivar was a flagship project by the previous Devendra Fadnavis regime which spent ₹9,634 crore to ensure water conservation in various districts of Maharashtra. During the last days of the government, there were allegations of irregularities in various districts including Pune’s Purandar. Following the adverse observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report pointing at some irregularities, the government set up a four-member committee chaired by former additional secretary Vijay Kumar to conduct an open inquiry into the alleged irregularities. Vijay Kumar said, “The complainants wanted some time to bring evidence. I will give the complainants a chance to produce the evidence.” When asked about the overall response across the state, Vijay Kumar said, “This is something that is in the process. I am not interested in going into details as of now. After I get satisfactory details, I will speak again.” According to district agriculture superintendent Dnyaneshwar Bote, some complainants claimed that they did not get enough time to get proper information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/open-inquiry-into-jal-yukta-shivar-receives-poor-response-from-complainants-101614792932749.html

The school’s teachers have conducted the survey in these areas. Some of the areas where the Covid cases are high, the teachers have not visited there yet. More areas will be surveyed in the coming days to estimate the number of students who have dropped out of school,” said Jagtap.The complete survey will be finished by March 10.“After the survey, as per the directives of the state government, we will try to include these students back in formal education,” said Jagtap.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), said that over 4,279 students were identified by the department who were out of schools due to various reasons.“There are a few students who didn’t attend school full time. We are on this campaign to identify students from the last one month. Our teachers and anganwadi workers have visited every family in the area to get them to go to schools. We were focusing on child labour and areas like brick lanes and other places. The state government has taken up this program state wise,” said Prasad.He further added that the ZP is doing a resurvey of some places wherein some students have not been tracked.“We are visiting dhabas where they are chances to find more children who can be involved in child labour. We have identified such hotspots. We have enrolled most of the students who were out of school. There are some students who are enrolled anywhere in anganwadi or preschool. We are also tracking them and counselling the parents,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-578-students-dropped-out-of-school-in-a-year-101614792872702.html

It also won the Shalimar Bagh North constituency which was earlier held by the BJP.Though Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta said the party will introspect and work to remove the shortcomings, the central leadership declined to comment on the party’s dismal performance.Union minister Prakash Javadekar, who referred to the BJP’s performance in Gujarat as an illustration of people’s faith in the BJP-led NDA government, declined to comment on the Delhi performance.Referring to Gujarat he said, “It is a feat for any political party to remain in power for so long. The Congress has been wiped out.”The BJP won a clear majority in all 31 districts of the Panchayat as well as 196 out of 231 taluka panchayats and 70 out of 81 municipalities. “These results mean that people voted for development and that farmers are with the reforms,” he said.Referring to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi‘s speech in Assam he said, “He had tried to defame Gujarat and targeted Gujarati traders (for low wages of tea workers in the state)...People rejected his negative campaign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-losing-lone-seat-bjp-downplays-performance-in-delhi-local-body-polls-101614789887933.html
03-03-2021||Delhi||Court reunites man with his two dogs, says ‘unjustified to deprive of companionship’||A Delhi court has handed back the custody of two golden retriever dogs to their owner saying it would be “unjustified to deprive him of the companionship and custody of his pets”, which were taken away by an NGO and the city police alleging that the animals were being mistreated by their owner.Additional sessions judge Anil Antil passed the order after taking note of a police report about the maintenance of the dogs, Luv and Kush, at their owner’s place on Feroz Shah Road, and their veterinary doctor’s opinion.The judge, however, directed the dogs’ owner and businessman Anand Kumar Mohatta to produce both canines before the court and the police as and when required during the ongoing proceedings. The court passed the directions on a revision petition by Mohatta, against an order of a magisterial court refusing the owner the custody of the dogs. The dogs were taken away on January 30 by the NGO People for Animals, which accused Mohatta of animal cruelty.The NGO said at the time of inspection, the dogs were found to be suffering from high fever with swollen eyes, and later on, after a thorough examination by a veterinary doctor, both pets were found to be suffering from Parvo virus. The NGO claimed that the dogs were left unattended for a long time and their well-being was not being taken care of by Mohatta. The allegations were refuted by Mohatta who said he was taking proper care of both pets and was administering them due medication after regular visits to the veterinarian.Mohatta’s advocate said the dogs were administered the vaccinations as per the standards prescribed.In the status reply filed by the Delhi Police, the court also noted that the premises from where the dogs were taken had a separate 400 square feet room for the pets.Mohatta had also employed a servant to look after both the dogs, the court notedThe court also took note of the ownership certificate, vaccination certificate and medical certificate of the dogs. The vet endorsed the submissions made by advocate Rana and medical documents produced on record regarding the administration of vaccine for Parvo virus, which the pets were found to be suffering from.“In these facts and circumstances and taking note of the medical record, it would be unjustified to deprive the revisionist (Mohatta) of companionship and custody of his pets and therefore, in my considered opinion, in the interest of justice, the custody of the two pets, namely Luv and Kush, be handed over to revisionist,” the judge said in the order passed on February 25.Both pets were released on a bond of ₹40,000 each.The court asked Mohatta to file the specific report about their health and medical status report issued by their veterinary doctor twice in a month before the court, which is conducting the proceedings for alleged cruelty until the case is disposed of..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-reunites-man-with-his-two-dogs-says-unjustified-to-deprive-of-companionship-101614789752578.html

Global healthcare provider, VAMED, has shown an interest in being involved in the project. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “We already had a dialogue with VAMED and have written communication with them. We will either carry an expression of interest, or take a Rs900 crore loan to erect the cancer and urology hospital.” Rasne added, “This cancer hospital will be our flagship programme and will definitely be launched before the upcoming municipal elections. As per my estimate, by coming August, the project will be streamlined.” A top PMC official on condition of anonymity said, “PMC has identified land for the proposed hospital either at Baner or Warje. The plot will be at least 10,000 square feet. Either PMC will call for an expression of interest and ask the concerned organisation to give a proposal, or then the PMC prefers a soft loan for this project.” VAMED is a global provider for hospitals and other facilities in the healthcare sector. The VAMED portfolio ranges from project development, planning and turnkey construction, to total facility management of healthcare facilities. With its range of services, VAMED covers all areas of healthcare, from prevention and wellness, to acute care, rehabilitation and nursing.

While Mumbai has already begun vaccination at 29 such hospitals, Pune, with the highest active cases in the state, is yet to get an approval for the proposal, sent on Wednesday. These private hospitals are not empanelled with the PMJAY, CGHS or the State Health Insurance (MPJAY), but have shown a willingness to be a part of the vaccination drive, after being duly assessed by the local authorities. Prior to kick-starting phase two of the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive, the central government had said that only those private hospitals which are empanelled with the government schemes would be able to vaccinate eligible beneficiaries - senior citizens and those aged between 45-59 with specified comorbidities; at a cost of ₹250 per dose.However, to counter the rush, the civic body has sent a proposal of more hospitals to be vaccination sites. Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We have sent a proposal of 13 non-empanelled private hospitals who have shown a willingness to vaccinate beneficiaries and have more than 200 beds. Hopefully, we will get a response by Thursday morning. We have also received applications from 24 more such hospitals which have about 199-100 beds. After discussion with the government we will send forward the proposal. We will also increase timings at Naidu hospital from 9 am to 10 pm now, as we have seen a huge response from beneficiaries.”On Wednesday, PMC increased its vaccination sites from eight to 31, which also included three empanelled hospitals - Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, Aundh Institute of Medical Science, and Inlaks and Budhrani hospital, Koregaon park. Agarwal said, “On March 1 we had four locations, on March 2, eight locations and then on March 3, we now have 31 locations. We will increase vaccination sites to more than 100 in the coming days. I request all eligible beneficiaries to register online and come as per appointment.”On Wednesday, of the 2,700 target beneficiaries, 2,504 got the vaccine, which is a 93% success rate. Of these 2,504 beneficiaries, 1,378 senior citizens, and 148, aged between 45-59 years, with co-morbidities got the Covid-19 vaccine. Until Wednesday, totally, 1,38,869 beneficiaries have got the vaccine, of which 79,497 healthcare workers got their first dose and 15,451 got their second dose.A total of 39,668 frontline workers; 166 beneficiaries aged 45 to 60 with comorbidities, and 4,087 senior citizens have been vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-waits-on-govt-clearance-for-proposed-list-of-13-non-empanelled-pvt-hospitals-as-vaccination-centres-101614785192411.html

Social distancing has gone for a toss in government hospitals.Beneficiaries crowd the hospitals to get the jab and some senior citizens have gone three days without getting vaccinated yet.The administration is now appealing to citizens to avoid crowding the Covid vaccination sites, many of which are hospitals with Covid-19 patients, adding to the risk of infection. Siddharth Shirole, BJP MLA from Pune’s Shivajinagar constituency said, “I request all Punekars to be patient and not to approach vaccination centres without a scheduled appointment slot. Crowding of senior citizens & at-risk patients at the centres is counterproductive & is creating a high-infection zone. I also understand that there are several errors in listing addresses of the centres, including incorrect pin codes & incomplete locations. It will be updated & rectified soon.” Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “The technical glitches are not from our end and we are working on it. We would not like to encourage more walk-in vaccinations, as it would be better for crowd management and also for people’s own safety that they register first, get an appointment, and then come to the hospital. We are increasing the sites just for this reason.”While vaccination went on smoothly at some centres, including Naidu hospital, Sassoon hospital, Sutar hospital and the Janata Vasahat clinic, other centres still saw technical glitches. For example, at the Bhangire hospital run by the PMC, registrations are being accepted but vaccinations have not yet started. Senior citizens are especially finding it difficult to get registered on the CoWin app. Madhukar Joshi, a senior citizen from Katraj, said, “When I entered my Aadhar details to register my name, it did not happen. When I put in the PAN details, it showed that the beneficiary was already registered.”Dhairyasheel Vandekar visited PMC’s Naidu hospital and had a pleasant experience. He said, “The doctors and staff were extremely courteous and attentive and made the experience very pleasant. With all the challenges, PMC is doing a good job vaccinating the citizens. I got the jab through advance registration, but it was not easy. I was continuously trying for two days with all the hospitals on the website and was lucky to get a slot for Wednesday afternoon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/crowding-at-hospitals-raises-risk-of-infection-for-vaccine-beneficiaries-101614782792469.html

The total property tax expected to be recovered from the 250 defaulters is Rs19 crore, plus ₹3 crore in outstanding arrears.The PCB expects to earn Rs40 crore from 12,200 properties situated across the Cantonment area, and has recovered only Rs18 crore till date. The names of several prominent organisations, real estate developers and business establishments, figure in the list of defaulters.PCB chief executive officer (CEO), Amit Kumar, said, “We have released the names and addresses of the property tax defaulters and directed them to immediately pay their property tax dues to the Cantonment board. Property tax arrears are for different periods and have been assessed by our officials. Strict action will be taken if the arrears are not paid by the concerned parties. We will begin the process to attach properties from March 5.” Former PCB president Vinod Mathurawala, said, “Tax defaulters must pay up their dues, even in instalments, as is the mandatory procedure. The PCB is already suffering from a shortage of funds and citizens must pay up in the larger interests of the Cantonment area.” The cash-strapped PCB is facing a severe shortage of revenue generation from three categories, comprising property tax, vehicle entry tax (VET) and pay-and-park scheme.The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) reported a loss of ₹11.52 crore in revenue during the lockdown of 2020.PCB generated a revenue shortfall of ₹5 crore in its VET collection from April to June, 2020. Development projects estimated to be worth ₹200 crore have been hit hard, as the PCB has not received its share of goods and service tax (GST) funds from the state government, since July 2017.Crisis warningOn September 7, 2019, the then PCB president Major General Navneet Kumar, General-Officer-Commanding (GOC), south Maharashtra and Goa sub-area, addressed a press conference at Southern Command HQ and said that the board was going through a financial crisis which had taken a heavy toll on developmental projects.According to him, the crisis has been further aggravated by the non-payment of ₹150 crore by the state government to PCB as local body tax arrears, ever since the revised goods and services tax (GST) became operational in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pcb-to-attach-properties-of-tax-defaulters-from-march-5-101614780512181.html

Bengaluru accounts for 34% of all the multinational corporations (MNC) in the country and nearly 50% of the fortune 500 companies have a presence in India’s IT capital.“The ER&D sector in the country is the fastest growing industry with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8%. Meanwhile, the global Engineering Research and Development industry is expected to reach spending of $2 trillion by 2025. Considering this scenario, this policy aims to prepare the state to make use of the future opportunities emanating from this sector,” said CN Ashwatha Narayana, Karnataka’s deputy chief minister and in-charge of IT/BT, science and technology portfolios.The launch of the policy comes at a time when the BS Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has been unable to announce any mass-based schemes in the state due to the severe fund-crunch on account of revenue shortfalls from the Centre. The new policy envisages creation of an additional 50,000 jobs.“(The) Government of Karnataka seeks to integrate the state’s Engineering R&D ecosystem and further strengthen its overall value proposition, to champion India’s Engineering R&D growth trajectory.” according to the policy document.Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder of Infosys and chairman of Karnataka’s vision group on IT, said that Karnataka’s journey in research and development began in the early 1980s when Texas Instruments set up an office in what would eventually become India’s IT capital. “This is what started the IT revolution, R&D, remote software development,” he said.Around 1.6 lakh students were allotted engineering ranks in Karnataka, according to government data. There are at least 222 engineering colleges in the state, including 1,176 private institutions, 265 polytechnics and 12 junior technical schools, according to government data.But a significant number of students are not employable due to several reasons, including ineffective communication and technical skills, access to large companies. Gopalakrishnan said that such a policy would help bridge the gap between engineering talent and the industry.The policy will also support industrial application of academic research, spend ₹10,000 per student on training and certification as provide grants to universities to set up laboratories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-launches-engineering-research-and-development-policy-101614779186648.html

According to data released by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), 2,153 senior citizens and comorbid patients were administered the vaccine. With the BBMP keeping 4,200 shots as the target, 51 % of the targeted vaccine shots were administered, as compared to Monday’s 22 %.Meanwhile, 9,197 senior citizens and comorbid patients were administered the vaccine across the state.In some hospitals in the city, the Co-WIN portal did not work on Tuesday morning.“The slow server speed at several locations slowed down the vaccination process in many centres,” said a senior BBMP official.Even those who wanted to register for the vaccine faced problems with the portal. Several complaints were raised about the server being down while users trying to register. “Whenever we tried to access the portal, it showed the server was down. Another person known to me, said that even though she was able to access the portal, there were no time or date slots available in the hospital,” said Sanjiv Patil, a 68-year-old resident of Indira Nagar in east Bengaluru.In some cases, people were able to register for the vaccination but did not get a confirmation for the same, a BBMP official added. He added that due to glitches in the portal, many who registered online could not get the vaccine as their details did not appear in the BBMP’s list.BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad told Hindustan Times that a meeting was held with the health department over these issues. “In the morning meeting, we told them about the glitches we are facing, and they have promised to take it up with the government and get it rectified. But even today (Tuesday), these glitches continue,” he said.According to reports on social media, some temples, a government school and Bangalore One Centre were listed as vaccination centres even though BBMP has not designated any such places.Following the vaccination drive on Monday, BBMP had listed out a number of problems in the portal such as list of beneficiaries not being visible in vaccinator module, vaccinators unable to record a list of beneficiaries administered the dose, scheduling vaccination sessions creating confusion, among other technical problems with Co-WIN portal.Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala, state minister K S Eshwarappa and Wipro founder chairman Azim Premji were among those who received the vaccine in the state on day two of the inoculation drive on Tuesday.There were no instances of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI), the health department said in a release.Governor Vala received the vaccine shot at the K C General Hospital at Malleswaram.A press communique issued by the Raj Bhavan said Vala appealed to all eligible people to take the vaccine and make the country Covid-19 free.He also lauded the doctors and scientists who worked in a short time to fight against the virus.Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Eshwarappa took the vaccine at Shivamogga Ayurveda College and later posted a photograph on his Twitter handle.Wipro founder Azim Premji took the shot at Narayana Health City, according the hospital sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/51-vaccination-on-day-2-technical-glitches-persist-in-bengaluru-101614778852920.html
03-03-2021||Bangalore||Once a source of drinking water, Bengaluru river now filled with froth, stench||A river that once provided drinking water for villages outside Bengaluru city is now often mistaken for a sewage drain. The water is now unfit for drinking and the unchecked flow of industrial pollutants and domestic sewage and tons of plastic dumped in the river has made it difficult for the people to approach the river because of the froth and stench.The 57-km-long Vrishabhavathi river used to be a picnic spot in the late 1960s. Thanks to the pollution, the only river that originates from Bengaluru city now has an alternative name – the Kengeri Mori (Gutter of Kengeri).Experts say the decay of the river has an impact on Bengaluru’s ecosystem that goes beyond the froth and stench it generates; it could affect the quality of groundwater in the areas that it passes through. Farmers in the outskirts of the city use this water for the cultivation of vegetables that end up on the dining tables of the city’s residents.The degradation of the river began around 50 years ago when industrial areas began cropping up along the catchment areas of the river – in Peenya, Yeshwanthpura, Kumbalagou and so on. Over the years, industrial effluents polluted the river but in recent times, the big pollutant has been domestic sewage.“In terms of volume, domestic sewage contributes to the bulk of the pollution. Most households in Bengaluru don’t connect their sewage to the lines provided by the civic authorities. These (sewage) lines are meant to take the domestic affluents to a treatment centre. But the people connect their sewage to stormwater drains, which eventually take it to the river,” said Dr Sharachchandra Lele, a distinguished fellow at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment.Lele, however, added that industrial pollutants too pose a serious problem because most of the effluents let into the river are not biodegradable.The pollution has changed the nature of the river as well. In the early days, Vrishabhavathi was a seasonal river, flowing only during the monsoons.“Now it has been a perennial river, just that the main water body in the river is Bangalore’s sewage. At least for 6-9 months, what flows in the river is primarily sewage and it is around 500-600 million litres per day,” Lele added.Has there been any plan to revive this river? Experts say no. “It has to be a sustained, systemic effort if we have to revive the river and it could take a long time. The sewage entering the river should be diverted to sewage treatment plants. Industrial effluents will have to be collected and treated at effluent treatment plans and groundwater tables will have to be brought up so that groundwater flows into the river. This will take 5-7 years. Sadly, no such long-term plans have been proposed by anyone,” S Vishwanath, a city-based water conservationist, said.A senior official at the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), who didn’t want to be named, pinned the blame on Bengaluru residents.“We have sewage treatment plans in the city, but the problem is that we don’t get sewage from the households to treat it. In most areas in Bengaluru, the sewage is directly dumped into the stormwater drains, which are meant to collect excessive rainwater. We are taking action, but how much we do?” said the official. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said it has booked more than 500 apartment complexes in the city for letting sewage into the stormwater drains.An official said that the board had recommended to the BWSSB and Bangalore Electricity Supply Company to cut power and water supply to these apartments.While the blame game over the condition of the river continues, the effluents let into the river are slowly making their way back to the city.“The baby corn, other vegetables, fodder and the milk from the cattle from the villages downstream come into the city. If the quality of water the cattle drink and the water that is used for cultivation is bad it could certainly affect the city-dwellers directly,” Lele added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/once-a-source-of-drinking-water-bengaluru-river-now-filled-with-froth-stench-101614778435072.html

03-03-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru: Toyota workers' union to go on hunger strike for 14 days||The workers’ union of Japanese car-maker Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) on Wednesday said that they will serve a fresh strike notice to the company to fulfil at least six of their demands.“According to rules, we will serve a strike notice and give the company 14 days’ time to fulfil our demands. We will carry out a relay hunger strike for the duration of these 14 days and if the company does not fulfil our demands, we will go in for a full-blown strike,” Gangadhar, an office bearer of the workers’ union, told Hindustan Times.The development come a day after TKM, in a statement, claimed that the workers had withdrawn the strike after nearly four months.The demands include payment of full wages for the lockout period from November 10, 2020 to March 1, 2021, negotiation on workload dispute with the union, withdrawal of dismissal orders, charge sheets, memos issued during the lockout period, restoration of five-day work weeks and discontinuation of contract labour from production jobs.Also Read | Toyota unseats Volkswagen to become the world’s top-selling automakerThe union also released a statement on Wednesday, stating that they would return to their shifts for the next two weeks (until their strike notice comes into effect) since the management has issued a clarification that they will not seek an undertaking from the workers.“Since the workers and union were firm on not giving any undertaking and since the management issued a notice that workers report for duty without undertaking, the union has advised its members to report for duty as it was a moral victory for the union,” the union said in a statement.TKM has been in and out of labour-related problems ever since the suspension of a workers’ union office bearer in November last year.TKM first announced a lockout on November 10 and lifted restrictions nine days later (November 19) after reconciliation meetings with the Karnataka labour department. However, the company reimposed the lockout on November 23, citing unsafe and volatile environment at the company’s plant in Bidadi, just outside Bengaluru.TKM again lifted the lockout on January 12 but insisted on workers signing an undertaking of safety and productivity, which became the bone of contention between the two sides.The union maintained that the government had not mandated the signing of any undertaking.TKM, in a statement on Tuesday, said that some members of the union had submitted an undertaking to the labour department and added that the company would not insist on any individual undertaking.“(The) executive committee of the union had never decided to give any kind of undertaking, much less to any labour authority, nor had it authorised any office bearers to give any kind of undertaking. This was manufactured by the management to save its face,” the union said in its statement.The lockout had triggered a political battle as the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) used the incident to target the anti-labour stand of the BSYediyurappa-led government in Karnataka.The union has demanded the reinstatement of 66 of its members who have since been suspended or dismissed from the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-toyota-union-to-go-on-strike-again-101614771572452.html

Outbreak after Tibetan New Year festivities Since last week, 160 monks at Gyuto monastery have tested positive for Covid-19. Prajapati said investigation into the Gyuto monastery cluster suggests that the outbreak started after Losar, the Tibetan New Year, festivities on February 14. Fifteen monks, comprising 13 from Karnataka and two from Delhi, were at the monastery from February 16 to 19. The index case in the monastery was reported on February 23 during random sampling. Since then, 330 samples have been tested of which 160 have tested positive. Two patients have been shifted to Fortis Hospital in Kangra and one to Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Tanda, while the others, who are mostly asymptomatic, have been isolated at the monastery. Monks from other states test negative What has left the health authorities perplexed is the fact that the monks who came from outside Himachal Pradesh have tested negative for coronavirus. “We aren’t sure about the origin of the outbreak as those who came from Karnataka and Delhi have tested negative,” said Prajapati. He said the test report of 26 monks advised repeat sample were awaited. The sample report of monastery head Kelsang Gyatso was also awaited. Palden Dhondup, the secretary of health, Central Tibetan Administration, said the department with Delek Hospitals was taking all measures to deal with the situation. He said the situation was a concern but hoped the situation would become normal in a fortnight. Inaugurated in 1996 by the Dalai Lama, Gyuto Tantric Monastery is an important institution of the Geluk School of Tibetan Buddhism, where monks study Tantric Buddhism. The monastery was home to the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, since 2000, after he fled Tibet, to May 2017 when he moved to US and finally acquired citizenship of Dominica, a Caribbean island country, in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tibetan-govt-in-exile-on-alert-after-covid-19-outbreak-at-gyuto-monastery-101614769412464.html

The reasons for apprehension of arrest are justified in the facts and circumstances set out. Therefore, the applicant is entitled for protection by way of transit bail to approach the competent authority to seek appropriate reliefs,” Justice MS Jawalkar said while granting bail to Chaudhuri to allow him to approach the courts in Delhi. Extinction Rebellion is a global collective of climate activists that calls itself “a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the climate and ecological emergency”. Chaudhuri has been working in Goa since August 2020 and told the court he is an ardent environmentalist, actively involved in seeking ecologically sustainable solutions and proposing an environment-oriented approach towards policymaking. He said he has been working for the accreditation of khazan lands as a United Nations Agricultural Heritage Site besides volunteering with Extinction Rebellion.A “toolkit” is a document created to explain any issue. It also provides information on what one needs to do to address the issue. This might include information about petitions, details about protests and mass movements.The document was first publicised by Greta Thunberg, a Swedish climate activist, who has been vocal about her support to farmers agitating at Delhi border for over three months now.Earlier, the Delhi Police had also asked Google and some social media giants to provide information about email IDs, URLs and certain social media accounts related to the creators of the toolkit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/toolkit-case-goa-based-climate-activist-granted-transit-bail-101614763472112.html
03-03-2021||Bangalore||Kichcha Sudeepa: We don’t need to put Kannada film industry on the map, it has always been there||He rules Kannada film industry which has been churning out good content for years now, and with films such as Vikrant Rona and KGF 2, it is truly going global.However, ask Kichcha Sudeepa if it’s only now that his industry is getting it’s due, and he refuses.“By saying that, it is definitely humiliating other people of my industry, the seniors who have been working. For me, I don’t look at pan India. Kannada, or any other industry has survived only because of it’s seniors. They have done what they are supposed to do, in their eras, because of which the industry has survived and we are enjoying,” he reasons.The 47-year-old, who stepped into films 25 years ago, has had other industries calling too because of the stardom he enjoys, such as Eega in Tamil, and Dabangg 3 in Hindi. He feels that thinking the current crop of artistes has made film industries what they are is “arrogance”.“There are a couple of industries which were unable to grow to a certain level. Keeping that in mind, we should respect all seniors, who have worked so hard and brought it to the masses. That we are taking it anywhere else would be arrogance.

The results show that people of Delhi trust the AAP’s model of good governance. In 2015 polls, we won 67 out of 70 seats. In 2020, we won 62 out of 70 seats. Now, we won four out of five seats in the municipal bypolls. It shows that people are happy with our work,” said Kejriwal, addressing a gathering at the AAP head office in central Delhi.Also Read | ‘People fed up with BJP’: Sisodia after AAP wins 4 out of 5 wards in MCD bypollsOn BJP’s performance, he added, “The BJP winning no seat in the bypoll reflects that people are extremely unhappy with its governance of the municipal bodies. There is corruption everywhere. Their constant rant about seeking funds from the Delhi government for operating the MCDs have upset people. The Delhi government has paid all its dues but the BJP leaders have spent it all. Now they cannot even pay salaries. Even the Delhi government gets very less from the Central government, but we chose to work harder on better governance instead of ranting about inadequate funds. People see [through] such things. We have improved hospitals, schools, subsidised power and water, and improved the condition of roads.”“People have also taken note of the BJP’s politics of violence – especially the way BJP workers stormed into the residence of deputy CM Manish Sisodia and Delhi Jal Board office. This is not why people had voted them to power in the municipal polls (in 2017). The bypoll results give an indication on how people would vote in the 2022 municipal polls in Delhi. I congratulate all the winning candidates and wish them luck for better work in their municipal wards,” said Kejriwal.Of the five wards that went to poll, AAP won four. They are: Rohini-C and Shalimar Bagh North under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation; and Trilokpuri East and Kalyanpuri under the East Corporation.Another ward in the East Corporation, Chauhan Banger, was won by the Congress. The BJP won no seats.The five seats fell vacant after four councillors won the assembly elections in 2020 and one died two years back. While four seats of the five seats were earlier held by AAP, the Shalimar Bagh seat was held by BJP. The bypolls were held last Sunday. While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal bodies.

03-03-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka minister faces allegations of sexual exploitation||An activist has filed a police complaint in Bengaluru accusing Karnataka minister Ramesh Jarkiholi of sexually exploiting a woman. Dinesh Kalahalli, the activist, has released a video and screengrabs that purportedly show the minister with the woman to back up his allegation. Local news channels have also aired a phone conversation purportedly between Jarkiholi and the woman.“Since there are threats and an environment of fear, the victim is not filing the complaint. Her family approached me,” Kalahalli said.Deputy police commissioner (Bengaluru Central) said they would like to first speak to the woman and her relatives, but the activist has not given them any information regarding them. “We are trying to ascertain who they are and are trying to contact them.”Also Read | Who is stirring the caste cauldron in Karnataka?In his complaint, Kalahalli has alleged Jarkiholi exploited the woman after she approached him for some help with a short film.Ramesh Jarkiholi could not be reached for comment and texts to the minister went unanswered.His brother, Balachandra Jarkiholi, who is also a ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker, said the police should investigate the political forces behind the video. “If it is true, then will ask Ramesh to seek the state’s forgiveness and retire,” he added.Balachandra Jarkiholi said the woman has not complained. “Some random person has filed it and it is wrong. I have requested the CM [chief minister BS Yediyurappa] to give the case to the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] or COD [Corps of Detectives],” he said after meeting Yediyurappa.Ramesh Jarkiholi was among the lawmakers who defected from the Congress in 2019 and helped the BJP return to power in Karnataka.BJP leader and Union minister Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday said that he was not aware of the details of the case against Ramesh Jarkiholi but has seen media reports about it. “I will inquire about this incident and then react. An investigation is a must,” Joshi said. He said that if the incident is genuine, it is a matter of shame. “We should be clean and there is no compromise on this.”Ramesh Jarkiholi enjoys significant influence in Belagavi.Top leaders of the opposition Congress met at former chief minister Siddaramaiah’s residence to discuss the issue as the party workers took to the streets to protest against Ramesh Jarkiholi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-minister-faces-allegations-of-sexual-exploitation-101614761132180.html
03-03-2021||Other||Cleaner, more aware... but for the most part, life back to normal in Pune’s Covid hotspots||PUNE During the early days of the pandemic last year, when the rest of the city was relatively untouched by the coronavirus that causes the Covid-19 infection, Kashewadi slum in Bhavani peth had become a hotspot of infection.The virus, according to civic health department officials, entered the population here through a domestic help working at the home of a family that had just returned from abroad.The infection slowly took enveloped Kashewadi, a population of 11,000, and the slum was reporting 60 per cent of the overall number of cases in city in May and June last year. Gradually, Covid-19 to another slum on Tadiwala road, under the Dhole Patil road ward office, making it difficult for the civic machinery to control its spread, as both localities are congested.Residents also use public toilets, where social distancing norms were flouted. A year later, these two slums are reporting fewer cases, though many in these localities have returned to their pre-Covid lifestyle, which the experts say, is risky.For Kamal Ghadge, a resident of Kashewadi slum in Bhavani peth, nothing seems to have changed.Recalling her Covid-19 experience, one year later, Ghadge said, “We were completely scared when the Covid outbreak happened. None of our family members went out except to use the public toilets. A year later, I do not see much change in our slum and even in the surrounding area, except that cleanliness of roads and toilets has gotten better.” Bhavani peth is known for its wholesale stores as well. A majority of the residents have been living here for decades and are engaged in daily labour work. When the Covid graph went down, most bylanes were freed from being containment zones. As a result, people began crowding the small chowks. Public toilets too, have once again started seeing crowds, with people queuing up awaiting their turn.Mangesh Joseph Manuel, another resident of the area, said, “We live in a building under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. During the peak, our building had multiple positive cases and some even died due to the infection. Even I tested positive during the lockdown, but we maintained home cleanliness and self-hygiene on a priority.” According to Manuel, the SRA buildings in Bhavani peth area are the dirtiest. “Garbage was found lying all over the parking and circulating areas of the buildings. Very few people were wearing face masks and some of them were openly spitting on the road,” says Manuel. When HT visited some public toilets at Kashewadi, it was clean, though people were crowding there to chit-chat outside.Vajir Shaikh, a resident going of the Kashewadi slum area said, “As we live in a slum area there are no separate toilets, so we are dependent on public toilets. When the lockdown started and Covid positive cases were on rise, the main reason of spread was common toilet usage. PMC workers are cleaning the toilets several times a day for the last one year. Now we don’t fear going to the toilet.” The situation is no different in the Tadiwala road slum area, with a population of 8,000. Surekha Kamble, a resident of the Tadiwala road slum area said, “We have now become used to these conditions. For few months there was a fear of getting infected which is now gone. PMC workers clean the roads, but since the population is so large, throughout the day garbage gathers on the corners of the roads. Mostly, we do not send our children outside to play. There is need to clean the roads twice a day.” While Tadiwala slum is close to the Pune railway station, both, local and migrant population live here. Many are engaged in daily wage work. Many from this slum also work as support staff at hospitals on the Dhole Patil road, like Ruby Hall clinic, Jehangir and even Sasoon Hospital.From May to July 2020, daily cases in Tadiwala slum were 20 to 30, though the tally has now come down to just two cases per day. Sachin Tamkhede, PMC assistant municipal commissioner and Bhavani Peth ward officer said, “It was a difficult year for us, as a major slum with a densely populated area comes under our ward office. All the necessary steps according to the Covid guidelines are being taken on daily basis, but creating public awareness and that sense of responsibility towards keeping our area clean is what we are working on. We still continue to clean public toilets five times a day, and to keep a watch on it, a mobile application has been developed through which “before” and “after” photos of the cleaning needs to be uploaded by that PMC staffer. We have tried our all possible efforts to bring down the death rate in our ward, especially in the slum areas from where it started.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cleaner-more-aware-but-for-the-most-part-life-back-to-normal-in-pune-s-covid-hotspots-101614759211282.html

The leopard was shot dead by a forest department appointed hunter Rajeev Soloman in Kanalichhina block on Tuesday evening," said Naveen Chandra Pant, sub-divisional forest officer of Pithoragarh forest division."The leopard had injuries on its two legs, and it probably started attacking humans because they are easy prey. The carcass has been sent for post-mortem examination" he said.On February 28, the leopard killed a 70-year-woman Tulsi Devi in Suroli village of Pithoragarh district. The woman had gone missing in the day. Villagers later found her remains in the forest, 150 metres from the village.On February 18, the leopard killed 50-year-old Kalavati Devi in Kapri village. After this attack, furious locals demanded that the leopard be shot dead.Chief wildlife warden, through the invocation of Clause 11 (1) (a) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, can declare any wild animal as a threat to human life and as such fit to be destroyed. The Act states that ‘chief wildlife warden of the state may, if he is satisfied that any wild animal specified in Schedule I has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, by order in writing and stating the reasons, therefore, permit any person to hunt such animal or cause such animal to be hunted’.Also Read: Police crackdown on villagers sparks pandemonium in Uttarakhand assemblyThe forest official said this was the third man-eater leopard to have been killed this year in the Kumaon region.

We fear that his resignation will not be accepted once the session is over. So, he is still the forest minister of the state. We expect some more drama in a few days over Sanjay Rathod's resignation," he said.BJP MLA from Buldhana, Sanjay Kute said Rathod is still the Forest minister and enjoys all the privileges of being a minister."What I remember, the Chief Minister had announced about Sanjay Rathod's resignation in the press conference before the Budget session but the resignation is still not accepted and forwarded to the Governor, which means Sanjay Rathod is still Forest minister of the state and he can enjoy all the privileges of being a minister," Kute said.The BJP MLA said the Chief Minister still wants to keep Rathod in the cabinet as his resignation has not been sent to the Governor.He also alleged that the Chief Minister has still not allocated the forest department to any other minister as an additional charge, which makes his allegation more valid that Rathod is still forest minister of Maharashtra.On February 8, Chavan had allegedly jumped off a building in Pune to end her life. Hailing from Parli town in Beed, Chavan had gone to Pune for an English speaking course. A couple of days after her death, some of her audio clips went viral on social media which the opposition took up and pointed fingers at the Maharashtra Forest Minister Sanjay Rathod, demanding an investigation into the case.The BJP has alleged that Rathod is connected with the mysterious death of the woman in Pune.

03-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt to make probe report on Mumbai power outage public||Post the massive power outage that brought Mumbai to a complete halt on October 12, 2020, the state and Centre constituted committees to investigate the reasons behind the incident. While none of the reports have been made public as yet, state energy minister Nitin Raut on Monday said that all the reports will be tabled in the ongoing budget session of the Maharashtra legislature, where he will discuss them. Reports of a Chinese cyber attack being the reason behind the power outage came to the fore on Monday. State home minister Anil Deshmukh also said that the state’s cyber police investigations indicated cyber sabotage by some foreign countries. However, the Central government refuted these reports on Tuesday, stating that the incident was the result of a human error. Union Power minister RK Singh said on Tuesday that the government not in possession of any evidence which could prove that the power outage was caused by a cyber attack by either China or Pakistan. “We don’t have evidence to say that the cyber attacks were carried out by China or Pakistan. Some people say that the group behind the attacks is Chinese but we don’t have evidence. China will definitely deny it,” Singh told ANI.Also Read | ‘Mumbai power outage due to human error, no proof of China’s role’: Union minTaking suo motu cognisance of the Mumbai power outage, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has ordered an enquiry by an independent committee. MERC stated that the committee needs to “verify and analyse the submissions of all parties, to find out the root cause of the incident, to examine the adequacy of protection systems/islanding system etc. and to verify the adequacy of responses of all concerned.” The committee also has to probe if the generation and distribution companies followed the protocol for restoration of power supply to the city. In a separate notification, MERC stated that the committee includes retired IAS officer Dr Sudhir Kumar Goel, the chairman, V Ramakrishnan, an ex member of the Central Electricity Authority, and Dr Faruk Kazi, the head of the electrical engineering department at the Veermara Jijabai Technical Institute. Goel said, “While we have submitted the report, we are not permitted to reveal any details.” Also Read | Calls for review of islanding system following October 12 Mumbai power outageThe Union power ministry had also constituted a committee under the Central Electricity Authority to check whether the grid failure was because of technical flaws or a manual error. The committee, chaired by the CEA chief engineer, also has to probe as to why Mumbai’s islanding system did not work. Apart from this, the state government also constituted a committee with members from the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd to probe the incident. The Maharashtra cyber police were also asked to look into the incident after Raut hinted at possible sabotage on October 13, 2020. Maharashtra inspector general of police (Cyber) Yashasvi Yadav, under whose supervision the investigation was conducted and the report prepared, said, “We have submitted the investigation report to the home minister and he has already outlined the four major findings, including introducing Trojan Horses into the server, unaccounted transferring of around 8GB of data from unidentified foreign servers, hacking attempts by blacklisted Internet protocol (IP) addresses, etc. We have explained the entire attack with proofs.

03-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai power outage: Electricity regulator had raised questions on islanding system||Mumbai: Mumbai’s electricity regulator questioned the failure of the city’s decades’ old islanding system at its hearing held last year on the October 12 grid failure. It also pointed to a delay bringing the generating units on the bar during the outage.The regulator, in an order, said that the failure of the system, the delay, possible inadvertent tripping by the station operator at Kharghar substation, delay in load management/load disconnections, inadequate load trimming, etc., are some of the reasons for the outage stated by the stakeholders.“However, verification of individual submissions and root cause analysis by independent experts would be necessary to find out the exact reason for the incident. This analysis would also help to take appropriate (immediate and medium-term) remedial measures for ensuring that such an incident do not recur in future,” it said.The stakeholders called to the hearing on October 20 also questioned the grid failure and the delay in restoration of power supply by Tata Power.In its submission to the regulator on October 20, Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) noted: “ Delayed restoration of power supply in Mumbai has caused immense hardship to BEST’s consumers in the critical Covid pandemic scenario. The prolonged power failure could have been avoided, had Mumbai system survived from outside grid disturbance after operationalisation of Mumbai Islanding scheme and if TPC (Tata Power Company Ltd) was able to bring its hydro/ thermal generation into service without delay. Hence, further review of Mumbai Islanding scheme considering load/generation balance is necessary.”“Mumbai Generating Companies, Transmission Licensees and MSLDC [Maharashtra State Load Despatch Centre] were aware of critical situation arising due to failure of 400 kV lines in the early morning of 12 October, 2020. Accordingly, a contingency plan should have been initiated to avoid any further grid disturbance,” it added. The BEST said the strengthening of Mumbai transmission is essential to remove the congestion in the system.“The occurrence severely affected the power supply to a large section of population of MMR [Mumbai Metropolitan Region]. Hence, occurrence was required to be taken cognisance of for ascertaining actions pertaining to dereliction of actions, if any, in operation and maintenance of lines, system security, failure of protection and to achieve intended islanding of critical load-generation balance for areas.”The regulator said it was appropriate to initiate a suo motu proceeding to find the primary reasons for the partial grid failure, response, and performance of licensees/generators and for identifying preventive measures. It issued a notice on October 17 asking MSLDC to submit a detailed report on the partial grid failure.Islanding system refers to the condition in which a generator provides electricity to a location even though electrical grid power is no longer available. Tata Power introduced the system in 1981. It is unique to the region and the only such system in the country.At the hearing, executives of Tata Power too suggested that the islanding system needs to “be relooked”.“We have all been historically dependent on the islanding scheme, but since the generation and incoming power ratio is changing, a change is required in the islanding scheme itself. With the central coordination and Western Regional Power Committee (WRPC), we have to completely relook at the islanding scheme in view of less embedded generation and more import of power,” Sanjay Banga, president, transmission and distribution, Tata Power, said in his representation to the regulator.The islanding system has an embedded power generation of 1,877 megawatts. Banga said earlier this was enough to meet the electricity demand of Mumbai. It also accounts for less than half the peak demand of Mumbai and adjoining areas. To meet the balance demand, power is imported from outside the islanding system.According to the regulator’s order, Tata Power said that its hydro units were picked up but the same could not be synchronised with the grid. The company added the rate of frequency decline was so high that before the breaker operation could complete, the frequency dropped significantly.Tata Power also noted that since 1997, there was no failure of the islanding system.“ Initial analysis of TPC suggests that islanding system works effectively in generation rich system. In past islanding events, the embedded generation was around 80 to 90% of the load. However, in the present event, almost 60% of power was from outside Mumbai and also almost 1000 MW availability was dropped at Kalwa Substation. TPC-G generation was picking up, but the system changes were so rapid in its transient state that Islanding System could not operate successfully,” it said.“Considering the fact that embedded generation capacity is reducing over time, Mumbai demand is increasing, and more and more power being received from outside Mumbai, review of existing Islanding System and review of frequency setting needs to be undertaken.” It added that the company has formed an internal committee to analyse the event and look into the technical issues in detail.The regulator also ordered that a high-level expert committee be formed to analyse the root cause of the tripping that led to the grid failure. It added the committee will have to submit its report within three months of the formation. “The high level committee had in January asked for the extension in submitting its final report,” a power ministry official said.According to MSLDC, there was inadvertent tripping by a station operator at the Kharghar substation, which resulted in the outage. “There was considerable delay in bringing TPC-G Unit 5 and Unit 7 on bar. Also, Hydro Generating Units that are expected to come on bar in short time, but same were also synchronised with the grid with considerable delay.”The regulator noted: “It is necessary to find out as to what happened at individual stakeholder level and what needs to be done in future at individual stakeholder level and collectively at systems level to avoid recurrence of such event.”It added in the past when similar incidents occurred, studies were undertaken through expert committees to find out the primary reason for the grid disturbances. Based on their recommendations, glaring difficulties were rectified. “However, the long-term plans for infrastructure augmentation/development seem not to have materialised in toto as was expected. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine as to whether the delay in implementation of recommendations/suggestions of the Committees had any bearing on the partial grid failure of MMR that occurred on 12 October, 2020.”The outage was back in the spotlight after American cyber intelligence company Recorded Future said it had uncovered a suspected China-linked cyber operation that was focussed on India’s electricity grid and other critical infrastructure. While the company did not link the Mumbai incident to the operation it discovered, it did not rule it out either.According to Recorded Future, RedEcho deployed malware known as ShadowPad, which has been previously linked to Chinese cyber soldiers. ShadowPad has the ability to hand over systems controls to malicious hackers, who can then make potentially catastrophic to sensitive industrial systems.Chinese government-linked attackers possibly gained access to computer networks part of India’s power infrastructure, the American firm said, citing technical clues that federal power ministry officials separately said had been on their radar, fuelling speculation that a blackout in Mumbai last year may have been the result of sabotage.Hours after the disclosure, the Union power ministry said it had received inputs from Indian agencies—first in November and then again in February this year—about the threat of infection from ShadowPad, prompting remedial measures to be taken.On Tuesday, Union power minister RK Singh said the power outage in Mumbai in October was caused by “human error”, not a cyber-attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/calls-for-review-of-islanding-system-following-october-12-mumbai-power-outage-101614754592878.html
03-03-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s tales: Pune gets its first names... royal patronages recognise sacred headquarters||Those of you who have read Sherlock Holmes would know the name of the unusual Diogenes club for recluses and private people, of which Sherlock’s brother, Mycroft was a member. Such eccentric clubs are not figment of someone’s imagination, but exist even around us. You must have heard of the laughter club where people laugh their hearts out for better health, or the left-handers’ association.I am a member of one such seemingly bizarre, but fascinating society called, Place Name Society of India. Society members study and analyse various identities and meanings which can be derived from the name of particular place. The name of a place is central to its cultural identity. It often carries meaning which provides rationale for adoption and continuity of a particular name. In this column, we have traced the origin of Pune’s settlement through the ages, and arrive at a settlement which had an urban character.Dr M R Kantak, senior historian, associates Pune with Punnala/Punnata from the ancient Roman text of Ptolemy’s “Geography”, in an article in the book “Shahar Pune”. However, except for similar sounding names, we do not have direct evidence to connect the name to Pune. Other scholars have claimed that “Punnala/Punnata” resemble some ancient towns in south India. So, the speculation of it being Pune cannot be fully substantiated.An interesting connection is found at the famous Buddhist site of Sanchi, informing us of a donation from Pune. The name in Brahmi script is mentioned as “Punyavardhana” and the late Dr Harihar Thosar claims it to be our very own Pune. By virtue of it being on the confluence of the rivers Mutha and Mula, proximity to the Indo-Roman trade route and Buddhist activity, Pune always seem to be identified as Punya Kshetra, a sacred place. The discovery of Satavahana period artifacts from Pune strengthens this claim to the original name of Pune. The clenching evidence comes much later during the eighth century CE when various clans of kings named Rashtrakutas ruled this country. On a new moon day of Ashwin month in year 758 CE, on the occasion of a solar eclipse, Krishna Raja I, the Rashtrakuta king donated land to a Brahmin called Pugadibhatta. The donated village was “Bopkhelugram” (modern Bhopkhel suburb on Alandi road). The copperplate mentions the boundary of this village surrounded by “Kalas” village on the east (suburb Kalas by the same name), river “Muila” on the south (river Mula), “Darpapudika” to the west (Dapodi of the present day) and “Bhesuri” (Bhosari suburb) on the north. The names of the areas could have been Sanskriticised to fit the prose in the order of things.The copperplate describes all the above references to be belonging to the administrative unit of Pune, aka “Punya – vishaya”. Vishay roughly encompasses around several hundred villages in those days and is used to denote the central headquarters, in this case “Punya” for Pune. Thus, it is the first time we are able to put a face and name to the silent entity, Pune.Shortly after this, on March 23, 768 CE, another piece of land is granted on the occasion of the new moon, by the same king, Kishna Raja I. It was donated to the Brahmins belonging to “Karad Vishaya”. The village of Kumarigram (Koregaon Bhima), along with other villages such Bhamropara (Bhowrapur), Aralva (Urali), (Sindugram (Sinadon) and Turudee (Tadavale) were donated. These villages were made free from all oppression through taxes and the records mention that the order should be respected by future kings from any linage. It also mentions surrounding villages such as Khamgaon, Bori, Dalimb, Theur, and Alandi (Chorachi) on the boundaries and river Muila (Mula).Pune is referred slightly in different manner as “Punak- vishaya”, again a headquarter. It could be derived from the older form “Punnaka”.Another incomplete copper plate in Rajwade Sanshodhan Mandal, Dhule’s collection, belonging to Sind king Mahasamant Adityavarman, records a grant to Navashiv, a Brahmin from Madhya Pradesh. On this copper plate, dated March 6, 965 CE, the Kinhika village (Kinhai to the north west of Pune) on the banks of river Indra (Indrayani) is donated. This village falls under the settlement and administrative unit of Ramtirthika, which according to Dr Manjiri Bhalerao, can be identified on the banks of river Ram in Pune.Rashtrakuta rule was followed by their feudatories, the Shilahara kings, who rose to power in subsequent centuries. The Janjira copperplate of the Shilahara dynasty king, Aparajita, dated to August 20, 993, mentions the conquest of Punaka vishaya, i.e. Pune, as an important career achievement.

She had a 101-degree fever and needed dialysis. Two of the three Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)-run Covid-designated hospitals with dialysis centres were out of beds. Patil and her husband, Sudhir, were forced to spend the day outside KEM, the city’s largest public hospital managed by BMC, before she could be admitted, tested for Covid, and then treated. It was only around 2 am the following day that Patil was admitted. Her treatment began on a stretcher because no bed was available.“The whole ward was full. Not a single bed was vacant. There were patients lying on the floor. I was on a stretcher, and I did not even have a bedsheet to cover myself. I was scared and I felt alone. My husband was not allowed inside the Covid ward,” Patil, who spent two weeks in the hospital, said. “I still have nightmares about that night.”Maharashtra recorded its first set of Covid-19 cases on March 9 when a Pune-bound couple landed in Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji International airport from Dubai. The couple took a taxi from the airport to Pune, where they were tested. The taxi driver and the couple’s daughter also tested positive for the virus.Also Read | Maharashtra’s daily Covid-19 cases remain below 8,000 for second straight dayExactly a month later, around the time Patil went to the hospital, Mumbai had 1182 active cases. But the city had only 200 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and 50 ventilators in the six Covid-designated public hospitals for the more serious patients who required hospitalisation. Mumbai had the highest number of cases among all major Indian cities.Things were only about to get worse.Mumbai has a population of more than 20 million people. Of them, 12 million live in slums, where the population density and lack of sanitation facilities — a neighbourhood comprising close to 200 families usually share one toilet complex — meant that conditions were for any pandemic to spread. Dharavi, the country’s largest slum, is home to 650,000 people in a 2.4-km sq area. Its population density is 10 times that of Manhattan in New York City, where the pandemic had created havoc through March.The comparison between Mumbai and New York was inevitable. Around the time that Patil went to KEM hospital, New York had more confirmed cases than any country outside the US. Nearly half of the cases in the US were in New York. Dozens of people were dying every day. The hospitals were simply unable to cope in New York. This was feared to become Mumbai’s fate too. By May 21, the number of cases in Mumbai surpassed the caseload of 158 countries, including the UAE, Indonesia and Ireland.“Mumbai is not like other cities. It has unique geographical and sociological characteristics. It is home to the largest slum, Dharavi, which acts as a ticking bomb in any epidemic outbreak. So, when the first case was reported in India in January, the civic body should have been more cautious and started testing all domestic and international passengers. But it was not done until mid-March,” said Dr Abhijit More, the co-convenor of Jan Arogya Abhiyaan, a non-governmental organisation.Also Read | With 14,989 fresh Covid-19 infections, India’s active cases surge past 170,000That was not the only thing Mumbai was unprepared for.By April, Mumbai’s positivity rate (the percentage of people whose test results returned positive for the coronavirus among the total number) was 8%. It shot up to 18% in May and 21.2% in July. Even with BMC’s decision to use 80% of the beds of all private hospitals in the city, there was one isolation bed per 5,246 residents.Soon, people began to be sent away from hospitals for the lack of beds. On May 1, a family from Chembur visited five hospitals to get a 62-year-old woman admitted but could not. Four days later, the woman succumbed to the infection without treatment. “I had never felt so helpless as I did when I could not save my mother. I was ready to put in all my savings, but no hospital was ready to admit and treat her,” said her daughter.On May 13, a 35-year-old bank loan agent took a test to confirm whether his symptoms were Covid-related. His results returned positive two days later. Following this, four different hospitals turned him away for lack of ICU beds, though his condition was steadily deteriorating. Finally, he was admitted to a hospital in Jogeshwari, but died a night later. “If he got treatment on time, I could have saved him,” his brother said.Reports of infected patients sharing beds in BYL Nair, Dr RN Cooper and Lokmanya Tilak General (Sion) hospitals emerged, and videos of patients lying close to bodies wrapped in black polythene bags in Covid-19 hospital wards began to circulate on social media. By mid-June, half the state’s death toll was being recorded from Mumbai. All 11 electric crematoria in the city worked overtime as grief-stricken families formed serpentine queues, often waiting for seven to 10 hours to lay their loved ones to rest.Pandemic centralMumbai is no stranger to pandemics and its authorities have faced a steep learning curve each time. In fact, much of the city as we know it today is a result of a planning body that was created in the wake of the bubonic plague which first hit the city in 1896. The following year, the city’s first and only infectious diseases hospital — now called Kasturba hospital — was set up. By 1918, the plague epidemic claimed 160,000 lives in the city alone. The same year, the Influenza epidemic hit the city claiming several thousand more lives over the course of two years. But when the Covid-19 pandemic hit Mumbai in March 2020, Kasturba hospital had only 150 beds (including ICU beds) where suspected and confirmed infected patients could be quarantined.The problem facing the health infrastructure was two-fold: a severe shortage of beds and ventilators across primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals; two, doctors, nurses and other health care providers falling prey to Covid-19, which meant that the already immense strain on health centres was getting worse.The state appointed a nine-member task force, comprising doctors, to guide policy decisions. One of the first recommendations it made was to ask the BMC to consider taking over all hospitals in the city, and reserve around 70% of it for Covid-19 patients. This advice eventually came in handy, as the BMC began to direct officials to acquire beds as well as ICU wards from private nursing homes and smaller hospitals spread across all 24 wards of the city, as cases began to rocket.By May, the BMC had acquired an additional 2,400 beds in this way. But it would still prove to be not nearly enough.Within a month of the outbreak, more than 100 medical staffers from nine major private hospitals including Jaslok, Saifee, Breach Candy, Nanavati and Hinduja (Khar) tested positive for the virus, leading to a partial shutdown of their emergency and OPD wards. By mid-July, more than 1,000 doctors and nurses had already contracted the infection in the city.To avoid getting infected, doctors would work entire shifts in PPE kits, dehydration, and menstrual cycle notwithstanding. “When the pandemic started, we were given cheap quality donated PPEs which were not even safe to use. Due to fear, we stopped visiting our families and were quarantined in lodges and hotels,” said a resident doctor from KEM.According to the Indian Medical Association, more than 40 private practitioners have succumbed to the infection.Steep learning curve“Since the virus was new, we did not have any knowledge of its epidemiological characteristics. Therefore, just like the rest of the world, we had to learn through trial and error,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.In April, BMC’s 24x7 disaster helpline number, 1916, began to field calls for Covid-related queries. Anyone seeking a bed in a hospital had to call this helpline to get registered and the bed, when available, would be allotted. Soon, volunteers were busy round the clock, fielding up to 4,000 calls a day on average. Over 22,000 calls were recorded till February 2021 and almost 60% of them were enquiries about hospital beds.It was only towards the end of May that volunteers could provide real-time information to the callers on the availability of beds in Covid-designated hospitals, when the BMC came out with a live dashboard. At the time, according to a press release by the municipal body, 96% of the city’s Covid ICU beds, 63% of the Oxygen support beds and 66% of the ventilators had already been used up.The BMC also came out with a standard operating procedure (SOP) in the second week of April to treat patients depending on the severity of the condition. The civic body opened Covid Care Centres (CCC-1 and 2) — the first for high-risk contacts of positive persons and the second for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients — in makeshift facilities such as lodges, stadiums, schools, hotels and hostels. Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) were opened for symptomatic patients, moderately ill patients and some patients with comorbidities. Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) were opened for patients showing prolonged symptoms of fever, cough, and breathlessness, senior citizens, as well as severely ill and critical patients who needed ICUs.Covid jumbo facilities were opened across the city in Mulund, Dahisar, Mahalaxmi, Race Course, Goregaon and Bandra Kurla Complex, which helped increase the bed capacity. The Mumbai Cricket Association temporarily handed over the possession of Wankhede Stadium for use by emergency staff of BMC and to quarantine Covid-19 positive but asymptomatic patients. So did the privately-run National Sports Club of India, which gave the BMC space within its complex to set up a Jumbo centre.In July, when Mumbai hit its peak, it had 16,859 beds in all dedicated Covid hospitals. By October, the city had nearly 70,000 beds across all CCC1 and 2 facilities, which also included seven jumbo Covid centres that could cumulatively handle 5,000 patients. As the number of cases began to flatten out, hospitals began to reduce the number of beds for Covid patients. In December, there were 13,898 beds in hospitals, and almost 80% of the CCC-1 beds were unoccupied.An aggressive trace, test and quarantine system was also put in place by the BMC. High-risk contacts of infected patients were made to stay in CCC-1, and those above 60 years with comorbidities were isolated. In May, a home isolation protocol came into place: if the symptoms did not warrant hospitalization, people were asked to stay home and isolate if possible.“Following the instructions of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), we started quarantining all asymptomatic and mild/moderate patients in their houses. In slums, we isolated the high-risk contacts like senior citizens and people with comorbidities in CCC-1,” said Daksha Shah, executive health officer, BMC.Till February 25, 2021, the city’s municipal body had traced over 4.5 million close contacts including 2 million high-risk, and 4.4 million people had been quarantined at home. The civic body also started door-to-door screening where people were checked for fever, cold, oxygen saturation levels and other Covid-19 symptoms.“Though the lockdown had impacted people’s lives adversely, it gave us breathing time to chalk out our plan. Good decision making and sincere implementation helped us stop the spread,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North that covers Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim.Lessons learnt“The outbreak has got the civic body to realise the importance of having a robust health care system, one that is fully equipped and battle-ready. If Mumbai residents have to live with the virus and other similar deadly infections in today’s increasingly interconnected and interdependent world, they have to focus on filling up the cracks in the health infrastructure,” said Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the civic body’s death committee.It is almost a year since the outbreak of the pandemic that brought Mumbai to a standstill. The positivity rate came down to 10% in January. But in February, the daily cases have seen a sharp hike.New strains of the virus, first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have also been seen in India, including in Maharashtra, and while there is no link found between the new strains and the rise in cases, it is clear that the pandemic is not over.“The battle against Sars-CoV-2 is far from over. After staying in the house for months, people have become fatigued. Their guards are down. Wedding ceremonies and family functions have become super spreader events. We need to tighten our grip and follow all precautionary measures,” Supe said.Spotlight has also fallen on the hard lessons that the municipal body — the richest in the country — has learnt in the past year. An analysis of BMC’s three-year budget shows that only 13% of its revenue is invested in the health sector which health experts have called “inadequate”.This year, the allocation for health care in BMC’s budget is ₹4,728.53 crore, of which a capital expenditure of ₹1,206.14 crore has been earmarked.“The BMC has proposed to improve the infrastructure of health care institutes, carry out major structural repairs at 29 hospitals, 287 health posts and/or dispensaries and 28 maternity homes for which ₹822 crore has been allocated,” said Iqbal Singh Chahal, BMC commissioner, while presenting this year’s budget.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccination drive turnout improving in MaharashtraA report by independent public-policy think tank IDFC pointed out the focus on expenditure has always been on secondary and tertiary care, rather than primary care. “While expenditure on hospitals was 74% of Mumbai’s health budget, only 26% was spent on dispensaries,” it read. Primary care centres offer the first line of defence; if they continue to remain ill-equipped and under-staffed, the effects are felt throughout the health care infrastructure, as the past year has shown.“We will be focusing on developing the 19 peripheral hospitals. Also, we have plans to construct a building inside Kasturba Hospital for patients with infectious diseases. We want to make both horizontal and vertical growth in the health sector,” Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said.A September 2020 report by Praja Foundation, an NGO working for accountable governance, also pointed out that the overall vacancy of medical personnel in civic medical institutions was 27% in 2015 which increased to 47% in 2019.“It is time for the civic body to introspect if they meet the required standards mentioned laid by the union health ministry. The pandemic has been an eye-opener,” said Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee, Praja Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hard-knocks-and-tough-lessons-how-mumbai-s-health-infra-coped-with-covid19-101614753091784.html

Delhi goes to municipal polls next year.Though the outcome of the bypolls will not alter the composition of north and east corporations as BJP has a comfortable majority, it is a setback for the party as it couldn’t even retain its stronghold, Shalimar Bagh ward. The bypolls are seen as the precursor to municipal elections scheduled next year. Political parties admit that the result will set the tone for the upcoming elections.However, reacting to his party’s poor performance, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “Our workers worked very hard in these bypolls. We will analyse the result and see where we went wrong.

03-03-2021||Patna||Bihar relies on village chowkidars to resolve land disputes early, reduce crime||To get information of land disputes from far-flung villages that often lead to serious crimes, the Bihar government will now use village chowkidars. The department of revenue and land reforms has asked the chowkidars to provide weekly information on land disputes, enabling the concerned circle officer (CO) and station house officer (SHO) to take the necessary preventive measures to resolve the cases early, officials said on Tuesday.It is assumed that the village chowkidars have all the information on land disputes in their respective villages. The department has also deputed IPS officer, Chandrashekhar Vidyarthi, to review the weekly land dispute meetings organised by the COs and SHOs every Saturdays and suggest corrective measures.Last year, the department asked all the CO and SHOs to hold weekly meetings on Saturdays to resolve land disputes. Besides, chief minister Nitish Kumar on December 8, 2020, in a review meeting held by the department of revenue and land reforms, emphasised on the importance of village chowkidars in getting timely information on land disputes.According to the National Crime Bureau Record (NCRB), in Bihar in 2019, there were 3,707 crime incidents related to land and property disputes, while the number of people killed were 5,227, or 3.1% per lakh.A department official said despite the government orders some COs were not uploading the information from weekly meetings on the official website.“According to the IT cell of the department, till March 1, 2021, out of total 534 circles in Bihar, 182 COs had not provided information to the department for weekly review of each circle.

Here is all you need to know about the projection:• The number is roughly half the 4.2 million previously estimated when authorities believed the age criteria would be lower at 50 and above, and more pre-existing illnesses would be included in the list of conditions to qualify a person to get shots in this phase.• Instead, the drive now covers those above 60 and identifies a list of 20 specific comorbid conditions that will allow anyone above the age of 45 to get doses.• The final numbers will depend on the number of registrations that happen. • For the third category of people being vaccinated, the new Co-WIN portal depends on self-registration or bulk registrations. • The final number will depend on how many people come forward, get registered, and vaccinated.• The first dose for the beneficiary group in Delhi comprising people aged over 60 and those in the age group of 45-59 with any of the 20 comorbid conditions is expected to be covered in two to three months.• According to estimates for Delhi, there are 1.22 million people between the ages of 60 and 69, 0.67 million between the ages of 70 and 79, and 0.23 million over the age of 80 years, who are currently included on the priority list.• Additionally, the number of people eligible, because they have one of the 20 medical conditions that put them at higher risk if they have Covid-19, is expected to be around 22,000. • On average, Delhi has been carrying out 19,236 vaccinations daily over the last week. As of Tuesday, the city has 308 centres, each of which can give doses to 100 people a day. • The government is planning to add 100 more, raising the daily capacity to over 40,000, a second district official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-ongoing-covid-19-vaccination-drive-to-cover-2-14-million-key-points-101614744151471.html

In January, despite frequent flight cancellations due to foggy weather, 20,420 passengers travelled on 132 flights. In December, the airport handled 158 flights and 26,318 passengers. Flight operations under RCS-UDAN scheme was launched in Darbhanga on November 8 last year.Airport director Biplab Kumar Mondal said the Airport Authority of India was making all efforts for smooth and comfortable travel despite limited space at civil enclave at Darbhanga airport, which is also an Indian Air Force base. He said a plan is being made for the construction of a permanent civil enclave after land acquisition is done for the purpose."We have to be more inventive in utilising existing facilities to ensure a convenient journey amid rising numbers of passengers,” Mondal added.Recently, at the civil aviation consultative committee meeting, minister Hardeep Singh Puri said Darbhanga airport was one of most successful examples under the RCS scheme.Spicejet, the lone airline with a license to fly from Darbhanga under UDAN, has again opened booking for Ahmedabad after having discontinued the direct Darbhanga-Ahmedabad flight on February 15. The airline officials, however, declined to confirm the resumption of the flight. However, it is confirmed that the airline is starting the second daily flight to Mumbai from March 10.Also Read:Hotter summer forecast for Bihar with maximum temperatures rising in March-MayThe launch of flights on Hyderabad and Pune routes from Darbhanga continues to be in limbo for want of necessary clearances.

03-03-2021||Delhi||Snatching Delhi’s main gateway crime: Data||Unemployed, illiterate, school drop-outs, arrested for the first time – these are common threads that connect almost every person arrested for snatching in Delhi since 2018, highlighting how one of the most serious concerns on the streets of the national capital is also its biggest gateway crime.An HT analysis of the profile of snatchers arrested in Delhi between 2018 and 2020 shows that more than 90% of those arrested were caught for the first time, and did not have any criminal record until then. Police registered them as “first-time offenders”.Of the 6,496 people arrested in 2020, at least 5,977 (92.98%) were first-time offenders. In 2019, of the 5,243 arrested, this number was 4,806 (91.66%), and in 2018, 5,167 out of the 5,346 people (96.66%) arrested for snatching had no past record.Snatching has come sharply under the spotlight after a woman was last week stabbed to death in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar even as she held her two-year-old daughter in her arms while trying to defend herself against snatchers. The two men arrested for the crime — Fardeen,19, and Aqibul, 22 — were unemployed, school drop-outs, and like the majority of Delhi’s snatchers, had never been arrested before.“This is what makes snatching so difficult to control. Any person on the road could be a snatcher in Delhi — he need not be a hardcore criminal. Numerous cases of first-timers indulging in this crime shows how this is the first offence that one commits before entering the world of crime,” said a senior police officer who asked not to be named.It was a view that several other present and former cops agreed with.Citing an example of how several young men who turn to crime because of trying circumstances start by becoming snatchers, the officer cited above said at least 100 people arrested last year said that they had turned to snatching after losing their jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The situation is that a person loses his job and finds snatching as the second-best option to make a living. In October, we arrested a man named Mohsin, who worked in a shoe store but lost his job during the lockdown. He then got in touch with his two friends and tried to snatch a man’s phone outside Red Fort. The examples are too many. There are no records of such persons,” a second officer said. Explaining the difficulties in keeping track of such people, a third senior officer said: “It is easier to keep tabs on hardcore criminals and their gangs. Their activities and areas of operation are known; we can place informers. But many young men who are snatchers manage to slip through the net because they don’t have a record. It takes a concerted effort to bring down snatching cases.”Though snatching cases in Delhi rose in 2020 as compared to 2019 — 7965 as compared to 6266 — the third officer said that distress calls to the Police Control Room number, 112, was a better indicator of mapping the crime. The calls are a part of the record and cannot be removed from the log. According to police’s crime data, in 2020 there were 24,746 snatching calls, compared to 56,937 in 2019. However, the calls do not mean number of incidents, as the same victim could have made multiple calls; and victims sometimes refer to “theft” as “snatching”. The difference between the two, in police parlance, is that there is use of force in snatching.Further analysis of police data shows that of the snatchers arrested in 2020, almost 43.71% (2,840) were illiterate or school drop-outs (did not clear Class 5). In fact, only 10 of the arrested had graduate degrees.The data also showed that a cell phone was the most common item snatched — in at least 71% (5,655) of the cases — followed by gold jewellery such as necklace and bracelet in at least 15% cases (1,195) and a handbag or cash in at least 8% of the cases (638).EASY MONEYAdvocate LN RAO, who worked in Delhi Police for over three decades and retired as a deputy commissioner of police of the Special Cell, said snatching has become rampant because it’s relatively easy and offers instant returns.“Disposing of a snatched cell phone or a piece of gold jewellery is not a problem. An unemployed person vulnerable towards crime has realised that there is no dearth of buyers for such stolen items. It may be difficult to dispose a stolen car but this is not the case with cell phones or gold jewellery. With prices of cell phones and gold increasing regularly, the unemployed person, who has stolen those items, gets a good return,” he said.Rao said that a cell phone, which costs ₹30,000 could be sold at half its price, and a gold jewellery once stolen could be melted within minutes, removing all evidence of the crime.Another expert, Vikram Singh, who was a former director-general of the Uttar Pradesh police, said, “Incidents happening in many parts of the city show that the snatchers do not fear the police in Delhi. Police must hit back. I mean, hit hard. If snatchers are striking in different parts of the city, it means police are unable to create fear in the minds of the snatchers. Snatchers should know that if they indulge in any trick, the police will make them pay. Police should work towards that.”Delhi’s deputy commissioner of police of the crime branch, Chinmoy Biswal, who is also the police spokesperson, said, “ Our cases show that many juveniles are indulging in snatching. We cannot maintain their record. Many times, when they are caught, we find that they have a history of such crimes but there is no such record. Maintaining surveillance then becomes difficult. There are many first-time offenders too. Though it is not part of core policing, every year we identify youths, who could deviate towards crime if given an opportunity. As part of our YUVA programme, we helped thousands of such youths find jobs so that they can be weaned away from the wrong path. At times, there are some incidents but we have launched a massive crack down on snatching and all other crimes.The numbers of snatching calls have reducedwhile the number of arrested persons has increased.”LAWS NOT STRINGENTFormer additional commissioner of police, Ashok Chand, said the current laws were too lenient towards a heinous crime that can even lead to serious injuries or deaths. “The law has to be made stricter. Those vulnerable towards crime may be indulging in snatching because they know that they will get bail easily. Amending the law like the one in Haryana will put some rein on the snatchers.”In Delhi, there is no specific law related to snatching. Police arrest and book snatchers under Sections 379 (theft) and 356 (criminal force during theft). The maximum punishment, if convicted under the two sections, is three years. In contrast, Haryana has amended the laws and now book snatchers under Section 379A (snatching without use of force) and 379 B (with use of force). If a person is booked under these two sections, the maximum punishment is 10 years and 15 years respectively.LN Rao agreed that snatching cases will decrease if there is fear of the law.“It will go down the day a snatcher realises that the offence is non-bailable, that he can end up spending more than 10 years if caught. Until then, such would-be criminals will find snatching as an easy route,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/snatching-city-s-main-gateway-crime-data-101614739207489.html
03-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Razia Sultan’s local chai stall||A rickey table. A rickety bench. A kettle and a boiling pan. Rusks and biscuits stacked up in a small room behind.An old doorway across the lane. A historic tomb just around the turning.And tea trays, or chhikas, hanging on the wall—looking a bit like 3-D hashtags.This is Old Delhi’s most atmospheric chai stall, one wants to declare, though that would be unfair to other equally lovely chai shacks, not just in the historic Walled City but across the National Capital Region.And yet, it can safely be said that you ought to drop by this chai establishment. Even though it seems very improvised, as if it had been rustled out hurriedly just this morning, which actually isn’t far off the mark. In a part of the city where everything seems aged, it is just two years old. “Earlier my stall was in a different place,” says owner Abdul Majid, his face dappled with tranquillity. This morning it’s uncomfortably warm and the friendly man is cooking up another round of his chai, with a few customers sitting about him—one is perched on a scooter, some are staring meditatively towards the chipped kettle, and others are distracted by their mobile phones.What they all ought to do, really, is just look about themselves, and inhale the place’s intensely beautiful ambiance. Remains of a derelict mansion with a beautiful door overlook a lively crowd of locals—who are chattering, cursing and laughing with each other. A multitude of cats appear at regular intervals, almost instantly disappearing into the alley’s hidden corners and holes. Now a row of labourers go past the chai shop, carrying huge sacks of cement on their back.The stall is tucked atop the hill of Bulbuli Khana neighbourhood and in fact, a few steps ahead, the alley ends into the grave of Razia Sultan, the only woman ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. The shop’s most beautiful aspect is undoubtedly the blue colour of the wall, on which the aforementioned chhikas are hung. It’s a shade so ethereal, so fragile that you fear a man’s raised voice or too bright a daylight might erase it forever. A green tarpaulin hangs over the stall for shade. The establishment stands right under an old building, which, a passerby says, is about 200 years old.Despite its makeshift character and its young age, the tea stall appears to have taken roots firmly into the rhythms of this neighbourhood. One would imagine that chai has always been on the boil on this spot. But at night, not long after 9, the stall closes. All you then see is the bare table, with the street corner looking like as if Abdul Majid’s chai stall never existed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-razia-sultan-s-local-chai-stall-101614731687691.html
03-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots case: A hundred suspicions not proof, says court||“From a hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicion don’t make a proof”, a Delhi court quoted from Russian classic Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, while exonerating two persons from the charge of attempt to murder in a north-east Delhi riots case.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat questioned the police’s case as to how the offence of attempt to murder can be made out against accused Imran and Babu, when the victim himself is absent from the police investigation and has never been seen by the police.The duo was arrested for allegedly shooting and injuring a man named Rahul during the riots in Welcome area on February 25, 2020.“The gunshot injury is stated to be caused to Rahul but where is he? His statement is not on record... So by the time, police arrived at the hospital, the alleged victim Rahul had vanished. It is not as if Rahul gave any initial statement and then vanished. The state is categorical in saying that the police never saw Rahul. That being the case, who is going to say who shot whom and by whom and where? The alleged victim has never been seen by the police. He has never given any statement about any gunshot injury or about any mob/rioters. So how is Section 307 IPC made out against the accused persons when the victim is absent from even the police investigation? How is the gunshot injury established? There is no murmur of that,” the judge said.Rawat also said the charges under the Arms Act are also “superfluous” as no case was made out under those sections. “With the case of the prosecution as it is, Section 307 IPC (attempt to murder) is out of bounds. With nothing in the charge sheet to dig in, no case under Section 307 IPC is made out and there is no ground for presuming that these two accused persons have committed the offence of attempt to murder as defined under Section 307 IPC,” the judge said.The court said presumption cannot be stretched to take the shape of proof.“(Fyodor) Dostoevsky in ‘Crime and Punishment’ says “From a hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicion don’t make a proof”. Thus, both the accused persons are discharged of the offences under Section 307 IPC & Arms Act,” he said in the order passed on March 1.He further said the police have, after long investigation, concluded that Rahul had given a wrong address and a wrong mobile phone number in his medico legal case (MLC).It said there was only one police witness, constable Pushkar, but even he did not make any direct or even tangential reference to the firing by rioters or gunshot injury caused to alleged victim Rahul.Rawat, however, said there was grounds for presuming that both the accused persons have committed the offences of unlawful assembly and rioting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-case-a-hundred-suspicions-not-proof-says-court-101614731131856.html
03-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court takes cognisance of sedition charges against 18||A Delhi court on Tuesday took cognisance of the offences of sedition, promoting enmity between religious groups and criminal conspiracy against 18 persons accused of allegedly orchestrating the north-east Delhi riots, saying that the requisite sanction under criminal procedure code has been received from the authorities.Under section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the investigating agency has to take prior sanction from the state government to prosecute any individual for sedition.Earlier, the court took cognizance of offences registered under stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), rioting, murder, unlawful assembly, disappearance of evidences, detailed in two separate charge sheets. But the court did not take cognizance of sedition charges for lack of proper sanction.At least 53 persons were killed and 581 injured in the riots last year, which was allegedly triggered by a clash between supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and those opposing it. It later snowballed into a communal riot that raged between February 23 and 27.The special cell is probing the role of several prominent anti-CAA protesters in allegedly orchestrating the riots. The police have claimed that the riots were not spontaneous but planned by several persons, including student leaders.The arrested persons have denied the allegations and accused the police of launching a witch hunt against prominent anti-government faces.The main charge sheet was filed in September against Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha and student activist Gulfisha Fatima, former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider and Shifa-Ur-Rehman, suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi, Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohd Salim Khan and Athar Khan.In the first supplementary charge sheet, the police invoked same charges against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, and Faizan Khan.During the hearing, Umar Khalid told the court that no court had convicted him still one of the newspapers had carried photos of him along with other accused declaring them convicts for orchestrating the riots. He also said that media leaks are happening again and again and is putting the accused in a vulnerable position in the jail“No court has convicted me. Excerpts from the charge sheets have been published and it is happening again and again. It paints us at guilty and not accused and makes s us vulnerable in the jail,” Khalid said.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, while taking cognizance of the second supplementary charge sheet in the case, also cautioned the media to be careful and objective in its approach. “It is one thing to report generally about the charge-sheet but quite another to reproduce it as it is and thus, obviously, the question of leakage would arise. This is grossly unfair and unjustified and the court expects that it would not occur in future,” the court said.The court also rejected a plea by advocate Adit Pujari, Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, who demanded that a copy of the charge sheet should be supplied to him even before the cognizance is taken as it has already been leaked to the media.It also said that even though guidelines for reporting cannot be laid, but at least a disclaimer should be given whether it is the version of the police or the accused instead of portraying it as an order of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-takes-cognisance-of-sedition-charges-against-18-101614730909524.html

The Ladli Scheme, implemented by the Department of Women and Child Development in 2008, aims at promoting education among girls, reducing their drop-out rate, and providing financial security to families of girl child.The cabinet has also decided to release ₹75.98 crore under different scholarship schemes for the benefit of SC/ST/OBC students. These scholarship schemes include pre-matric and post-matric scholarships, and merit scholarships for SC/ST/OBC/minority students from Class 1 to 12.To ensure education is accessible and inclusive, the Delhi Cabinet has also approved ₹2 crore for children with special needs and children with disabilities.”Under the Talent Promotion Scheme, money will be given to the inclusive education branch of the directorate of education so that government schools can acquire equipment/aids and support services for developing the talent of children with special needs,” the government said.The directorate of education has also been given approval by the cabinet to procure 4,178 steel almirahs, at a cost of ₹7.2 crore, in order to improve their library infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-okays-rs-185-crore-for-child-welfare-scholarship-programme-101614730507369.html
03-03-2021||Delhi||Private hospitals account for 74% of vaccines given on Day 2 of drive||With the Covid-19 vaccination drive being extended to senior citizens and those aged over 45 years with comorbidities, inoculation centres in private hospitals across Delhi are seeing more rush than government facilities. Private hospitals charge up to ₹250 per shot while the vaccines are administered for free at government sites.Of the 11,655 such persons who received the jab on Tuesday, 74% went to centres in private hospitals, according to government data. The government hospitals immunised 3,063 such persons on Tuesday.Officials said this could also be because a majority of vaccination sites in the national capital are in private hospitals — of the 308 vaccination sites in Delhi, 136 are in private hospitals while only 56 are in government hospitals.“Many elderly people choose to go to private hospitals because they think they will get better services there. They worry that queues would be longer in government hospitals, but that is not the case. The whole point of online registrations is to ensure that there aren’t too many people at any given site,” said a senior district official, requesting anonymity.Many senior citizens were seen gathered outside the vaccination centres in private hospitals even after 5pm.At Max Hospital in Saket, a group of senior citizens was seen banging on the doors of the vaccination centre, insisting that they be inoculated even though the hospital had closed the drive for the day.“We came here around 3pm but were told that due to the rush, our turn won’t come before 5pm. Now when we have returned at 5pm, they have closed the doors,” said Anita Kapur, 65, who had come from Noida to get the shot.An official at the hospital said the rush was unprecedented over the past two days. As many as 490 persons were vaccinated at the hospital on Tuesday.“We could have covered over 600 persons had the Co-WIN app been working properly. We had to manually enter the data of persons throughout the day since the server was down,” the official said.At Jasola’s Apollo Hospitals, 280 persons were vaccinated on Tuesday. Among them was Vinod Chawala, 74, who said he chose a private hospital because of the hassle-free process. “I had registered on the app on Monday and got an appointment for Tuesday. Besides, the vaccine charges are affordable. Had it been too expensive in private hospitals, I would have chosen a government facility to avail of a free shot,” he said.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageSome senior citizens said the government needs to create more awareness about the vaccine availability in public hospitals. “A major reason why people are choosing private hospitals is because they are not confident about the safety of the vaccine available in government facilities. They don’t know if vaccines at both sites are equally safe. The government needs to create more awareness about this; otherwise, beneficiaries will continue to throng private hospitals,” said Abha Sardana, 70, who took her first vaccine shot at Apollo Hospitals.In comparison, there were around 40 people waiting to get the shot outside the five vaccination sites at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at 4.30pm. All of them were in the waiting area, maintaining proper social distancing in the spacious area arranged for recipients on the eighth floor of the new OPD building.“There was some rush around midday. Even then, it just takes about 1 hour – including the 30-minute waiting time – for a person to get done with. When there is no rush, it takes barely 40 minutes. With the new OPD block, we are able to ensure that social distancing is maintained even during peak hours,” said a nursing orderly on duty at one of the sites, who did not want to be named.Around 100 elderly and comorbid persons were immunised at the five sites on Tuesday.Across the road, at Safdarjung Hospital, too, the vaccination site seemed relatively empty.

03-03-2021||Chandigarh||Covid cases in Chandigarh jumped by 85% in last week of February||Recording a whopping 85% jump between the third and fourth week of February, Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh continue to show an upward trend.With the surge, the percentage of active cases in the last two weeks also reached 2%, which had dropped to 0.8% in early February.Though the level of testing has increased, it is disproportionate with the number of fresh cases, leading to doubling of the positivity rate.At a time when UT had reported around 130 cases, the testing levels were above 8,000. But now, when the number of cases has almost tripled, the testing numbers remain around 11,000 only.Despite the fact that the vaccination drive has opened up for civilians and the online registration system is starting to get a good response, the cases continue to surge.‘Best time to get jab’A senior official of the UT health department, not wishing to be named, said, “The vaccine has arrived at a time when the positivity rate is increasing and the infection spread is also widening. This is the best time to get the jab and we should inoculate as many people as possible.”The surge in cases, if continues, is also worrying as the majority of health workers in Chandigarh have not been inoculated. The coverage of persons who have received at least one shot of the vaccine remains below 50%.“The vaccine can generate protection in six weeks after both doses have been taken. So, if the cases continue to grow at this speed, we may see more infection cases in the coming months. It is worrisome because a lot of health workers have not been inoculated,” another official, wishing anonymity, said.Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department, said that the number of cases was largely increasing due to increased mobility and people not adhering to safety precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-cases-in-chandigarh-jumped-by-85-in-last-week-of-february-101614720570355.html
03-03-2021||Chandigarh||External developmental charges in Panchkula slashed||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday announced a one-third reduction in external development charges (EDC), licence fee for real estate developers, conversion charges and state infrastructure development charges (SIDC) for Panchkula district to ensure that the rates were at par with Mohali and Zirakpur.Addressing media persons here, Khattar said that the reduction was aimed at wooing real estate developers to invest in Panchkula district.“We can shape Panchkula the same way as Gurugram,” Khattar said.The EDC is levied on external development works like water supply, sewerage, drains, provisions of treatment and disposal of sewage, sullage and storm water, roads, electrical works, solid waste management and disposal, slaughterhouses, colleges, hospitals, stadium/sports complex, fire stations, grid sub-stations in a colony or area.The SIDC on the other hand is imposed in case of major highways, metro rail, big canals and such major infrastructure projects involving more than one urban estate.Khattar said the decision to bring down these charges at par with Mohali and Zirakpur had been taken to develop Panchkula as a smart city, a tourist destination and an education hub.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/external-developmental-charges-in-panchkula-slashed-101614719909703.html
03-03-2021||Chandigarh||Journalist, realtor arrested for torturing man to usurp his Chandigarh house||Probing into the gruesome kidnapping and torture of a 48-year-old man, the only surviving heir of his family, the police on Tuesday arrested a journalist and a property dealer, who usurped his Sector-37 house and sold it illegally for ₹2.9 crore in March 2019.The journalist, Sanjeev Mahajan, who has been terminated by the leading Hindi newspaper that he worked for, and realtor Manish Gupta, pulled all stops with the help of the brother of a Chandigarh DSP, a bouncer, a liquor contractor and multiple property dealers to grab the 338 square yards house and sell it to Gupta’s brother Saurabh Gupta, said investigators.The ordeal of the victim, Rahul Mehta, started in April 2017 when he was illegally confined in his house, and forcibly made to transfer the general power of attorney (GPA) to the main accused’s accomplices, and later abandoned at a stud farm in Gujarat.Over the past years, he was shifted to various ashrams and is now being taken care of at a similar institution in Delhi.The legal action in the matter came now following an anonymous complaint at one of the single window enquiries managed by the Chandigarh Police.Among the multiple accused named in the FIR are Sanjeev; Manish; Saurabh; businessman Khalendra Singh Kadyan and liquor contractor Arvind Singla, to whom the GPA was transferred; Satpal Dagar, the brother of UT DSP Ram Gopal, and slain bouncer Surjit Singh. “A special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted, comprising ASP Shruti Arora, Sector 31 SHO police station Narinder Patial and Burail police post in-charge sub-inspector Om Prakash, to probe the case. No one will be spared,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh.“Names of other police officials have also cropped up and their role is being investigated,” he added.Victim tortured to transfer GPAAs per the preliminary inquiry, conducted by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Devinder Kumar Sharma, Rahul was the sole heir of House Number 340 in Sector 37-A, since his parents and brother had died.Facing multiple health issues, Rahul was living alone in the house, when Sanjeev and Manish conspired to grab the property.“They confined him in a room of the house and tortured him for over a month. They got the GPA of the house transferred to Arvind and Khalinder, which authorised them to transfer the ownership of the property,” said assistant superintendent of police (ASP, South), Shruti Arora. Abandoned at stud farm in Gujarat Police investigations found out that between June-July 2017, Surjit dropped off Rahul at a stud farm, owned by one Abdul Karim, in Bhuj, Gujarat.According to Abdul, Surjit, who was shot dead in March 2020, had told him that Rahul was homeless and needed a place to stay. When Surjit did not return for a long time, Abdul sent Rahul to Manavjoth Ram Dev Seva Ashram in Bhuj.In March 2018, Rahul was taken to Kajrat Foundation in Maharashtra and from there, further to Apna Ghar Ashram in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, and its branch in New Delhi, where he is now lodged.Police said while Rahul was at Bharatpur, the accused sold the house to Saurabh in March 2019. “They executed a sale deed in favour of Saurabh by presenting a proxy of Rahul before the sub-registrar, Estate Office, Chandigarh,” the ASP added.All accused are facing charges under Sections 452 (house-trespass), 331 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to extort confession, or to compel restoration of property), 365 (kidnapping), 386 (extortion), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 477 (fraudulent cancellation, destruction, etc., of will, authori¬ty to adopt, or valuable security) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.

03-03-2021||Chandigarh||Debate on guv’s address: Cong, SAD MLAs spar over farm laws||Chandigarh The legislators of the ruling Congress and the opposition — Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) — sparred over three central farm laws, during the debate on governor’s address on the second day of the budget session on Tuesday. They accused one another of doing little to help the farmers and playing into the hands of the Centre for personal interests. Congress legislator Kuljit Nagra said the farmer agitation has come under international gaze only because of the Amarinder-led Punjab government prepared the ground for the agitation. “When the farmers wanted to block rail tracks, the state government did not pressure them not to do so. When they took over toll-plazas, no action was taken because our government knew that these laws will prove death warrants for the farmers,” said Nagra. On SAD, the Congress MLA said Akalis did exactly the opposite as when the Centre promulgated the ordinances, the then Union minister, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, could not red-flag the BJP. “To date, the SAD couldn’t show anything to prove behanji’s (Harsimrat) dissent to the ordinances in the Union cabinet meeting. They all joined the agitation after entire Punjab rallied behind the farmers,” said Nagra, amid shouting by the Akali MLAs. The SAD leader in the House, Sharanjeet Singh Dhillon, objected to Nagra’s accusation against the party. “The reality was that our alliance partner BJP ended up being dishonest. When the laws were being framed, they kept on telling us that when these laws will be passed in Parliament, they will do whatever amendments are required. But they did not and ditched us,” said Dhillon, whose statement earned strong reactions from the Congress benches. Hayer targets Congress AAP legislator Meet Hayer, took point of order from the deputy speaker, and said the Congress should also reply on the accusation by the Centre that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh was the member of the high-powered group that had backed the need for these farm laws. “SAD, BJP are equally responsible for the laws. But the Congress should also reply if Amarinder was not part of the meeting. Why your MPs did not storm the well of the House the day Union minister of state for agriculture had made a statement in the Parliament?” said Hayer. Nagra hit back by saying that the Centre has already disclosed proceedings of meetings of group of chief ministers and it’s before the public now. “Amarinder was never part of such meetings and the media has already reported it. The AAP member should read newspapers properly before initiating a debate,” Nagra said. Congress MLA Kushaldeep Dhillon accused the SAD of ruining the image of five-time chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, who had fought for farmer throughout his life. “Everybody knows that the SAD backed these laws for six months. In fact, the SAD leaders got so desperate to save the Union ministry of biba ji (Harsimrat) that they even pressured Parkash Singh Badal to upload a video in support of the laws,” said Dhillon. Majithia, Gill in verbal duelFormer minister and senior Speaker Rana Kanwarpal Singh leader Bikram Singh Majithia and Congress MLA from Patti Harminder Singh Gill entered into a verbal spat in the House when the latter alleged that former’s great-grandfather Sunder Singh Majthia had supported Mahant Narain Das during the Nankana Sahib massacre in 1921. Hitting back, Majithia alleged Gill had links with police officer Ajit Singh Sandhu, known for killing innocent Sikh youths in police encounters during militancy. Majitha also addressed Gill with some other remarks which were expunged by the speaker. Speaker Rana Kanwar Pal Singh has to repeatedly intervene to calm down both the members with requests to not get personal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/debate-on-guv-s-address-cong-sad-mlas-spar-over-farm-laws-101614716492654.html

He said if suspension is not revoked, the opposition will not allow the House to function. Sukhu said parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj and deputy speaker had pushed the opposition members, which led to provocation. “We are being held responsible without any fault of ours,” he said while asking to play the video clippings of the incident in Vidhan Sabha . He asked the speaker to give his ruling. Sukhu said the ruling party should have taken the opposition into confidence that the governor will cut short his address due to his poor health. Urban development and law minister Suresh Bhardwaj said it was the discretion of the governor whether to read the full address or not. He said the entire episode of the opening day and opposition’s protest has been recorded in CCTVs. He said opposition members attacked the governor’s ADC and further stopped him from coming out of his car. Saying that suspension of MLAs wasn’t something new, Bhardwaj said, “Many things are resolved through dialogue. The Congress should not twist the facts.”Senior Congress leader and Dalhousie MLA Asha Kumari drew the attention of the House towards how the Vidhan Sabha secretariat ‘broke the tradition’ and opposition members were not invited for tea with governor. The Speaker allowed deputy speaker Hansraj to speak in the house as he wanted to clarify his position on the incident, however the opposition did not allow him to speak, saying that he himself was guilty of manhandling. This led to sloganeering and counter sloganeering. Congress legislator Vikramaditya Singh walked towards the well and had sharp exchanges with deputy speaker, which flared up tempers of the ruling legislators. The opposition walked out and later returned to the House. CM Jai Ram Thakur, while rebutting the allegations of the opposition, said no one is above the law. He said the entire cabinet and the BJP MLAs had gone to Raj Bhavan to apologise to the governor. The entire episode was utterly shameful, but the opposition is not ashamed, he added. Calling the ‘manhandling’ unbearable and unpardonable, Jai Ram added that there could not be any other incident more embarrassing than this in the history of Himachal. He said the deputy speaker was being singled out inside and outside the House repeatedly. “He can’t be denied to speak. If he wants to say anything, it’s his right,” the CM said, while terming the objectionable remarks made against the deputy speaker unfortunate and intolerable. Later, amid the opposition din, Speaker Vipin Parmar announced the commencement of the question hour. Question Hour: ‘Defaulters owe ₹434 crore to power board’Defaulters owe a sum of ₹ 424.34 crore to the Himachal Pradesh electricity board as on January 31, 2021, said power minister Sukh Ram Chaudhary while responding to a question tabled in the House. In a written reply to the question raised by Dalhousie MLA, Chaudhary said ₹ 365.56 crore is due from the current consumers and ₹ 58.78 crore from the permanently disconnected consumers. Among the defaulters are 180 hoteliers, it was informed. Jai Ram presents ₹9,125-cr supplementary demandsJai Ram Thakur on Tuesday presented the supplementary demands for grant worth ₹9,125.12 crore in the House for the year 2020-21.Out of the total demands, ₹8,448 crore is under non-plan schemes, ₹280.84 crore under plan schemes and ₹ 396.11 crore under the centrally sponsored schemes.Jai Ram said under the non-plan expenditure, ₹7,999.57 crore has been provided for ways and means advance.“Relief was provided to every section of the society and now, the state is coming out of economic recession,” he added.He said major chunk of the grant under the plan schemes will go to health and family welfare department, World Bank-aided horticulture development project and to provide additional subsidy.Under centrally sponsored schemes, he said, supplementary demand is proposed for funding ongoing or new schemes.Prominent among these are Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana, smart city mission, loan to credit co-operatives, social security pension, and World Bank-assisted project for skill strengthening for industrial programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/barbs-fly-in-hp-house-over-suspension-of-5-cong-mlas-101614715769461.html
03-03-2021||Other||Create extra seat for MBBS aspirant: HC to Dadra and Nagar Haveli administration||Observing that the Covid-19 pandemic had claimed a lot of doctors and the doctors’ pool needed to be replenished fast, the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Dadra and Nagar Haveli administration to create an additional seat for a meritorious student who did not get an admission to MBBS course. The petitioner, who had scored 96 percentile (559 marks) in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) approached HC after finding that another student, having scored as low as 219 marks in NEET, had got admission, while she was refused a seat because of lack of clear guidelines in the admission brochure about unfilled seats that were reverted through all-India quota (AIQ) to state quota. The student had claimed that rather than merit, the Union territory (UT) had given admissions during the mop-up round as per priority list based on domicile, which was unfair to her. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petition filed by Silvassa resident Annu Sinsinwar, was informed by senior advocate Anil Anturkar that though the student had secured a high percentile, she was refused admission to the only medical college started in Silvassa in 2019. Anturkar submitted that though Sinsinwar was domiciled in UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and had completed her secondary education in Silvassa, she had pursued her higher secondary education (Class 11 and Class 12) in Rajasthan. He submitted that as a result of this, the student had been deemed ineligible for admission to MBBS course based on the first three priorities stipulated in the admission brochure for academic year 2020-21. It was also submitted that after the completion of the regular admission process, which included admission under AIQ, four seats had been reverted as they remained unfilled. As Sinsinwar had failed to get admission in AIQ through the reserved quota, she sought admission based on merit to the four reverted seats. However, as there was no prescribed mode to dispose of reverted seats in the admission brochure, UT had included the four seats in its quota and allotted it based on the three priorities. Anturkar argued that while it was expected that as per clause 5 (5) of Regulations on Graduate Medical Education, 1997, of the Medical Council of India the UT should have filled up the four seats solely on merit, but as they did not do so, the efforts of the student would be wasted. and hence the court should direct UT administration to accommodate her. Advocate Sunny Punamiya, for the four students who were allotted the reverted seats, submitted that they were not at fault and cancelling their admission would result in hardships, and hence the court should consider their interest too while passing orders. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “We may observe that the case in hand stands peculiarly and in such situation, interest of justice would imminently require that the petitioner be accommodated without disturbing the admissions of respondents. The court, in such a situation, would also take into consideration such equitable circumstances so as not to disturb the educational interest of the students.” In light of these observations, HC directed the authorities to admit Sinsinwar forthwith, by creating an additional seat in the first year of MBBS course, while keeping intact the admission of the fourth student. In a separate addendum to the judgment, the chief justice observed, “It is rather painful when a candidate scoring as low as 219 marks in NEET obtains an admission in MBBS course because of a quota for the Coast Guards – with which I have no qualm – whereas a candidate like the petitioner, scoring as high as 559 marks in the same qualifying examination, is left high and dry and suffers for no fault on her part compelling her to seek judicial intervention.” While observing that there was no explanation from the authorities as to why the admission brochure did not have guidelines for allotment of reverted seats, he noted, “The admission process suffers from a serious taint and if such tainted admission process is saved, the rule of merit would be compromised which, in turn, would frustrate the labour of meritorious students like the petitioner, apart from develop in them of a sense of aversion to the concept of qualifying examinations.” He concluded that as Covid-19 had taken away from the society a number of reputed doctors, the pool of doctors had to be replenished fast. “If meritorious students desirous of becoming doctors are not encouraged in such challenging times, it would amount to a grave disservice to the society,” said justice Datta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/create-extra-seat-for-mbbs-aspirant-hc-to-dadra-and-nagar-haveli-administration-101614715710365.html

Led by JKPCC general secretary Shahnawaz Choudhary, party workers earlier in the day burnt Azad’s effigy and staged a protest against him outside the Jammu Press Club, while those from the Youth Congress and the NSUI sought his removal from the party.Choudhary accused Azad of weakening the Congress and acting at the behest of PM Narendra Modi.“While the Congress held him in high esteem, made him a member of the Rajya Sabha and chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, he heaped praise on the PM and forged friendship with the BJP,” he said.He regretted that Azad didn’t come to J&K for the district development council election campaigning, but was here for G-23 summit and praised PM Modi.However, few hours later, general secretary of the Jammu District Congress Committee (Urban) Kohli and JKPCC executive committee member Chopra staged another protest against Choudhary. “Shahnawaz Choudhary is the same person, who fought against party candidate Akram Choudhary as an independent candidate in the DDC polls and won. How could he be a member of the party?” asked Chopra. Kohli said, “This man has tried to malign the image of a leader like Azad, whose name is synonymous with the Congress in Jammu and Kashmir and in the country. We can never tolerate this insult of Azad sahib.” “Youth Congress leaders like Aijaz Choudhary and Jitender Singh Chib, along with Shahnawaz Choudhary, should be immediately shown the door. They are playing into the hands of the BJP and the RSS. They are trying to split the Congress,” Chopra claimed. JKPCC president Ghulam Ahmad Mir, meanwhile, said, “The Congress is a very big party and every individual analyses things as per his/her understanding. He is certainly general secretary of the JKPCC, but in democracy everyone has the right to express opinion or resentment.”It’s pertinent to mention here that a local English daily has quoted Mir as saying in Delhi that “what happened on February 27 (G-23 summit in Jammu) shouldn’t have happened. There was still some hope that Azad Sahib was speaking for J&K’s people, but he quashed all hopes on February 28 by praising the PM. I’m here for a routine meeting and haven’t spoken to the party high command about Azad sahib yet”. On Sunday, Azad had asked the audience to learn from PM Modi about how one remains grounded to his roots. Azad’s comments had come a day after G-23 leaders held a well-attended public rally here. On February 9, the PM had given an emotional farewell speech to Azad when the latter had retired from the Rajya Sabha. “I (will) not let you retire, I will continue taking your advice. My doors are always open for you,” Modi had said. Addressing a function of Gujjar community here on Sunday, Azad had said, “Our PM also says that he is from village and was nothing (non-entity) and that he washed utensils and sold tea. Politically, we may have serious differences and are opposed to him but he didn’t hide his true self. And, those who hide their true selves, they live in a bubble… in an imaginary world. People should be proud of their roots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rift-in-j-k-cong-group-protests-against-azad-another-supports-him-101614715709295.html
03-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana to reserve 75% jobs in private sector for locals||After sitting on it for close to four months, Haryana governor Satydeo Narain Arya on Tuesday gave assent to the bill providing 75% reservation in private sector to state job seekers who have a domicile certificate. The quota will apply for 10 years. The assembly had late last year passed the bill, a key poll promise made by the ruling alliance partner Jannayak Janta Party. “The governor today gave his assent to the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, providing quota for local people in private sector jobs that offer a salary of less than ₹50,000 a month,” chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar told reporters here. A near-similar ordinance approved by the cabinet in July last was reserved by the governor for the consideration of the President. Though the ordinance was withdrawn by the cabinet in October last, the Union labour and employment ministry which examined the ordinance had advised the state government against enacting such a law. The state government though did no heed to the advice. Legal experts said the new law was in contravention of the Constitution and will not withstand judicial scrutiny. While tabling the bill in the assembly, the government modified its section 23, a provision which gave it an overriding effect over any other law, a broad provision having the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. Section 23 in the bill was modified to provide overriding effect on any other state law. However, issues raised by the law and legislative secretary during the vetting of the proposed law still holds good, experts said. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana, experts said, was in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The private sector job quota move was piloted by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s JJP. The controversial piece of legislation did not find much support from the BJP quarters initially. In fact, CM Khattar had once sounded non-committal on the prospect of enacting such a law. Sources said since the BJP government at the Centre has a very different view on the matter, it was surprising how the governor assented to the bill. As per the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, giving preference to local candidates in low-paid jobs is socially, economically and environmentally desirable and any such preference would be in the interests of the general public. “The bill will provide tremendous benefits to the private employers directly or indirectly through qualified and trained local work force. Availability of suitable workforce locally would enhance the efficiency of Industry as the workforce is one of the major components for the development of any industrial organisation,’’ it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-reserve-75-jobs-in-private-sector-for-locals-101614715649472.html

Of these, 12,299 were citizens above 60 years, while 3,812 were in the age group of 45-60 with comorbidities. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director of medical education and research (DMER), said the number of vaccination centres and beneficiaries will increase in the coming days. “We are seeing a good response from the citizens. In the coming days, we will open additional centres, as well as increase the number of beneficiaries,” said Dr Lahane. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that there was lot of enthusiasm among the citizens to get themselves vaccinated. “Seeing the enthusiasm, we will open additional centres. I would like to appeal to the people that instead of walking- in, it would be better if they register online so that they can save time. In the coming days, online registration would be given preference,” said Kakani. Many of the vaccination centres witnessed serpentine queues of senior citizens, resulting in chaos. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) was able to control the situation but many complained of the lack of proper planning in executing the vaccination drive. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said the vaccination drive was a total chaos. “The three authorities — Centre, the state government and BMC — have failed to adequately plan and flawlessly execute something as important as vaccination in the middle of the pandemic. The entire process is a big mess, and technology, which was supposed to make life easier, is in fact making it difficult,” said AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon. Till now, 1,266,108 beneficiaries have been administered vaccines in the state. Of these, 6,507 healthcare workers have received the second dose. On Tuesday, the state recorded 7,863 cases against 6,397 infections recorded on Monday. The tally now stands at 2,169,330. Authorities said the surge in cases is owing to the rise in tests. On Tuesday, 75,521 tests were conducted, against the 61,746 tests a day before. The total number of active cases in the state stood at 79,093, with Pune leading the list with 15,872 cases, followed by Nagpur (9,926) and Thane (8,366). After Mumbai recorded 849 new cases, its tally of active cases tal surged to 8,217. Amravati, which is under lockdown, saw a marginal dip of active cases to 6,491 from Monday’s 6,497. “We are witnessing a dip in cases in the rural parts of the state and this is indicative in the figures of Monday and Tuesday,” said Dr Lahane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-vaccination-drive-turnout-improving-in-maharashtra-101614715049279.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||Centre nod for 29 more private hospitals from Mumbai to start vaccination||To speed up the third phase of the nation-wide mass immunization programme, the centre on Tuesday approved 29 private hospitals to inoculate senior citizens above 60 years and those above 45 years with co-morbidities. This list includes three private hospitals which the civic body had already selected on Sunday to start the vaccination programme on March 1. Among the 26 new names are most major hospitals—Hinduja, Lilavati, Jaslok, Kokilaben, Bombay, SL Raheja, Global, Nanavati, Saifee hospital.On Friday, the central government issued guidelines for the third phase of the mass immunization programme. As per the rules, only private hospitals empaneled under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) and Central Government Health Schemes (CGHS) were allowed to conduct their third phase in their premises. This disqualified all major private hospitals that come under the umbrella of charitable hospitals for the vaccination. Following which, Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, public health department, Maharashtra, requested the central government to allow private hospitals with more than 200 beds and multispeciality facilities with the infrastructure for vaccination. In response to this, the union health ministry changed the earlier guidelines and approved 29 such private hospitals who aren’t empanelled under the government health schemes. This includes the already three selected hospitals—Doshi Hindu Sabha, KJ Somaiya and SRCC Children’s Hospital who have been conducting the vaccination from March 1. “It is a victorious day for us. Private hospitals are an essential part of the medical healthcare structure. All major hospitals have over 2,000 healthcare staff who can help expedite the process. During the peak of the pandemic, private hospitals played a major role in providing treatment to infected patients. I am happy that the government finally considered that,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, in-charge of Covid beds in private hospitals. Just like the present rules, probable beneficiaries will be able to pre-register on the Co-WIN app for an appointment-based vaccination or directly walk-in for vaccination.“This will give a huge boost to mass immunization. As soon as the state government releases the government resolution, we will start the process,” said Dr V Ravishankar, chief operating officer, Lilavati Hospital, Bandra.At present, these will be given a daily target of 100 vaccination. But doctors say that to expedite the vaccination, they need to increase the target to 300. “It is a welcome move. With this gradually, they have to boost up their daily vaccination to around 300. The faster we can vaccinate people, the faster we can develop herd immunity, breaking the chain of infection,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-nod-for-29-more-private-hospitals-from-mumbai-to-start-vaccination-101614714688644.html
03-03-2021||Other||45-year-old dies minutes after receiving second Covid-19 shot in Maharashtra||A 45-year-old private healthcare worker died after receiving the second dose of Covid-19 vaccination on Tuesday at Bhiwandi. Sukhdev Kirdat, who worked as a private doctor’s driver fell unconscious 20 minutes after he was administered the dose at Bhagyanagar vaccination centre. He was rushed to Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital but was declared dead. The incident caused panic among the other beneficiaries who were waiting for their turn at the centre. The officials of Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) claimed that the cause of death can be ascertained only after the post-mortem report is acquired. BNCMC medical health officer KR Kharat said,” The beneficiary came at the centre for the second dose and was fine before the vaccine. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, he fell unconscious while waiting at the observation room. His body has been sent to JJ hospital for post mortem. Experts will be studying the case and then submitting a report on what caused the death. Our staff had checked all his past records and his current health status. When he took the first dose, he was completely fine.” Following the incident, senior health officials from Thane also visited the centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/45yearold-dies-minutes-after-receiving-second-covid-19-shot-in-maharashtra-101614714629198.html
03-03-2021||Other||Mumbai colleges forced to go back to online mode as Covid-19 cases surge||Weeks after colleges began taking small steps towards the gradual reopening of their campuses, the rising Covid-19 cases in Mumbai has again postponed their plans of physical classes. A handful of institutes who had recently started physical practical sessions or scheduled a combination of online and offline preliminary exams for their final-year batches have now called-off all physical sessions and are continuing lectures only online. Despite no clear directions from the government, some colleges had chosen to restart practical sessions for their final-year students. “Our students were worried about not understanding important practical concepts online. So with the consent of their parents, we had started allowing 15-20 students to our laboratories each day for practical sessions,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal KC College, Churchgate. She said that the college for now has planned practical classes in a way that students have to sit through four-five back-to-back lectures so they do not need to come back to the campus for a physical class anytime soon. However, the originally scheduled preliminary exams for their final-year students, starting on Wednesday, will now only be held in the online mode, added Bagla. A college in the suburbs had informed its students to start attending physical classes in batches of not more than 20-25, but the move has now been put on hold. “We had also received consent forms of parents, but the current situation does not permit us to take any chances with the health or safety of our staff and students. For the time being, we are holding back our plans for physical reopening of colleges and will instead continue online classes itself,” said the principal of the college. In the first week of February, state education minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant had announced that colleges can reopen with not more than 50% attendance on campus at any given point of time. The University of Mumbai (MU) then issued a circular, asking colleges to approach the local civic authority or the collector’s office before restarting physical classes in a phased manner. The circular also shared the Covid-19 safety guidelines prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to ensure the safety of staff and students. On February 12, however, after a meeting between officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and MU, the civic officials directed the varsity to postpone the reopening of colleges by a week until February 22. Since then, owing to rising Covid-19 cases in the city and state, the education minister or the local civic authorities have not given any clear directions to colleges or the university about the status of reopening of colleges, forcing more colleges to start preparing for the next exam session only in online mode. “Last time [winter 2020 exam session], we had very little time to prepare, and colleges were asked to put together question papers in multiple choice questions (MCQs) format. But this time, we will try to incorporate more descriptive type questions along with MCQs in the papers. Whatever the decision of the university or the state education department, colleges are preparing for exams already,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-colleges-forced-to-go-back-to-online-mode-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101614714329637.html
03-03-2021||Other||5 political decisions that helped Mumbai cope with Covid-19||The city reported its first two infections the same day that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic. On March 11, 2020, Maharashtra had detected 68 patients of the coronavirus disease. A year on, more than 2.16 million people have been infected in the state, and of those, 327,619 are in Mumbai. The state authorities soon realised that Mumbai needed special measures to control the spread of the disease. Even today, the seven-day average of cases is at the worst since the end of November, though it still remains significantly below the peak of the first wave. As we stand at this juncture, a look at how we got here.Stopping the trainsFor 84 days, starting March 23, 2020 — two days before the national lockdown began —the city came to a standstill. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that local suburban train network would stop from March 22 midnight as part of the restrictions on movement due to the coronavirus pandemic. The following day, the Centre announced that local train services will be stopped in Mumbai. This was unprecedented, if anything; even after the July 11, 2006 train bombings which claimed 209 lives, local services resumed within hours.It was only in July 2020 that trains — almost half the pre-lockdown numbers — began to ply; only essential services workers were allowed to travel by them. Railway stations also maintained a single entry and exit point, and the Railway Protection Force and Government Railway Police personnel kept a check on who arrived.“I think it was the right decision, given how crowded local trains in Mumbai get, and how low the uptake of masks was then. There was also no background immunity and continuing the operation of trains would have the potential of being a super-spreader mechanism,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, a Mumbai-based epidemiologist, who is a consultant pulmonologist at PD Hinduja National Hospital. Much of the rise in case numbers now is being attributed to the resumption of train services for the general public since February 1. Yet this call showed was that it was possible to implement what could have well been the toughest decision for Mumbai.As the locals and outstations trains were suspended, the migrant population in the city started taking road transport. Most migrants also attempted to go to their home states and town on foot. By March end, Maharashtra government directed district authorities to stop the migrants, shift them to temporary shelters, and provide food and medical assistance.Decentralising powerSeveral municipal officials, irrespective of rank, realised that swift decision-making was vital to curb the spread of the disease. But, in a city of over 20 million people, how was this to be achieved? To that end, the BMC set up its first control room in June. Such control rooms, or war rooms, were opened in all the 24 wards of the city. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who is in charge of the civic health department, said that this decentralisation of power was key in helping the administration fight Covid-19.“Financial and administration powers were delegated to ward offices, various [hospital] deans and facility operators for the procurement of material, creation of infrastructure, etc. We provided 15 ambulances in each ward at their disposal, we gave a dedicated medical team for immediate medical intervention,” Kakani pointed out.Each war room had a team of 10-12 civic employees and doctors who would work in shifts to help people get ambulances, offer details on hospital bed availability and help people with the next course of action in case they tested positive. “A typical day in a ward room started with receiving the Covid test results at 7.30 am. Doctors on the team would inform the patient and tell them if they needed to be treated in a hospital or if they could opt for home isolation provided certain conditions were fulfilled,” a BMC official said. “The Mumbai strategy that worked was decentralisation of power. Each ward became a mini-Mumbai and each ward officer became like a local municipal commissioner. Strategies were common and overall response improved. Whether it was public hospital or private, protocols were clear—oxygen, supportive care, and steroid, along with aggressive comorbidity care. That was the game changer for Mumbai,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, endocrinologist and member, Maharashtra’s Covid Task Force.Bringing the experts inThe Maharashtra government constituted a nine-member panel of experts in April to advise them on how to handle the epidemic. This meant that administrative officers received continuous scientific inputs to enable them to make decisions while dealing with the crisis. The team, led by Dr Sanjay Oak, who was the dean of civic-run King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, was asked to suggest ways to reduce the death toll, recommend a drug protocol in treating critically-ill Covid-19 patients, establish a management protocol for serious and critically-ill Covid-19 patients, and suggest the healthcare support needed in Covid-dedicated hospitals, among other things. Besides the Covid task force, the state government also formed similar teams in 34 districts of the state.Former Additional Chief Secretary of Maharashtra Chandra Iyengar, who also handled the health department during her service in 2009, lauded the government’s move on setting up such a group and giving them a free hand to chalk out the road ahead. “The priority that was laid down and the approach was good [to set up a treatment protocol]. Given the largeness of the problem, there was no confusion. They have been clear in the approach. The government respected the task force that it set up and almost gave this group of experts full freedom to work... The direction has been correct. Even today, there are cases but the death rate is in check. What is critical that lives should not be lost. Because there was clarity right down the line, with no two people giving two differing ideas that helped [the city],” Iyengar said.Easing strain on hospitalsMumbai faced a severe shortage of beds in the initial months of the pandemic, and as the caseload began to increase, patients began to be turned away from hospitals and many couldn’t receive adequate care on time. In the second week of April, the BMC came out with a standard operating procedure for treatment.It opened Covid Care Centres (CCC-1 and 2) — the first for high-risk contacts of positive persons and the second for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients — in makeshift facilities; Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) for symptomatic patients, moderately-ill patients and some patients with co-morbidities; and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) for patients showing prolonged symptoms of fever, cough, and breathlessness, senior citizens, as well as severely ill and critical patients who needed ICUs. In April, the National Sports Club of India’s (NSCI) stadium dome in Worli was made into a 500-bed isolation facility and later upgraded to Mumbai’s first jumbo Covid facility. In all, the BMC created seven such jumbo facilities across the city, including Mulund, BKC and Goregaon. In July, when Mumbai hit its peak, it had a total of 16,859 beds all dedicated Covid hospitals, and by October, the city had nearly 70,000 beds across all CCC1 and 2 facilities, which also included seven jumbo Covid centres that could cumulatively handle 5,000 patients.“Initially beds [jumbo centres] were only for patients who tested positive. Then gradually beds were available for walk-ins, or for someone who was a suspected case. We ensured that all critical facilities were available such as ICU units, ventilators, and oxygen. Initially oxygen supply was cylinder-based. We turned to a pipeline system by connecting it to a turbo cylinder with capacity of 13,000 litres. It provided a major support as most patients did not require ventilators, and oxygen supply beds did the work. This helped us reduce the mortality rate,” said Kakani.Test, test, testThe one parameter that Mumbai has consistently scored the best on, compared to other Indian cities, has been testing: With a testing rate of 19,015 samples tested a day on average for the week ending February 25, 2020, it is the highest the city has ever done. In March last year, Maharashtra had only two reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing facilities: the National Institute of Virology, Pune and Kasturba Hospital, Byculla. Soon, the civic body added testing facilities at other civic and state-run hospitals.By mid-April, 10 private laboratories and diagnostic centres were added to the list of testing centres. “Our testing capacity was scaled up every few months. Today we have a capacity to test about 25,000 samples in a day, including RT-PCR and antigen test,” said Dr Daksha Shah, health officer, BMC. According to Kakani, Mumbai was the first to liberalise testing in the country. Initially, only people who have a prescription from a doctor could get tested for coronavirus, which changed after July 7. “We liberalised testing against the guidelines of ICMR as we wanted more people to get tested. From July 7, self-declaration by people was more than sufficient to get tested,” he said. Currently, there are 37 private laboratories and hospitals that are authorised to carry out RT-PCR and antigen tests. According to a civic health department official, the private laboratories alone boost Mumbai’s daily testing capacity by 90%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-political-decisions-that-helped-mumbai-cope-with-covid19-101614714030807.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||MMRDA seeks Bombay HC’s nod to start Metro work at disputed plot||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Tuesday approached the Bombay high court (HC) through an interim application, seeking lifting of the court’s stay on the October 1, 2020 order by the Mumbai suburban district collector, which permitted the transfer of 102 acres at Kanjurmarg to the authority for building a car shed and an interchange station for Metro lines 3, 4, 4A and 6.The Centre and the Maharashtra government have been locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car depot, which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony. Last year, the Centre had filed a petition in the HC, challenging the collector’s order and said the land belongs to its salt departmentOn December 16,2020, acting on three separate petitions, a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni stayed the October 1, 2020 order. The bench had also restrained MMRDA from carrying any further work on the site. MMRDA’s contractor, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited, was testing soil at the site at the relevant time.Now, in its application, MMRDA has stated that as the public project is of importance and the work has already commenced, it was ready to give an undertaking that it would extend all benefits and compensation to which the owner and/or lessee would be entitled on acquisition of the said land under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act. The application is expected to be heard next week. The interim application, while seeking lifting of the HC stay, said the state government had conducted a viability and sustainability assessment of the land at Kanjurmarg and found it suitable for the construction of the Metro car shed and interchange station. The application further stated that if the project was not allowed, three Metro lines, namely the Lokhandwala-Vikhroli, Kasarwadavali-Wadala and Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ could not be commissioned and made available for public use. The application added that while the car shed at Kanjurmarg was aimed at saving environmental damage, which could be caused if the shed was constructed at Aarey, it would also optimise the operation of the Metro lines due to its unique geographical and locational advantage. While stressing on the possible loss to the public exchequer due to the delay if the development activities were not permitted, the application stated that disruption of development of the car shed, which also includes a casting yard would cost Rs2.5crore-3 crore a day. “The Metro car depot, which also includes a casting yard, is indispensable as regards to the functioning of any metro line. If such car shed is not allowed to be developed forthwith, metro lines 6, 4 and 3 cannot be made functional. Resultantly, a major portion of the metro project will be disrupted, leading to failure of the entire scheme of Mumbai Metro Rail project as envisaged for the city of Mumbai.” With regards to the title of the land, the MMRDA application stated that the dispute between the centre and state over ownership of the land could be resolved amicably as both recognised the need for the Metro project. The application also stated that the Centre had shown its willingness to give the said land to MMRDA. Addressing the claims of one Mahesh Garodia, who also challenged the collector’s order, the application stated, “No prejudice would be caused to Garodia in the event the MMRDA is permitted to utilise the land for the project in view of the undertaking given by MMRDA to give all benefits and compensation to which the owner and/or lessee would be entitled to an acquisition of the land.” In light of these submissions, the application sought the lifting of the stay on the car shed project. Two of the three petitions are filed by the Central government, seeking stay on the Metro car shed work at the salt pan land. By one of the petitions, the Centre has challenged October 1, 2020 order by the district collector, allotting 102 acres out of Survey No 275 (part) to MMRDA. On October 6, 2020, the collector handed over possession of the salt pan land to MMRDA, which in turn handed it over to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited, which has been awarded the contract to construct the Metro car shed. Centre has claimed that entire salt pan lands in the belt, including the 102 acres, belongs to its salt department and has always been under administrative control of the deputy salt commissioner.By a separate petition, Centre has also challenged November 1, 2018, order of the Maharashtra revenue minister, upholding addition of names of the state government and some private parties in ownership column of the revenue record of several salt pan lands at Nahur, Mulund, KanjurMarg, Mandale, Malvani and Pahadi areas of Mumbai.The third petition was filed by Garodia. Garodia has claimed beneficial interest in vast tract of salt pan lands, including the 102-acres plot at Kanjurmarg, as a legal representative of the original lessee of the lands. He claimed that has filed a suit concerning the entire land leased to his predecessors and high court has passed interim orders in his favour. The suits are subsequently transferred to Bombay City Civil Court, which has confirmed the interim orders.Garodia’s counsel, senior advocate Shyam Mehta, had pointed out to court that till January 2020 the technical advisory committee of the state government had maintained that Kanjurmarg was not viable for construction of the metro car shed. They, therefore, changed the reservation of a suitable piece of land at Aarey Colony and spent over Rs200 crore for preparation at Aarey Colony.The 102-acre plot has become a bone of serious contention between Maharashtra government and the Centre. Ignoring steep opposition of environmental activists to vast tree cutting required for the car shed at Aarey Colony, when he was at the helm of affairs, BJP’s former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had decided to construct the car shed for Mumbai Metro-3 at Aarey Colony, .After the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, came to power in 2019, it responded positively to environmentalists and shifted the shed to Kanjurmarg, a location which the Fadnavis government had specifically rejected.The Uddhav Thackeray-led government then decided to construct an integrated metro car shed at Kanjurmarg, instead of constructing separate car sheds for these lines individually.The MMRDA, on its part, had highlighted that the stay on work at Kanjurmarg will entail additional expenditure for MMRDA of Rs2,328 crore on land acquisition and Rs1,600 crore as operational costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmrda-seeks-bombay-hc-s-nod-to-start-metro-work-at-disputed-plot-101614712536492.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Civic contractor dumps raw sewage in Bhandup salt lakes, green activist seeks action||An environmentalist, associated with a city-based NGO, on Monday, wrote to the civic authorities, including the collector (Mumbai suburban), the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the forest department’s mangrove cell, alleging unauthorised dumping of raw sewage into salt lakes in Bhandup, by a civic contractor.D Stalin, director of NGO Vanashakti, provided pictures and videos of the alleged violations, along with the GPS coordinates pinpointing at the location (along a service road in Nahur, East). He also highlighted the construction of a tarred road in the area, which is hindering the flow of intertidal water to nearby mangroves.The road has been constructed by a contractor to facilitate the installation of new sewer lines in the area, and that wastewater from existing sewers is being pumped out for the same purpose. This, despite, the site’s proximity to the nearby Bhandup sewage-treatment plant.Stalin’s letter (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times), said, “While the work is needed for better sewage collection and treatment, the method employed here, as seen in the video, is to pump the sewage into the intertidal salt lakes. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has a sewage treatment plant less than 2kms away. The sewage could have been easily transported by tankers.”“This act of pumping raw sewage into the salt lakes and polluting it is an offence. Please take action and direct the civic body to proceed in a proper non-polluting manner,” Stalin wrote, adding that these water bodies are fishing grounds for coastal communities and also provide wetland habitat for birds.“The BMC contractor informed that the salt department has permitted the work but that does not mean that environmental laws can be violated... all work must be done in a manner that does not block tidal water or threaten coastal water bodies,” Stalin’s letter goes on to state.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), BMC, could not be contacted on Monday despite multiple attempts. Virender Tiwari, the additional principal chief conservator of forests, also did not respond to messages seeking comment on the issue. An official with the revenue department, however, on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they have taken cognisance of some of these violations.“We have visited the site and noted dumping of debris in the salt lake, which has been tarred over to make an access road by the contractor. We permitted laying new sewer lines in Bhandup, but not to reclaim water bodies. We will seek a written undertaking from the BMC that the road will be removed once work is complete,” said the official, who did not directly comment on the dumping of raw sewage into the salt lake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaicivic-contractor-dumps-raw-sewage-in-bhandup-salt-lakes-green-activist-seeks-action-101614712529337.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||Over 700 hospitals, nursing homes in Mumbai flouting fire safety norms: BMC audit||The fire audit conducted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has found lapses in fire safety norms in around 701 hospitals and nursing homes across Mumbai. The list includes 38 government and BMC-run hospitals, the state government told the state Assembly on Tuesday. The fire safety audit was conducted in the backdrop of the Bhandara fire that broke out in a government hospital in January, killing ten infants. In a written reply, the state urban development minister Eknath Shinde said the fire department of the BMC has conducted fire audits of 1,324 hospitals, nursing homes and maternity homes in the city and found lapses in fire safety measures in 663 hospitals. They have been served notices under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006,” he said.Around 38 hospitals being run by the state government and BMC in Mumbai have also been asked to remove anomalies after lapses in fire safety measures were found during the drive conducted by the civic body, he added.Shiv Sena legislator Sanjay Potnis and others have asked about the drive conducted in January to check lapses in hospitals in taking fire safety measures across Mumbai. He said that patients from across the state come to Mumbai for treatment and a drive conducted by the civic body found lapses in fire safety measures in the hospitals.Around ten infants died after the fire broke out at the Sick Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) of Bhandara district hospital in the early hours of January 9. Taking cognizance of the incident, the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had ordered a thorough investigation and directed to find out why the infants could not be saved at the time of the fire. He also ordered fire and structural audits of all the government hospitals across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-700-hospitals-nursing-homes-in-mumbai-flouting-fire-safety-norms-bmc-audit-101614712353510.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||Chaos persists at Mumbai vaccination centres||Day two of the third phase of Covid-19 vaccination in Mumbai saw chaotic scenes similar to the first day with experts and citizens fearing that the vaccination centres may become “superspreader venues”, where one person infected with the coronavirus transmits it to several other people.In Bhiwandi, a 45-year-old private health worker, Sukhdev Kirdat, died after receiving his second vaccine dose, officials said. He fell unconscious 20 minutes after he got the jab, after which he was rushed to another hospital and declared dead by the doctors. Officials from the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) said the cause of death can be ascertained only after the post mortem report is acquired. “When he took the first dose he was completely fine, ” said KR Kharat, medical health officer, BNCMC, Meanwhile, technical glitches on the centralised CoWIN app, crowding due to inadequate seating arrangements turned vaccination centres into battlegrounds as senior citizens and those above 45 years of age with comorbidities jostled with each other just to get registered, said citizens. Civic officials criticised the Central government for a delay in issuing guidelines and not providing “breathing space”. However, on Tuesday, 6,863 citizens above the age of 60 and above 45 years with comorbidities got their vaccine shots, a 246% jump from the 1,982 vaccinated on Monday, official data stated.Also, on Tuesday, 25 centres, including three private ones, were activated, up from the eight on Monday. A total of 713 of the 6,863 were vaccinated at the three private centres.According to civic officials, by around 1pm, the CoWIN portal started functioning properly, post which crowds dwindled. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean, NESCO Covid Centre, said “The CoWIN portal had crashed or we can say it was taking time to load. But we are making all arrangements from our end to ensure no crowding. We also started manually registering those who had done so online and were scheduled appointments. The problem was with those who were walk-in beneficiaries. We cannot manually register them, considering they had not registered online nor can we register them on the spot as the portal had technical glitches.”Dr Andrade added, “We are making all possible arrangements, and Tuesday was much better than Monday. At the same time, citizens should also ensure they follow all Covid-19 norms.’On Tuesday, a video from the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo vaccination centre, showing crowding, was being circulated on social media. Even this was due to the portal having technical glitches. Dr Rajesh Dere, dean, BKC vaccination centre, said, “By afternoon, all the crowds were managed and the vaccination was streamlined. In the morning, there was little problem considering the portal had crashed and we also appealed to citizens to act responsibly.The BMC has maintained that it is following up with the Central government on fixing glitches on the portal, owing to which there was crowding at vaccination centres. A dean from a civic hospital said, “Lakhs or crores of citizens are logging in at the same time in the portal, owing to which there may be glitches, but until these glitches are resolved, the government should stop walk-in vaccination. Walk-ins add to the crowds at vaccination centres, leading to chaos.”Ruben Mascarenhas, an Andheri residentn said, “I had visited the NESCO jumbo centre on Tuesday to get my parents vaccinated, but had to return home without getting it done.

03-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: AC trains soon on Western Railway’s slow corridor||After running air-conditioned (AC) local trains for the past three years, the Western Railway (WR) is now considering to introduce a similar service between Andheri and Virar, on its slow lines. The AC trains will be introduced by March-end, after the completion of the extension of platforms enabling them to accommodate 15 compartment local trains.Presently, the WR operates AC local trains only on its fast railway line corridor between Churchgate and Virar railway stations.“The work on the extension of the platforms is going on and is likely to be completed soon. All proposals are being studied,” said Alok Kansal, general manager, WR.The AC train was introduced in 2017 and was suspended in March 2020 due to the spread of coronavirus in the city. The train services resumed in October 2020 after the Maharashtra government eased lockdown restrictions. The footfall of AC passengers after the resumption of train services has been low.To extend the railway platform between Andheri and Virar several changes in the alignment of the tracks are being undertaken. The changes include rationalisation of inter-signal distance on the railway tracks and extension of platforms on the slow line to accommodate these trains.Earlier the zonal railway had proposed the operation of semi-AC trains between Andheri and Virar railway station. WR in 2009 introduced 15-compartment local trains on its railway network. The train has 25% more passenger-carrying capacity compared to 12-compartment trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ac-trains-soon-on-western-railway-s-slow-corridor-101614712049130.html

03-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai coastal road work in fast lane, 100m tunneling done||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) completed digging the first 100m for the coastal road tunnel. The work started from the Priyadarshini Park end on January 11 using a tunnel boring machine (TBM).According to BMC, the tunnelling work is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. It includes two tunnels, taking the total tunnelling to 4.14km. The TBM, named ‘Mawla’, is placed 20m under the ground and will pass through Malabar Hill going up to Girgaum Chowpatty.A BMC official said, “Once the TBM reaches chowpatty, it will again be placed in the opposite direction for digging the other side of the tunnel.”The coastal road project measuring around 10km between Princess Street flyover and Worli-end of Bandra-Worli sea link is expected to be ready by July 2023. The tunnelling work has been delayed, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, which initially delayed the delivery of the TBM from China. Also, the BMC had to tweak its plan to not use Chinese experts for the assembling of the TBM in the backdrop of border tensions between India and China.According to BMC officials, the coastal road will save 70% travel time and 30% fuel. Post-construction, motorists will be able to reach from Nariman Point to Worli within minutes. The coastal road project was originally planned between Nariman Point and Kandivli, claiming it will ease traffic for those travelling between north and south Mumbai. However, now there is a question whether there should be a coastal road or a sea link beyond Versova to connect to the suburbs. The state is yet to take a call on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-coastal-road-work-in-fast-lane-100m-tunneling-done-101614711809377.html

03-03-2021||Mumbai||Road dust main contributor to PM pollution in Mumbai: Study||The contribution of road dust to the city’s overall pollution load has more than doubled over the past decade, reveals the interim results from a source apportionment study conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). Select details from this study, which has not yet been finalised, were shared by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) officials during an air pollution townhall organised by the state environment department on Tuesday.Road dust largely refers to solid particles generated during the handling and processing of road-building materials, such as gravel and concrete. Turbulence generated by passing traffic, particularly in areas with high traffic volume, or where road surface erosion and tyre wear are high, also generates and resuspends fugitive particles which become airborne. Preliminary findings from NEERI’s study indicate that such pollutants make up 71% of all particulate matter pollution in Mumbai.Of this, 45% comes from unpaved roads (which are more prone to erosion by wind) followed by paved surfaces, which contribute to 26% of the city’s dust load. Another 8% comes from particulate matter emissions traced to construction activities, and 3% to vehicles. The rest comes from industries, the domestic sector, aircraft, marine vessels, open eateries, bakeries, and crematoria.This marks a significant upswing in the presence of road dust over the last 10 years. An earlier source apportionment study released in 2010, (also by NEERI) had found that road dust makes up only 31% of Mumbai’s particulate matter concentration - with paved and unpaved roads contributing 12% and 18% respectively. This suggests a proportional increase in certain polluting activities, such as road laying, during the same time frame.NEERI’s earlier study had found, at the time, that paved and unpaved roads emitted over 7,924 tonnes of particulate matter into Mumbai’s atmosphere each year. The study had prioritised a 15% reduction in PM emissions from paved roads by the year 2017 and a 100 % reduction in emissions from unpaved roads by the same time.A subsequent analysis by Urban Emissions (an air pollution research and advocacy group) suggested that in 2018, “dust emissions from road re-suspension and construction activities” in Mumbai resulted in 7,050 tonnes of PM2.5 and 43,550 tonnes of PM10 emissions - a substantial increase. MPCB officials said they are taking steps to address these findings. “Road dust was earlier just a third of the total pollution load. This increase needs to be investigated. I have already written a letter to NEERI asking them to conduct a detailed audit for identifying areas where road dust resuspension is a problem. They will start by surveying about 20 locations,” said Dr Sudhir Shrivastava, chairman, MPCB, who did not specify these locations by name.Officials, including Dr VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB, and Dr Rakesh Kumar, director, NEERI, confirmed that these preliminary findings have been communicated to the Central Pollution Control Board by NEERI, but did not specify when. “The audit itself will start any day now. A list of areas is being prepared,” said Kumar, who also did not specify the areas by name.During his presentation as part of Tuesday’s webinar, Dr Motghare revealed that Mumbai’s air pollution action plan (for which funds were recently disbursed by the Centre), includes preparing a plan “for creation of green buffers along the traffic corridors” and “blacktopping of metaled roads including pavements of roads shoulders”, among others. A total of 364 green “traffic islands”, which will act as dust traps, have also been planned. Mechanical sweeping machines, meanwhile, are currently cleaning 253 kilometres of the city’s 2,000km wide road network every day.On the other hand, NEERI’s preliminary findings also show that emissions from certain sources have also decreased over the last decade. For example, bakeries in the city were found to contribute 3.5% of all particulate matter concentration last year (as opposed to nearly 6% in 2010. Similarly, emissions from landfill fires reduced from 11% to 3.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/road-dust-main-contributor-to-pm-pollution-in-mumbai-study-101614711329296.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar: Will not disconnect power supply over bills for now||Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday declared there will be no disconnection of electricity supply for farmer and local residents who failed to pay their bills until the issue of non-payment of the outstanding bills was debated in the state Assembly. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which created a din in both the houses of state legislature over the issue, demanded an urgent debate on the matter, saying they were unhappy with the action by state-owned power companies. They threated to intensify the agitation if the government did not announce stopping the disconnection of power supply. “No power connections of agricultural pumps and domestic consumers will be disconnected until the issue of non-payment of outstanding bills is debated in the state assembly. The matter will be discussed in the lower House in a day or two,” Pawar said in the Assembly. The issue also led to adjournment of proceedings in the Council as the Opposition was not satisfied with the response from the treasury benches. After a brief adjournment, Pawar came to the Council and said, “The government is ready to discuss the pending electricity bill in the legislature. The power supply for agricultural pumps and consumers in the state will not be cut until the members of both the parties are satisfied after the discussion. A special meeting will be held to discuss the power arrears in the state.” Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said people are infuriated with the move as they were already facing an economic crisis and disconnection is nothing less than double whammy for them. “Lakhs of people have received disconnection notices by the power companies for non-payment of electricity dues. The disconnection drive is going on parallely. Farmers were badly affected due to coronavirus pandemic, lockdown and floods. There are consumers who have received inflated power bills up to ₹80 crore. The state energy minister (Nitin Raut) had declared a concession in power bills, instead of which the peopel have been gifted with the tariff hike,” Fadnavis said. “Shopkeepers could not open their shops owing to lockdown and now if you are asking them to pay the bills immediately, how are they going to manage? People are really annoyed with the move. The state government must stop the disconnection drive immediately,” he demanded. In the Upper House, leader of opposition Pravin Darekar said the power connections are cut to “forcibly” recover money from farmers and middle-class households. He demanded, “The government is not in a profit-making business, if they are in a loss, they should secure loans but forgo the pending bills of the people and stop disconnection immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-will-not-disconnect-power-supply-over-bills-for-now-101614710909745.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||HC permits resumption of construction near Banganga Talav||The Bombay high court on Monday permitted the resumption of piling and construction activities undertaken by two developers adjacent to the Banganga Talav at Walkeshwar temple, Malabar Hill, after it was informed by the Director Archaeology and Museums that the allegations made by the petitioner trust were incorrect. The board of trustees had filed a petition alleging that the piling and construction work was contaminating the underground water flowing into the tank and hence the construction activity should be stopped, as it would affect the state protected grade I heritage structure. The court while lifting the stay directed the Director of Archaeology and Museums to depute an officer to be present on site when the construction work was on and to place a report of the same before the court in the next hearing on March 8. On February 22, a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the petition filed by The Board of Trustees of the Temples Charitable Institution and Funds of Gaud Saraswat Brahman Community which is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the temple and talav was informed by advocate Devendra Rajapurkar that the heritage structure was in imminent danger due to construction and piling work going on in the vicinity. On Monday, Rajapurkar informed the court that the survey was conducted whilst the work was stopped following the HC order the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-permits-resumption-of-construction-near-banganga-talav-101614710908454.html

On October 10, 2020, Saini was named as accused in Kotkapura police firing case. On January 18, the special investigation team (SIT), probing the 2015 police firing incidents, filed a supplementary chargesheet against Saini naming him as a conspirator in Kotkapura firing case. However, after filling of chargesheet, the court of judicial magistrate Ekta Uppal had summoned him to appear 18, following which he moved anticipatory bail application. After Saini failed to appear in the court, judicial magistrate issued fresh summons for March 26 against him in this case and also dismissed his application seeking exemption from appearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-faridkot-court-denies-pre-arrest-bail-to-ex-punjab-dgp-saini-101614710848958.html
03-03-2021||Mumbai||Record corruption in the name of handling Covid in Maharashtra, alleges Fadnavis||Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis attacked Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government accusing it of large-scale corruption in handling the Covid-19 pandemic over last one year. The procurement made for thermometer, fans, bed sheets, dead body bags were made at much higher rates than the market prices and it should be probed by the state government, Fadnavis demanded in the Assembly. He also said that the former forest minister Sanjay Rathod should be booked, holding him responsible for the death of a Pune girl as there is enough evidence against him corroborating his involvement from the 12 audio clips went viral on social media, a suspected abortion in Yavatmal by using fake address, mobile and tower location among others. Fadnavis was speaking while participating in a debate on the Governor’s address in the state Assembly. “The state is patting itself on the back, saying they erected Covid centers in Mumbai in record time, but actually it is a case of corruption in record time. There was large-scale corruption in procurement of items to be used for setting up and operations of Covid centres. ₹6500 was paid per thermometer which costs ₹1200 in market, ₹8.5 lakh was paid for taking bed sheets on lease which can be bought by spending ₹2 lakh, ₹90,000 was paid for taking fans on rent for 90 days, though they could have purchased number of fans in the same amount,” Fadnavis alleged. Similarly, ₹4.5 lakh and ₹6.75 lakh were paid for taking chairs and wooden tables on rent, respectively. Body bags cost ₹6,719 per piece to the government when their market price is just ₹2,200, he added. The opposition leader said the information documentation on effective planning to control Covid-19 pandemic in future has been given to Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRTC). “It should have been done by the state health department or medical education department,” he remarked. He also cornered the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government over Shiv Sena leader and former forest minister Sanjay Rathod whose name surfaced in connection with suicide of a woman in Pune. “There is no action taken in the suicide case even after 20 days,” the leader of opposition said. “You will not be able to get sleep at night after all this,” he said pointing out at the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who was sitting in front of him in the lower House. In the legislative council too, opposition leader Pravin Darekar rapped the Uddhav Thackeray led government for its failure on all fronts. “The state just wants to claim credit for Central schemes where it has played no role,” said Darekar. “The chief minister declared that there should be no religious, political or social gathering due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. As a head of state, we are all bound to obey his instructions. But his own minister (Rathod) held a big gathering at Pohradevi temple. His own ministers are flouting rules with impunity.”However the entire opposition staged a walk out when state transport minister Anil Parab indirectly remarked that Darekar was copying Devendra Fadnavis’s speech. Fadnavis also claimed the government hasn’t sent the resignation of Sanjay Rathod to Raj Bhavan yet. Fadnavis, during the discussion on Governor’s address in the Assembly, said, “The chief minister had said that he has not kept the resignation to frame it, but I don’t think it has been sent [to the Governor’s Office yet]; have not heard anything on it yet. He [CM Uddhav Thackeray] might have kept to frame it, then i don’t know.”A senior MVA minister, who is aware of the developments, confirmed that CMO till Tuesday evening hadn’t forwarded the resignation to Raj Bhavan. “It is the CM’s prerogative and he will decide when to do it, “ he said requesting anonymity.TWEET ROW Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday questioned the probe announced by state home minister Anil Deshmukh into the tweets by many Indian celebrities. “I would be proud if I had asked someone to tweet for my country. Let’s assume I asked them (celebrities) to tweet, what’s wrong in it? If there is propaganda against my country and if I had asked celebrities to stand for the country, is thisan offence? We aren’t afraid of your investigations. I am grateful you are holding an investigation for the tweets made for the country. This proves your “patriotism” (deshbhakti) and ours,” he remarked. “The preliminary inquiry by the police has revealed the involvement of BJP IT cell including 12 others. The police are investigating the matter further,” Deshmukh said in the state assembly. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary Sachin Sawant said the BJP has confessed to have made the celebrities tweet in response to the tweets by international celebrities supporting farmer protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/record-corruption-in-the-name-of-handling-covid-in-maharashtra-alleges-fadnavis-101614710669051.html
03-03-2021||Chandigarh||Behbal Kalan firing: HC grants anticipatory bail to Saini, Umranangal||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted anticipatory bail to former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended inspector general of police (IGP) Paramraj Singh Umranangal in the 2015 Behbal Kalan firing case observing that their custodial interrogation is not required in view of challan already presented before a trial court.Allowing their pleas, the bench of justice Raj Mohan Singh observed that initially, an FIR was registered against Charanjit Singh, former SSP Moga, and in second supplementary challan, four more accused were nominated. It was only in third supplementary challan the two were nominated. The third supplementary challan has been presented against them without associating them with the probe. Hence, their custodial interrogation is not required, it added.The high court was dealing with pleas from Saini and Umranangal, filed last month after dismissal of the same by the sessions court. They were chargesheeted by the special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police on January 15, which led to their summoning by a trial court. The high court has now asked them to appear before a judicial magistrate on March 8 and directed that in the event of arrest, they be released on bail. The judgment was pronounced on Monday and detailed order released on Tuesday.The court observed that they were nominated as accused without making them to join the probe. The only notice received by Umranangal in the context of joining the probe was of February 7, 2019, and in the case of Saini on September 20, 2019. Both the notices were prior to their nomination as accused and even prior to recording of an approver’s statement.The court also took note of the fact that in second supplementary challan, it was stated that after completion of the investigation against the remaining accused, a challan would be presented and by that time, the duo had been already nominated as accused. It further observed that when second inquiry commission report was submitted in the Vidhan Sabha, action taken report was also submitted proposing to proceed against the two departmentally. However, the court did not make any further observation adding that the “appropriate court” would consider the issue. The court also refrained from commenting on allegations of mala fide probe against the state levelled by the two.Both are accused in the case registered on October 21, 2015, at the Bajakhana police station in Faridkot, a week after two protesters were killed allegedly in the police firing at Behbal Kalan in the aftermath of incidents of sacrilege reported at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala. HC seeks response from govtMeanwhile the high court sought response from Punjab government on a plea filed by Saini seeking quashing of chargesheet filed by Punjab Police in the Behbal Kalan firing case. The state has been given time till March 19 to respond on the plea. The plea alleges “mala fide act” by the state adding that for five years, the probe did not find anything and suddenly now the name of Saini has cropped up in the investigations and he has been nominated as an accused in the FIR. “High court has issued notice of motion on the former DGP’s plea for March 19,” confirmed his counsel, Himmat Singh Deol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-saini-umranangal-101614710548929.html
03-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly zero hour: SAD seeks case against Capt, Jakhar for father-son suicide||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday demanded registration of a case against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa in a debt-ridden father-son duo’s suicide in the state. Raising the farm debt issue during the zero hour of the state assembly on day two of the budget session, SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia said the farmer-son duo had committed suicide due to the failure of the state government to waive their farm loan. “In their suicide notes, the duo said their loan was from a cooperative society, but it was not waived by the state government, he said, showing copies of the suicide notes left behind by the father and son. The father-son duo of Mahadipur village of Hoshiarpur district had committed suicide last month by consuming poison to protest against the central government’s attitude on the farmers’ stir, besides blaming the Punjab government for not waiving their loan. The Akali legislator said the Congress government had promised to waive loans taken by farmers from banks, cooperative societies and financial institutions, but their loan was not written off. “The government as well as Congress should be held accountable for this,” he said. Accusing the Congress of cheating the farmers, he sought registration of case against the chief minister and Jakhar. He also sought a government job for one family member of the duo. Need to maintain decorum of House: Sandhu Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu stressed the need to maintain decorum of the House, drawing attention towards the slogan-shouting and protests by members during the governor’s speech on the opening day of the session. He said that copies of the governor’s address were torn, some members rode bicycles to travel to the state assembly and there were some other protests. “Is there no difference between what happens outside and inside the House? There should be decorum in the House. What are we trying to show?” said the suspended AAP legislator, pointing to newspaper headlines on Monday’s proceedings. Members from the treasury benches thumped their desks to appreciate his suggestion. Demand for probe into Mohali land deal Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema also demanded a probe into the auction of 31 acres of prime land of a liquidated private firm, JCT, in Mohali (SAS Nagar) where the government had the first right. Calling it a scam, he said the land was sold to private companies for ₹92 crore whereas its market worth was roughly ₹400 crore. There was involvement of some officers and dealers in this transaction and the state government needed to look into the matter, he demanded, raising the controversial land deal. During the zero hour, SAD MLA Harinder Pal Singh Chandumajra drew the attention of the House towards the deepening financial crisis of Punjabi University, Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-zero-hour-sad-seeks-case-against-capt-jakhar-for-father-son-suicide-101614710070894.html
03-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram school murder: Petition in HC challenges denial of prosecution sanction against 4 cops||The Haryana government’s decision to decline prosecution sanction against four police officials, accused of framing a bus conductor for the murder of a seven-year-old student, was challenged before the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday by the deceased boy’s father, who filed a petition in this regard. Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for deceased boy’s father, said the petition was filed to quash the order passed by state government declining the prosecution sanction against the four officials. “We filed a petition in order to challenge the state government’s decision to sanction prosecution against the officials.”Earlier in December last year, the Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI) had filed a supplementary charge sheet before a CBI court against four police officials, including the former ACP and SHO of Bhondsi police station and the investigation officer of the case, for falsely implicating the conductor of the school bus and accusing him of sexual assault and murder. Last month, a special CBI court on Panchkula had observed that the state government is “sleeping over” the CBI’s request for prosecution sanction like “Kumbhakarna”. The state government had declined the prosecution sanction saying that the officials made an error in investigation but there was no fault in their intention. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary to government of Haryana, home department, passed an order on February 19, observing that there may be instances of not adopting the correct approach depending upon the circumstances of the case, but the intention of the investigation officer to conduct the investigation in the right perspective has to be seen. The intention and the ultimate objective of both the agencies were to focus on the main offence of the murder of a seven-year-old boy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-school-murder-petition-challenging-prosecution-sanction-against-police-officers-filed-101614708148244.html
03-03-2021||World||'Now is not the time': Top US health official warns against easing Covid-19 curbs||A top US health official warned Wednesday that measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 had to stay in place if the pandemic is to be beaten, after Texas dropped its mask-wearing mandate.The United States has recorded over 500,000 deaths from the coronavirus, but has recently made progress with its vaccination plan and some states are easing controls -- triggering alarm from health experts and the federal government."Now is not the time to release all restrictions... the next month or two is really pivotal in terms of how this pandemic goes," said Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."Every individual is empowered to do the right thing here regardless of what the states decide... I would still encourage individuals to wear a mask, to socially distance."Biden has hailed recent success in distributing vaccines but stressed that Americans should continue to wear masks as his administration tries to quell the soaring death toll and the risk posed by new virus variants."The president is 100 percent behind Doctor Walensky and the CDC's recommendations," White House coronavirus advisor Andy Slavitt said, speaking after Walensky at a coronavirus briefing."I don't think you could possibly be any clearer about the importance and the need for masks. As a leader, it's probably one of the topics he talks about most frequently."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-is-not-the-time-top-us-health-official-warns-against-easing-covid-19-curbs-101614792556158.html

03-03-2021||World||South Africa Covid-19 virus strain 'offers immunity against other variants': Experts||A new study has shown that people previously infected by the Covid-19 variant identified in South Africa have better immunity against other coronavirus mutations, experts said Wednesday.The findings, from yet to be peer-reviewed research by the team of South African scientists who discovered the 501Y.V2 variant, raise hopes that vaccines modelled on the strain could protect against future mutations.Identified late last year, the variant became the dominant strain in Africa's worst hit nation by the pandemic, fuelling the second wave of infection and delaying the start of vaccinations in February.Scientists said Wednesday that plasma collected from people infected with the variant had "good neutralising activity", including against "first wave" viruses and potentially other variants of concern.After the antibodies were tested against the original variant and another identified in Brazil, "results are showing a clear sense of direction", virologist Tulio de Oliveira said in a video conference."The 501Y.V2 can produce a high level of antibodies that can neutralise itself," he said, adding that the immune response outperforms previous variants.Health minister Zweli Mkhize told the same meeting that the discovery was "good news for all" as it presented a huge boost to the control of the pandemic.Only four percent of a sample of 55 patients who had 501Y.V2 failed to neutralise infection from the original coronavirus variant, data presented by the scientists showed.Meanwhile the antibodies were fully effective against the strain identified in Brazil, although only seven patients -- a small number -- were examined in one of the analyses.Coronavirus mutations -- some more contagious -- had put a damper on global vaccination programmes after existing shots were found to offer less protection against them.Manufacturers have in recent weeks raced to tweak their formulas in response to the spread of newer variants.US biotechnology company Moderna last week said it will begin in mid-March a clinical trial of a version of its vaccine specific to the South Africa variant.Top government advisor and leading epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim explained that shots developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna uses mRNA technology to elicit antibody production, and that the recent development bodes well for achieving immunity."These findings are basically telling us that we have a good prospect of success if we make a vaccine based on it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-covid-19-virus-strain-offers-immunity-against-other-variants-experts-101614792064334.html
03-03-2021||World||Water crisis continues in Mississippi after over two weeks since storms||Frustrations are mounting in Mississippi’s largest city, more than two weeks since winter storms and freezing weather ravaged the city’s water system — knocking out water for drinking and making it impossible for many to even flush their toilets.For more than two weeks now, residents in the city of 160,000 have been warned to boil any water that does come out of kitchen taps before using it.“I pray it comes back on,” Jackson resident Nita Smith said. “I’m not sure how much more of this we can take.”Smith has not had water at her house for nearly three weeks now, she said.Smith is concerned about her mother who has diabetes, since not having water makes it difficult to take her medicine. Her mother and most of the other elderly people on her street don’t drive anymore, so she’s been helping them get water to clean themselves and flush their toilets, she said.A key focus of city crews this week is filling the system's water tanks to an optimal level, officials said in an update late Tuesday. Workers are also continuing to fix dozens of water main breaks and leaks throughout the capital city.City officials on Wednesday planned to continue distributing water for flushing toilets at several pick-up points.But they have given no specific timeline for when the crisis will be resolved, nor have they said how many residents remain without water. It is difficult to estimate how many customers remained without water Wednesday, said Michelle Atoa, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office.The crisis has taken a toll on businesses. Jeff Good is co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, and two of them remained closed Wednesday. In an update to his customers posted on Facebook, Good said the businesses have insurance, but he’s concerned about his employees.“We will not be financially ruined,” Good wrote. “The spirits of our team members are my biggest concern.“A true malaise and depression is setting in," he added. “I am staying in touch, keeping them informed of the facts, trying to find the path each day.”Bonnie Bishop, 68, and her husband, Mike, 63, have been without water at their Jackson home for 14 days as both struggle with health problems.She's recovering after a three-and-half-month hospital stay with the coronavirus and back at home but still in therapy to learn how to walk again and deals with constant neuropathy in her hands and feet.She has not been able to soak her feet in warm water, something that usually helps with the neuropathy, or help her husband with gathering water to boil for cooking for cleaning.Mike Bishop just had surgery on his elbow. The first week of the couple was without water, he still had staples in his arm and was hauling five-gallon containers from his truck, his wife said. Bonnie Bishop said she told her husband not to strain himself, but he wouldn’t listen. They need water, and feel like they have no choice.“It’s a lot of wear and tear on the elderly,” she said.On Monday, the couple drove 25 miles (40 kilometers) to Mike’s mother’s house to do laundry.“My greatest concerns are sanitation and hygiene,” Bonnie Bishop said. “I am sure that is everyone’s concern.”Jackson's water system has not been able to provide a sustainable flow of water throughout the city since the mid-February storms, city officials have said.Jackson's water system “has basically crashed like a computer and now we’re trying to rebuild it,” Public Works Director Charles Williams said at a recent briefing.The city's water mains are more than a century old, and needs related to its infrastructure have gone unaddressed for decades, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has said.“We more than likely have more than a $2 billion issue with our infrastructure,” he said.Melanie Deaver Hanlin, who was without water for 14 days, was flushing her toilets with pool water and showering at friends' homes. She said serious updates need to be made to Jackson’s water system.“The problem needs to be fixed, not patched,” she said. “That’s the issue now — poor maintenance for far too long, and Jackson residents are paying the price.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/water-crisis-continues-in-mississippi-over-two-weeks-after-storms-101614791156756.html
03-03-2021||World||Pentagon hesitated on sending National Guard to Capitol riot: US General||The Defense Department took more than three hours to dispatch the National Guard to the deadly riot at the US Capitol despite a frantic request for reinforcement from police, according to testimony Wednesday that added to the finger-pointing about the government response.Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, told senators that the then-chief of the Capitol Police requested military support in a 1:49 p.m. call, but the Defense Department's approval for that support was not relayed to him until after 5 p.m., according to prepared testimony. Guard troops who had been waiting on buses were then rushed to the Capitol.That delay stood in contrast to the immediate approval for National Guard support granted in response to the civil unrest that roiled American cities last spring as an outgrowth of racial justice protests, Walker said. As local officials pleaded for help, Army officials raised concerns about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol, he said.“The Army senior leadership” expressed to officials on the call “that it would not be their best military advice to have uniformed Guardsmen on the Capitol,” Walker said.Meanwhile, the Capitol Police disclosed the existence of intelligence of a “possible plot” by a militia group to breach the US Capitol on Thursday. The revelation, coming as the acting police chief was testifying before a House subcommittee, differed from an earlier advisory from the House sergeant-at-arms that said Capitol Police had “no indication that groups will travel to Washington D.C. to protest or commit acts of violence.”The Senate hearing is the second about what went wrong on Jan. 6, with national security officials face questions about missed intelligence and botched efforts to quickly gather National Guard troops that day as a violent mob laid siege to the US Capitol. Even as Walker detailed the National Guard delay, another military official noted that local officials in Washington had said days earlier that no such support was needed.Senators were eager to grill officials from the Pentagon, the National Guard and the Justice and Homeland Security departments about their preparations for that day. Supporters of then-President Donald Trump had talked online, in some cases openly, about gathering in Washington that day and interrupting the electoral count.At a hearing last week, officials who were in charge of security at the Capitol blamed one another, as well as federal law enforcement for their own lack of preparation as hundreds of rioters, descended on the building, easily breached the security perimeter and eventually broke into the Capitol. Five people died as a result of the rioting.So far, lawmakers conducting investigations have focused on failed efforts to gather and share intelligence about the insurrectionists’ planning before Jan. 6 and on the deliberations among officials about whether and when to call National Guard troops to protect Congress.The officials at the hearing last week, including ousted Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, gave conflicting accounts of those negotiations. Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, told senators he was “stunned” over the delayed response and said Sund was pleading with Army officials to deploy National Guard troops as the rioting rapidly escalated.Senate Rules Committee Chair Amy Klobuchar, one of two Democratic senators who will preside over Wednesday's hearing, said in an interview Tuesday that she believes every moment counted as the National Guard decision was delayed and police officers outside the Capitol were beaten and injured by the rioters.“Any minute that we lost, I need to know why,” Klobuchar said.The hearing comes as thousands of National Guard troops are still patrolling the fenced-in Capitol and as multiple committees across Congress are launching investigations into mistakes made on Jan. 6. The probes are largely focused on security missteps and the origins of the extremism that led hundreds of Trump supporters to break through the doors and windows of the Capitol, hunt for lawmakers and temporarily stop the counting of electoral votes.Congress has, for now, abandoned any examination of Trump’s role in the attack after the Senate acquitted him last month of inciting the riot by telling the supporters that morning to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat.As the Senate hears from the federal officials, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman will testify before a House panel that is also looking into how security failed. In a hearing last week before the same subcommittee, she conceded there were multiple levels of failures but denied that law enforcement failed to take seriously warnings of violence before the insurrection.In the Senate, Klobuchar said there is particular interest in hearing from Walker, the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, who was on the phone with Sund and the Department of the Army as the rioters first broke into the building. Contee, the D.C. police chief, was also on the call and told senators that the Army was initially reluctant to send troops.“While I certainly understand the importance of both planning and public perception — the factors cited by the staff on the call — these issues become secondary when you are watching your employees, vastly outnumbered by a mob, being physically assaulted,” Contee said. He said he had quickly deployed his own officers and he was “shocked” that the National Guard “could not — or would not — do the same."Contee said that Army staff said they were not refusing to send troops, but “did not like the optics of boots on the ground” at the Capitol.Also testifying at the joint hearing of the Senate Rules Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees are Robert Salesses of the Defense Department, Melissa Smislova of the Department of Homeland Security and Jill Sanborn of the FBI, all officials who oversee aspects of intelligence and security operations.Lawmakers have grilled law enforcement officials about missed intelligence ahead of the attack, including a report from an FBI field office in Virginia that warned of online posts foreshadowing a “war” in Washington. Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of the report at the time, even though the FBI had forwarded it to the department.Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the report was disseminated though the FBI’s joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies.Though the information was raw and unverified and appeared aspirational in nature, Wray said, it was specific and concerning enough that “the smartest thing to do, the most prudent thing to do, was just push it to the people who needed to get it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-hesitated-on-sending-national-guard-to-capitol-riot-us-general-101614789343335.html
03-03-2021||World||Prince Philip 'slightly improving': Duchess Camilla on father-in-law's health||Prince Philip is “slightly improving” and the royal family is keeping its fingers crossed for the hospitalized duke's recovery, his daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, said Wednesday.Philip, 99, has been hospitalized since being admitted Feb. 16 to King Edward VII’s Hospital in London, where he was treated for an infection. On Monday, he was transferred to a specialized cardiac care hospital, St. Bartholomew’s, to undergo further treatment alongside testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition.Camilla said during a visit to a coronavirus vaccination center in London that Philip is “slightly improving,” but he “hurts at moments.”“We keep our fingers crossed,” said the duchess, who is married to Prince Charles, eldest son of Philip and Queen Elizabeth II. The comments were reported by broadcasters covering the visit.Buckingham Palace said Monday that Philip was “comfortable and is responding to treatment but is expected to remain in hospital until at least the end of the week.’”The two-week stay is already Philip’s longest-ever stint in hospital.Philip, who retired from royal duties in 2017, rarely appears in public. During England’s current coronavirus lockdown, Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, has been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London, with the queen.Philip married the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and is the longest-serving royal consort in British history. He and the queen have four children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-slightly-improving-duchess-camilla-on-father-in-law-s-health-101614791152421.html
03-03-2021||World||Myanmar security forces kill at least 33 protestors: Reports||Myanmar security forces dramatically escalated their crackdown on protests against last month’s coup, killing at least 33 protesters Wednesday in several cities, according to accounts on social media and local news reports compiled by a data analyst.That is highest daily death toll since the February 1 takeover, exceeding the 18 that the UN Human Rights Office said were killed on Sunday, and could galvanize the international community, which has responded fitfully thus far to the violence. Videos from Wednesday also showed security forces firing slingshots at demonstrators, chasing them down and even brutally beating an ambulance crew.The toll could even be higher; the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent television and online news service, tallied 38 deaths.Demonstrators have regularly flooded the streets of cities across the country since the military seized power and ousted the elected government of leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Their numbers have remained high even as security forces have repeatedly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to disperse the crowds, and arrested protesters en masse.The intensifying standoff is unfortunately familiar in the country with a long history of peaceful resistance to military rule — and brutal crackdowns. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.The Wednesday death toll was compiled by a data analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety. He also collected information where he could on the victims’ names, ages, hometowns, and where and how they were killed.The Associated Press was unable to independently confirm most of the reported deaths, but several square with online postings. The data analyst, who is in Yangon, the country’s biggest city, said he collected the information to honor those who were killed for their heroic resistance.According to his list, the highest number of deaths were in Yangon, where the total was 18. In the central city of Monywa, which has turned out huge crowds, eight were reported. Two deaths each were reported in Salin, a town in Magwe region, and in Mandalay, the country’s second-biggest city. Mawlamyine, in the country’s southeast, and Myingyan and Kalay, both in central Myanmar, each had a single death.As part of the crackdown, security forces have also arrested hundreds of people at protests, including journalists. On Saturday, at least eight journalists, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, were detained. A video shows he had moved out of the way as police charged down a street at protesters, but then was seized by police officers, who handcuffed him and held him briefly in a chokehold before marching him away.He has been charged with violating a public safety law that could see him imprisoned for up to three years.The escalation of the crackdown has led to increased diplomatic efforts to resolve Myanmar’s political crisis — but there appear to be few viable options. It's not yet clear if Wednesday's soaring death toll could change the dynamic.The UN Security Council is expected to hold a closed meeting on the situation on Friday, council diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized the give the information before the official announcement. The United Kingdom requested the meeting, they said.Still, any kind of coordinated action at the United Nations will be difficult since two permanent members of the Security Council, China and Russia, would almost certainly veto it. Some countries have imposed or are considering imposing their own sanctions.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, held a teleconference meeting of foreign ministers on Tuesday to discuss the crisis.But there, too, action is unlikely. The regional group of 10 nations has a tradition of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. A statement by the chair after the meeting merely called for an end to violence and for talks on how to reach a peaceful settlement.Ignoring that appeal, Myanmar’s security forces on Wednesday continued to attack peaceful protesters.In addition to the deaths, there have been reports of other violence. In Yangon, a widely circulated video taken from a security camera showed police in the city brutally beating members of an ambulance crew — apparently after they were arrested. Police can be seen kicking the three crew members and thrashing them with rifle butts.Security forces are believed to single out medical workers for arrest and mistreatment because members of the medical profession launched the country’s civil disobedience movement to resist the junta.In Mandalay, riot police, backed by soldiers, broke up a rally and chased around 1,000 teachers and students from a street with tear gas as gun shots could be heard.Video from the AP showed a squad of police firing slingshots in the apparent direction of demonstrators as they dispersed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-kill-at-least-33-protestors-reports-101614790555500.html
03-03-2021||World||US Police uncover ‘possible plot’ by militia to breach Capitol on March 4||The US Capitol Police say they have intelligence showing there is a “possible plot” by a militia group to breach the US Capitol on Thursday.The revelation was detailed in a statement from the Capitol Police. It comes at the same time the acting police chief is testifying before a House subcommittee.“The United States Capitol Police Department is aware of and prepared for any potential threats towards members of Congress or towards the Capitol complex,” the agency said in a statement. “We have obtained intelligence that shows a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4.”The statement differs from an advisory that was sent to members of Congress by the acting House sergeant-at-arms this week, saying that Capitol Police had “no indication that groups will travel to Washington D.C. to protest or commit acts of violence.”The threat comes nearly two months after thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in a violent insurrection as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden’s electoral win. So far, about 300 people have been charged with federal crimes for their roles in the riot. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died.Capitol Police say that they have stepped up security around the Capitol complex since January's insurrection, adding physical security measures such as the fencing topped with razor wire around the Capitol and members of the National Guard who remain at the complex. The statement said the agency was “taking the intelligence seriously” but provided no other specific details on the threat.The threat appears to be connected to a far-right conspiracy theory, mainly promoted by supporters of QAnon, that Trump will rise again to power on March 4, which was the original presidential inauguration day, until 1933, when it was moved to Jan. 20.Thousands of accounts that promoted the Jan. 6 event that led to a violent storming of the US Capitol have since been suspended by major tech companies like Facebook and Twitter, making it far more difficult for QAnon and far-right groups to organize a repeat of the mass gathering on Thursday.Twitter banned more than 70,000 accounts after the riots, while Facebook and Instagram removed posts mentioning “stop the steal,” a pro-Trump rallying cry used to mobilize his supporters in January. And the conservative social media platform Parler, which many of Trump’s supporters joined to promote false election fraud conspiracy theories and encourage friends to “storm” the Capitol on Jan. 6, was booted off the internet following the siege.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-police-uncover-possible-plot-by-militia-to-breach-capitol-101614790168511.html
03-03-2021||World||Biden signs off on tighter eligibility for $1,400 stimulus checks||President Joe Biden has agreed to moderate Democrats’ demands to narrow eligibility for the $1,400 stimulus payments included in the $1.9 trillion pandemic-relief bill, according to a Democratic aide.Individuals earning over $80,000 now won’t qualify for the payments, compared with a $100,000 cap in the previously drafted legislation, the aide said on condition of anonymity. The ceiling for couples will now be $160,000 against $200,000 before.Democratic Senators including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire had advocated tighter targeting of help to the neediest in the giant Covid-19 assistance package. Their votes will be critical in passing the legislation given the Senate’s 50-50 partisan split and united Republican opposition to Biden’s bill.A separate push by moderates to trim the $400-a-week supplemental unemployment benefits in the bill that the House passed last week to $300 won’t be included in what is initially brought to the Senate floor, according to the aide. The Senate’s so-called managers’ amendment to the House bill is expected to keep the House’s figure, which is a $100-a-week increase from the current level through August.The White House declined to comment.Senate TimelineFor the stimulus checks, phasing out of the $1,400 payments starts at $75,000 per individual and $150,000 for couples, the same as set in the House bill, the aide said.“I think we could drop it below the $200,000 and still provide help to households that still need it,” Shaheen said earlier this week in arguing for changes to the stimulus-check eligibility.It wasn’t immediately clear whether all Senate Democrats have accepted the compromise, although discussions had continued about it into last night. The language Biden approved gives both the moderate and progressive wings of the Senate Democratic caucus one item they wanted in the final negotiations.Biden met with nine moderate Democrats at the White House earlier this week as he sought their support in enacting his first signature piece of legislation.The House version of the aid bill must be tweaked, as some of its elements were found to violate congressional rules; among senators’ tasks is removing the minimum-wage hike and slightly trimming the overall cost.Senate Democrats will proceed with debate on the package once the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation affirm that the managers’ amendment to the House bill qualifies for protections against a filibuster, said a Senate Democratic aide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-off-on-tighter-eligibility-for-1-400-stimulus-checks-101614789211322.html

The news of Shaikh's defeat was told to him by Zain Qureshi -- who was the minister's polling agent, according to Geo News.Official results announcing Gillani's victory will be announced later, sources said.Geo ancherperson Shahzeb Khanzada termed it a "huge upset" for Imran Khan since he had personally campaigned for Shaikh and had managed to win over most of the government's allies.Senior ministers of the government such as Fawad Chaudhry and Sheikh Rashid had earlier claimed that Shaikh would defeat the former prime minister easily.Analyst Irshad Bhatti also said that it was "huge upset" for the government, adding that his earlier prediction that the former prime minister would lose has been proved wrong, Geo News further reported.Moreover, senior analyst Mazhar Abbas claimed this development was a victory for former president Asif Ali Zardari and a loss for Imran Khan."It was Zardari who urged the PDM to delay the long march and contest the Senate elections," he said, adding that a no-confidence movement against the Prime Minister could be successful.Meanwhile, according to Dawn, Abdul Qadir, Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Muhammad Qasim, Palwasha Khan, Khalida Ateeb, Sarfaraz Bugti, Manzoor Ahmed and Prince Ahmed Umer Ahmedzai have won the elections so far, as per unofficial and unverified results.The polling for 37 seats of Pakistan's Senate came to a close at 5 pm and counting of votes is currently underway as a total of 78 candidates contesting from Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Islamabad.The polls were held after a long-drawn open ballot controversy that kept the ruling party and opposition in a war of words and a legal battle before the Supreme Court on Monday announced that the elections for the Upper House of the Parliament will be held through secret ballot, according to Article 226 of the Pakistan Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expm-gilani-s-party-defeats-pak-pm-imran-khan-s-candidate-in-senate-polls-101614788239421.html
03-03-2021||World||Pak should be on FATF ‘black list’ for role in Afghanistan: Canadian think tank||In a scathing report published by an Ottawa-based think tank, a former Canadian cabinet minister has called for designating Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism and for adding it to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “black list” until it ends its alleged proxy war in Afghanistan. The report, titled “Ending Pakistan’s Proxy War in Afghanistan” and published by Macdonald Laurier Institute (MLI), has been authored by Chris Alexander, who was Canada’s citizenship and immigration minister from 2013-2015 in the Conservative government of then PM Stephen Harper. Alexander was also, from 2003-2009, the first resident Canadian ambassador to Afghanistan and deputy special representative of the UN’s secretary general for the country. He pointed out that the peace process in Afghanistan under President Ashraf Ghani is fading out, and what is considered an “endless war” has a “single underlying cause: Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is waging a covert proxy war in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s aim is to break Afghanistan’s post-2001 constitutional order by installing a Taliban-led coalition to replace the current government, which ISI sees as a stalking horse for India”. Underlining the ISI’s role in Afghanistan, Alexander added, “Without ISI support, the Taliban-led proxy war would end quickly.” Hibatullah Akhundzada currently heads the Afghan Taliban group. Late last month, the Paris-based terror funding watchdog FATF retained Pakistan on its grey list till June to address remaining targets. Pakistan has been on the grey list since 2018 and the FATF has said Islamabad has complied with 24 of 27 actions it was required to make. Alexander made 10 strategic recommendations in the report, including not just listing Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism, but also to “ensure that states enact wide-ranging sanctions against Pakistani officials” supporting extremist groups such as Taliban, al-Qaeda, Haqqani Network. The report also calls for debating the “situation in Pakistan” at the UN Security Council to make it clear that “ISI support for the Taliban and other terrorist groups is a threat to international peace and security. In the MLI’s report, the former Canadian minister also recommended that further talks with the Taliban be suspended pending an “unconditional ceasefire” while also suspending further US and Nato forces’ reduction till that happens and Pakistan’s covert proxy war ends. “The ISI’s clandestine ‘Directorate S’ continues to deliver comprehensive support to these groups, marshalling additional backing as required from other branches of Pakistan’s military and civilian institutions,” Alexander noted. Drawing a parallel to the international sanctions slapped on Russia over its role in Crimea, on Iran and increasingly on China, Alexander argued that to “achieve peace and protect the credibility of international law nearly two decades after the fall of the Taliban regime, every serious partner of Afghanistan now has a duty to enact far-reaching sanctions against those individuals and agencies in Pakistan responsible for this covert proxy war in Afghanistan”. The report also describes the ISI as the “chief spoiler now undermining peace and stability in Afghanistan”, placing at risk gains made over the past two decades since the 9/11 terror attacks in the US. “These achievements are now at risk,” Alexander wrote, due to what he called Pakistan’s policy of “strategic depth” to counter “perceived Indian influence”. That proxy war, Alexander claimed, has cost “at least 124,000 lives” over the last two decades, including 2,355 US soldiers and 167 Canadian military personnel and civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-should-be-on-fatf-black-list-for-role-in-afghanistan-canadian-think-tank-101614788853342.html
03-03-2021||World||ICC probes alleged war crimes in Palestinian territories, Israel condemns decision||The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Wednesday she has launched an investigation into alleged crimes in the Palestinian territories, plunging the court into the midst of one of the most fraught conflicts of the past half century.Fatou Bensouda said in a statement the probe will look into “crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court that are alleged to have been committed" since June 13, 2014, and that the investigation will be conducted “independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor.”Israel swiftly condemned the decision.Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi called it “an act of moral and legal bankruptcy” and said Israel “will take every step necessary to protect its citizens and soldiers from legal persecution.Bensouda said in 2019 there was a “reasonable basis” to open a war crimes probe into Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip as well as Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.Following that assessment, she asked judges to rule on the extent of the court’s jurisdiction in the troubled region. They did that last month, saying that the court’s jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.The Palestinian Authority welcomed Wednesday’s move.“This long-awaited step serves Palestine’s vigorous effort to achieve justice and accountability as indispensable bases for peace,” the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said. It called for concluding the investigation quickly because “the crimes committed by the occupation’s leaders against the Palestinian people are lasting, systematic and far-reaching.”The Palestinians joined the court in 2015 and have long pushed for an investigation of Israel, which is not a member of the court. The Palestinians asked the court to probe Israeli actions during its 2014 war against Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel’s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem.In the past, Israeli officials have accused the court of overstepping its bounds, saying the Palestinians are not an independent sovereign state. Officials say that Israel has been unfairly singled out and reject the allegations. They say military actions in Gaza were acts of self-defense and the status of the West Bank is disputed and must be resolved through negotiations.Bensouda, however, said there is a “reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases.” At the same time, she said the investigation will “allow for a continuing assessment of actions being taken at the domestic level in accordance with the principle of complementarity.”Eugene Kontorovich, director of international law at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative Israeli think tank, said the court’s investigation “is entirely unjustified -- and predictable, given its longstanding lawless bias against the Jewish state.”Israel has also argued that its military justice system is independent and capable of investigating itself. The ICC was set up to deal with crimes in countries where authorities are unable or unwilling to launch meaningful prosecutions.The Palestinians and human rights groups say Israel’s military justice system is biased and routinely whitewashes abuses by soldiers.The investigation will likely also look into alleged crimes by Palestinian militants. Bensouda has said her probe would look into the actions of Hamas, which fired rockets indiscriminately into Israel during the 2014 war.Israel blames Hamas and other militant groups for Palestinian war casualties, saying the militants use residential areas as cover to launch rockets and leave the military no choice but to strike back.Hamas welcomed the initiation of the investigation and called on Bensouda to “resist any pressure” that could scuttle the process.“This is a step forward to implement justice, punish the occupation and do justice to the Palestinian people,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the Associated Press.Asked whether the investigation can also cover rocket attacks by his group, he said that Hamas “is totally certain that its resistance of the occupation is legitimate" under international law.Bensouda said that priorities in the investigation will be “determined in due time” based on constraints including the coronavirus pandemic, limited resources and prosecutors' existing heavy workload.“Such challenges, however, as daunting and complex as they are, cannot divert us from ultimately discharging the responsibilities that the Rome Statute places upon the Office,” she said, referring to the court’s founding treaty.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians claim all three areas for a future independent state, a position that has widespread international support.Israel annexed east Jerusalem, home to the city’s most important religious sites, after the 1967 war and considers it part of its capital. It says the West Bank is disputed, not occupied, and withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The Hamas militant group seized control of Gaza two years later from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.Human Rights Watch welcomed the court's move as a step toward justice for Israeli and Palestinian victims.“The court’s crowded docket shouldn’t deter the prosecutor’s office from doggedly pursuing cases against anyone credibly implicated in such crimes,” said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch.“All eyes will also be on the next prosecutor Karim Khan to pick up the baton and expeditiously move forward while demonstrating firm independence in seeking to hold even the most powerful to account,” Jarrah added. "ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court’s work from any political pressure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/icc-probes-alleged-war-crimes-in-palestinian-territories-101614786045551.html
03-03-2021||World||Former top White House physician Ronny Jackson drank on duty, made sexual comments: Report||US House representative Ronny Jackson made “sexual and denigrating” comments about a female staff and drank alcohol while working as a top White House physician under the previous administrations, according to a report obtained by CNN. The office of the Department of Defense (DoD) inspector general has been investigating Jackson since 2018, particularly after the White House doctor withdrew as President Donald Trump's nominee to run the Veterans Affairs Department following allegations of “hostile work environment" and "drunkenness”.The investigation, which included interviews of 78 witnesses and a review of White House documents, led to the conclusion that Jackson failed to treat his subordinates with dignity and respect, according to CNN. The report has further claimed that the majority of witnesses interviewed as a part of the investigation used words like “meltdowns,” “rages,” “tantrums,” and “aggressive” to describe the physician’s behaviour.The Pentagon report also alleges, per CNN, that the physician, who achieved the position of rear admiral in the US Navy, behaved inappropriately as he consumed alcohol and sleeping medication while on duty. During an overseas presidential trip, Jackson allegedly told a medical subordinate that a female colleague of his had “great t**s” and “a nice a**”, according to CNN citing witnesses. The report is expected to be released by the Pentagon watchdog later on Wednesday.The DoD office of inspector general conducts audits, evaluations, administrative investigations, and overseas contingency operations, providing oversight related to the programs and operations of the Pentagon. The administrative investigations, conducted in the case of Jackson, oversees allegations of misconduct by senior DoD officials.Jackson has reportedly rejected the allegations and accused Democrats of using the report to “repeat and rehash untrue attacks on my integrity.” "I flat out reject any allegation that I consumed alcohol while on duty. I also categorically deny any implication that I was in any way sexually inappropriate at work, outside of work, or anywhere with any member of my staff or anyone else. That is not me and what is alleged did not happen,” Jackson was quoted as saying by Axios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-top-white-house-doctor-drank-on-duty-made-sexual-comments-report-101614782353486.html

Lawyers for the couple, who stepped back as frontline royals last year, told the newspaper they are the victims of a calculated smear campaign based on "misleading and harmful misinformation".The development comes as an interview by the couple with American chat show host Oprah Winfrey is due to be aired over the weekend, with clips showing Harry speak about his late mother, Diana – the Princess of Wales, saying he feared history was "repeating itself" before he and Meghan decided to step back as senior royals.Princess Diana had died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-says-allegations-of-bullying-brought-against-her-false-report-101614783709724.html
03-03-2021||World||Far-right misinformation has more engagement on Facebook: Research||Facebook has emerged as a major source of news consumption in recent years. Since it's launch in 2004, the social media platform has evolved from a simply image sharing and status updating website to go-to point for millennials.The website has seen a lot of user engagement and heated debates over issues which are politically relevant and concern with the lives of the people. And in recent times, Facebook has to deal with misinformation problem.As outrage over the issue grew, the company deployed a series of checks and balances to counter the misinformation campaign. Some of these include labelling of the false claims and reduced visibility in users' feed.But when it comes to political ideology, there is an interesting trend which has been highlighted by the researchers at New York University (NYU) in a recent survey.The researchers identified that accounts which have been labelled far-right by rating agencies generate more engagement - likes, shares and other forms - than any other partisan group. The study also said that far-right misinformation had on average 65 per cent more engagement per follower.This was followed by pages for far-Left publications and then then closer to the centre of the political spectrum.The study has been conducted by Laura Edelson and Ian Goldstein, PhD candidates at NYU, and Minh-Kha Nguyen, a PhD student at Grenoble Alpes University.The researchers based their study on Facebook's CrowdTangle tool and obtained list of pages and public posts from independent data providers and fact-checking websites. Among other criteria, the researchers looked pages with more than 100 followers.The timeframe chosen by the researchers was August 10, 2020 to January 11, 2021. At least 8.6 million pages were downloaded by the researchers to arrive at conclusion, the team said.They also said that content from websites rated as "extreme" garnered more engagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farright-pages-generated-more-engagement-on-facebook-research-101614784514312.html
03-03-2021||World||Saudi Arabia to ship gas to South Korea and take carbon dioxide back||Saudi Arabia plans to ship gas to South Korea where it will be used to make hydrogen, and the carbon dioxide produced in the process will be transported straight back to the kingdom.Hyundai OilBank Co. will take liquefied petroleum gas cargoes from Saudi Aramco which it will then convert into hydrogen, the Korean energy company’s parent Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co. said in a statement. The hydrogen will be used at desulfurization facilities and to power vehicles.The deal signed on Wednesday includes an agreement for the CO2 emitted in the hydrogen-making process to be transported back to Saudi Arabia, according to a Hyundai Heavy spokesman. The gas will then be used in Aramco’s oil production facilities.The Saudi oil major uses carbon dioxide to pump more oil out of the ground in a process known as enhanced oil recovery. Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for more information on the arrangement.The plan hinges on the relative ease of shipping carbon dioxide rather than hydrogen. Carbon dioxide can be shipped as a refrigerated liquid under moderate pressure.“It’s an option to get around the problems of shipping blue hydrogen but still using blue hydrogen in a global market,” said Florian Forster, a consultant at Boston Consulting Group. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas and the carbon dioxide emitted in the process is captured.Aramco shipped its first cargo of hydrogen produced in combination with carbon capture as ammonia to Japan in September. The agreement with HHI differs because the hydrogen will be produced in South Korea, rather than where the natural gas was extracted.“It seems the project will bank on the idea that shipping LPG to Korea and carbon dioxide back to Saudi Arabia will be cheaper than shipping hydrogen to Korea,” said Martin Tengler, BloombergNEF’s lead hydrogen analyst.Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering Co., the shipbuilding arm of Hyundai Heavy, will jointly develop the world’s first vessel that will be able to carry LPG and captured carbon dioxide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-ship-gas-to-south-korea-and-take-carbon-dioxide-back-101614783221340.html
03-03-2021||World||UK to receive 10 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses from India's Serum Institute||The UK will receive 10 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the UK government said on Tuesday.SII, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is mass producing the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, for dozens of poor and middle-income countries."The UK has ordered 100 million doses of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, of which 10 million doses will come from the Serum Institute of India," a UK government spokesperson told Reuters.Reuters reported in February that Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was auditing the manufacturing processes at SII to pave the way for the AstraZeneca vaccine to be shipped from there to the UK.The move is likely to stir concerns that wealthy Western countries are procuring vaccine doses at the expense of poor countries.A slew of low-and middle-income countries ranging from Bangladesh to Brazil are dependent on SII's AstraZeneca vaccine, branded Covishield, but demand has been growing from Western countries.It is also providing doses to the Covax programme backed by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance.The UK government said the agreement follows assurances from the SII that providing doses to the UK would not impact its commitment to provide vaccines to poorer countries.Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency remained concerned, however: "The acquisition by the UK is just another example of how the countries with the highest incomes continue to enjoy privileges at the expense of the poorest ones."Alain Alsalhani, Vaccines and Special Projects Pharmacist with NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres, said he was worried about potential delays."This announcement is a concern as we were under the impression that AstraZeneca would manufacture doses for the UK and Europe in Britain and in the European Union," he said."If SII exports doses to Europe, we can genuinely ask ourselves if AZ and SII delivery timelines to the Covax mechanism in the first half are not going to be subject to delays."Britain has been ahead at inoculating people, with nearly 20.5 million residents receiving the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine so far, according to official data.Separately, the European Union's drug regulator is auditing the manufacturing site of SII, Reuters reported on Monday. AstraZeneca has committed to delivering 180 million doses in the second quarter to the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-receive-10-mn-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-doses-from-india-s-serum-institute-101614783241754.html
03-03-2021||World||California crash kills 13 on route for illegal border crossings||Barely a mile from where an SUV packed with 25 people struck a tractor-trailer — killing 13 inside — a cemetery with unmarked bricks is a burial ground for migrants who died crossing the border from Mexico to remote California desert.Authorities are investigating whether human smuggling was involved in Tuesday's early-morning collision that killed the 22-year-old male driver of the SUV and 12 passengers. The Mexican government said 10 of the dead were Mexican citizens and that nationalities of the three others who died was undetermined.Seats of the 1997 Ford Expedition were removed except for the driver and right front passenger's, said Omar Watson, chief of the California Highway Patrol's border division.The cause of the collision was undetermined, authorities said, and it also was unknown why so many people were crammed into a vehicle built to hold eight people safely. But smugglers have been known to pack people in extremely unsafe conditions to maximize profits.The crash occurred during the height of harvest in California's Imperial Valley, which provides much of the lettuce, onions, broccoli and winter vegetables to U.S. supermarkets. Holtville, a no-stoplight town with a gazebo in its large central square, calls itself the world's carrot capital.The area became a major route for illegal border crossings in the late 1990s after heightened enforcement in San Diego pushed migrants to more remote areas. Many crossed the All-American Canal, an aqueduct that runs along the border and unleashes Colorado River water to farms through a vast network of canals.At the back of Terrace Park Cemetery in Holtville, single bricks — rows of them — mark the unidentified remains of people who died, many of them migrants.In 2001, John Hunter founded Water Station, a volunteer group that leaves jugs of water in giant plastic drums for dehydrated migrants.“I was trying to figure out how to stop the deaths,” said Hunter, whose brother Duncan strongly advocated for border wall construction as a congressman.Illegal crossings fell sharply in the mid-2000s but the area has remained a draw for migrants and was a priority for wall construction under former President Donald Trump. His administration's first wall project was in Calexico.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said late Tuesday that agents in its Homeland Security Investigations unit "have initiated a human smuggling investigation (into Tuesday's crash). The investigation is ongoing and no further details are available at this time.”When police arrived about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of San Diego, some passengers were trying to crawl out of the crumpled SUV while others were wandering around the fields. The rig’s front end was pushed into the SUV’s left side and two empty trailers were jackknifed behind it.“It was a pretty chaotic scene,” said Watson.The Border Patrol said its agents were not pursuing the vehicle.People in the vehicle ranged in age from 15 to 53 and were a mix of men and women, officials said. The driver was from Mexicali, Mexico, just across the border, and was among those killed. The 68-year-old driver of the big rig, who is from nearby El Centro, was hospitalized with moderate injuries.Passengers’ injuries ranged from minor to severe and included fractures and head trauma. They were being cared for at several hospitals. One person was treated at a hospital and released.The crash occurred around 6:15 a.m. under clear, sunny skies at an intersection just outside Holtville, about 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the border. Authorities said the tractor-trailer and its two empty containers were northbound on State Highway 115 when the SUV pulled in front of it from a road with a stop sign.A California Highway Patrol report said the SUV entered an intersection directly in front of the big-rig, which hit the left side of the SUV. Both vehicles came to a halt on a dirt shoulder.It’s not clear if the SUV ran a stop sign or had stopped before entering the highway. Speeds were also unknown.The speed limit for tractor-trailers on the highway is 55 mph (88.5 kph), according to CHP Officer Jake Sanchez. The other road is also 55 mph for vehicles.A 1997 Ford Expedition can carry a maximum payload of 2,000 pounds. If it had 25 people inside, that would easily exceed the payload limit, which taxes the brakes and makes it tougher to steer, said Frank Borris, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation.“You’re going to have extended stopping distances, delayed reactions to steering inputs and potential over-reaction to any type of high-speed lane change,” said Borris, who now runs a safety consulting business.SUVs of that age tended to be top-heavy even without carrying a lot of weight, Borris said.“With all of that payload above the vehicle’s center of gravity, it’s going to make it even more unstable,” he said.The crash occurred amid verdant farms that grow a wide variety of vegetables and alfalfa used for cattle feed. Many workers commute daily from Mexico during the winter harvest, taking buses and SUVs to the fields from downtown Calexico just before dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-crash-kills-13-on-route-for-illegal-border-crossings-101614782684476.html

We have shown that their own members are afraid of the government," Bilawal was quoted as saying by Geo News.As the polling for 37 seats of Pakistan's Senate is underway, the PPP chairman stated that even a single vote more would be a bonus for the party to lead in the elections for the Upper House of the Parliament.Bilawal further remarked that Prime Minister Imran Khan will be 'ousted' with the collective effort of the people and the Opposition."We will get him [Imran Khan] out of here together. PDM is with the people," he said.Taking a jibe at the incumbent government, Bilawal said those who should be winning the elections easily are seen worried about the results. "They are losing, their government is leaving," he said.Polling for the 37 seats of Pakistan's Senate is underway via secret ballot as a total of 78 candidates are contesting from the federal capital and three provinces -- Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.The polls are being held after a long-drawn open ballot controversy that kept the ruling party and opposition in a war of words and a legal battle before the Supreme Court on Monday announced that the polls for the Upper House of the Parliament will be held through secret ballot, according to Article 226 of the Pakistan Constitution.The ruling PTI's numerical strength in the Senate is expected to almost double from the existing 14 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bilawal-bhutto-says-pti-partymen-have-lost-faith-in-imran-101614781306016.html
03-03-2021||World||Data show US companies create less jobs than projected||The number of employees at US businesses rose in February by less than expected, underscoring the labor market’s struggle to recover despite a decline in Covid-19 infections in recent weeks.Company payrolls increased by 117,000 during the month, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for an increase of 205,000. The prior month was revised up to a 195,000 rise.The figures suggest that employment gains are being held back by pandemic-related constraints on businesses and economic activity. Even so, many economists expect a continued improvement in the labor market in the coming months as Covid-19 vaccinations pick up and virus concerns ease.“The labor market continues to post a sluggish recovery across the board,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a statement. “We’re seeing large-sized companies increasingly feeling the effects of Co-19, while job growth in the goods producing sector pauses.”Lawmakers are watching the labor market closely as they consider another economic stimulus bill. President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief package -- which includes an extension of federal unemployment benefits -- passed the House of Representatives on Saturday and the Senate is expected to vote on the legislation as soon as this week.The data precede Friday’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which is forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 200,000 in February, following a gain of just 6,000 in the prior month.The gain in employment was led by services, which rose by 131,000, the ADP data showed. Payrolls at goods-producing businesses, meanwhile, decreased by 14,000, led by manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-show-us-companies-create-less-jobs-than-projected-101614779757577.html

Our relationship has become an ‘all-weather strategic cooperative partnership’,” Qureshi wrote in a Chinese state-run paper.India and China in 2019 had announced a list of 70 events to mark 70 years of the establishment of Sino-India ties in 2020.The celebrations never took off, at first because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and then because of the military standoff which broke out in May.In the case of China and Pakistan, however, the celebrations have already begun: On Tuesday a logo was unveiled during the Wang-Qureshi event, which, it was said, epitomises the historic nature of Pakistan-China ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-and-pakistan-to-hold-100-events-to-mark-70-years-of-bilateral-ties-101614781472974.html

An emergency issued for up to 10 other urban prefectures later in January was lifted last week, underscoring the government’s eagerness to allow businesses to return to normal as soon as possible.“Our anti-infection measures are in a very important phase,” Suga told reporters Wednesday. “In order to protect people’s lives and health, I think we need to extend (the state of emergency) for about two weeks.”Tokyo is to host the Olympics, delayed by one year because of the virus, starting July 23.The state of emergency centers around asking restaurants, bars and other businesses to voluntarily close at 8 p.m. Japan has never had a mandatory lockdown, but has managed to keep infections relatively low. Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike and the heads of neighboring prefectures have raised concerns that a lifting of the emergency this weekend could trigger a quick rebound in infections.Daily new cases in Tokyo have decreased significantly after peaking at about 2,000 in early January, but the decline has slowed recently. Tokyo on Wednesday reported 316 new cases, up from 232 the day before, raising its total to 112,345. Nationwide, Japan reported more than 434,000 cases and about 8,000 deaths as of Tuesday.Suga said he will consult with experts and prefectural leaders and make a final decision quickly. He said medical systems in the region are still burdened with Covid-19 patients and more hospital beds have to be freed up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-mulls-extension-of-coronavirus-emergency-in-tokyo-101614778136943.html
03-03-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine deliveries to African nations pick up speed||More African countries received the long-awaited first deliveries of Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday, with Kenya and Rwanda benefiting from the global Covax initiative that aims to ensure doses for the world’s low-and middle-income nations.African and other health officials have been frustrated with the sight of a handful of rich countries rolling out vaccines after snapping up large amounts for themselves.“We will be known as the continent of Covid” if Africa doesn’t quickly reach its target of vaccinating 60% of its population of 1.3 billion people, the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said last week. The continent last month surpassed 100,000 confirmed deaths.So far Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Angola and Congo also have received their first vaccine doses via Covax, with several other countries including Mali, Senegal, Malawi and Uganda set to receive them this week.Rwanda is becoming the first African nation to receive the Pfizer vaccine via Covax. The vaccine needs storage at ultra-cold temperatures, making rollout complex in hot countries and rural areas, for example.Covax has faced delays related to the severely limited global supply of vaccine doses as well as logistical issues.And Covax alone will not supply Africa’s 54 countries with the doses needed to reach the 60% population coverage for achieving so-called herd immunity, when enough people are protected through infection or vaccination to make it difficult for a virus to continue to spread.That's why some countries such as South Africa, the hardest-hit African nation, are also pursuing Covid-19 vaccines via bilateral deals or via the African Union's bulk-purchasing program.Despite the various challenges, some health officials expressed jubilation as the first vaccine doses via Covax arrived.“We have been fighting the pandemic with rubber bullets but what we have acquired today is equivalent, metaphorically speaking, to bazookas and machine guns,” Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said.Kenya received 1.02 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. The minister said the vaccines will be administered to some 400,000 medical workers and the rest will go to other front-line workers such as teachers and police officers.“This first shipment of 1 million vaccines is part of an order of 3.5 million to Kenya,” UNICEF spokesman Andrew Brown told The Associated Press.Kenya, East Africa’s commercial hub, has more than 106,000 confirmed virus cases including more than 1,800 deaths. Many health workers for months have been disgruntled over the inadequate supply of personal protective equipment. They also say they were never paid the allowances that the government promised them for the extra work and risk while combating Covid-19.Rwanda received 240,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with 102,960 Pfizer doses expected later Wednesday. The health ministry said these first doses will target front-line workers, those above 65 and people with underlying health conditions.Health Minister Daniel Ngamije said Rwanda’s goal is to vaccinate 30% of the population by the end of this year, and 60% by the end of 2022.Rwanda has recorded 19,111 cases and 265 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-deliveries-to-african-nations-pick-up-speed-101614777515914.html
03-03-2021||World||SOS call to local paper saves 81 Rohingya at sea, but no country to take them in||Denis Giles, the editor of a small Indian newspaper, received a phone call as he sat typing in his one-room office in Port Blair overlooking the languid waters of the Andaman Sea.The caller, Mohammed Siddiqui, was frantic and largely incoherent. Giles said he was about to hang up until he heard, in broken Hindi: "Please help me... Many people may die."Siddiqui pleaded with Giles to spread the word of dozens of Rohingya Muslims fleeing Bangladesh for Malaysia aboard a crippled fishing boat in the Andaman Sea. Eight of the passengers had already died."You can help me save lives," Siddiqui told Giles, who publishes the English-language Andaman Chronicle, which has been covering news in India's coral reef-fringed Andaman and Nicobar archipelago for more than 15 years.Siddiqui's brother and the other Rohingya passengers had paid human traffickers to smuggle them to Malaysia from cramped refugee camps in southern Bangladesh that are home to more than a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.Siddiqui, who lives in Australia, told Reuters that he learned of the fate of the vessel after his brother made an SOS call from a satellite phone on board the boat on Feb. 18, roughly a week after it embarked on the voyage from Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh."No one knew of the boat until the engine developed a snag and it drifted near Indian waters," Siddiqui said. "That was when I got to know that my brother was stuck on a boat with 80 survivors and that eight were dead due to extreme dehydration or hunger."Siddiqui said he tried to reach the Bangladesh Coast Guard and other agencies."There was just no response. Finally I decided to call some journalists and based on the GPS coordinates I realised the only person who could help was someone based in the Andaman Islands," Siddiqui said.Favoured DestinationHundreds of thousands of Rohingya were forced to flee their homeland after a crackdown by Myanmar's military in 2017. Myanmar denies accusations of genocide and says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign.The Rohingya are a minority group, most of whom are denied citizenship by Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Muslim-majority Malaysia has been a favoured destination for fleeing Rohingya. Many risk the perilous sea journey in rickety boats despite Malaysia saying last year it would no longer accept them.Siddiqui, who was given the coordinates by the fishing boat captain, passed them to Giles, who was the first person to call the Indian Coast Guard to alert them. That was Feb. 19."I told them people are dying they must send ships to help them but Indian officials instead suggested I send them details via email," said Giles.He fired off an email with the coordinates of the boat that was adrift roughly 235 km (150 miles) northeast of Port Blair, said Giles in an effort to explain the urgency.Giles, who published a story about the refugees on Feb. 21, said he only received a call from the coast guard on Feb. 23 to inform him that a rescue was under way.The Indian Coast Guard and Navy did not respond to requests for comment on the rescue operation."The Sea is not their home"But while the boat has been located, the fate of the passengers remains far from certain.India's foreign ministry confirmed the boat had been found and that two Coast Guard ships were helping those on board and repairing the vessel so that it could return safely to Bangladesh.But Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen last week told Reuters his government expects either India, the closest country, or Myanmar to take it in.Aid agencies are demanding that governments stop passing the buck and act."The law of the sea equally binds all states to come to the rescue of persons in distress at sea and deliver them to a place of safety," said Catherine Stubberfield, an Asia-Pacific spokeswoman for the UNHCR."This applies regardless of nationality, legal status, or circumstances in which people in distress are found."New Delhi has not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them, nor does it have a law protecting refugees.Giles said he feels relieved the refugees are at least getting help for now, along with food, water and medicine."I hope the Rohingya receive a warm welcome from a country at the earliest," said Giles. "The sea is not their home."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sos-call-to-local-paper-saves-81-rohingya-at-sea-but-no-country-to-take-them-in-101614775384498.html
03-03-2021||World||China kicks off its politically significant annual Parliament season||China on Wednesday began its politically significant annual Parliament season, amid mounting political and economic challenges in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and the growing adversity with the US over a host of issues including, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.The gathering of China’s political elite is taking place ahead of this year's centenary celebrations of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and increasingly assertive leadership of President Xi Jinping.Xi, 67, has established himself as the most powerful leader after Mao Zedong with prospects of life-long tenure in power following scrapping of two-year tenure rule for the Presidency.Every year in March, the full sessions of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s parliament and the advisory body the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) hold their sessions with full members totalling over 5,000 legislators and advisors.The CPPCC will begin its week-long session from Thursday which will be attended by Xi and other leaders while the NPC kicks off its meeting from March 5. The political season began on Wednesday with a nationally televised press conference by its spokesman.During this year’s meeting, the NPC, often described as a rubber stamp parliament for its routine approval of the CPC proposals, is set to endorse the 14th Five Year plan and the plan for Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.While the 14th Five-Year plan envisages a massive overhaul of the country's domestic market to boost consumption in order to reduce China's reliance on shrinking exports markets, the Vision 2035 visualises a long-term plan, reflecting the development vision outlined by president Xi.China’s status as a world’s factory has been affected by declining global markets and the trade war initiated by former US president Donald Trump, followed by his successor Joe Biden as well, by his move to ban of Chinese tech firms like Huawei, TikTok and restrictions on exports of semiconductor chips to China deepening the technology conflict between top two world economies.The relations between the US and China are at an all-time low. The two countries are currently engaged in a bitter confrontation over various issues, including trade, the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the communist giant's aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea and human rights violations in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.China is also expected to increase about seven per cent of its defence budget which last year was 1.268 trillion yuan (close to $200 billion), according to report in state-run Global Times. It is over three times higher than India’s defence budget of $47.4 billion.Security as well as Covid-19 monitoring has been increased in Beijing ahead of CPCC and NPC sessions.Last year, the two sessions were held in May instead of March due to a coronavirus outbreak. This year only, Beijing-based foreign correspondents were invited to cover the proceedings mostly through video links due to Covid-19 restrictions.Correspondents covering the events should undergo coronavirus tests every day before attending the events.Though China is exporting its coronavirus vaccines to different countries, the Chinese leadership is yet to get vaccinated. Reports say delegates attending the parliament sessions were being inoculated.Answering a question at the press conference about China's pursuing Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy, CPCCC spokesman Guo Weimin said China’s exports of vaccines to expand geopolitical clout is a narrow-minded view.China has always put the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines first, Guo said. So far China has administered 52 million vaccine doses of vaccines to people at home. Some foreign leaders have taken Chinese vaccines as well, he said.China has also provided vaccines to 69 countries and two international organisations, and exported vaccines to 28 countries, Guo said.On criticism about the recent announcement by President Xi that China eradicated absolute poverty, he said, "experts said China's poverty alleviation standard is a comprehensive one and higher than the World Bank's standard of $1.90 per day. The basic living needs of the rural population are met.""Despite the remarkable achievement pocketed in poverty alleviation cause, China's development remains unbalanced and inadequate, hence the country is poised to consolidate the gains of poverty alleviation and press ahead with the rural revitalisation strategy," he said.On the imposition of national security law in Hong Kong, much against the wishes of local people, he said the purposes of adopting and implementing the law on safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and improving its electoral system are both to uphold and improve the "one country, two systems" and to ensure its steady and sustained development in a right direction, he said.He also decried calls for boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics over allegations of genocide in Xinjiang against Uighur Muslims as "futile"Attempts to politicise sports games and disturb and sabotage the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are futile and doomed to fail, he said.The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games is scheduled to be held from February 2022 in Beijing and towns in the neighbouring Hebei province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-kicks-off-its-politically-significant-annual-parliament-season-101614776603321.html
03-03-2021||World||Israel allocates $60 million to build first quantum computer||Israel is seeking to build its first quantum computer, joining a global race for one of the world’s most important emerging technologies.The Ministry of Defense and Innovation Authority are taking bids from multinational companies, Israeli businesses and universities for a 198 million-shekel ($60 million) project to build a computer with 30 to 40 qubits, according to Aviv Zeevi, vice president at the Authority’s Technological Infrastructure Division. He expects the winner of the tender to begin work before the end of the year.“We want to be in the game,” Zeevi said. “We need to be at least at a reasonable level to be able to develop” varying kinds of hardware and software associated with quantum computers.Rather than storing information in binary 0s or 1s, like classical computers, a quantum computer’s qubits can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously, which translates into an exponential edge in computing power. In 2019, Google said that its quantum computer solved a problem in minutes that would take the fastest supercomputer about 10,000 years.The new project is part of Israel’s 1.25 billion shekel national initiative to build up quantum proficiency. While scientists say practical, widespread applications for quantum computers are still years away, countries like China, the U.S. and Germany are devoting large sums to figure out how to master this technology.Israel is a tech powerhouse that’s home to several dozen so-called unicorns, or privately owned tech firms worth over $1 billion. But there are only a handful of quantum computing startups, such as the software firm Classiq Technologies and Quantum Machines, which develops hardware and software for quantum computers.The government initiative “is a massive first step,” said Itamar Sivan, chief executive officer of Quantum Machines. “Our hope is that with continued investments we can grow the burgeoning quantum ecosystem here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-allocates-60-million-to-build-first-quantum-computer-101614776339811.html

Pyongyang does not recognise the U.N. investigator's mandate and has previously rejected U.N. allegations of crimes against humanity committed by the state.Reduced trade with China has led to a significant decrease in market activities, reducing earnings for many families reliant on small-scale market activities, Ojea Quintana said."There have been shortages of essential goods, medicines, agricultural inputs for farming and raw materials for state-owned factories," he said, voicing concern that typhoons and floods last year could lead to a "serious food crisis"."Deaths by starvation have been reported, as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them."Humanitarian operations have nearly ground to a halt and only three international aid workers remain in North Korea while relief goods have been stuck at the Chinese border for months due to import restrictions, he said.North Korea is to receive 1.7 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via the COVAX facility by the end of May, allocation figures from the GAVI vaccine alliance and World Health Organization (WHO) showed on Tuesday.Ojea Quintana urged Pyongyang to grant full access for medical and aid workers involved in Covid-19 vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-measures-to-stem-covid-19-worsen-abuses-hunger-says-un-expert-101614773920892.html
03-03-2021||World||India led the world in internet shutdowns in 2020: Report||India led the world last year in internet shutdowns that affected hundreds of millions of people, as governments cracked down on political rivals and tried to suppress protests.At least 155 internet shutdowns in 2020 disrupted access for people in 29 countries, according to a report on Wednesday from digital rights group Access Now. That included 28 full internet blackouts that plunged people and in some cases entire cities, into “digital darkness,” the report said. Most recorded incidents took place in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.“The pandemic has forced offline activities online. So when governments intentionally disrupt internet access it denies people the opportunities to continue their education, businesses, and access life-saving information about the pandemic,” said Access Now campaigner Felicia Anthonio.The digital rights campaign says governments in 2020 increasingly used shutdowns in response to ongoing violence, especially in conflict zones. Other trends in recent years include efforts to hide political instability, thwart protests and suppress dissent, it said.India RecordIndia consistently restricts access more than any other country, accounting for the lion’s share in 2020 with at least 109 disruptions, according to the report. The next highest was Yemen with six shutdowns. Indian authorities cut off access and throttled bandwidth to quell demonstrations in recent years, including protests over a controversial citizenship law after it revoked the special autonomous status of Kashmir. Most recently, tens of thousands of protesting farmers blocked highways in defiance of the government’s decision to restrict phone and Internet access.India’s Supreme Court in January ruled that indefinite internet shutdowns in Kashmir were illegal following a legal challenge from civil society groups. The government has argued shutdowns were necessary to prevent disorder, curb fake news and hate speech.Authorities in Ethiopia imposed at least four full outages, including a nationwide shutdown that lasted more than two weeks and affected more than 100 million people, the report said. A mobile network disruption in Myanmar’s Rakhine and Chin states lasted 19 months. Following a coup in February 2021, Myanmar’s junta restored access in the region, but has since ordered new blackouts as it seeks to quell protests.High CostsDisruptions overall fell last year to 155 from 213 in 2019, reversing recent trends, the Access Now report said.But major disruptions in 2020 lasted 49% longer compared with the year before, according to digital privacy and security research group Top10VPN. They cost the world economy $4 billion, nearly three quarters of which was incurred by India alone, it said.“Internet shutdowns violate human rights and they are being used against marginalized groups around the world,” said Anthonio. “Switching off the internet means a total disruption of daily activities, their rights and their lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-led-the-world-in-internet-shutdowns-in-2020-report-101614772298279.html

This to us was incredible.”The variant, identified in South Africa late last year, has taken over as the dominant strain in the nation of 60 million people and has spread to 48 other countries. Initial evidence suggests it’s 50% more transmissible than the original virus and has led to countries including the UK banning flights from South Africa.Much of the research was done by Krisp, a genetic-sequencing institute in Durban, South Africa. The research did show that antibodies generated in reaction to infections with the original virus were as much as 48% less effective against the new variant, according to data presented on the webinar.“This is indeed good news for all of us,” South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said.A small trial of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine indicated that it had limited effect on preventing mild disease from infection with the 501Y.V2 variant, leading the government to switch to Johnson & Johnson’s shot for its initial vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-variant-found-in-south-africa-paves-way-for-better-vaccines-101614771874226.html

03-03-2021||World||Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates bet on electric motor startup||As much as half of the world’s electricity is consumed by motors. They power everything from fans to electric cars and pumps to industrial machinery. Making them more efficient could go a long way in reducing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.That’s the promise of California-based startup Turntide Technologies Inc., which has commercialized a new type of electric motor. The company said on Wednesday it has raised $80 million from investors including a fund led by Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates, Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr., and co-creator of the iPhone Tony Fadell. Electric motors convert electricity into motion by using electromagnets to generate magnetic fields that turn a rotor around a shaft. That simple turning motion, depending on the size of the motor, can blow fallen leaves or bend sheets of metal.But in conventional motors, much of the magnetic field is wasted and doesn’t contribute to turning the rotor. Turntide has found a way to try and maximize that conversion by turning the magnets inside the motor on and off as often as 20,000 times a second. When the process works correctly, the motor can produce the same amount of work with up to 30% less electricity. The design of the motor dates back to 1838, said Turntide Chief Executive Officer Ryan Morris. But the fine control needed to run it efficiently had to wait until computer chips got cheap enough to run the programs.That’s what Downey likes about the technology, beyond its ability to cut emissions. “They figured out how to use a 19th century technology and use software to make it do what it always had the potential to do,” he said in an interview.Morris describes the product as “software wrapped in metal.” That’s why the company is able to outsource the manufacturing to India, China and Taiwan, but still control the intellectual property needed to run the motor efficiently.Turntide is currently focused on a niche market. It replaces the old electric motors in ventilation systems in large buildings. The cost savings from reduced electricity use means it can promise a return on investment in as little as three years. By the end of 2020, Turntide had replaced 5,000 such motors and aims to do 50,000 this year.Next, Turntide is exploring the application of its motors in pumps and compressors. Ultimately, the company’s biggest market is likely to be electric cars, though achieving the performance that electric motors in cars demand will take a few years of development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-downey-jr-and-bill-gates-bet-on-electric-motor-startup-101614770923730.html

Hartig, the museum’s director. “His humanitarianism and dedication truly exemplify what it means to be a Great American."The museum asked Fauci to contribute a personal artifact to mark the pandemic, and he chose the lumpy blue and orange ball that he used to explain the complexities of the virus in dozens of interviews.The model was made with a 3D printer and shows what the Smithsonian’s announcement calls “the various components of the SARS-CoV-2 virion (the complete, infectious form of the virus), including the spike protein.”Fauci showed off his new medal in a video call Tuesday night, calling it “an extraordinary and humbling” honor.“This has been a terrible year in so many respects,” he said. “Decades from now, people will be talking about the experience that we went through.”Fauci, 80, is the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. After serving as the beleaguered and frequently sidelined face of the Trump administration's Covid response, Fauci was retained as a senior adviser to President Joe Biden.The Great Americans Medal was founded in 2016. Previous honorees include former secretaries of state Madeleine K. Albright and Gen. Colin L. Powell, tennis star Billie Jean King and musician Paul Simon.Fauci received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian award, in 2008 from then-President George W. Bush for his decades of work, dating back to the earliest days of the AIDS crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-presents-his-personal-3d-model-of-covid-19-virus-to-smithsonian-101614768886690.html

The infection has so far killed more than 43,000 people in Texas.This was announced by Texas governor Greg Abbott said Tuesday despite a urgent warning to states from federal health officials to not let their guard down, saying the pandemic is far from over. The repeal will take effect from March 10, announced Abbott.The enforcement of the mask mandate was patchy, and some sheriffs refused to police the restrictions at all. There were reports that authorities only warned the violators verbally, or left informational flyers.The opponents of the mask mandate said that wearing them infringed upon their rights, like making personal judgements about what represented an acceptable risk to self. Other said it infringed on constitutional rights."I believe in our constitutional rights, and this is borderline infringing on some of those constitutional rights in my belief," Jason Bridges, a sheriff in Nacogdoches County, Texas, was heard saying in a Facebook video which had become widely popular on social media.Meanwhile, restaurant owners are discussing whether they, too, would relax Covid-19 safeguards in their dining rooms that were already allowed to be almost fully open after Abbott's latest order. School administrators are also scrambling to figure out the ramifications for the state's 5 million public school students.At Bob’s Steak & Chop House in Dallas, founder Bob Sambol welcomed the ability to make decisions for his own restaurant again, even though he has not decided what approach he'll take. “I have a week, thank God," Sambol said.Texas is fully reopening just ahead of the spring break holiday, which health experts worry could lead to more spread.Abbott’s rollbacks come just as the US is picking up the pace of vaccinating people. In Texas, 7.1 per cent of its nearly 30 million residents have been fully vaccinated, according to state data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mask-mandate-implementation-was-patchy-in-texas-now-locals-concerned-101614769002366.html
03-03-2021||World||London mayor Sadiq Khan tightens emission rules, buses stare at heavy fines||The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has tightened the city-wide Low Emission Zone (LEZ) rules, which means that heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), buses and coaches that fail to meet emissions standards will be hit with a daily charge of up to 300 pounds.The new standards, Euro VI (NOx and PM), apply to heavy vehicles across most of Greater London and match the emission standards of the central London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ).The LEZ, which operates 24 hours a day and every day of the year from this week, was set up to encourage the most polluting heavy diesel vehicles driving in the UK capital to become cleaner.“Toxic air pollution causes long-lasting harm and is a national public health crisis. In London it contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. There is also evidence linking air pollution with an increased vulnerability to the most severe impacts of COVID-19,” said Khan.“I've moved fast in London to implement the most ambitious plans to tackle air pollution of any major city in the world – showing what we can achieve if we are brave enough,” he said.The date for enforcement of the tougher standards was delayed from October 2020 in the face of the pandemic and its impact on supply chains using such vehicles.New data from City Hall, the Mayor’s office, shows compliance with the new standards is nearly at 90 per cent, compared to around 70 per cent in May 2019.Earlier this year, Transport for London (TfL) announced that their entire 9,000-strong core bus fleet complies with the LEZ standards, and now meets or exceeds the cleanest Euro VI emissions standards.Alex Williams, TfL’s Director of City Planning, said, “Toxic air in London is a blight on the city and we need to take bold action to clean it up. The introduction of these tighter standards for heavy vehicles and the expansion of the ULEZ will significantly reduce harmful emissions within the M25.“We have been working closely with the freight industry to prepare them for the launch of a stronger Low Emission Zone. They have responded magnificently, showing their commitment to a green recovery, with the vast majority now meeting these world-leading environmental requirements.”The introduction of tougher standards for the LEZ, alongside the planned expansion of London’s ULEZ later this year, is expected to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from road transport by around 30 per cent across London in 2021.City Hall says it will help deliver wider benefits for London, including preventing more than 1 million air pollution related hospital admissions over the next 30 years, saving the National Health Service (NHS) around 5 billion pounds.The latest in a series of reports evaluating the impact of the central London ULEZ shows that, even throughout the pandemic, compliance standards remained high.Compliance with the ULEZ at the end of December 2020 was more than 90 per cent for cars and 85 per cent for all vehicle types. This compares to 39 per cent compliance in February 2017 when the T-charge, the precursor to the ULEZ, was announced by the Mayor of London, and Londoners started preparing for the ULEZ.The report also shows that the scale of reduction in NO2 in central London in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic was similar to the reduction driven by the city's air quality programme between 2017 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-tightens-emission-rules-buses-stare-at-heavy-fines-101614768650503.html

Francis will visit the former Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, where churches still bear the signs of conflict."The people of Iraq are waiting for us. They were waiting for St. Pope John Paul II, who was not allowed to go. The people cannot be let down for a second time. Let us pray that this trip can be carried out well," he said.Francis will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham, who is revered by Christians, Moslems and Jews, and meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, 90."In the land of Abraham, together with other religious leaders, we also will take another step forward in fraternity among believers," Francis said.Al-Sistani is one of the most important figures in Shi'ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond. He commands a vast following among Iraq's Shi'ite majority and huge influence over politics and public opinion.About 10,000 security forces will be deployed to protect the pope, who will mostly likely be travelling in armoured vehicles.The number of people who will be able to see him has been severely limited because of coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-says-he-must-go-to-iraq-because-people-cannot-be-let-down-101614768295421.html

KiliAvo has challenged that in Kenya's environmental tribunal, where the case is pending, according to CM Advocates LLP, the law firm representing them.The agency's acting director general Mamo Mamo told Reuters it initially approved the EIA because of the project's endorsement by the Amboseli Ecosystem Trust, a coalition that includes community groups and government representatives, but changed its position when the Trust withdrew approval.Fruit Exports V Tourist CashWith ideal conditions for growing the fruit, Kenya's avocado export revenues surged 33% to 14 billion Kenyan shillings (about $127 million) in the year to October 2020, government data shows.As impressive as that growth rate is, such money pales in comparison to tourism, which raked in $1.6 billion in 2019. Squeezing the elephants could hit their population, conservationists say, harming a national heritage and also prejudicing the tourism trade so many people depend on."We can’t just say to the elephants: 'Would you mind not going that way because we have decided that we are going to do stuff here?'" said Vicki Fishlock, a scientist working for the Amboseli Elephant Trust group."Blockage of the corridor would surely kill the sanctuary as it depends on the animals migrating from Amboseli," added Samuel Kaanki, who chairs an association of 342 Maasai owning 20,500 acres where elephants browse, breed and migrate.He said the elephants, if blocked by farms like KiliAvo's or others, would seek alternative routes: "This would ... result in massive human-wildlife conflicts."KiliAvo's lawyers said the farm was actually 17 km (11 miles) away from Amboseli in an area designated for farming. Further, the company had employed 300 local residents, provided training and technology, proposed improving fresh water facilities and helped renovate a school, CM Advocates LLP said."Our Client continues to be the victim of constant and relentless harassment and mischaracterization of their project for ulterior motives," it said in an email to Reuters. "Our Client is actually a victim of witch-hunt and opportunism."Another conservation group, Big Life Foundation, has footage from October of four gazelles apparently stuck on one side of the fence, trying to get through. It also said the fence was damaged at least three times last month by elephants."If they are trapped in one place, populations will collapse," said Ernest Lenkoina, human-elephant conflict mitigation project manager at Big Life. "In the end, both the Maasai way of life here and the sight of elephants browsing beneath Mount Kilimanjaro could be gone forever."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avocados-threaten-to-usher-in-massive-human-wildlife-conflicts-in-kenya-101614766404682.html

Significant pressure was exerted on foreign journalists and sources seeking to report on the pandemic itself," the report said.In some cases, Chinese officials gave journalists a choice: Leave instantly or be quarantined for at least 14 days. In other cases, journalists were forced to take repeated Covid-19 tests, a delay tactic to prevent them from working.The respondents described exchanges during this approval process in which Chinese authorities hinted that permission to return hinged on more favourable coverage of China. The press group further said the Chinese government propaganda is claiming that the coronavirus originated abroad and was brought into China."As a result, fears that foreigners pose dangerous health risks have subjected correspondents to growing xenophobia, making it more challenging for them to live and work in China," the report added.Furthermore, the introduction of mandatory coronavirus checkpoints and contact tracing apps has created more opportunities for Chinese authorities to gather data on foreign journalists and their sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-using-covid-19-pandemic-to-increase-restrictions-for-foreign-journalists-101614765993849.html

So, they asked Musk if this new city will incorporate the Boca Chica Village area, where his company is building its futuristic deep-space rocket."An area much larger than Boca Chica," Musk said replying to the Twitter user.An area much larger than Boca ChicaSome people in Texas say the move is part of Musk's plan to change the name of Boca Chica, the area near the Mexican border where SpaceX’s new Starship prototypes dominate the seaside skyline.“Sending a tweet doesn’t make it so,” Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. “They have a lot of hoops and hurdles to go through before they can make it so,” he added.Trevino also said that a SpaceX representative made a “casual inquiry” recently about requirements to incorporate Boca Chica and rename it the City of Starbase.Musk has chosen Texas for his ambitious plan to build rockets to make human space travel more affordable and routine. But SpaceX has been trying to fix the issues which led to two failed rocket launches in recent months.Starship SN9 rocket, the company's latest attempt to go into deep space, exploded during a landing attempt minutes after a high-altitude experimental launch from Boca Chica.

Recorded Future calls the group RedEcho and says it had targeted as many as 10 entities under India’s power grid as well as two maritime ports when the company first notified India’s Computer Emergency Response Team on Feb. 10. Most of these connections were still operational as recently as Feb. 28, Solomon said.“There’s still an active connection between the attacker and the attackee,” Solomon said, referring to the port. “It’s still happening.”A spokesman for India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology wasn’t immediately available for comment. “Without any proof, slandering a specific side is irresponsible behavior and an ill-intentioned one,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in Beijing on Wednesday.The intrusions into India’s critical infrastructure have been occurring since at least the middle of last year, according to Recorded Future, which tracks back to the start of a bloody skirmish between Indian and Chinese soldiers at a border post in the Himalayas.Since then, authorities across India’s federal and state governments have been bickering about whether a cyberattack was responsible for the October collapse of the power grid that supplies Mumbai, an outage that brought the financial hub to a halt for several hours, impacting stock markets, transport networks and thousands of households.Watch | ‘Yes, it’s possible’: Cyber security expert on China hand in Mumbai outageRecorded Future, a privately held cybersecurity firm based near Boston that tracks malicious activity by nation-state actors, hasn’t made any connection or assertion between the traffic observed under RedEcho and the Mumbai outage. But, Solomon said, “it’s not unusual to see this type of technique used by nation states as an instrument of national power.”“This could be as simple as trying to drive influence operations to be able to signal either to the people or the government that at any given time they have leverage that can be used against them,” he added.Indian federal officials have denied that any cyberattack has occurred, but say malware was found. The National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre emailed the central Power System Operation Corp. about the threat from RedEcho on Feb. 12, the Power Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. Dispatch center employees shut down control functions that allow circuit breakers to be operated remotely. They changed user credentials and isolated vulnerable equipment.Investigators from Maharashtra state, which houses Mumbai, are due to present their findings to local lawmakers on Wednesday.Regarding the Mumbai power outage of Oct. 12, initial information suggested 14 Trojan Horses, that is malicious code, and 8 gigabyte of unaccounted foreign data could have been transferred to the main electricity board, Anil Deshmukh, Maharashtra state’s home minister, said in a briefing on Monday. He added that black-listed IP addresses had tried to log-in to the board’s servers. He didn’t attribute the attack to any country or entity.The 10 entities RedEcho infiltrated account for nearly 80% of India’s land mass from an electricity-coverage perspective, Solomon said. The intrusions could have remained unexposed and undetected until they were needed as leverage, he said.“If it was meant to take down the lights, it would have taken down the lights,” Solomon said. “It didn’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-hackers-still-actively-targeting-indian-port-in-shadow-war-says-us-firm-101614766351260.html

The country remains closed to non-resident foreigners.A Reuters poll published last month showed nearly two-thirds of Japanese companies also oppose holding the Games as planned, swinging from the previous survey showing most in favour.Japan has so far confirmed 431,250 coronavirus cases and 7,931 deaths as of Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-plans-to-ban-olympic-spectators-from-abroad-over-covid-19-fears-report-101614764909705.html

The aviation sector has been hit hard due to the travel restrictions imposed by governments around the world to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), prompting airlines to devise different strategies to tackle the challenges.Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) on Monday released preliminary traffic figures for January 2021 that showed the airline operations were “still depressed” as the spread of coronavirus variants resulted in tighter border restrictions. AAPA said that Asia Pacific airlines carried a combined total of 1.3 million passengers in January, which was less than 4 per cent of January 2020 numbers.“The industry is working with several stakeholders to prepare the ground for the sustained resumption of air travel, notably on contactless digitalized tools and passenger facilitation protocols to ensure a safe and seamless journey for travelers,” AAPA director general Subhas Menon said in a statement.Read | IndiGo flight to Lucknow makes emergency landing at Karachi airport as flyer takes illIn an attempt to boost domestic travel, the Australian flag carrier has now announced three mystery flights, each from different cities, that will take the travellers to a destination not known to them beforehand.

Niamrin found the vomit while taking a stroll along the beach after a rainstorm, washed up on the coast of Nakhon Si Thammarat province in southern Thailand.When Niamrin inspected the mass, she found that it smelled like fish. Unaware of what the mass was, she brought it back home with her. After speaking to her neighbors, she discovered that the oval-shaped mass was whale vomit which is also called ‘ambergris’.Niamrin’s neighbor then informed her that the smell emanating from the almost 15lb weighing mass could indicate that it’s a genuine piece of ambergris, hence, to check its authenticity, they held a naked flame to the 12 inches wide and 24 inches long mass which caused it to melt and then harden again after cooling down.Now, Niamrin is waiting for experts to visit her house to confirm whether the ambergris is genuine or not.According to a report in Daily Mail, Niamrin said that if the mass turns out to be genuine ambergris, she would help her community with the money she gets.Ambergris, the treasure of the seaAmbergris, a solid waxy substance which originates in the intestine of the sperm whale, is used for medicines and potions and as a spice in eastern cultures. In western cultures, the same substance is used to stabilize the scent of fine perfumes. Ambergris often floats and washes ashore on the coasts of China, Japan, Africa, and the Americas and on tropical islands such as the Bahamas. Fresh ambergris is black and soft and has an unpleasant odour. When it is exposed to sun, air, or seawater, this substance hardens and changes colour, fading to light gray or yellow and in this process develops a pleasant fragrance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lucky-haul-thai-woman-finds-lump-of-whale-vomit-worth-over-250000-101614764260339.html
03-03-2021||World||US president Biden vows enough Covid-19 vaccines for all US adults by May-end||President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the US expects to take delivery of enough coronavirus vaccines for all adults by the end of May, two months earlier than anticipated, as his administration announced that drugmaker Merck & Co. will help produce rival Johnson & Johnson's newly approved shot.With the bolstered supply, Biden also announced he would be using the powers of the federal government to direct all states to prioritize vaccinating teachers, and said the federal government would provide the doses directly through its pharmacy program.He challenged states to administer at least one dose of the vaccine to all educators by the end of March as part of his administration's efforts to reopen more schools across the nation."We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May," said Biden, who likened the partnership between the two drug companies to the spirit of national cooperation during World War II.Biden's twin announcements quickly raised expectations for when the nation could safely emerge from the pandemic with the promise of additional vaccines, but it highlighted the looming challenge facing the nation: successfully putting those doses into arms.Even as he expressed optimism, Biden quickly tempered the outlook for a return to life as it was before the virus hit."I've been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don't know for sure," Biden said, before saying his hope was sometime before "this time next year."Biden's speech was set against the backdrop of states across the country moving to relax virus-related restrictions. This comes despite the objections of the White House and the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who have raised alarm about new variants of the virus and pleaded against any relaxation of virus protocols until more Americans are vaccinated.In Texas, GOP Governor Greg Abbot moved to lift his state's mask-wearing mandate and a host of other limitations. Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer eased capacity limits on restaurants and both public and residential gatherings.Fauci has previously said the nation must achieve a vaccination rate of about 80 per cent to reach "herd immunity." Only about 8 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the pace of vaccination has been increasing, with the US setting a new daily record for injections on both Thursday and Friday of last week.In hopes of increasing vaccinations even further, the Biden administration told governors to make preparations to administer even more doses in the coming weeks.More shots are also heading toward the federally backed program to administer doses in retail pharmacies, which federal officials believe can double or triple their pace of vaccination. More than 800,000 doses of the J&J vaccine will also be distributed this week to pharmacies, on top of the 2.4 million they are now getting of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine supply.Those pharmacies will be key in getting the vaccines into the arms of teachers — particularly in the roughly 20 states where they have not been prioritized for shots — which will help reopen schools to better educate students who have been at risk of falling behind during the pandemic and reduce the burden on parents who have had to choose between childcare and a job."Let's treat in-person learning as the essential service that it is," Biden said. Teachers will be able to sign up directly through the participating retail pharmacies in their local area, the administration said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki also announced Tuesday that the federal government was increasing supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to states next week to 15.2 million doses per week, up from 14.5 million previously. States will also receive 2.8 million doses of the J&J shot this week.On a call with governors Tuesday, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said states should prepare for administering 16-17 million total weekly doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of March, climbing to 17-18 million weekly by early April. The supply of J&J doses to states, expected to dip after the initial shipment this week, will climb to 4-6 million weekly doses by the end of March and 5-6 million doses weekly through the end of April.Officials have said J&J faced unexpected production issues with its vaccine and produced only 3.9 million doses ahead of its receiving emergency use authorization on Saturday. The company has promised to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June.Before the approval of the J&J shot, Biden had suggested that it would take until the end of July to have enough vaccine for every adult in the US.Facing questions about the company's slipping delivery schedule, J&J Vice President Richard Nettles told lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week that the company had faced "significant challenges" because of its "highly complex" manufacturing process.The assistance from Merck was expected to help J&J meet its production commitments and expand supply even further, but the administration did not immediately provide specifics. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-vows-enough-covid-19-vaccines-for-all-us-adults-by-end-of-may-101614738807211.html

03-03-2021||World||Swiss to vote on banning face veils in referendum criticised as Islamophobic||"Stop Extremism!" urges a red billboard in a quiet village outside Zurich above an image of a scowling woman wearing a black headscarf and face veil.The billboard is part of a campaign by the far-right Swiss People's Party (SVP) to ban face coverings in public and which will be voted on in a binding national referendum on Sunday. Opinion polls suggest most Swiss will back it and the ban will become law."In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms," said Walter Wobmann, an SVP member of parliament and chairman of the referendum committee.The proposal predates the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seen all adults forced to don masks in many settings to prevent the spread of infection. It gathered the necessary support to trigger a referendum in 2017.It does not mention Islam directly, and also aims to stop violent street protesters and football hooligans wearing masks. Still, local politicians, media and campaigners have dubbed it the burqa ban.The proposal compounds Switzerland's tense relationship with Islam after citizens voted to ban building any new minarets in 2009. Two cantons already have local bans on face coverings.Wobmann said the vote was not against Islam itself, but added, "the facial covering is a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland."France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public.No one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates. Muslims make up 5.2% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people, with most having their roots in Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo.Swiss Muslims have said right-wing parties were using the vote to rally their supporters and demonise them and others have warned a ban could stoke wider divisions."The niqab is a blank sheet which allows people to project their fears onto it," said Andreas Tunger-Zanetti, manager of Lucerne University's Centre for Research on Religion."But ... you are very unlikely to meet someone on a Swiss street wearing one."He said a ban risked cementing Switzerland's image as anti-Islamic and could create resentment amongst some Muslims.Rifa'at Lenzin, 67, a Swiss Muslim woman, said she was totally against the ban, which was tackling a problem which didn't exist, in a country where Muslims were well integrated."Changing the constitution to tell people what they can and cannot wear is a very bad idea.. This is Switzerland, not Saudi Arabia.""We are Muslims but we are Swiss citizens who have grown up here too," Lenzin said. "This vote is simply racist and Islamophobic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-to-vote-on-banning-face-veils-in-referendum-criticised-as-islamophobic-101614762685280.html
03-03-2021||World||Nine killed as Myanmar police opens fire to disperse protests||Myanmar security forces shot and killed nine people during protests against the military coup on Wednesday, witnesses and media reported, a day after a regional diplomatic push to end the month-long crisis made little headway.Two people were killed during clashes at a protest in the country's second-biggest city Mandalay, a witness and media reports said, and one person was killed when police opened fire in the main city of Yangon, a witness there said.The Monywa Gazette reported five people were killed in that central town in police firing. One person was shot and killed in the central town of Myingyan, said student activist Moe Myint Hein, 25."They opened fire on us with live bullets. One was killed, he's young, a teenage boy, shot in the head," Moe Myint Hein, who was wounded in the leg, told Reuters by telephone.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.The violence came a day after foreign ministers from Southeast Asian neighbours urged restraint but failed to unite behind a call for the military to release ousted government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy.At least 30 people have been killed since the coup on Feb. 1, which ended Myanmar's tentative steps towards democratic rule, triggering nationwide protests and international dismay.The security forces also detained about 300 protesters as they broke up protests in Yangon, the Myanmar Now news agency reported. One activist said several protest leaders were among those taken away.Video posted on social media showed long lines of young men, hands on heads, filing into army trucks as police and soldiers stood guard. Reuters was not able to verify the footage.Protesters were also out in Chin State in the west, Kachin State in the north, Shan State in the northeast, the central region of Sagaing and the south, media and residents said."We're aiming to show that no one in this country wants dictatorship," Salai Lian, an activist in Chin State, told Reuters.'NO MORE WORDS'On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to make a breakthrough in a virtual foreign ministers' meeting on Myanmar.While united in a call for restraint, only four members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore - called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees."We expressed ASEAN's readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner," the ASEAN chair, Brunei, said in a statement.Myanmar's state media said the military-appointed foreign minister attended the ASEAN meeting that "exchanged views on regional and international issues", but made no mention of the focus on Myanmar's problems.It said Wunna Maung Lwin "apprised the meeting of voting irregularities" in November's election.The military justified the coup saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 elections were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second five-year term. The election commission said the vote was fair.Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has said the intervention was to protect Myanmar's fledgling democracy and has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday in an interview the coup was a "tragic" step back for Myanmar and the use of lethal force by its security forces was "disastrous".ASEAN's bid to find a way out of the crisis has drawn criticism from inside Myanmar, with concern it would legitimise the junta and not help the country."No more words, action," activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters in a message when asked about the ASEAN effort. She called for sanctions on businesses linked to the military.Tuesday evening's news bulletin on Myanmar state television said agitators were mobilising people on social media and forming "illegal organisations".Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.She is one of nearly 1,300 people who have been detained, according to activists, among them six journalists in Yangon, one of whom works for the Associated Press, which has called for his release.Ousted President Win Myint is facing two new charges, his lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said, including one for a breach of the constitution that is punishable by up to three years on prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nine-killed-as-myanmar-police-opens-fire-to-disperse-protests-101614762620437.html
03-03-2021||World||Beijing refutes allegations of sexual abuse made by Uyghur women: Report||As the number of Western lawmakers accusing China of genocide grows, Beijing is focusing on discrediting Uyghur witnesses behind the recent report of sexual abuse, reported FR24 News.Earlier in February, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) had reported on the abuses of women's rights in Xinjiang's 're-education camps' where women were subjected to sexual abuse, modern-day slavery and forced sterilization.To refute the report, during a regular daily press briefing last week, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin held up images of witnesses who described sexual abuse in Xinjiang.China also released explicit details about Uyghur women's fertility, sex and STDs as part of a campaign to combat global pressure on their treatment of the minority group, reported FR24 News.Chinese authorities named women, leaked what they say is private medical data and information about women's fertility, and accused some of having affairs and another of having a sexually transmitted disease.The campaign included briefings lasting several hours, with images of residents of Xinjiang and statements by family members refuting charges of sexual abuse.James Millward, professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University and expert on Xinjiang politics, said, "One of the reasons the Communist Party is so concerned about these testimonies from women is that it undermines the premise. Initial of what they are doing there, this is the fight against terrorism?""The fact that there are so many women in the camps... who don't have the slightest appearance of being violent people just shows how far it has nothing to do with terrorism," added Millward.In January, the Chinese Embassy's Twitter account was suspended for a tweet saying Uyghur women were "baby-making machines" before Beijing set up its camp system, reported FR24 News."The biological, reproductive, and gendered aspect of this is especially horrible to the world," said Millward. China "seems to have recognized this ... Now you see them trying to respond in this awkward way."Meanwhile, China declined to provide data on the number of people in the camps. Beijing had initially denied the very existence of the camps, but now claims that they are educational and vocational centers and that everyone has "graduated."Uyghurs make up most of the one million people who the UN estimates have been held in camps in Xinjiang as part of what the central government calls a campaign against terrorism.Also, Beijing has rejected calls for an independent UN investigation into Xinjiang's internment program. Journalists and diplomats are not allowed access to the camps outside of tightly controlled government tours.Joe Biden's administration has called China's treatment of Uyghurs genocide, a position recently adopted by Canada and the Netherlands.China faces sanctions such as a ban on US purchases of cotton and tomatoes from Xinjiang and calls from some Western lawmakers to boycott the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-refutes-allegations-of-sexual-abuse-made-by-uyghur-women-report-101614762483046.html
03-03-2021||World||EU months away from issuing vaccine passports for travel, memo shows||The European Union is still months away from issuing Covid-19 immunity certificates, raising the risk of another lost tourism season for the bloc’s aviation and hospitality industries.Technical work on a digital platform to authenticate travelers’ health status could take three to four months, according to a briefing note circulated to national delegations in Brussels on Tuesday. Beyond that, there are legal hurdles, the challenge of agreeing the scope of the program, and resolving thorny medical questions.The system being developed by the European Commission would confirm holders have recently tested negative, been fully vaccinated, or recovered from the coronavirus and are thus presumed to be immune.But EU member states are at loggerheads over the use of the “status certificates,” with tourism-dependent economies like Greece pushing for rapid introduction to allow for the return of travel and other activities like dining out, at least for a segment of the population. France and Belgium have resisted, citing concerns including privacy and fairness.Industry PainAirlines and hotels have also been clamoring to ease restrictions which have only been tightened over the past several months, even as vaccine rollouts progress. The International Air Transport Association last week said airlines could burn through $95 billion this year, double an earlier forecast, while passenger traffic could be limited to as little as one-third of pre-pandemic levels.“Testing, supported by digital apps and contact tracing, are all part of the solution,” Gloria Guevara, head of the World Travel & Tourism Council said last week. The group spans hotels and airlines, as well as airports, tour operators and companies like cruise lines, car rental services and travel agents.The EU has been working on technical aspects of the certificate with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization.The memo seen by Bloomberg is asking the bloc’s member states to provide feedback before the commission unveils a legislative proposal later this month. Among the issues that still need to be resolved is whether the certificates will be used to facilitate travel within the EU, and what it will mean for journeys from outside the bloc.Travel TensionOne risk for the EU is that tourism-dependent members would grow impatient and strike their own bilateral arrangements with outside countries, endangering unity. Last month, Greece and Israel reached a deal on mutual recognition of jabs. Greece is also in talks with the UK, the US, and Russia, “with various degrees of progress,” Greek Tourism Minister Harry Theoharis said last week.“Of course we hope the EU can work together as one and remove the need for bilateral discussions and agreements,” Theoharis said on a Bloomberg travel panel.The bloc also needs to establish a common approach to “proof of recovery” from Covid, according to the memo dated March 2. It’s unclear for how long a person who has survived the illness is immune to reinfection, and whether the body will be resistant to emerging variants of the virus.Vaccine RaceEU member states are racing to inoculate their populace and tame the spread of the pandemic before vaccine-resistant mutations take hold. But the rollout is lagging far behind the US and the UK.With the vast majority of the world’s population yet to be inoculated, and the virus still spreading and mutating, the bloc is preparing a “coordinated response in the event that a new variant of the virus would spread across Europe, especially if it were a vaccine-resistant variant.”The internal memo urges member states to “pre-agree on the range of emergency measures that may need to be taken in such a case, as regards testing, quarantine,” as well as travel restrictions.The commission is already working on agreements with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of the bloc’s member states, for the purchase of booster shots or new vaccines that will offer protection from emerging variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-months-away-from-issuing-vaccine-passports-for-travel-memo-shows-101614761828239.html

03-03-2021||World||Microsoft says China-linked group targets exchange email||Microsoft Corp. is urging customers to download software patches after state-sponsored hackers based in China broke into some customers’ copies of its software for email, contacts and calendar using multiple previously undiscovered flaws.The attackers used the vulnerabilities to hack into Microsoft Exchange Server, allowing them to break into email accounts and install malware to “facilitate long-term access to victim environments,” Microsoft said Tuesday.Microsoft released patches for the flaws in a blog post announcing the attack. “Microsoft has detected multiple 0-day exploits being used to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server in limited and targeted attacks,” the blog said.Previously undiscovered vulnerabilities are known as zero days, and they are valuable to hackers because there aren’t defenses against them -- at least until they are discovered and patches are created.“We are sharing this information with our customers and the security community to emphasize the critical nature of these vulnerabilities and the importance of patching all affected systems immediately,” the company said. It added that on-premise systems were affected but the online version of Exchange wasn’t.The hackers responsible are “a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China,” according to the blog. They typically target “entities in the United States across a number of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in a regular press briefing Wednesday in Beijing that conclusions on hacks into Microsoft servers should be based on complete evidence and avoid wanton accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-says-china-linked-group-targets-exchange-email-101614761776158.html
03-03-2021||World||Pakistan to enact legislation to fully implement FATF action plan: Report||Pakistan will have to enact additional laws to facilitate action by authorities to apprehend and prosecute people involved in terror financing in order to fully implement the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) action plan. This was decided at a meeting of senior officials chaired by Pakistan’s finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh to review anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing efforts in the aftermath of FATF’s plenary meeting last month. At the conclusion of the plenary meeting on February 25, FATF retained Pakistan in its “grey list” and asked the country to complete the action plan to counter terror financing before June, including steps to investigate and prosecute individuals and entities involved in such activities. Also Read | Terror financing watchdog keeps Pakistan on ‘grey list’FATF said Pakistan had “largely addressed” 24 of the 27 items in the action plan. However, FATF president Marcus Pleyer pointed out the deficiencies yet to be addressed are all “serious” as they relate to terror financing. During the meeting of Pakistan’s National Executive Committee (NEC) on anti-money laundering chaired by Shaikh on Monday, it was decided that additional legislation will have to be enacted on at least two counts to implement FATF’s action plan by June, the Dawn newspaper reported. The additional legislation has to “cover some weaknesses in the existing framework that limited the authorities from taking action, including imposing sanction or apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them”, the report said. The Dawn quoted its sources as saying that the meeting was informed reasonable progress had been made on one of the three remaining items in the FATF action plan “but two areas that required additional legislation would be time consuming”. The Pakistan government will also have to submit an updated report within 30 days to FATF on progress in legislation and other steps to be taken to address outstanding concerns. The meeting concluded there shouldn’t be any hurdle in making two more legal amendments, the report said. Shaikh asked the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and chairman of the FATF coordination committee, industries minister Hammad Azhar, to finalise the timelines for the additional legislation in consultation with the federal government and armed forces. “The strict adherence to timelines would culminate into successful completion of the FATF action plan,” Shaikh was quoted as saying in an official statement. A statement issued by FATF at the conclusion of its plenary meeting had said the outstanding actions for Pakistan include demonstrating that terror financing investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf of the designated terrorists, showing that prosecutions result in “effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions”, and demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-enact-legislation-to-fully-implement-fatf-action-plan-report-101614761312203.html
03-03-2021||World||Biden’s Covid-19 mask mandate faces a new challenge. Now from ‘red’ state Texas||Texas governor Greg Abbott announced on Tuesday that the state is lifting its mask mandate. This makes Texas the largest state that no longer requires the mask mandate, which was put in place by President Joe Biden's in the first two days in office.“Removing statewide mandates does not end personal responsibility. It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed,” Abbott said in a statement from Lubbock while rescinding statewide face mask orders. The repeal will come into effect from March 10. This also means that Texas is fully reopening just ahead of the spring break holiday, which health experts worry could lead to more spread of Covid-19.But governor Abbott justified the move saying that Texas has seen the number of cases and deaths plunge. Hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since October, and the seven-day rolling average of positive tests has dropped to about 7,600 cases, down from more than 10,000 in mid-February. But experts worry, as only 7.1 per cent of nearly 30 million residents of the state have been fully vaccinated, according to data reported by the state to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Read more: Texas utility files for bankruptcy after $2.1 billion power billWhat is the mask mandate?The mask mandate came into effect on February 1 after the CDC ordered that masks be worn while using any form of public transportation or while inside any transportation hub. Although the executive order that was passed by President Biden with respect to the masks said that masking is compulsory, it is still up to state governments to impose broader mask mandates or even reduce them.What is the politics behind the move?Abbott, a Republican, has faced sustained criticism from his party in America’s biggest red state over the statewide mask mandate. Thus, the move is a direct challenge to Biden’s mask mandate. But Abbott said that the state needs to reopen to ensure that businesses are open and employment is generated.Read more: 'Who is at fault?' Investigation into Texas blackout begins"For nearly half a year, most businesses have been open either 75 percent or 50 percent and during that time, too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities…. This must end. It is now time to open Texas 100 per cent. Every business that wants to be open should be open,” Abbott said.What about other states?Texas joins four states which have already lifted the mask mandates: Montana, Iowa, North Dakota and Mississippi. Currently, thirty-five state governments require people to wear masks in public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-covid-19-mask-mandate-faces-a-new-challenge-now-from-red-state-texas-101614759868211.html
03-03-2021||World||Hong Kong makes 100th pro-democracy arrest under national security law||Hong Kong has made its 100th arrest under a national security law imposed on the former British colony by China last year, while dozens of pro-democracy activists return to court for a mass bail hearing before their trial on subversion charges.Former Next Digital Ltd. Executive Director Stephen Ting was detained on fraud allegations, the Oriental Daily newspaper reported, citing people it didn’t identify. Police issued a statement late Tuesday confirming the arrest of a 61-year-old man “after in-depth investigation by national security department.” Police didn’t name the person or his affiliation with Next Digital.As of Tuesday, 100 people have been arrested on suspicion of activities harming national security, police said in a separate statement Wednesday. The accused include 83 male suspects and 17 female suspects, ages 16 to 79, police said.One of the most high-profile operations under the security law involved the arrest of 55 opposition figures in January. They were rounded up for taking part in an unofficial primary election and accused of trying to gain a majority in the legislature to paralyze the government.Some 47 of those people are attending a third day of arraignment hearings to decide whether they will receive bail before their subversion trial. The defendants include some of the city’s most prominent activists such as Joshua Wong, Benny Tai and Jimmy Sham, and most have objected to government requests to keep them in jail while also delaying further proceedings until at least May 31.Also read: China's electoral reform 'earthquake' set to upend Hong Kong politicsThe case comes before an annual meeting of China’s legislature opens in Beijing on Friday, with senior officials calling for lawmakers to overhaul the former British colony’s election system to further diminish the influence of pro-democracy politicians. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam plans to travel to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the National People’s Congress.Before the hearing started Wednesday, the owner of a local diner brought food and drinks to supporters of the defendants outside the courthouse. “I want to support the people here,” said Cheong Wong. “This is the least I can do.”Amnesty International Hong Kong was critical of Monday’s hearing, which started at 11 a.m. and ended about 3 a.m. the following day when one defendant fainted. Three others went to the hospital after saying they felt unwell, local media reported.An extended hearing “along with insufficient time to rest could potentially violate the right to a fair trial, and such a violation could warrant legitimate grounds for an appeal,” said Lam Cho Ming, a program manager at the human rights group. “Fair trial rights demand that there must be adequate time and facilities to prepare the defense.”More than four-fifths of people arrested since the law’s enactment have been accused of participating in some form of political activity, such as displaying banners, posting in support of the city’s independence on social media or organizing primary elections for legislative seats. Some suspects have been arrested more than once. Only one previous arrest involved an allegation of violence.“The early arrests have inevitably focused on low-hanging fruit,” said Bing Ling, a professor of Chinese law at the University of Sydney. Public expressions of anti-China sentiment are easier to prove in court and detaining high-profile individuals has a bigger deterrent effect, he said.The law granted broad new powers to authorities to stifle opposition opinion and deter protests, such as the large and sometimes violent demonstrations that shook the Asian financial hub in 2019. Lawyers, activists and Western governments have criticized the legislation for its broadly defined provisions, which bar terrorism, secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces.Lam, the city’s Beijing-appointed chief executive, has credited the law with restoring stability to the Asian financial center. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have said since it was announced that it targeted “extremely few” people suspected of endangering the country’s security. In June, the Hong Kong government said in a statement to Bloomberg News that it would be “irresponsible and scaremongering” to say that the law would provide the government sweeping powers to jail or disqualify opposition figures.So far, prosecutors have brought charges against 56 of those arrested by police. One of the most prominent is Next Digital founder Jimmy Lai, who has been denied bail while awaiting trial on charges he colluded with foreign powers to impose sanctions or engage in hostile activities against Hong Kong or China. He also faces a fraud charge.The collusion charges are based on Lai’s social media posts and comments to foreign media outlets, and on donations police say his company made to an advocacy group, according to court filings and local media reports citing police documents. Lai denies the allegations.The 47 opposition figures are being prosecuted over their roles in helping organize a primary that drew more than 600,000 voters in July last year to choose candidates for Legislative Council elections that were later postponed. Authorities say the primary and plans to force the resignation of Carrie Lam using a provision of the mini-constitution were an illegal attempt to paralyze the government.The efforts by authorities to rein in opposition appear set to continue, even though protests have mostly ended. In January, Secretary for Security John Lee said the government would strengthen intelligence gathering because behavior that endangered national security may be “driven underground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-makes-100th-pro-democracy-arrest-under-national-security-law-101614755229759.html
03-03-2021||World||Australia building world's first platypus sanctuary to promote breeding and rehabilitation||Australian conservationists on Wednesday unveiled plans to build the world's first refuge for the platypus, to promote breeding and rehabilitation as the duck-billed mammal faces extinction due to climate change.The Taronga Conservation Society Australia and the New South Wales State government said they would build the specialist facility, mostly ponds and burrows for the semiaquatic creatures, at a zoo 391 km (243 miles) from Sydney, by 2022, which could house up to 65 platypuses."There is so much to learn about the platypus and we know so little," Taronga CEO Cameron Kerr told reporters."These facilities will be critical in building our knowledge so that we don't let this iconic creature slip off the earth."Concerns about the platypus going extinct have been heightened since once-in-a-generation wildfires devastated 12.6 million hectares (31 million acres) of bush, nearly the size of Greece, in late 2019 and early 2020.Scientists estimate nearly three billion animals died in what the prime minister called the country's "black summer". A government inquiry found bushfires would likely occur more often because of warming temperatures.Unlike other famous Australian animals such as the koala or kangaroo, the beaver-like platypus is rarely seen in the wild due to its reclusive nature and highly specific habitat needs.The furry, web-footed animal, along with the echnidna, is one of just two egg-laying mammals, and generally lives around small streams and slow-moving rivers in cooler temperatures."The refuge ... will give us a chance to really learn about what sort of environments they like, and what is most likely to encourage them to breed," said Kerr.The 2019-20 bushfires followed several years of drought, and Taronga had noted beforehand an increased number of platypuses with "climate-related injuries and illnesses", it said in a statement.Last year, a separate inquiry found that koalas would be extinct in New South Wales by 2050, due to deforestation for farming and urban development.The platypus is classified as a protected species in Australia, and Taronga said that without intervention, the animal may follow a few decades later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-building-world-s-first-platypus-sanctuary-to-promote-breeding-and-rehabilitation-101614758729007.html

Hairdressers and some schools have reopened in recent days.The tally of infections rose by 9,019 to 2,460,030 on Wednesday, an increase of more than 1,000 over last week, while the death toll rose by 418 to 70,881.However, the number of cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days fell slightly, to 64 from 65.8 on Tuesday.Also read: Ahead of Easter holidays, Germany drafts plans to start easing Covid-19 lockdownThe latest draft plans obtained by Reuters provide for a tighter lockdown to be re-imposed if the number of cases rises above 100 per 100,000.The government had targeted 50 cases per 100,000 before easing the lockdown, but was pressed to relax that as the national figure stagnated above 60, while deaths and the numbers of patients in intensive care fell.However, Gernot Marx, head of the German association for intensive care and emergency medicine, continued to urge caution:"It is important that we hold out for another three weeks because, by vaccinating many people, we can significantly flatten out a third wave, despite the virus mutations," he told the Augsburger Allgemeine daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-merkel-set-to-agree-to-cautious-easing-of-covid-19-lockdown-101614755200736.html

The agency earlier said it will provide compensation of over 430 million won ($383,466) for deaths from the Covid-19 vaccine."KDCA is conducting epidemiological surveys with relevant local authorities... to confirm any link with inoculation," said Jeong.An AstraZeneca spokeswoman in Seoul said the company had no comment.Jeong noted that there were no cases of fatalities from receiving Covid-19 vaccines developed by AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech.

03-03-2021||World||Sweden's capital Stockholm hit by 100% spike in Covid-19 cases in just 3 weeks||In Sweden’s capital, the rate of coronavirus infections just doubled over the past three weeks, making a third wave seem almost inevitable.The surge in new cases follows a warning from the government of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven that Sweden might need to enforce legislation enacted earlier this year, allowing the authorities to impose what would be the country’s first lockdown since the pandemic erupted roughly a year ago.With the current infection rates, the capital area has seen a “small” increase in the number of people “so seriously ill that they are in need of hospital care,” Johan Bratt, the acting health and medical care director for the Stockholm region, said in a statement on Wednesday.There were 6,336 new cases of Covid registered in the capital last week, compared with 3,225 reported for the week beginning Feb. 1, according to data compiled by the region.The uptick follows a gloomy prognosis by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who told reporters on Tuesday that a third wave now seems impossible to avoid.“To expect a scenario in which we don’t have any increase at all in the spring is all but ruled out by now,” Tegnell said.But the country of 10.4 million people, which drew international attention for its laissez-faire approach at the outset the pandemic, is still cautious about resorting to a full lockdown.“We still believe in finding the places where we can impose more targeted measures instead,” Tegnell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedens-capital-stockholm-hit-by-100-spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-just-3-weeks-101614758023070.html

Kenya has more than 106,000 confirmed virus cases including more than 1,800 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenya-receives-receives-1-million-covid-vaccines-from-india-under-covax-initiative-101614757757221.html
03-03-2021||World||Myanmar police fire to break up protests as ASEAN diplomatic effort stalls||Myanmar security forces opened fire in several places on Wednesday to break up anti-junta protests and several people were hurt, media reported, a day after a regional diplomatic push to end the month-long crisis made little headway.Foreign Ministers from Southeast Asian neighbours urged restraint but failed to unite behind a call for the military to release ousted government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy.At least 21 people have been killed since a military coup on Feb. 1 ended Myanmar's tentative steps towards democratic rule and triggered protests across the country and international dismay.Security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters in several places, including the main cities of Yangon and Mandalay, and there were also reports of live ammunition being used in some places."Oh my eyes, it hurts," one woman in a teacher's uniform shouted as she and other protesters scattered through a cloud of tear gas in the second city of Mandalay, according to a live video feed.Nine people were hurt when police fired rubber bullets in Mandalay, the Myanmar Now news agency reported.The Monywa Gazette reported five people were wounded when security forces fired live ammunition in that central town and there were also unconfirmed reports of firing and injuries in the two other central towns, Myingyan and Magway.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.The security forces detained about 400 protesters as they broke up protests in Yangon, Myanmar Now reported. One activist said several protest leaders were among those taken away.Video posted on social media showed long lines of young men, hands on heads, filing into army trucks as police and soldiers stood guard. Reuters was not able to verify the footage.Protesters were also out in Chin State in the west, Kachin State in the north, Shan State in the northeast, the central region of Sagaing and the south, media and residents said."We're aiming to show that no one in this country wants dictatorship," Salai Lian, an activist in Chin State, told Reuters.'NO MORE WORDS'On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to make a breakthrough in a virtual foreign ministers' meeting on Myanmar.While united in a call for restraint, only four members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore - called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees."We expressed ASEAN's readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner," the ASEAN chair, Brunei, said in a statement.Myanmar's state media said the military-appointed foreign minister attended the ASEAN meeting that "exchanged views on regional and international issues", but made no mention of the focus on Myanmar's problems.It said Wunna Maung Lwin "apprised the meeting of voting irregularities" in November's election.The military justified the coup saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 elections were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second five-year term. The election commission said the vote was fair.Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has said the intervention was to protect Myanmar's fledgling democracy and has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday in an interview the coup was a "tragic" step back for Myanmar and the use of lethal force by its security forces was "disastrous".ASEAN's bid to find a way out of the crisis has drawn criticism from inside Myanmar, with concern it would legitimise the junta and not help the country."No more words, action," activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters in a message when asked about the ASEAN effort. She called for sanctions on businesses linked to the military.Tuesday evening's news bulletin on Myanmar state television said agitators were mobilising people on social media and forming "illegal organisations".It said tear gas and stun guns grenades were used to disperse crowds in Yangon and 12 rioters were arrested.Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.She is one of nearly 1,300 people who have been detained, according to activists, among them six journalists in Yangon, one of whom works for the Associated Press, which has called for his release.Ousted President Win Myint is facing two new charges, his lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said, including one for a breach of the constitution that is punishable by up to three years on prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-fire-to-break-up-protests-as-asean-diplomatic-effort-stalls-101614757160152.html

03-03-2021||World||Pakistan needs more legislations to meet remaining FATF benchmarks: Report||As Pakistan remains on the 'grey list' of the terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF), it will have to enact laws on at least two counts to meet the outstanding points of the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) action plan to meet the June deadline.According to a report by Dawn, aside from further legislations, the Pakistan government will have to submit an updated report within a month to the FATF on the progress on legislation and other steps to be taken to address the outstanding issues.The Pakistani daily's report said the additional legislation has to cover weaknesses in the existing framework, including apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them.The three remaining FATF points include demonstrating that terrorist financing (TF) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities; demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions; and demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, specifically those acting for or on their behalf.Global terror financing watchdog last week retained Pakistan on its "grey list" till June after concluding that Islamabad failed to address its strategically important deficiencies, to fully implement the action plan that the watchdog had drawn up for Pakistan.The global watchdog had in October last year asked Pakistan to deliver on all 27 points by this February. However, Islamabad failed in this regard."To date, Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has now largely addressed 24 of the 27 action items. As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan before June 2021," FATF said in a statement at the outcome of a plenary last week.Pakistan's continuation on the 'grey list' means that it will not get any respite in trying to access finances in the form of investments and aid from international bodies including International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistan has been on the FATF's grey list since June 2018.A research paper by an Islamabad-based think tank recently revealed that Pakistan sustained a total of USD 38 billion in economic losses due to FATF's decision.The research paper titled "Bearing the cost of global politics -- the impact of FATF grey-listing on Pakistan's economy" states that that grey-listing events spanning from 2008 to 2019, may have resulted in total GDP losses worth USD 38 billion, The Express Tribune reported.The report published by Tabadlab said the losses are worked out on the basis of a decrease in consumption expenditures, foreign direct investment and exports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-needs-more-legislations-to-meet-remaining-fatf-benchmarks-report-101614755944839.html

Then says he cannot||CNN anchor Chris Cuomo addressed the sexual harassment allegations against his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo at the start of Monday’s Cuomo prime time show. The journalist said that he obviously cannot report on the story due to conflict of interest."You're straight with me, I'll be straight with you," Cuomo told his audience. "Obviously, I'm aware of what's going on with my brother. And obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother.""Now, of course, CNN has to cover it," he continued. "They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so. I have always cared very deeply about these issues, and profoundly so. I just wanted to tell you that. There's a lot of news going on that matters also, so let's get after that."Read more: New York Governor Cuomo backs down on plan to review his alleged sexual misconductWhy the controversy?Chris Cuomo’s statement was considered controversial as the Cuomo brothers have often shared screen time together on CNN. On several occasions last spring, when New York was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, Governor Cuomo made several appearances on his brother’s show, even though ever since Chris Cuomo joined the network in 2013, he had been prevented from covering stories surrounding his brother.Read more: Andrew Cuomo's scandals dim luster of man dubbed ‘America’s governor’What are the allegations that Governor Cuomo faces?Governor Cuomo is facing allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior towards three women.

In a statement on Sunday, Governor Cuomo apologized saying, "I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal," he said. "Some of the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation. To the extent anyone felt that way, I am truly sorry."

The attack occurred immediately after Republican Trump, in a speech near the White House, exhorted his supporters to march to the Capitol, having repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him.The Justice Department has charged more than 300 people with crimes ranging from conspiracy to attacking police and obstructing Congress. The rioting left five dead.At least 18 people associated with the far-right Proud Boys have been charged and nine people tied to the anti-government militia known as the Oath Keepers are facing charges they conspired as far back as November to storm the Capitol to prevent Biden from becoming president.Biden took office on Jan. 20.Wray revealed that since the attacks, the FBI has also seen instances of "foreign adversaries" who have been "leveraging the events of Jan. 6 to amplify their own narratives" and push propaganda.He did not provide further details, saying he could not do so in an unclassified setting.Supporters of Trump have repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims the rioters were actually fake Trump supporters who belong to antifa. They have also repeated Trump's false claims that the election was stolen due to widespread fraud.Wray told lawmakers on Tuesday this narrative was false.To the contrary, he said, a number of the rioters belong to far-right militia movements, or were motivated by racial ideologies - but none to date appear to belong to any left-wing groups.The anti-government militia extremists, he noted, appears to be the "biggest bucket" that is trending as the FBI examines the backgrounds of the rioters.Wray said he stood by comments made by former Attorney General Bill Barr, who had infuriated Trump after the election when he said the Justice Department did not have evidence of any widespread election fraud."We are not aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud, much less that would have affected the outcome of the presidential election," Wray told lawmakers.The FBI has yet to arrest any suspects in the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, or for pipe bombs that were discovered outside the headquarters of both the Republican and Democratic national committees.The FBI has obtained a video that shows a suspect spraying bear spray on police officers, including Sicknick, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.The suspect has yet to be identified by name, and it is still unclear if the bear spray contributed to Sicknick's death.Wray said he cannot disclose a cause of death, and Sicknick's death is still under investigation.In a newly unsealed search warrant, investigators say rioters carried weapons inside the Capitol including tire irons, sledge hammers, tasers, bear spray and, in at least one case, a handgun with an extended magazine.Investigators including the FBI have come under scrutiny over why more was not done to protect the Capitol ahead of the attack.The day before, the FBI's Norfolk, Virginia, office distributed a raw, unverified intelligence report which warned that violent extremists intended to disrupt Congress.Wray told lawmakers the intelligence was shared with other law enforcement agencies three different ways, but acknowledged he personally did not see the report until a few days later.As to why other top law enforcement officials did not see it, Wray said: "I don't have a good answer to that."Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said to Wray: "What I don't understand is why this ... raw intelligence didn't prompt a stronger warning and alarm."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-evidence-us-capitol-rioters-belong-to-antifa-movement-says-fbi-chief-101614754324964.html

However, the WHO is yet to ratify five of the Chinese vaccines currently authorised by Beijing for emergency use.Observers are optimistic about borders opening up for international travel as the Covid-19 immunisation drive gains momentum across the world.The US is the worst affected nation by the coronavirus with 514,660 related fatalities and over 28 million confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.In China, Covid-19 has claimed 4,836 lives with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, the coronavirus resources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/free-travel-allowed-for-official-reasons-wu-on-us-china-collab-for-covid19-101614734937334.html
03-03-2021||World||China charges blogger for 'demeaning military casualties' of Galwan clash||A popular Chinese blogger with millions of followers has been charged for posts regarding military casualties in the Galwan valley clash with India last June.The authorities accused the popular blogger of demeaning military casualties of the border clash, South China Morning Post reported.38-year-old Qiu Ziming was charged for comments that prosecutors in the eastern city of Nanjing said, "distorted facts, defamed five soldiers who defended the Chinese border, and have led to severely negative social impacts".The comments came after China admitted for the first time that four of its soldiers had been killed and one seriously wounded during the clash that took place in the Himalayas, SCMP reported.Qiu, a former reporter with the weekly Economic Observer, had 2.5 million followers on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo when he had published two posts that suggested a commander survived the clashes because he was the highest-ranking officer there.He also suggested that more Chinese soldiers might have been killed in the conflict than those disclosed by the authorities.Last month, the Chinese military ended its months-long silence to say that four soldiers - Chen Hongjun, 33, Xiao Siyuan, 24, Wang Zhuoran, 24 and Chen Xiangrong, 18 - were killed in the conflict in the Galwan Valley in June. Their commanding officer Qi Fabao, 41, was badly wounded.State media had also released footage of the clash showing Qi walking with open arms towards Indian troops and trying to stop them. Meanwhile, the Russian news agency last month had claimed that 45 Chinese soldiers were killed in the clashes at the Galwan Valley.In a commentary on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua accused Qiu of "damaging the reputation of heroes, hurting nationalistic feelings and poisoning patriotic hearts" with his sensational posts.The Chinese Communist Party has long been accused of suppressing the idea that could undermine the sweeping authority.In just the past few years, the government has attempted to muzzle critics by making them disappear without a trace, ordering people to physically barge into their houses, or locking up those close to critics as a kind of blackmail.

03-03-2021||World||Fly me to the Moon: Japan billionaire Yusaku Maezawa offers space seats||It's the sort of chance that comes along just once in a blue Moon: a Japanese billionaire is throwing open a private lunar expedition to eight people from around the world.Yusaku Maezawa, an online fashion tycoon, was announced in 2018 as the first man to book a spot aboard the lunar spaceship being developed by SpaceX.Maezawa, who paid an undisclosed sum for the trip expected to launch in 2023 at the earliest, originally said he planned to invite six to eight artists to join him on the voyage around the Moon.But on Wednesday, in a video posted on his Twitter account, he revealed a broader application process."I'm inviting you to join me on this mission. Eight of you from all around the world," he said."I have bought all the seats, so it will be a private ride," he added.Maezawa, 45, said his initial plan of inviting artists had "evolved" because he came to believe that "every single person who is doing something creative could be called an artist."The Japanese entrepreneur said applicants would need to fulfil just two criteria: being ready to "push the envelope" creatively, and being willing to help other crew members do the same.In all, he said around 10 to 12 people will be on board the spaceship, which is expected to loop around the Moon before returning to Earth.The application timeline for spots on the trip calls for would-be space travellers to pre-register by March 14, with initial screening carried out by March 21.No deadlines are given for the next stages -- an "assignment" and an online interview -- but final interviews and medical checkups are currently scheduled for late May 2021, according to Maezawa's website.Musk 'highly confident'Maezawa and his band of astronauts will become the first lunar voyagers since the last US Apollo mission in 1972 -- if SpaceX can pull the trip off.Last month, a prototype of its Starship crashed in a fireball as it tried to land upright after a test flight, the second such accident, after the last prototype of the Starship met a similar fate in December.But the company hopes the reusable, 394-foot (120-metre) rocket system will one day carry crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond."I'm highly confident that we will have reached orbit many times with Starship before 2023 and that it will be safe enough for human transport by 2023. It's looking very promising," SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in Maezawa's video posted Wednesday.The mission will be the first private space flight beyond Earth's orbit, Musk said.Because it will not land on the Moon, but loop behind it, "we expect people will go further than any human has ever gone from planet Earth," he added.Maezawa, known for his eccentric comments and extravagant lifestyle including a penchant for pricey art, was last year valued around $1.9 billion, making him one of Japan's richest people.He made his fortune as founder of online fashion store Zozo, which he sold to Yahoo! Japan in 2019.Maezawa has previously made headlines with an online ad for a girlfriend to join him on his SpaceX flight -- only to abruptly cancel the hunt, despite attracting nearly 30,000 applicants.US space agency NASA is intending to land astronauts on the Moon, including the first woman, in 2024.One of the goals of its Artemis III voyage is to bring back a total of 85 kilograms (187 pounds) of lunar samples -- more than the average 64 kilograms brought back by Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fly-me-to-the-moon-japan-billionaire-yusaku-maezawa-offers-space-seats-101614752862953.html

He also said climate change, global health issues and cyber threats pose serious risks.Among the Russia-related issues Burns and other intelligence chiefs are expected to deal with early in the Biden administration are an investigation into recent hacking attacks of US government and private and local government data networks.A US official said Biden's Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, confirmed by the Senate in January, will lead a broad review of intelligence issues facing US agencies, including what role Russia's leadership played in the SolarWinds hack of US targets and in approving payment of alleged Russian bounties to Taliban fighters who kill American and allied forces in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cia-director-william-burns-recommends-shutting-down-beijing-funded-confucius-institutes-101614734906297.html

03-03-2021||World||Joe Biden brings no relief to tensions between US, China||worlPresident Joe Biden took office promising to move quickly to restore and repair America's relations with the rest of the world, but one major nation has yet to see any US effort to improve ties: China.From Iran to Russia, Europe to Latin America, Biden has sought to cool tensions that rose during President Donald Trump's four years in office. Yet, there have been no overtures to China.Although the Biden administration has halted the ferocious rhetorical attacks and near daily announcements of new sanctions on China that had become commonplace under Trump, it has yet to back down on any of Trump's actions against Beijing.This persistent state of low-intensity hostility has profound implications. China and the United States are the world's two largest economies and the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Their power struggle complicates global efforts to deal with climate change and recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Biden's tough stance has its roots in the competition for global power, but it's also a result of the 2020 presidential election campaign in which Trump and his allies repeatedly sought to portray him as soft on China, particularly during the pandemic that originated there. There's also little appetite from lawmakers in either party to ease pressure on China.Thus in their first month in office, Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have reaffirmed many of the Trump administration's most significant steps targeting China, including a determination that its crackdown on Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in western Xinjiang region constitutes a “genocide” and a flat-out rejection of nearly all of China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.Nor has the new administration signaled any let-up in Trump's tariffs, restrictions on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics in the US or criticism of Chinese policies toward Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong.It's also critical of Beijing's attempts to further its increasing global influence through telecommunications technology, social media and educational and cultural exchanges.Biden's nominee to head the CIA, William Burns, was explicit about his concerns over many of these issues at his confirmation hearing Wednesday. And, the newly confirmed US.ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, made a point of highlighting her unease with the state of affairs and pledged to combat Chinese attempts to exert undue pressure on other countries at the UN.The backdrop is clear: The United States is convinced that it and China are engaged in a duel for global dominance. And neither is prepared to back down.China has sounded at times hopeful that Biden will reverse what foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said were Trump administration actions that “caused immeasurable damage to the relationship between the two countries.”Those remarks followed a speech in which China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, demanded that Biden's administration lift restrictions on trade and people-to-people contacts and cease what Beijing considers unwarranted interference in the areas of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet.Wang urged the US to “stop smearing” the reputation of China's ruling Communist Party. “We hope that the US policy makers will keep pace with the times, see clearly the trend of the world, abandon biases, give up unwarranted suspicions and move to bring the China policy back to reason to ensure a healthy, steady development of China-US relations,” he said.But the anti-China rhetoric hasn't eased. Top Biden administration officials have vowed to use American power to contain what many Democrats and Republicans see as growing Chinese threats to US interests and values in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.They have all repeatedly referred to China as a strategic rival or foe, not a partner or potential friend, and have also evinced their belief that America must “outcompete” China.“Outcompeting China will be key to our national security in the decades ahead,” Burns said at his confirmation hearing. “China is a formidable authoritarian adversary, methodically strengthening its capabilities to steal intellectual property, repress its own people, bully its neighbors, expand its global reach, and build influence in American society.”“It is hard for me to see a more significant threat or challenge for the United States as far out as I can see into the 21st century than that one. It is the biggest geopolitical test that we face,” he said.At least some Asia hands in the United States see Biden as moving slowly toward potential reengagement with China in part because he wants to shore up his domestic position and make clear the US is not a victim of Chinese predation.“They are restraining themselves from the normal syndrome of a new administration running into problem-solving with China,” said Danny Russel, who was assistant secretary of state for Asia during the Obama administration and is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.Russel said Biden is "sending out messages that have the effect of showing he's not soft on China, that he's not a patsy for China, that he isn't so desperate for a breakthrough on climate change that he's going to trade away our national security interests.”Chinese academics see little difference in Biden's approach.“Continuity takes precedent over adjustment and change,” said Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at elite Nanjing University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-brings-no-relief-to-tensions-between-us-china-101614750582081.html
03-03-2021||World||Biden administration withdraws Neera Tanden’s nomination to cabinet position||The White House on Tuesday withdrew Indian-American Neera Tanden’s nomination to a cabinet position to head the office of management and budget (OMB) after she faced opposition from Republicans as well as a Democrat for her controversial tweets. She will have a role in the Biden administration still, but it was not immediately clear how.“I have accepted Neera Tanden’s request to withdraw her name from nomination for director of the office of management and budget,” US President Joe Biden said. “I have the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my administration.” Biden offered no indication of what that role will be, but it will most certainly be a position not requiring confirmation by the Senate.“I am writing to you to withdraw my nomination,” Tanden wrote to the president as it “now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities”.Tanden’s nomination, as the first Indian-American and woman of colour picked to head the OMB, had appeared to be in trouble almost from the time it was announced. Critics have called Tanden divisive citing her tweets in which she had targeted specially, and not only, Republicans over the past four years.“Very disappointed. We worked our hearts out and did everything we could to help Neera,” Shekar Narasimhan, a Democratic donor who also leads an initiative to promote Asian-descent Democratic politicians, said about Tanden pulling her nomination. “This would not have happened if Democrats stuck together and realised how critical the AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) community is to their electoral prospects in the future.”Tanden’s nomination began unravelling after Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator, announced his opposition to it. In an evenly divided 100-member Senate, Tanden would have made it home with the support of all 50 Democrats and then vice-president Kamala Harris’s tie-breaker vote.But Manchin’s opposition to her nomination left her at the mercy of the Republicans. There were hopes that moderate Republicans, who have voted against the party line, such as Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, would come to her rescue. None of them did.“Congress has to be able to trust the OMB director to make countless decisions in an impartial manner, carrying out the letter of the law and congressional intent,” Collins had said while announcing her decision. “Neera Tanden has neither the experience nor the temperament to lead this critical agency. Her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend.” Collins was among the Republicans who Tanden had once targeted in her tweets, calling her “the worst”.Some of Tanden’s defenders, however, alleged she was a victim of sexism. “I feel like there’s a little bit of sexism going on here,” William Kristol, a conservative political commentator, told The Washington Post. “It just seems like these tweets sound harsher to these old guys because they’re coming from a woman.”These same Republicans had looked the other way as one of their own, former president Donald Trump, had demeaned people in his social media posts.Other defenders of Tanden had alleged an undercurrent of racism in opposition to her nomination. The Washington Post had reported, citing activists, “Many of the president’s Black, Latino, Asian and Native American nominees are encountering more political turbulence than their White counterparts, further drawing out the process of staffing the federal government.”Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, tweeted as Tanden’s chances of being confirmed dimmed late February, “I represent one of the largest Indian-American districts in US. How do I look at what’s happening to @neeratanden and tell little girls of South Asian descent that they’ll have the same opportunities in life as white men? The answer: I can’t. And that’s a shame.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-withdraws-neera-tanden-s-nomination-to-cabinet-position-101614750031792.html

A women-led organisation, the team strongly believes in diversity and the role women can play in generating positive outcomes for society and for the economy as a whole. The investment by US DFC will help Northern Arc expand financing to many such deserving borrowers," said Northern Arc MD and CEO Kshama Fernandes.Women-owned businesses across the globe are chronically underfunded, the DFC said in a media release adding that in India, female entrepreneurs face a financing gap of hundreds of millions of dollars, while women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face a gap in the tens of billions of dollars.DFC's USD 50 million investment will help close these financing gaps. With this loan, Northern Arc will provide expanded financing to its network of inclusive financial institutions, entrepreneurs and small businesses catalysing traditionally underserved populations to create new jobs and grow their local economies, the media release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-body-announces-usd-50-million-loan-to-promote-gender-equity-in-businesses-financing-101614746218021.html

03-03-2021||World||US health experts halted trials of plasma transfusions for Covid-19 patients||US health experts said Tuesday they are halting clinical trials of convalescent blood plasma in patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms after preliminary results showed no benefit from the treatment.The trial that began in August involved just over 500 people who went to emergency rooms but did not need to be hospitalized.The people chosen for the study also had risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes or heart trouble.Some of them received the treatment -- blood plasma from people who had Covid-19 and overcame it -- and others got a placebo.Doctors looked at how many needed additional care or outright hospitalization, or who died, in the 15 days after undergoing the treatment.An independent group of experts determined that while the convalescent plasma intervention caused no harm, it was unlikely to benefit patients, the National Institutes of Health said.Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood from a Covid-19 patient that recovered. It contains anti-bodies produced by the body after being infected.In late October a study carried out in India and published in the medical journal BMJ said the treatment offered limited effectiveness.It did not reduce mortality or keep people with moderate Covid-19 symptoms from developing a serious case.Also read: Covid-19: US approves single shot J&J vaccine, UK vaccinates 20 millionMore than 100,000 people have received the treatment in the US since the start of the pandemic and many more elsewhere in the world, the NIH said.In late August, at the persistent request of then president Donald Trump, the US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization for transfusions of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients to people who were hospitalized with the disease.The then head of the FDA, Stephen Hahn, acknowledged an error at a press conference with Trump, saying he had cited figures that overestimated the benefits of the treatment.The FDA recently restricted its emergency authorization to use of plasma only with a high concentration of antibodies and for patients hospitalized with early stages of Covid-19 or with a limited ability to produce antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-experts-halted-trials-of-plasma-transfusions-for-covid-19-patients-101614734794634.html

The entire driver's side of the smaller vehicle was caved in, and the passenger side was flung wide open."Unfortunately, consular staff have confirmed the death of 10 Mexicans so far," Roberto Velasco, the foreign ministry's director for North America, said in a tweet in Spanish.Mexicans were also among the injured in the crash, he said.It was not immediately clear how fast the vehicles were going, or whether the SUV had observed a stop sign before heading into the intersection of State Route 115 and Norrish Road just outside of Holtville, about 10 miles (16.1 km) north of the border, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) said.Those killed, who included the driver of the SUV, ranged in age from 15 to 53, and minors as young as 16 were injured, said Omar Watson, chief of the highway patrol's border division. He said the driver was 22 years old.Several of the occupants were ejected from the vehicle and died on the pavement; others died inside the SUV, Watson said.Most of the survivors are Spanish-speaking, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said. Despite the presence of CBP agents and Spanish translators, Watson said it was too early to know whether the SUV's occupants were migrant workers or others who might have crossed from Mexico in the overcrowded vehicle.Although it varies by trim and model year, the Ford Expedition typically is designed to hold five to eight people.Watson said the CHP was working with the Mexican Consulate to determine who was in the vehicle and notify families of fatalities.The CBP spokesperson, who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said the agency was not in pursuit of or aware of the vehicle until the Imperial County Sheriff's Department asked for its help at the crash site.The agency does not know and is not investigating the immigration status of the people at this time.The driver of the tractor-trailer, which was earlier said to be hauling gravel but according to the CHP was not, was also hospitalized with moderate injuries, Watson said.The logo of Havens and Sons Trucking of nearby El Centro was on the side of the truck cab. A person who answered the phone at the company told Reuters it had no comment at this time.Several of the victims were taken to El Centro Regional Medical Center, the director of the hospital's emergency room, Judy Cruz, said in a news briefing posted on Facebook.Agriculture drives the economy around Holtville and El Centro. Known as the Imperial Valley, the area is a big producer of fruits, vegetables, grain and cattle despite being desert, thanks to irrigation from the Colorado River and a long growing season.Hospital officials had previously said that 27 people were in the SUV, and that 15 had died, but Watson said there were 25 passengers and 13 fatalities.Three victims were flown to other hospitals and seven others were brought to El Centro. One person died at the hospital, Cruz said.In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it will investigate the crash in concert with the California Highway Patrol. The agency's investigator-in-charge was expected to arrive on Wednesday, the NTSB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-die-in-collision-of-truck-crowded-suv-near-us-mexico-border-101614738411032.html

Brazil is among the hardest-hit countries globally, with 10,646,926 confirmed cases and 257,361 deaths from Covid-19.While the virus recedes in most of the world, Brazil is battling a spike in infections, which has been made worse by carnival and year-end gatherings. About 20 states have more than 80% of ICU beds filled, leading the National Council of Health Secretaries to call for tough measures including a national curfew and closure of airports to avoid a collapse of public and private healthcare systems networks.Also read: Coronavirus variant infected many already recovered from Covid-19: StudyA slow roll-out of vaccines -- Brazil was late to kick off its immunization campaign, and had only 6 million doses at hand when it did -- and a variant that researchers say appears more contagious has added to concern.

03-03-2021||World||Texas and other state governors ease Covid-19 rules despite warnings||Texas on Tuesday became the biggest state to lift its mask rule, joining a rapidly growing movement by governors and other leaders across the US to loosen Covid-19 restrictions despite pleas from health officials not to let down their guard yet.The state will also do away with limits on the number of diners who can be served indoors, said Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock.The governors of Michigan and Louisiana likewise eased up on bars, restaurants and other businesses Tuesday, as did the mayor of San Francisco.“Removing state-wide mandates does not end personal responsibility,” said Abbott, speaking from a crowded dining room where many of those surrounding him were not wearing masks. “It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed."A year into the outbreak, politicians and ordinary Americans alike have grown tired of rules meant to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed over a half-million people in the United States. Some places are lifting infection control measures; in other places, people are ignoring them.Top health officials, including the head of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, have responded by begging people repeatedly not to risk another deadly wave of contagion just when the nation is making progress in vaccinating people and victory over the pandemic is in sight.US cases have plunged more than 70% over the past two months from an average of nearly 250,000 new infections a day, while average deaths per day have plummeted about 40% since mid-January.Also read: Texas utility files for bankruptcy after $2.1 billion power billBut the two curves have levelled off abruptly in the past several days and have even risen slightly, and the numbers are still running at alarmingly high levels, with an average of about 2,000 deaths and 68,000 cases per day. Health officials are increasingly worried about virus mutations.“We stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained,” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned on Monday.Even so, many states are allowing restaurants to resume indoor dining, reopening movie theatres and expanding mass gatherings, while Americans are eager to socialize again.An Indianapolis-area bar was filled with mask less patrons over the weekend. In Southern California, people waited in lines that snaked through a parking lot on a recent weekday afternoon for the chance to shop and eat at Downtown Disney, part of the Disneyland. (The theme park's rides remain closed.) And Florida is getting ready to welcome students on spring break.“People want to stay safe, but at the same time, the fatigue has hit,” said Ryan Luke, who is organizing a weekend rally in Eagle, Idaho, to encourage people to patronize businesses that don’t require masks. "We just want to live a quasi-normal life.”Michael Junge argued against a mask mandate when officials in the Missouri tourist town of Branson passed one and said he hasn’t enforced it in his Lost Boys Barber Company. He said he is sick of it.“I think the whole thing is a joke honestly,” he said. “They originally said that this was going to go for a month and they have pushed it out to indefinitely. ... It should have been done a long time ago.”In San Francisco, and upbeat Mayor London Breed announced that California gave the green light to indoor dining and the reopening of of movie theatres and gyms.Florida is getting ready for spring break travellers to flock to its sunny beaches. The state is considered to be in an “active outbreak,” along with Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and South Carolina, according to the data-tracking website CovidActNow.Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis made it clear during his annual State of the State speech Tuesday that he welcomes more visitors to Florida in his drive to keep the state’s economy thriving.Municipalities can impose their own mask rules and curfews, restrict beach access and place some limits on bars and restaurants, but some have virtually no such measures in place ahead of the season.Miami Beach will require masks both indoors and out and will restrict the number of people allowed on the beach as well as in bars and restaurants.“If you want to party without restrictions, then go somewhere else. Go to Vegas,” Miami Beach City Manager Raul Aguila said during a recent virtual meeting. “We will be taking a zero-tolerance attitude towards that behaviour.”In Michigan, a group called All Business Is Essential has resisted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s virus policies, and many people are abandoning mask requirements and other measures, said group leader Erik Kiilunen.“At some point you’ve got to look yourself in the mirror and say, ‘Do I want a zero-risk life?’” he said. “It’s become a farce, really. People have quit living for a year, at what price?”“I think everybody wants things to get back the way they were,” said Aubrey D. Jenkins, the fire chief in Columbia, South Carolina, whose department issues dozens of $100 citations every weekend to bar-goers who refuse to wear masks or keep their distance. “But we still have to be real cautious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-and-other-state-governors-ease-covid-19-rules-despite-warnings-101614733121124.html
03-03-2021||World||Meghan Markle wins privacy claim against UK newspaper||Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has dubbed her victory in holding the Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) to account as a “comprehensive win for privacy and copyright” because the damage they do “runs deep”.The 39-year-old wife of Britain’s Prince Harry also thanks her husband for his support through the process, after a London High Court ruling in her favour involving articles in February 2019 that published extracts of a “personal and private” letter to her estranged father.The former actress’ legal team had sought a “summary judgment” in the case, which was granted by Justice Mark Warby in the claim for misuse of private information against the publisher of the 'Mail on Sunday’ and ‘MailOnline’."The claimant had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The ‘Mail’ articles interfered with that reasonable expectation," the judge concluded.“After two long years of pursuing litigation, I am grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers and The Mail on Sunday to account for their illegal and dehumanising practices,” said Markle in a statement after the judgment.“For these outlets, it’s a game. For me and so many others, it’s real life, real relationships, and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep,” she said.Markle, who is now based in the US with husband Harry and infant son Archie, said in her statement that the judgment was a victory for all because everyone loses when “misinformation sells more than truth” and when companies create their business model to profit from “people’s pain”.She added: “The world needs reliable, fact-checked, high-quality news... for today, with this comprehensive win on both privacy and copyright, we have all won. We now know, and hope it creates legal precedent, that you cannot take somebody’s privacy and exploit it in a privacy case, as the defendant has blatantly done over the past two years.“I share this victory with each of you — because we all deserve justice and truth, and we all deserve better.”The judge in his ruling had noted that the only “tenable justification” for the publication of extracts of the letter was to correct some inaccuracies about the letter, contained in an article in ‘People’ magazine which featured an interview with five friends of Markle.But he added: "The inescapable conclusion is that, save to the very limited extent I have identified, the disclosures made were not a necessary or proportionate means of serving that purpose. For the most part they did not serve that purpose at all. Taken as a whole the disclosures were manifestly excessive and hence unlawful."A spokesperson for ANL said: "We are very surprised by today's (Thursday) summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial.“We are carefully considering the judgment's contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal."Markle had brought a case in the High Court in England of breach of copyright, infringement of her privacy, and breaches of the Data Protection Act over articles which showed parts of a letter she had written to her 76-year-old father Thomas Markle in August 2018.Parts of the exchange between the father and daughter during a strained relationship were published in the newspaper and online in February 2019.Last year, the High Court had ruled that the newspaper publishers could also include the book ‘Finding Freedom’, written about the royals, their relationship and their decision to step away as frontline British royals, as part of their defence – a decision Meghan's legal team had tried to get overturned.Justice Warby has indicated the need for a further hearing in March to decide "the next steps" in the legal action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-wins-privacy-claim-against-uk-newspaper-101614733773766.html

Opening up markets and removing trade barriers will be a “priority” in President Joe Biden’s trade agenda, it added.The report sent to US Congress — titled “2021 Trade Policy Agenda and 2020 Annual Report” — detailed the negotiations that took place between the two countries on an interim trade agreement over 2019-2020, calling it a “package of meaningful market access outcomes”, but offered no clues to how the new administration sees them and how it would like to proceed.India has called for talks on a “fresh package”, and to this time go beyond the “nitpicking” and constant shifting of the goalpost that characterised the Trump administration’s approach.The report identified “long-standing market access impediments affecting US exporters” as the key continuing American ask and concern. Trade frictions between the two countries, which exert the weightiest drag on ties that are otherwise on an upward trajectory, have outlasted several administrations in both countries, irrespective of the parties in power.Also Read | India-US trade ties hit by tariff policies under Donald Trump administration: US Congress report“While India’s large market, economic growth, and progress towards development make it an essential market for many US exporters, a general and consistent trend of trade-restrictive policies have inhibited the potential of the bilateral trade relationship,” the report said. India-US bilateral trade in goods and services stood at $146.1 billion in 2019. The potential is said to be many times more. President Biden, who visited India in 2013, had then said the target should be $500 billion.“Recent Indian emphasis on import substitution through a ‘Make in India’ campaign has epitomized the challenges facing the bilateral trade relationship,” the President’s trade agenda released Monday said, identifying a programme launched by Prime Minister Modi in 2014.“Opening markets and reducing trade barriers are fundamental to any trade agenda,” the report said generally of President Joe Biden’s trade agenda. “This will be a priority for the Biden administration, particularly since export-oriented producers, manufacturers, and businesses enjoy greater than average productivity and wages.”The US has sought increased access for its companies to India’s dairy and poultry markets, wants medical devices to be freed from government-regulated pricing, and resolve issues regarding IT goods.To force India to give in, former President Donald Trump had in June 2019 ended India’s access to a preferential US import promotion programme — the Generalized system of Preferences (GSP) — that allowed an estimated $6 billion worth of imports from India to enter the US duty-free.India has blamed American trade negotiators for the failure to reach an agreement, by constantly changing, and upping, their demands. “I think the last time around when we were discussing, we were nitpicking with very small issues and changing the goalposts in every subsequent conversation,” Trade and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/make-in-india-key-to-challenges-in-trade-ties-says-us-101614730963666.html
03-03-2021||World||White House budget chief nominee Neera Tanden withdraws nomination||President Joe Biden's pick to head the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, has withdrawn her nomination after she faced opposition from key Democratic and Republican senators for her controversial tweets.Her withdrawal marks the first high-profile defeat of one of Biden's nominees. Eleven of the 23 Cabinet nominees requiring Senate approval have been confirmed, most with strong bipartisan support.Also Read: What is the controversy around Neera Tanden’s Senate confirmation?"Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities," Tanden wrote in a letter to Biden. The president, in a statement, said he has "utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel" and pledged to find her another role in his administration.Tanden's viability was in doubt after Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin and a number of moderate Republicans came out against her last month, all citing her tweets attacking members of both parties prior to her nomination.Manchin, a key moderate swing vote in the Senate, said last month in a statement announcing his opposition that "her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget."Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins, meanwhile, cited Biden's own standard of conduct in opposing Tanden, declaring in a statement that "her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend."Tanden needed just 51 votes in an evenly-divided Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris acting as a tiebreaker. But without Manchin's support, the White House was left scrambling to find a Republican to support her.One potential Republican vote, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told reporters earlier Tuesday on Capitol Hill she still had not yet made up her mind on Tanden's nomination.The White House stuck with her even after a number of centrist Republicans made their opposition known, insisting her experience growing up on welfare and background working on progressive policies as the president and CEO of the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress made her the right candidate for the moment. White House chief of staff Ron Klain initially insisted the administration was "fighting our guts out" for her.Tanden faced pointed questions over her past comments about members from both parties during her confirmation hearing. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and prominent progressive lawmaker, accused her of issuing "vicious attacks" against progressives, and hadn't said whether he'd support her nomination.Tanden apologized during that hearing to "people on either the left or right who are hurt by what I've said." Just prior to the hearing, she deleted hundreds of tweets, many of which were critical of Republicans.Collins cited those deleted tweets in her statement, saying that the move "raises concerns about her commitment to transparency." She said Congress "has to be able to trust the OMB director to make countless decisions in an impartial manner, carrying out the letter of the law and congressional intent."As recently as Monday, the White House indicated it was sticking by Tanden's nomination, with press secretary Jen Psaki noting Tanden's "decades of experience" in defending their pick."We will continue of course to fight for the confirmation of every nominee that the president puts forward," Psaki insisted, but she added, "We'll see if we have 50 votes."The head of the Office of Management and Budget is tasked with putting together the administration's budget, as well as overseeing a wide range of logistical and regulatory issues across the federal government.Tanden's withdrawal leaves the Biden administration without a clear replacement. The apparent front-runner on Capitol Hill to replace Tanden was Shalanda Young, a former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee who has been actively pushed by members of the Congressional Black Caucus.Other names mentioned include Ann O'Leary, a former chief of staff for California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Gene Sperling, who served as a top economic adviser to both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-budget-chief-nominee-neera-tanden-withdraws-nomination-amid-opposition-101614730381660.html
03-03-2021||India||Only Centre can enforce new digital media rules: I&B ministry to states||New Delhi The information and broadcasting ministry on Wednesday told all states and Union territories that no state official, district magistrate (DM) or police commissioner has the power to seek information from any media house under the new digital media rules unless information is sought by the central government.A district magistrate in Manipur on Tuesday withdrew a notice served by him to a talk show under the new rules framed and announced by the Centre last week. This came after the central government intervened and said that states did not have the power to issue such notices.The notice under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on February 25, was issued on March 1 and served on Tuesday morning to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi, which means Let’s Talk in Manipuri. This was probably the first such action against digital news anywhere in the country — four days after a gazette notification on the new digital media rules were published – but the notice was later withdrawn.The provisions under the new rules relate to the code of ethics for digital news publishers, setting up of a grievance redressal system and the requirement of disclosure of information to Centre, the ministry said. “These powers have not been delegated to state governments/district magistrates/police commissioners,” it added. These rules have to be administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting, it clarified. The rules relate to publishers of digital news and current affairs and publishers of online curated content (Over the Top).On Monday, the Centre sent a letter to the chief secretary of Manipur, a day after Imphal West district magistrate Naorem Praveen Singh served a notice to Manipuri talk show Khanasi Neinasi under the new laws.The show was hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the present Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and who has been jailed three times.The DM directed the media outlet to furnish all relevant documents to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The notice was withdrawn after the Centre’s remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-centre-can-enforce-new-digital-media-rules-i-b-ministry-to-states-101614795512792.html
03-03-2021||India||Odisha govt deploys 1000 men to contain huge blaze in Similipal National Park||The Odisha government on Wednesday engaged a team of over 1,000 people, including 750 forest guards and deployed 40 vehicles including fire tenders and 240 blowers to the Similipal biosphere reserve in Mayurbhanj district as a massive fire in 8 of the forest ranges raging for more than 10 days threatened to engulf the wildlife species and medicinal plants there.Odisha forest and environment minister Bikram Arukha said he has instructed the principal chief conservator of forests to ascertain the cause of the fire and bring it under control quickly. “Similipal is the pride of our state. Action is being taken by involving local people to protect our forest,” he said and asked the PCCF to submit a report to the state government by Thursday.The fire in Similipal biosphere came as Odisha topped the list of forest fire incidents with 6627 fire spots since February 24 as per the Forest Survey of India’s fire alerts system based on SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership and observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Telangana came a distant second with 1769 fires in the same time. Odisha also saw 8991 number of forests fires since November 1 last year, the highest among all the states.Similipal, among the few included by the UNESCO in its list of critical biosphere reserves of the world, covers an area of 5569 sq km and contributes 38% of the total protected area network in Odisha. It is the sixth largest biosphere reserve, one of the oldest tiger reserves in the country and a major biodiversity hotspot in Eastern India. The biosphere has the largest zone of Sal trees in the entire country. Its distinctive biodiversity contains 1,076 species of plants including 93 species of orchids, 300 species of medicinal plants and 52 species of endangered flora. It has also 42 species of mammals, 264 bird species, 39 reptile species and 12 amphibian species.The fire in Similipal which started in the Kaptipada range of the biosphere reserve in Mayurbhanj on February 9, soon spread to ranges like Upper Barahkamuda, Jenabil, Nawna South, Nawna North, Pithabata, Bhanjabasa and Thakurmunda range, alleged environmental activists working at the reserve.Vanoomitra Acharya, a conservationist working at Similipal said though tribals set fire to the dried leaves on the forest floor ahead of collecting the Mahua flowers, this year the poachers are behind the endless spate of fires. “Poachers are on a rampage inside the tiger reserve and they are setting fire to the bushes and the dried leaves so as to scare the animals like wild boars and barking deer to run in the opposite direction. They then shoot the animals with bows and arrows or pellet guns. While poachers were running amok, the forest officials did not do any patrolling. Forest fire incidences could have been reduced drastically with future planning and using modern technologies, but nothing of that sort was done in Similipal,” alleged Acharya, adding that the fire destroyed hundreds of bushes, medicinal plants and orchids for which the biosphere is famous.Regional chief conservator of forest of Baripada, M Yogajayananda, however said the fire may have been triggered by someone's negligence. “For more than a week, Baripada and the area nearby is experiencing temperatures of 40 degree Celsius. Unlike last year, this year there has been no rain in winter season leading to dry weather in the lower atmosphere which helped spread the fire quickly. The thick blanket of leaves on the forest floor has helped the fire to spread. But the core area of the tiger reserve has not been affected. It's only the villages in the fringe area that have been hit, but we are trying hard to bring the fire under control,” said Yogajayananda.Though the fire has been raging for more than 10 days, it did not come to public notice till erstwhile princess of Mayurbhanj royal family Akshita Bhanj Deo wrote about it on social media following which Union minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan expressed his concern and requested Union forest and environment minister Prakash Javadekar and chief minister Naveen Patnaik to take action. Javadekar later tweeted that he has asked his officials to take immediate action and report to him.Bhanj Deo said it was a matter of concern that no one took the forest fire seriously and the chief minister was tweeting about world wildlife day. “It's ironic that he was tweeting about wildlife day when Similipal was burning. Mayurbhanj is completely dependent on Similipal due to the forest and the rivers that emanate from hills in the region. The fire and the resultant smoke has been affecting not just the wild animals, but people living on the fringes. A few days ago, an auto-rickshaw carrying passengers collided with a truck as the drivers could not see each other due to the smoke. As the fire rages on, I am not sure how many wild animals have perished and what medicinal plants have been lost. I am worried whether we have lost the melanistic tiger and elephants to the fire. Army should have been requisitioned to contain the fire and the conservationists from Bhubaneswar could have been consulted on ways to protect the wildlife. Despite what officials say there has been very little action on the ground,” Bhanj Deo said.The CMO which undertook a review of the situation this evening said the forest fire is under control. “No loss of life or major damage to big trees has been reported. PCCF (Wildlife) has made spot visits to take stock of the situation. SOP has been issued to deal with the situation,” the CMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-deploys-1000-men-to-contain-huge-blaze-in-similipal-national-park-101614793853215.html

The group claimed that the peace talk teams are back on the table and negotiations are progressing.RN Ravi’s statements and conclusions, the group claimed, reflected his role as Nagaland Governor and not as the interlocutor.The NSCN (IM) stated it was regrettable that Ravi’s role as interlocutor has become “nothing less than disparaging and dismal”. It asserted that the status of the Naga political talks was, as confirmed by the union government during the last parliamentary session, in an advanced stage."It is very unfortunate of RN Ravi to have made such a misleading statement before the whole nation by blatantly contradicting the Centre and the Indian Parliament besides the 136 crore Indians and the world community in the matter of such sensitive Indo-Naga political negotiations which have been going on for more than two decades," the NSCN (IM) stated.The outfit underscored that the Naga peace talks are being handled by both the government of India and the NSCN (IM) to take the Naga people and the Centre to a point that is “honourable and acceptable”.It maintained that the historic framework agreement signed on August 3, 2015 between the Centre and the NSCN (IM) was being revived in order to remove any misinterpretation and thereby hasten the signing of Naga solution agreement.“This is the official understanding and the only way to conclude the talk,” the statement said, adding that the NSCN (IM), under no circumstance, would fail the Naga people by signing any agreement that is short of “the mutual standard as agreed upon”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reckless-naga-group-on-governor-rn-ravi-s-peace-talks-concluded-statement-101614788838479.html

03-03-2021||India||NIA starts probe in Bengal railway station blast that injured minister||A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday began a probe into the blast that injured West Bengal’s deputy labour minister Jakir Hossain and 22 Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers at Nimtita railway station in Murshidabad district on the night of February 17.Hossain and the others are admitted in hospital.The NIA team which reached Murshidabad on Wednesday afternoon visited the blast site and spoke to the local police. The officers also collected samples from the station. On Tuesday, the Union home ministry ordered the NIA to probe the blast.Hossain was supposed to board the Kolkata-bound Teesta Torsa Express from platform no 2 when the bomb, which was kept in a bag that was lying on the platform, went off.This is the second blast that the NIA is investigating in Bengal. The agency probed the 2018 bomb blast in a rented house at Khagragarh in East Burdwan district. Two operatives of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), who were making bombs inside the house, were killed. The probe exposed a big terror network in India and led to more than 30 arrests including that of Kausar who founded the third unit of the JMB in India.The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police is already probing the Nimtita blast. The CID has so far arrested two suspects, Abu Samad and Saidul Islam, who are now police custody.A CID officer, who did not want to be identified, claimed that during interrogation Saidul, who is an expert in making crude bombs, has admitted that he kept the bomb at Nimtita station to settle an old score with the minister.Speaking on condition of anonymity, another state police officer associated with the probe told HT on February 21 that examination of the remains of the exploded bomb clearly indicated that it was a socket bomb of high quality.“We have doubts if common criminals in Murshidabad have the expertise. Some of us suspect the involvement of JMB as its operatives are experts in making bombs of this kind,” the officer had said.The NIA team that visited Nimtita did not speak to the media. However, a local police officer who interacted with the team said the NIA has not ruled out the possibility of the JMB’s involvement.A section of state police officers suspect that JMB operatives might have brought the bomb to the station to carry out a big terror attack, possibly an explosion in a packed passenger train.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee entrusted three state agencies, including the CID, with the investigation while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress demanded probe by Central agencies.Murshidabad, where Muslims comprise 66.28% of the population, the state’s highest, shares border with Bangladesh.On February 10, a special NIA court in Kolkata handed a 29-year jail sentence to Kausar for his role in the Khagragarh blast. Kausar, 31, who was arrested by the NIA from a guest house in Bengaluru in August 2018, is also an accused in the 2018 Bodhgaya blast.The NIA and the Special Task Force (STF) of the state police have nabbed several JMB militants from Murshidabad district in recent years. The NIA has also nabbed several Al Qaeda suspects from the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-starts-probe-in-bengal-railway-station-blast-that-injured-minister-101614787284334.html

03-03-2021||India||'Rahul Gandhi’s take on Emergency is his personal opinion,' says CM Nitish Kumar||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said that everybody knew that the imposition of Emergency in the country was wrong.“I have been a victim of the Emergency period. I was a youth at that time,” said Kumar. He made the assertion while talking to mediapersons in the state legislature premises and said that whatever Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said about the Emergency were his personal views.In an interview, Rahul Gandhi had said that the Emergency was a mistake during the regime of Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister. He admitted that the Congress at no point attempted to capture India's institutional framework.The Bihar CM said that Emergency was imposed when Jayaprakash Narayan was carrying out a massive agitation and a lot of people were arrested. “Fundamental rights of the people were usurped. People of the country gave their verdict by voting Congress out of power during the elections after the Emergency. All opposition parties got united after being influenced by Jayaprakash Narayan’s ideology and formed the Janata Party, which formed the government,” Kumar recalled.The Bihar CM, however, refused to make any comments regarding the income tax department’s raid on film stars, saying that the department was acting as per the rule and power vested in it under the law. To another query relating to raids on jails, the CM said keeping a close watch on activities within the prison was an unavoidable necessity. “I take note of every important thing that comes to light during the raids on jails,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-take-on-emergency-is-his-personal-opinion-says-cm-nitish-kumar-101614786522053.html

The government claims that these are part of the long-pending reforms in the agriculture sector. The farmers, however, complain that it will put them at the mercy of corporates.Talks with the government broke down on January 22. During a tractor rally on January 26, a section of the farmers broke off from the rally route and engaged in violent clashes with the police.Tikait's mantra for farmers included 1 village, 1 tractor, 15 men and 10 days, adding another 15 are to replace the first 15 on rotational basis."If these farm laws are enforced then the foodgrains will be locked in godowns of the traders and big companies and the price of foodgrains will be decided on the basis of hunger,” he said.He said that the farmer movement has not ended. "There are 15,000 tractors at Tikri border and farmers have put up huts under trees,” he said.The government has maintaiend that the offer for talks is still open. The farmers, however, are insistent on repeal of the farm laws and also a guarantee on minium support prices or MSP for their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-tractors-are-stopped-remove-barricades-farmer-leader-rakesh-tikait-101614785018563.html

Police found his cell phone and motorcycle from the roadside around 10.30 pm on Tuesday.His body with bullet wounds was found from an agriculture field on Wednesday morning at around 5 am. Police said he was shot thrice.As the news of Hussain’s murder spread in the area, family members and local residents reached the spot and disrupted vehicular traffic. They stopped the police from sending the body for autopsy. Senior officials then reached the spot with reinforcement and launched a baton charge to disperse the mob.A police patrol car was torched while four vehicles were completely damaged by the mob. The state highway was blocked for some hours as the villagers clashed with the police who struggled to contain the situation. Additional forces were called from surrounding stations.Police said many miscreants were detained.“A case will be lodged and those responsible for the violence will be punished,” said Saran's superintendent of police (SP) Santosh Kumar.However, community leaders said the violence was a result of police negligence and insensitivity in tackling the matter and a reaction to deteriorating law and order situation in the area. A senior member of the community who did not wish to be named said that they suspected a political rivalry as the reason behind in the murder.Police eventually sent the body for post mortem around 2.30 pm.Earlier on Sunday night, criminals gunned down one Akash Kumar at Mohammadpur in Saran district. The victim was said to be grandson of mukhia Siya Devi. No one has yet been arrested in the case.On Wednesday, there was another protest against the police in southern district of Nawada after a 13-year-old boy was allegedly murdered in Warisliganj.Following the incident, family members and locals blocked Sheikhpura-Nawada road near Jaiprakash Chowk.

Pre-clinical trials conducted on animals and clinical trials conducted on humans are both integral parts of this process.Bhargava also reiterated what he said at a webinar organized by the Kerala government in February, about the interim results of Covaxin’s ongoing clinical trial showing effective results against variants of Covid-19. He added that the recent results which have been evaluated by a data safety and monitoring board has found Covaxin to be well tolerated across an expansive range of age groups.

This remark was followed by a barb at the government with the minister saying if such arrangements were made at borders, there won’t be any infiltration.“...But they run away when they see China. If this kind of preparation was made at borders with China or Bangladesh, infiltration won't happen,” he told the assembly.Thackeray’s comment drew a sharp response from former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis who condemned the statement and termed it an insult to the Indian soldiers. “The chief minister said -- 'China se hum bhagte hain'. It is an insult to our soldiers. Our soldiers faced the Chinese at -30°C temperature, laid down their lives and chased away the Chinese,” Fadnavis, who is leader of opposition, said in the assembly.The chief minister also slammed the BJP over it raising slogans. “(Shiv) Sena was not a part of the freedom struggle but neither was your parent organisation (RSS). Just chanting 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' doesn't make you (BJP) a patriot,” Thackeray asserted.The claim, however, was rejected by Fadnavis, who said, “It seems the chief minister does not know that RSS founder Hedgewar was also a freedom fighter.”Earlier in the day, Thackeray also took on the Centre over the renaming of Motera cricket stadium in Ahmedabad after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Replying to the Governor's address, he said, “"Someone said now we won't be losing any cricket matches because the name of the stadium has been changed. We won't be losing any match in that stadium... You erase the name of Vallabh bhai (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), do not award Bharat Ratna to Savarkar (Veer Savarkar) and try to teach Hindutva to us."(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nails-put-in-farmers-path-if-this-preparation-was-at-borders-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101614780274750.html
03-03-2021||India||'Be ready to combat new and emerging diseases: VP Naidu's message to scientists||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday called upon scientists and researchers to be always ready to combat new and emerging diseases as the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need to be ever vigilant to tackle an outbreak of sudden and unforeseen epidemics and pandemics.Virtually addressing the Valedictory and Award Session of Global Bio India-2021 from Chennai, he said biotechnology has emerged as the backbone of various industrial sectors in recent times.Built on four core beliefs of entrepreneurship, innovation, development of local talent, and demonstrating high value-based care, India is in a unique position to transition from the biotech industry to a bio-economy, he said according to an official statement.Lauding the Department of Biotechnology for working relentlessly to mitigate the COVID-19-induced health crisis through the development of diagnostics, vaccines and novel protection equipment, apart from scaling up diagnostic capacity and rapid regulatory response, he expressed happiness that India is at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.Referring to India's supply of COVID-19 vaccine to several countries in tune with the spirit of 'Vausudhaiva Kutumbakam' (world is one family) and the age-old philosophy of 'share and care', he pointed that India's action drew praise from the World Health Organisation with its director general thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for supporting vaccine equity.Recognising the immense potential of the biotech sector, the vice president said the government has eased regulatory approvals for entrepreneurs.Referring to the biotech sector's ambitious target of becoming a USD 150 billion industry by 2025 and contribute to knowledge and innovation-driven economy, Naidu urged the academia and the industry to join hands and engage pro-actively in imparting training and skills to the youth.He also stressed on the need to leverage the huge potential of biotechnology sector to come up with new interventions to address the challenges faced by agriculture and allied sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-ready-to-combat-new-and-emerging-diseases-vp-naidu-s-message-to-scientists-101614779981566.html

The three-day conference will begin on Thursday, with the PM delivering his address on March 6, said a second official.The JCOs and jawans have been invited to take part in the conference on the back of their gallant actions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) where India and China are locked in a border standoff and both sides are currently in the midst of a disengagement process as well as their role in thwarting infiltration attempts along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.After the National Democratic Alliance came to power in 2014, and then again in 2019, the PM has taken the initiative to reach out to jawans on several occasions including his practice of celebrating Diwali with soldiers. The PM has also repeatedly highlighted their role in safeguarding the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty in his public speeches.PM Modi meeting and interacting with the JCOs and jawans during the Combined Commanders’ Conference is a major departure from tradition, and it will definitely send a positive message to all ranks of the armed forces, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.“Indian soldiers cost the minimum and deliver the maximum. Recognition by the PM will surely be a morale booster. It is an apt recognition of their sacrifices and professionalism, especially in view of the effective management of the LAC and LoC,” Bhatia added.The conference was traditionally held in Delhi but has been organised outside the national capital during the last five years. In the past, it has been held on India’s solitary aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Indian Military Academy, Dehradun and Jodhpur, among other places.The conference is being held at a time when Indian and China are negotiating disengagement in eastern Ladakh and the military is putting finishing touches to its theaterisation plan for the most advantageous utilisation of its resources to address growing security threats.Also, it comes on the back of Indian and Pakistani militaries last week announcing that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC from the midnight of February 24.The military is expected to make a presentation to the PM on the situation along the borders and progress made towards the creation of theatre commands, said the second official.India is set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May, as previously reported by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jawans-to-take-part-in-top-military-meet-for-first-time-pm-modi-to-address-it-101614777527913.html

He also sought AG’s consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Katju.Also Read | Nirav Modi's extradition to India cleared: What next“I have submitted a letter to Ld. Attorney General for India seeking consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Justice (Retd.) Markandey Katju for his extremely contemptuous remarks made in the Nirav Modi Extradition case,” Srivastava, an Advocate-on-Record with the apex court, tweeted on Wednesday.I have submitted a letter to Ld. Attorney General for India seeking consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Justice (Retd.) Markandey Katju for his extremely contemptuous remarks made in Nirav Modi Extradition Case. pic.twitter.com/G3TpNOPQheIn the letter, dated March 1, 2021, Srivastava noted that the request was being made under Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, read with Rule 3 (c) of the Rules to regulate proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court of India, 1975. He then recalled observations made by the UK judge on Katju’s testimony in connection with the case.On February 25, while clearing Modi’s extradition to India over the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, the District Judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Sam Gooze, observed that Katju’s testimony ‘was not reliable’ and had ‘hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda.’ Katju deposed as a witness for Modi in September 2020, arguing that the fugitive jeweller ‘would not receive a fair trial in India’ and that he was a ‘scapegoat being blamed for a financial crisis in India.’Also Read | UK Court terms Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trial unreliableSrivastava further wrote in his letter that the UK court’s judgement categorically noted that the day before the ‘contemptuous’ remark, Justice Katju also gave an ‘elaborate’ press commentary about it to the media. This, as per Srivastava, amounts to Katju ‘deliberately and willfully scandalising’ the Supreme Court and lowering its authority, not just in front of the UK court, but also in front of the public at large.He added that these statements can ‘undermine the dignity and authority’ of the Supreme Court, and also recalled an instance from 2016 when the court issued a Contempt Notice against the former judge for a ‘contemptuous’ Facebook post. Srivastava added that in this case too, there was a criminal contempt of the Supreme Court, also citing the example of the recent Prashant Bhushan case, and finally sought Venugopal’s nod to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Justice Katju.Nirav Modi’s case will next be taken to British home secretary Preeti Patel. If Patel also gives her nod, Modi will be extradited to India and lodged at Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-case-lawyer-says-ex-sc-judge-katju-made-contemptuous-remarks-101614776676482.html

Instead, celebrities prefer accepting a tree sapling.On Wednesday, when Telangana home minister Mohammad Mahmud Ali celebrated his birthday, he appealed to the people not to come to him with bouquets, but plant trees. The minister himself planted a sapling at Anjuman Khadim-ul-Muslimeen, an orphanage in Amberpet in Hyderabad.And the credit for encouraging politicians and other VIPs to take up tree plantation goes to 44-year-old Joginapalli Santosh Kumar, a Rajya Sabha member from Telangana Rashtra Samithi, who had taken up a unique initiative – Green India Challenge (GIC) – three years ago, to improve the state’s green cover.“Happy to plant a sapling on my birthday as part of #GreenIndiaChallenge initiated by @MPsantoshtrs Saab. Request everyone to take part in this noble initiative. #GIC,” the deputy chief minister tweeted.Unlike other politicians who keep themselves busy indulging in power politics, Santosh, as the MP prefers being called, is focussing on promoting tree plantation among people in a big way.“My objective is to see that there is greenery everywhere – whether it is a small house, or a street or a colony or a township. At a time when even the villages are turning into concrete jungles, there is every need to develop greenery in whatever little space we have, in order to make a better living,” says Santosh.The idea of the Green India Challenge came to Santosh in July 2018, when people were being carried away by fancy challenges on social media like “Ice Bucket Challenge” and “Rice Bucket Challenge.” He said instead of wasting time on such publicity programmes, he thought he would do something that was useful to society.“After discussing with my friends, I came up with this idea of challenging the people to plant tree saplings, which would go a long way in improving the green cover in the state. The inspiration for me was my uncle, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who took up this tree plantation programme in a big way in Siddipet when he was an MLA in ‘90s,” he said.The Green India Challenge – with “Hara Hai Toh Bhara Hai” slogan, tags people to plant a sapling, challenging three others to do the same to continue the chain. “Within no time, the challenge has got tremendous response. Politicians, officials, sportspersons, celebrities from film industries in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Bollywood, also took up the challenge and planted trees in their respective areas and posted the pictures on their respective social media platforms, which led to the campaign going viral,” Santosh said.The GIC has now emerged as one of the largest campaigns initiated by an individual, as more than 13 crore trees have been planted in different parts of the country.Taking the campaign to the next level, Santosh has been requesting corporate groups to take up the afforestation on a larger scale in as many as 88 forest blocks in and around Hyderabad.“In an attempt to encourage industrialists, I adopted 2,400 acres of reserve forest area at Keesara in Medchal-Malkajgiri district, two years ago and took up planting of 30,000 trees. The entire area has been fenced and now, there is a tremendous growth in the forest area,” he said.Inspired by him, chairman of Hetero Pharma B Parthasarathy Reddy adopted 2,543 acres of forest land at Narasapur to improve the green cover. “Popular actor Prabhas (of Bahubali fame) has also responded to adopt 1,650 acres of forest land at Kazipally. Another big industrial group has agreed to spend nearly ₹70 crore to take up tree plantation at Rachakonda forest area on the outskirts of the city,” he said.In an attempt to highlight the importance of afforestation, Santosh brought out a coffee-table book titled “Vriksha Vedam” which comprises slokas and literary renditions from various ancient scriptures like Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Sanskrit literary works and Buddhist literature that preached the importance of trees for the welfare of mankind.Santosh is planning to set up a Green India Foundation to take up the tree plantation programme extensively to all parts of the country. “I am planning to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be part of this campaign.

For His Holiness the Dalai Lama, we will make special provisions."Earlier, Kangra Chief Medical Officer Gurdarshan Gupta said the request by the CTA for vaccination of the Dalai Lama and the people living around him was sent to the government."Permission has come now and modalities are being worked out to vaccinate them. Since His Holiness is in self-quarantine, a request was made to vaccinate him at his own premises, and that is under consideration," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/request-to-vaccinate-dalai-lama-at-his-premises-is-under-consideration-kangra-authorities-101614774627616.html
03-03-2021||India||Kerala minister says notices to investment fund board 'cheap poll gimmick'||The Kerala government on Wednesday termed the Enforcement Directorate cases against the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for alleged violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act as a “cheap poll-time gimmick” to scuttle the state’s development.The ED had served notices to KIIFB CEO KM Abraham, former state additional chief secretary, and officials of the Axis Bank (banking partner) to appear for interrogation next week in connection with external borrowing through ‘masala bonds’.“It is a cheap poll-time gimmick. The ED was cooking up stories without even understanding the KIIFB. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was using central agencies to target the state,” said state finance minister Thomas Issac.Last week, addressing an election rally in Ernakulam, the union minister had questioned the role of KIIFB and its budgetary provisions.Issac dismissed the ED charge that ‘masala bonds’ violated FEMA, saying there were set guidelines for external borrowing and KIIFB received the permission of the Reserve Bank of India.Masala bonds are specialised debt instruments issued outside the country in Indian denomination rather than local currency. In 2019, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had attended the listing event at the London Stock Exchange.“The ED’s move is a violation of poll code. The union minister also violated the poll code and it will be resisted with the support of the people,” he said. He also alleged that an ED official, who is the son of a senior BJP leader, was entrusted with the case to go after the state during election time.BJP state president K Surendran lauded the ED’s move.“The state’s debt had risen manifold in the last five years. In the name of KIIFB Issac and others were literally looting the state. Let there be some accountability,” he said. In the last report the Comptroller and Auditor General had also recommended a probe against the KIIFB constitution and its funding mechanism. The ED is also likely to question Issac.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-says-notices-to-investment-fund-board-cheap-poll-gimmick-101614773956948.html
03-03-2021||India||‘Won’t lose match as stadium’s name is Narendra Modi’: Thackeray’s dig at Centre||Taking a swipe at the Centre over changing Motera stadium’s name to Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad, Maharashtra chief minister Udhav Thackeray on Wednesday said that his party doesn't need to learn Hindutva from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government."Someone said now we won't be losing any cricket matches because the name of the stadium has been changed. We won't be losing any match in that stadium... You erase name of Vallabh bhai (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), do not award Bharat Ratna to Savarkar (Veer Savarkar) and try to teach Hindutva to us," Thackeray said replying to a discussion on the Governor's address in the state assembly.Maharashtra chief minister’s remarks come days after the world’s largest cricketing arena in Ahmedabad was renamed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the presence of President Ram Nath Kovind, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union minister of state for sports Kiren Rijiju.At the inauguration of the stadium, which can accommodate 130,000 spectators, last month, Shah had said, “Ahmedabad will then be known as the sports city of India.” The sports minister on the other hand had said, “It is a proud moment for India and not just cricket. While it is the largest cricket ground, it’s also one of the most modern stadiums in the world.”Amid criticism by the opposition over renaming the stadium, Gujarat deputy chief Minister Nitin Patel earlier issued a clarification saying Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's name was never associated with the stadium."This stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) and it was always known as the Motera Stadium. So there is no question of renaming it now. It was Narendra Modi, who had first floated the idea to demolish the old stadium and build a new one when he was the GCA president," Patel said, adding that the Narendra Modi Stadium is part of a larger complex, named 'Sardar Patel Sports Complex'.Targeting the Congress over the issue, Union minister Prakash Javdekar had tweeted, “The name of the Sports Complex is Sardar Patel Sports Enclave. Only the name of the cricket stadium, within the complex, has been named after Narendra Modi. Ironically, 'The Family', which never respected Sardar Patel, even after his death, is now making hue and cry."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-lose-match-as-stadium-s-name-is-narendra-modi-thackeray-s-dig-at-centre-101614773464510.html

The chief minister had then termed it a historic occasion for the state. RJD was the lone party that had voted against the Bill in Parliament.“The upper caste cell has been formed for the first time. Earlier, most political parties formed cells as per reservation granted in the Constitution. With the upper caste poor also getting 10% quota, JD-U president RCP Singh formed one for them also,” said party’s upper caste cell president Dr Nitish Kumar ‘Vimal’ alias Nitish Kumar ‘Tantan’, who has been with the JD-U since its inception and was also part of the Samata party since 1994.He said the objective behind the ‘novel initiative’, which would also inspire other political parties, is to establish communication with people, try to know their issues and anger, if any, and ensure that the advantages of the government’s inclusive development approach reach them.“We will expand the cell up to the village, panchayat and block levels. A couple of days later, a large number of upper caste friends drawn from different fields will also join us at a formal function in front of the party president. The idea is to make JD-U more and more inclusive with space for all. Most of the government programmes are also inclusive in nature,” he added.He also cited the statement of a senior IPS officer Arvind Pandey, who called for the need of a separate ministry for the welfare of the poor among the upper castes. “Like other social groups, which have separate departments to look after their needs, the upper caste should also have one,” Pandey had said citing his personal views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bid-to-expand-base-after-poll-debacle-jd-u-forms-upper-caste-cell-101614772563844.html

She also warned that consumption of donkey meat violates the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) norms.“People should know that under FSSAI, donkey consumption is illegal,” said Dr Dhanalakshmi.The district of Prakasam continues to practise their ancient ritual of donkey slaughter. Dr Dhanalakshmi told ANI that “maximum complaints of illegal slaughtering of donkeys have been received from districts of Prakasam, Krishna, West Godavari, and Guntur,”.Illegal slaughter of this domesticated animal has been a constant issue in Andhra Pradesh - the state even released orders in the past against slaughter and consumption of donkeys.The illegal slaughter of donkeys for consumption is a violation of Section 11 in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, which amongst other provisions deems it illegal to “beat, kick, over-ride, over-drives, over-load, torture or otherwise treats any animal so as to subject it to unnecessary pain or suffering or causes or, being the owner permits, any animals to be so treated,”. It is also a punishable offence under Section 429 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), which states, “Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc., of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees. Whoever commits mis­chief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless, any elephant, camel, horse, mule, buffalo, bull, cow or ox, whatever may be the value thereof, or any other animal of the value of fifty rupees or upwards, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both,”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/official-worried-about-decline-in-donkey-population-in-andhra-pradesh-blames-misconception-101614772774343.html

They should teach their leaders first about simplicity.

The property is under the name of his wife Asha and located in Delhi's Palam area, the ED said.The shelter home was being run by NGO Seva Sankalp Evam Vikash Samiti, managed by Thakur.The ED accused Thakur of "misappropritating" funds received as grants from the government and other agencies in the name of the NGO. Grants-in-aid to the tune of ₹7.57 crore was siphoned off by Thakur and invested the same in his own name as well as in the name of his family members, the agency further said.The ED said that Thakur also spent money on his younger son Mehul Anand’s medical education."During money laundering investigation, it was revealed that the girls' shelter home in Muzaffarpur was found to be running in a highly questionable manner and several girls reported about violence and being abused sexually," the ED said, adding that Thakur raped the girls.The case pertains to sexual exploitation of 44 girls at the shelter home. The social welfare department had given a contract to the NGO to run the shelter home in Muzaffarpur town in 2013.Thakur’s NGO was selected over other NGOs in the bid as he was said to have close connections with senior politicians of the ruling party and some bureaucrats.

03-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand budget session: Chamoli cloud burst dominates Day 3||The recent Chamoli cloud burst accident dominated the third day of the Uttarakhand Budget Session on Wednesday with the Leader of the Opposition Indira Hridayesh raising the issue of disaster management, demanding a comprehensive policy for disaster management, including an early warning system for disaster. First, Congress MLAs staged a sit-in at the entrance of the House in Gharsain, holding placards against the government on Monday’s lathi-charge incident on which it had staged a walkout and sit-in protest on Tuesday as well. Villagers of the Ghat area have been agitating for the last two months in support of their demand for the widening of Nandprayag-Ghat motor road. The protest took an ugly turn when the agitators walked up to the Assembly, only to be stopped by the police which resorted to lathi-charge. Water cannons were also used to prevent agitators from reaching the Vidhan Sabha building. While the Congress has been raising the issue in the House for two days now, its MLAs also questioned the government on the Chamoli cloud burst and also the steps being taken to ensure such a disaster is handled better if it recurs. Congress MLAs raised the issue by moving an adjournment motion on the same as soon as the House commenced on Wednesday. It was, however, taken up for debate by the Speaker in Zero Hour. Hridayesh said, “Being a disaster-prone state, many lives have been lost in natural disasters such as floods, landslide, flash floods, and earthquake. Recently, the state faced the Chamoli disaster in which many people died after being trapped in the tunnel. Before that, the country was shaken by the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy. Considering all these, the government should consult experts and frame a comprehensive disaster management policy including an early warning system on the disaster so that lives aren’t lost.” She also cited the strategic importance of the border areas of the state. “The government should take efficient steps for disaster management in the border areas so as to prevent migration of residents from there as it is important from a strategic and security point of view to make the residents stay there.” Another Congress MLA from Ranikhet, Karan Mahra, questioned the government on resources required for handling such disasters. “In the Chamoli disaster, it was learnt that many people died in the tunnel after about five days due to lack of oxygen inside. If there was proper equipment to supply oxygen there, those lives could have been saved. The government should scan such equipment being used in other countries and procure them for better disaster management,” said Mahra. Congress MLA from Dharchula, Harish Dhami, cited flash floods and landslide in his constituency last year in which 21 people died and accused the government of “not doing enough for the disaster victims including rehabilitation and providing compensation”. “The disaster wreaked havoc in the area but the government seems not to be taking it seriously. But it is beyond understanding that the government is doing the rehabilitation of the affected families on the basis of the 2011 census for a disaster that happened in 2020,” said Dhami. Replying to the Opposition, parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik spoke about the various steps being taken on disaster management, including “forming a committee comprising scientists on February 22 in the aftermath of Chamoli disaster to provide suggestions to handle disasters in a better way”. “The government is working on an early warning system for disasters, but it would take some time as it is not an easy process and needs several analyses,” he said. “The government will install a second Doppler radar in the state, and weather warning equipment in 176 places. As many as 839 families from 395 disaster prone villages have been rehabilitated since 2013 Kedarnath tragedy,” he said.While Kaushik was still speaking, Congress MLAs Dhami and Rajkumar staged a walkout citing the government reply as “unsatisfactory.” The House also tabled two amendment bills related to providing land ownership rights to women and other related to the Panchayati Raj system in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-budget-session-chamoli-cloud-burst-dominates-day-3-101614771452531.html

Jaishankar, who is visiting at the invitation of his Bangladeshi counterpart AK Abdul Momen, will call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the day-long trip, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday. He will also hold talks with Momen. The visit follows on the virtual summit between the two countries on December 17 and will “provide an opportunity to take stock of the progress in bilateral relations”, the ministry said. Modi is set to visit Bangladesh to participate in celebrations on March 26 marking 50 years of the country’s independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations. This will be his first foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak. Modi was earlier scheduled to visit Dhaka in March last year, but the trip was called off because of the pandemic. Also Read | Jaishankar, New Zealand counterpart discuss peace and stability in Indo-PacificJaishankar’s talks with Momen are expected to review bilateral ties and focus on regional and international developments, including the situation in Myanmar following the February 1 coup and its impact on efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees to Rakhine state, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. India has worked to remove irritants in ties with Bangladesh over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and sped up work on several connectivity and transit projects. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla made his first foreign visit amid the pandemic to Dhaka in August last year and handed over a personal message from Modi to Hasina. During the virtual summit with Hasina on December 17, Modi described Bangladesh as an important pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy. The two sides signed seven agreements at the summit in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture and revived a cross-border railway line that was snapped 55 years ago, giving a boost to connectivity initiatives and energy cooperation. Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen visited India in January for foreign office consultations and India has provided two million doses of the Covishield vaccine to Bangladesh under the “Vaccine Maitri” initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-to-travel-to-bangladesh-tomorrow-to-prepare-for-pm-modi-s-visit-101614771032546.html

03-03-2021||India||BJP’s Hindutva push not in line with Tamil Nadu ally AIADMK||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s predicament in Tamil Nadu is best summed up by Tejasvi Surya, a Lok Sabha member from Karnataka who said on February 22 that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) “represents a bad, virulent ideology which is anti-Hindu”.“Every Tamil is a proud Hindu. This is the sacred land that has the highest number of temples... Every inch of Tamil Nadu is sacred, but DMK is anti-Hindu, so we must defeat it,” he said at a rally in Salem.The problem, of course, is that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the senior partner of the alliance of which the BJP is a part, has the same beliefs and ideologies as the DMK. Both are Dravidian parties that trace their provenance to a common parent, Periyar (E V Ramaswami), and his emphasis on rationalism and anti-Brahminism.Over the weekend, home minister Amit Shah took on the DMK and the Congress at a rally on the issue of corruption. “The Congress and the DMK together carried out a scam of ₹12 lakh crore when they were in alliance at the Centre,” he said. Only, this is unlikely to cut much ice in Tamil Nadu — and not the least because Shah and the BJP are trying to convince their ally the AIADMK to take VK Sasikala, just back from serving four years in jail in a disproportionate assets case, into the fold.These are just some of the contradictions the party has to manage in a state where it is a minor political player, and where it is seen as a Hindu and Hindi party. To be sure, the party, otherwise a vocal proponent of the Hindi language, has been extolling the virtues of Tamil in an effort to connect with Tamilians.And both national and local leaders are hoping that what worked for the party elsewhere — Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the emphasis on development — will work in the state.Addressing a rally in Coimbatore last week, Modi’s speech combined the BJP’s ideological standpoint with issues of governance that the party perceives has a wider resonance on the ground in the poll-bound state.The state will pick a new assembly on April 6.Senior party leaders said the BJP will take advantage of PM Modi’s governance model to woo voters in the state, including those who are either opposed to the BJP or are ambivalent towards it. “There is a section of people that sees the BJP as a Hindu party that seeks the imposition of Hindi. There is also a section that is impressed by the BJP’s governance model in other states and at the centre. The party has to win the confidence of both these sections,” said a BJP leader who asked not to be named.“The Vel Yatra was a sideshow. The discourse in Tamil Nadu has to be congruent to what the AIADMK, the senior partner in the coalition wants. The BJP’s stance should not dislodge the campaign,” the leader explained.The BJP is also hoping the dynastic nature of the DMK (MK Stalin’s son is expected to contest the elections, even as this is the former’s first real electoral test after the death of his father M Karunanidhi), and its partner, the Congress, will be an issue with voters.In a recent meeting, Shah said: “We can see 2G, 3G, 4G all in Tamil Nadu. 2G- 2 generations of Maran family; 3G -3 generations of Karunanidhi’s family; 4G- 4 generations of Gandhi family.”Political commentator Sumant C Raman concurred that since the BJP is the junior partner in the alliance, it will have to adhere to a campaign narrative that suits both partners.“...Also, in Tamil Nadu the hardline Hindutva stance will not help. The BJP has been smart, in keeping with the Dravidian ethos; instead of Lord Ram they have focused on Lord Muruga, which is why there was the Vel Yatra...,” he added.The party is also carefully crafting its image as that of a political outfit that is not in not in conflict with the prevalent sentiment of pride in the Tamil language and customs.A second BJP leader said the PM’s repeated reference to Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar over the years is an attempt to forge a connection with Tamilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-hindutva-push-not-in-line-with-tamil-nadu-ally-aiadmk-101614767608746.html

The remarks allegedly came when the discussion digressed towards the farm laws stir going in India for the past three months at the borders of the national capital of Delhi. The programme, however, has been edited and the part has been removed so what led to the remark could not be verified.Shame!!Honourable PM Modi and his mother abused live on air by a caller on a BBC radio show on Sikhs in the UK.#BanBBC#BoycottBBCIn the edited programme, at 1 hour 32 minutes, the anchor issued an apology for the abuses hurled by the caller on the BBC show. “We would like to apologise for the language used by a guest earlier. It’s a live show and we discuss controversial issues but there was no reason for the type of language that was used and I’d like to say sorry again for any offence that was caused,” Rai said.No Modi's mother on BBC show Every Indian's mother has been abused, ban BBC in any case #BoycottBBCNot only Modi's mother has been abused in BBC, but they disrespected each woman of India, each Mother of India...Shame on BBC...

03-03-2021||India||‘Biggest gift’: Residents along LoC in J&K welcome India-Pakistan ceasefire||Thousands of people living along the Line of Control in north Kashmir’s small hamlets are relieved after the director general of military operations (DGMO) of India and Pakistan decided on a ceasefire along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir.On Thursday, India and Pakistan agreed to observe a strict ceasefire along the LoC from February 24 midnight. A joint statement issued by the armies of both countries said the move followed a discussion between India’s director general of military operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha and his Pakistani counterpart Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria over their established telephone hotline. For the last several months, there has been a surge in ceasefire violations along the LoC both in Jammu and in Kashmir regions."This is not the first time a ceasefire was announced on the LoC. For us it’s always good because we know what ceasefire means to us. We can live peacefully in our villages along with our children," said Irshad Ahmad Khawja who lives at village Garkote on the LoC.He said that from the last several months, the residents living along the LoC had only one demand, construction of underground bunkers. "The bunkers were our only safety shield during the cross LoC shelling and many people even started building bunkers on their own. And if the ceasefire was implemented again we won’t need the bunkers."He claimed in the last two years, dozens of houses were destroyed in Uri and six people were killed in the cross LoC shelling alone in the villages."In our neighbouring village Balkote, a young woman was killed in November when shells hit her house leaving her four children orphaned," said Khawja.Another resident, Ajaz Ahmad Shah of village Silikote on the zero line, said for them, the ceasefire means new lease of life. "Dozens of families migrated from our villages as they wanted to escape from the daily shelling. We now hope people will return." Shah said he lost his cousin when a shell landed on her house in a neighbouring village last year in November. "Whenever there is shelling, we always start thinking it is going to be the end of our lives. We have been living a miserable life and now, we want peace to prevail."Since 2003, when India and Pakistan agreed on the ceasefire along the LoC, which remained successful till 2017, the people living in the bordering areas reaped the dividends. "During the ceasefire years, the villagers even used to harvest right up to the LoC. We used to have peaceful sleep all those years," said Bilal Ahmad of Izmerg village near LoC in Gurez in northern Bandipora district. Gurez witnessed a lot of cross LoC shelling last year. "We are hopeful that this ceasefire will be successful like the previous one, announced in 2003."Mohammad Sayed Peerzada, a resident of Tangdhar in border Kupwara district said that since the last two years, there has been an increase in the intensity of shelling in the region..." The shelling had become a routine, especially in the villages close to LoC. In Kupwara district, half a dozen civilians were killed and houses damaged. We are happy the ceasefire between India and Pakistan will restore peace and people can live peacefully," he said, adding that in the last three decades, people living close to LoC have lived very tough lives. "Now we want to live peacefully and it will be only possible when India and Pakistan abide by truce." He said the earlier truce on the LoC and the borders saw reopening of many routes between India and Pakistan... "Hope this ceasefire will be followed by reopening of routes between the two parts of Kashmir and other peace initiatives."Also Read: 'Not sedition to have views different from govt': SC junks plea against AbdullahThere are some, however, who were not much hopeful of the ceasefire lasting long. "Our experience tells us that these initiatives don’t last long," said Aftab Ahmad from Kupwara. "If it is successful this time, it will be the biggest gift to the border residents of the two countries."Last month, the ministry of defence, while replying to a question in parliament, said that Pakistan resorted to 5133 incidents of ceasefire violations in 2020 and there were 46 casualties last year due to these violations.Recently, outgoing 15 Corps commander, Lt General B S Raju told media persons that efforts will be made to make this ceasefire successful and termed the year 2020 as the most peaceful year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-gift-residents-along-loc-in-j-k-welcome-india-pakistan-ceasefire-101614766851251.html

Bhushan declared that the previous timeframe for vaccination between 9 am to 5 pm has been done away with in the Co-WIN 2.0 app. Bhushan maintained that ultimately it is up to the hospitals to decide whether they want to continue administering vaccines after 5 pm or not."Co-WIN 2.0 does not provide 9 am-5 pm vaccination sessions. It has done away with that timeline. If a hospital has the capacity, the system permits it to do vaccination even after 5 pm in consultation with the state government. This has been briefed both to the state governments as well as the private and government hospitals," said Bhushan.The second phase of vaccination commenced all over the country from March 1.

03-03-2021||India||‘Another Vyapam’: Agriculture officers recruitment exam candidates allege fixing||Ten top rankers in Madhya Pradesh’s examination to recruit officers for the agriculture department, committed the same mistakes and scored similar marks in the general knowledge paper of the entrance examination, conducted by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board, (MPPEB) on February 10 and 11. Several candidates have raised suspicion that it could be another Vyapam scam in the Central Indian state.The coincidence did not end here. According to information provided by MPPEB, their caste, their college and academic performance is also almost the same, raising question marks over the recruitment examination.The examination was held for 862 posts in the agriculture department and the answer sheets were released on February 17 with the list of probable selected candidates. It was then a suspicion was raised over the conduct of the examinations.The candidates alleged it was another recruitment exam scam in the state ---infamous for rigging of entrance to medical colleges in 2013-14, popularly known as Vyapam scam. They also asked how these candidates from one region and caste with poor academic backgrounds could score the highest marks in the recruitment exam, which doesn’t have any provision of an interview.A candidate from Indore, Ranjeet Ragunath, said, “This is the tip of the iceberg of a scam. All top ten highest scorers in the exam are from Chambal division and nine are from the same caste. They completed their Bachelor of Science (Agriculture) degrees from a government agriculture college in Gwalior. Almost all the candidates completed their four-year degrees in five or more years.”“Even, they told some of the ex-students of their college that they were going to be selected 100% and they said this before the exam, so they were sure. Either, they had the question papers, or they might have some arrangement like the candidates had during the Vyapam scam,” he alleged.“They also secured 195 and 194 marks out of 200 that are the highest scores in the history of the exam,” claimed Raghunath.“The candidates scored full marks in the general knowledge section. But our suspicion increased when the MPPEB released answer sheets on February 17 and gave wrong answers to three questions. Coincidently, the top scorers also gave the same wrong answers in their answer sheets. We don’t know whether it is a coincidence or conspiracy, but how it is possible that they gave the same wrong answers, especially of basic questions which we studied in class 11,” said another candidate Sachit Anand from Satna.One of the top scorers in the exam, who scored full marks in the maths section, had failed in the statistics exam several times and completed his degree in eight years, he added.A professor at the agriculture college Gwalior was also surprised over the marks of these candidates. Requesting anonymity, the professor said, “Maybe overnight they earned knowledge and scored qualification marks but it is hard to believe that they scored the highest marks.”The candidates also raised questions on MPPEB for selecting a blacklisted company to conduct the exam.“This is also unfortunate that MPPEB allowed a blacklisted company to conduct the exam. It is the same company that was blacklisted by UP after a question paper of recruitment exam for sub-inspectors got leaked in 2017. The incidents of leak of question papers were also reported in other exams including teachers’ recruitment test in Tamil Nadu and protection officers’ recruitment test in Railways,” said Rajesh Singh from Gwalior, a candidate.When contacted, state head of NSEIT, MP, Krishnan Dwivedi said, “We adopted a fair method while conducting the exam. The candidates have the right to raise their voices but only MPPEB is authorized to clear the doubts of candidates. We can’t comment on this issue.”Also Read: MP govt to seek right to take criminal action against controversial web seriesThe candidates also met farmers’ welfare and agriculture development minister Kamal Patel who assured of holding an inquiry in the matter.Patel said, “This could be a coincidence, but we will inquire into the matter.”MPPEB director Shanmuga Priya Mishra said, “They are levelling allegations because of a lot of coincidences. We are inquiring into the matter and have also asked the company. Till now, we didn’t find any adverse things or irregularities. But if we find something concrete, we will act accordingly.”The candidates in question couldn’t be contacted over the phone despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-vyapam-agriculture-officers-recruitment-exam-candidates-allege-fixing-101614761365920.html

In a given case, it may also be defamatory, depending on the type of use," the court said in its order.The order copy was made available on Wednesday."The fact that the image has been illicitly used is bad enough. It only makes matters worse when used in a plainly derogatory and demeaning vein," Justice Patel said.The court directed OTT platform Amazon to take down the movie within 24 hours until the said scene is deleted."It is not acceptable for them (movie's makers) to merely pixelate or blur the images. The entire sequence, which has the image of the plaintiff (Malik), is to be removed immediately," Justice Patel said.Malik's advocate Bedi had argued that the actor has a huge fan following on social media and has also appeared in a few Bollywood songs.Bedi argued that Malik's photo was used illicitly by the defendant in a Telugu movie titled 'V' that was released on Amazon on September 5, 2020.As per Malik's suit, she had commissioned a photographer in 2017 for creating a portfolio."In August 2017, she (Malik) posted some photographs from the portfolio on her Instagram account. One of these photos was used in a scene of the Telugu movie where there is reference to a commercial sex worker," Bedi said.According to the suit, this was an unauthorised invasion of privacy and unauthorised use of private material.It was defamatory to Malik that her image was used to depict her in the motion picture as an escort or commercial sex worker, it stated.Justice Patel in the order noted that the contentions raised by Malik and her lawyer were correct."Indeed, I do not believe there is any other way of looking at it," the order said.The defendant claimed that they had contracted with an agency to procure the image and had assumed that prior approval would have been taken from the woman, whose photo was to be used.The court, however, noted that this argument of the defendant seemed "less than compelling"."Surely any right-thinking motion picture producer would have insisted on seeing an approval or consent by the model or person who is featured or to be featured," Justice Patel said, adding that this must be the standard procedure everywhere.The court said once the defendant has made the necessary alteration and deletion, the same will have to be shown to Malik and her advocate."Only after this, I will allow defendant 3 (Amazon) to re-release the movie," Justice Patel said, posting the matter for further hearing on March 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-asks-amazon-to-take-down-film-over-actor-s-defamation-case-101614760879060.html

03-03-2021||India||Demand for gasoline, diesel in India will reach record 215.24 mln in 1 yr: PPAC||India, once the centre of global oil demand growth, expects its fuel consumption to bounce back during the coming year as the nation recoups the losses caused by Covid-19.Demand for gasoline, diesel and other fuels will reach a record 215.24 million tons in the 12 months through March 2022, according to estimates by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India’s oil ministry. That’s almost a 10% rebound from the current year, which has been hit hard by the virus.At one stage last year, India’s fuel consumption plunged by as much as 70%, led by the world’s biggest lockdown. The measures forced a sharp reduction in crude processing and imports, and helped drive a slump in international oil prices. On Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied nations will discuss how much crude to pump, and India is urging them to open the taps.Also watch: Fuel price hike: Petrol, diesel prices rise again after a pause of two daysThe world’s No. 3 oil importer and consumer expects strong demand for transport and industrial fuels to drive next year’s rebound. Consumption of diesel -- an economic barometer and the country’s most-used fuel -- will grow by more than 13%, as will demand for gasoline. Overall fuel demand in the current financial year, which runs to March 31, is expected to fall 8.5%.India’s economy pulled itself out of recession last quarter, helped by a boost in government spending and the reopening of an economy that’s mainly driven by domestic consumption. It was one of the few major economies to post growth in the final three months of 2020.A trend for more commuters to use personal cars -- instead of buses, trains and other modes of public transport -- is expected to drive India’s demand for gasoline.Demand for aviation fuel, which suffered the biggest blow, is estimated to grow more than 74% during 2021-22, but will remain a little lower than the pre-pandemic year, the PPAC’s projection showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-gasoline-diesel-in-india-will-reach-record-215-24-mln-in-1-yr-ppac-101614732427588.html

Andhra cops 'fact-check' them||Andhra Pradesh BJP leaders on Tuesday targeted chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s government alleging encroachment of a famous Hindu religious site at Edlapadu in Guntur district. The administration has, however, rejected the charge, pointing that the Christian religious site was not at the same place as a temple but more than a kilometre away.The controversy started with a series of tweets posted by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders alleging a Christian Cross was being built on a hillock close to a Hindu religious place at Edlapadu in Narasaraopet block in Guntur district. BJP state general secretary S Vishnuvardhan Reddy was among the first to post a message with some photographs on his Twitter handle, claiming that the “Christian conversion mafia” was encroaching upon the place where goddess Sita’s footprints and carving of Lord Narasimha existed.“No place for Hindus in AP under @ysjagan govt. Attacks on Hindu temples continue,” he tweeted.Soon, Reddy’s tweet was retweeted by BJP state president Somu Veerraju, who claimed illegal construction was happening at the Hindu religious place.“All this is happening with the support of the administration and @ysjagan government. @BJP4Andhra and @RSSorg protested against illegal construction in the past but the administration is in no mood to stand for Hindus,” he tweeted.Later, BJP national secretary and co-in-charge of Andhra Pradesh affairs, Sunil Deodhar also raised the issue. “See huge illegal Cross in Edlapadu, AP, where once footprints of #SitaMata existed. Carving of Lord Narasimha exists at the back. In Guntur district, Christian mafias have created havoc. @BJP4Andhra and @friendsofrss protested but the administration tacitly supported. #Encroachment4ChristinAP.”The tweets went viral among BJP and other Sangh groups, evoking loud protests at a time when YSR Congress party is busy campaigning for elections to municipalities and municipal corporations in the state.A YSR Congress party leader from Guntur, who refused to be quoted, said the controversy over Edlapadu hills was totally unwarranted and the BJP, which has little stake in the municipal elections, was only trying to gain some political mileage.The Guntur (Rural) police issued a clarification through Twitter on Wednesday. “Fact check: THEY ARE COMPLETELY 2 DIFFERENT HILLOCKS and there is absolutely NO encroachment of the hill where Narasimha Swami idol is there ..(check videos by our SHO) Request to use Twitter to spread love, unity and peace,” the tweeted.Fact check : THEY ARE COMPLETELY 2 DIFFERENT HILLOCKS and there is absolutely NO encroachment of the hill where Narasimha Swami idol is there ..(check videos by our SHO)Request to use Twitter to spread love, unity and peace..@APPOLICE100 @dgpapofficial @ysjagan pic.twitter.com/lc7HZpq6c5Also Read: 4 killed in car crash in AP's Anantapur, liquor bottle found near driverNarasaraopet sub-collector Srivas Nupur said there was absolutely no truth in the claim about the encroachment of the hillock hosting the Hindu religious sites. He said there was an old Mother Mary temple at an adjacent hill at Yerragonda hillock in the same village and local RCM Church authorities sought district administration’s permission to construct steps for the devotees to reach the temple.“However, even before the government gave any permission, the church authorities started constructing steps and erecting a huge cross. On coming to know about it, the police and revenue authorities went there and stopped the works. Appropriate action would be taken on the directions of the government,” Nupur said.He clarified that both the hillocks hosting religious sites of the Hindu and the Christians were located at a distance of one and a half kilometre. “So, I request people not to believe in rumours but maintain restraint,” the sub-collector said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-claims-encroachment-of-hindu-site-in-andrha-govt-advices-against-rumours-101614753318359.html

The first draft list of the OBC community will be released on June 1 and objections will be invited till June 5. The commission is expected to come up with the final list by June 11, said officials.The decision to hold the survey came exactly a year after the Union ministry of home affairs rejected a proposal of the state cabinet for census of socially and educationally backward classes and other backward classes/castes during the 2021 general census. Soon after the Centre's rejection, Patnaik tabled the Odisha State Backward Classes (Amendment) Bill in the state assembly enabling the Backward Class Commission survey of the social and economic conditions."The State doesn’t have access to any recent data on this as the last census was done in 1931 which is almost 90-year old. This data is not enough for accurate and focused planning to reach out to the backward classes of the society,” the chief minister said last year while tabling the bill."It's an attempt to create an OBC votebank and this would be the first attempt in Odisha to influence voting through caste lines. BJD would certainly get some benefit out of the exercise," said former minister Bijoy Mohapatra.Though, the other backward castes account for 54% of Odisha's population, caste has never been a factor in state's politics unlike Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Karnataka. Neither the OBCs, nor the tribal and Dalits, who form 24% and 17% of the state’s population respectively, have ever voted en bloc in the past.Political analysts said the decision to start an OBC survey may have been triggered by fears of opposition BJP trying to target them ahead of next year's panchayat polls. Senior BJP leader and union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, himself an OBC, in a recent letter to chief minister Patnaik, had urged the state government to reserve seats for students belonging to the OBC category and the socially and economically backward classes.Though the BJD won 113 of the 147 assembly seats in 2019 assembly polls with 44.6% vote share, the BJP, was not far behind with 38% votes, though it could win only 23 seats, becoming the principal opposition party."Since last few elections, BJD has assiduously cultivated a woman votebank through programmes like ‘Mission Shakti’ that have created over 6 lakh self help groups. By beautifying religious places like Jagannath temple in Puri and Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar as well as several other famous temples across the state, it is trying to play a religious card before the BJP does it. By playing an OBC card it wants to upstage BJP in that segment," said Gyana Ranjan Swain, a political science professor.Many others feel Naveen Patnaik may be wary of consolidation of Paikas or Khandayats (a militia caste) behind the BJP as a result of the party’s efforts in the last few years through several events including the 200th anniversary of the famous Paika rebellion against the British and a memorial for the fallen Paikas on the foothills of a mountain near Bhubaneswar. Khandayats are the martial race of Odisha who are numerically superior with 22% share in population. Though they figure in the Odisha’s list of SEBCs, they are not in the Central list of OBCs and hence excluded from any reservation."The OBC survey seems to be a strategy to induct the Khandayats in the OBC list but exclude the creamy layer among them so as to prevent their future consolidation behind the BJP," said Biswaranjan Mohanty of Congress.Also Read: Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik inaugurates hostels for ST/SC studentsSajjan Sharma of BJP said the survey was just to hoodwink the OBCs in the state as the key to any survey was implementation. "The government is known for conducting such things, but it fails when it comes to execution." said Sharma.Former union minister Srikant Jena, himself a backward caste leader, said BJD’s real motive was suspect. “Naveen Patnaik government could have appealed before the Supreme Court after the Odisha high court in 2017 struck down the Odisha Reservation of Posts and Services (for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes) Act that provisioned for 27% reservations for the OBCs in government jobs. I wonder what kind of socio-economic survey would be completed within two months," he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-opposition-says-obc-survey-bid-to-create-vote-bank-by-naveen-patnaik-101614749722304.html
03-03-2021||India||Goa ecologists, miners oppose Centre’s proposed amendments to mining act||The Goa mine workers and environmentalists have come together to oppose the proposed amendments to the Mines and Minerals Development (MMDR) Act, 1957, which gives the Centre powers to auction mines in states, terming it a step backwards.In a series of communiques sent to the Union ministry of mines, the Goa Foundation has said the proposed amendments will “essentially enable the Center to force states to sell their family silver at a below-market price that the Center sets.”The Central ministry sent out a notice asking stakeholders and the general public to comment on the proposed amendments, which, among other things, included provisions to transfer the statutory clearances of expired mining leases and allows the Centre to auction mines in case of difficulties faced by the states, a provision crucial to Goa since it has not been able to auction its mines despite passing of more than two years since the Supreme Court order to grant fresh mining leases.Referring to mineral resources as a shared inheritance, owned by state governments as a trustee for the people, akin to the family silver, the Goa Foundation has said that ‘forcibly’ auctioning the mines at less than market value would amount to ‘cheating’.“How would states then fulfil their duties as public trustees to conserve the shared inherited mineral wealth if they have no control over if, when or how they sell their family silver? How would states meet intergenerational equity? These proposals violate the principle of subsidiarity and the federal structure of our Constitution,” Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares, said.We urge state governments to urgently examine the consequences of these proposals on the federal structure of our Union, the constitutionality of these proposals, especially in light of their role as public trustees over the shared inheritance of mineral wealth on behalf of the people and future generations, he added further.The Goa Mining People’s Front, a collective of mine worker unions, has however said that owing to Goa’s peculiar case unless the state’s legacy issues are resolved all attempts to resolve Goa’s mining impasse were bound to fail.“A petition challenging the Union Government’s move to convert Goa’s mining concessions as granted by the Portuguese to mining leases is pending before the Supreme Court for the last two decades. Unless that matter is disposed of no progress can be made,” Puti Gaonkar the president of the GMPF, said.“If the matter is resolved one way or another then the state or Central governments are free to proceed with the grant of fresh leases either through auction or any other means available,” Gaonkar said. “If any decision is taken prematurely, the existing mine owners will further seek to stay the process that could leave Goa’s mining in litigation for another ten years and further delay the restart,” he added.Officials in the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA), a body of mine owners, said they have written to the Centre expressing reservations over the proposed amendments, especially the clause that empowers the Union government to auction mining leases since it will be prejudicial to their claims over the mining leases. A GMOEA spokesperson, however, remained tight-lipped on the communique.Besides the challenge to the abolition of concessions to leases, a bunch of Goa’s mine operators led by Vedanta are also before the Supreme Court claiming that their leases are eligible to be renewed up to 2037 -- a period of 50 years with effect from 1987 -- if the law as it currently stands is applied retrospectively. The matter is currently being heard by the Supreme Court.Also Read: Activist in Goa files anticipatory bail plea fearing arrest in 'toolkit' caseThe Goa mining industry at its peak contributed 16% to the State GDP but has now reduced to a mere 0.2% owing to its shutdown in the state since the Supreme Court cancelled Goa’s 88 active mining leases in February 2018. The SC ruled that the renewals were illegal and asked the state government to grant fresh leases in tune with the existing policy.However, with the state government being reluctant to auction the leases, which is now the de facto means to grant fresh leases since the 2015 amendments to the MMDR Act, the situation has remained deadlocked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-ecologists-miners-oppose-centre-s-proposed-amendments-to-mining-act-101614746800131.html

On Tuesday, the 24-hour infection tally was at 12,286. Recoveries reached 10,812044 with 13,123 recoveries reported in the past 24 hours. With an infection tally higher than the recovery, India's active caseload on Wednesday stood at 1,70,126.On Tuesday, India's active cases were around 1.68 lakh. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat are contributing maximum to the number of daily cases, the Union health ministry said. Six states and UTs, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Goa, Chandigarh, Punjab and Gujarat, have a weekly positivity rate higher than the national average of 2 per cent. Maharashtra leads all the states with a weekly positivity rate of 10.02 per cent, the ministry said on Tuesday.Maharashtra reported 7,863 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, taking the state's caseload to 21,69,330.Kerala on Tuesday reported 2,938 new Covid-19 cases and 16 deaths.Punjab on Tuesday reported 730 new Covid-19 cases, while Tamil Nadu and Gujarat added 462 and 454 new cases, respectively.The Centre has deputed high-level multi-disciplinary teams to several states witnessing this sudden spike in the number of daily infections to ascertain the reason behind the rise.The sudden spike in daily infections comes after the Covid-19 situation became stable in January. The rise is seen as a combined effect of restrictions being eased everywhere and people slipping into the comfort of complacency. Several states have imposed local restrictions to contain the spread of the infection. Vaccination is also gaining pace as the second phase of the drive is now open to senior citizens and those with co-morbidities between the age group of 45 to 59.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-14-989-fresh-covid-19-infections-india-s-active-cases-surge-past-1-7-lakh-101614744939822.html

In a statement titled "Amazon Prime Video Apologizes", the company on Tuesday said it deeply regrets viewers considered certain scenes to be objectionable."This was never our intention, and the scenes that were objected to were removed or edited when they were brought to our attention. We respect our viewers' diverse beliefs and apologize unconditionally to anyone who felt hurt by these scenes," it added.The political thriller web series has been ebroiled in controversies since its release in January on Amazon. The Saif Ali Khan-starrer deleted the controversial scenes, but it didn't save the series from political wrath. Three FIRs were registered in Uttar Pradesh's Lucknow, Noida, and Shahjahanpur, two FIRs were lodged in Madhya Pradesh while one FIR each was lodged in Karnataka and Bihar. Apart from the FIRs, at least three other criminal complaints are pending in Maharashtra, Delhi, and Chandigarh, respectively.In January, Aparna Purohit, 'Tandav' actor Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub, and the makers had approached the Supreme court seeking protection from arrest on the FIRs. The top court at that time denied granting interim protection.The appellants then moved to the Allahabad high court which on February 25 declined to give them protection. "Such people make the revered figures of the religion of majority community source of earning money in a most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of the country," the court in its order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-row-supreme-court-to-hear-amazon-prime-head-s-anticipatory-bail-plea-101614743615563.html

This was probably the first such action against digital news anywhere in the country -- four days after a gazette notification on the new digital media rules were published.However, on Tuesday, I&B minister Prakash Javadekar told HT: “The rules are very clear that a DM does not have the power to issue such a notice. The mechanism is mostly self-regulatory and only in very serious cases can they complain to the ministry.”A letter written by I&B ministry secretary Amit Khare to Manipur chief secretary Rajesh Kumar said that the powers under the new rules “have not been delegated to the state governments/district magistrate/police commissioner”. It said the rules are to be administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting.The show is hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the present Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and who has been jailed three times.The notice issued by Naorem Praveen Singh, district magistrate of Imphal West district, said: “It has come to the notice of the undersigned that you are providing online services on news and current affairs on the social media platform.”The publisher/intermediary were directed to “furnish all relevant documents that you ensure compliance of the provisions” of the new rules “failing which steps as deemed fit shall be initiated without further notice”.On Tuesday evening, a letter addressed to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi was issued by the same DM, mentioning that the notice issued earlier “stands withdrawn with immediate effect”.The programme Khanasi Neinasi is around two months old and besides being broadcast, it was also telecast on the YouTube channel of Frontier Manipur, an Imphal-based digital news platform.“We have hosted just four to five shows. The last show aired on February 28 (a day before the notice was issued) was titled ‘Media Under Siege: Are Journalists Walking a Tightrope’” Kishorechandra, who’s also an associate editor of Frontier Manipur, said over the phone from Imphal.“It is not the responsibility of the district magistrate or the state government to issue such notifications. It seems they realised their mistake and decided to withdraw the earlier notice,” Kishorechandra added.Frontier Manipur has a collaboration with another news portal call Seven Salai and uses the latter’s infrastructure. Paojel Chaoba is the publisher as well as executive editor of Frontier Manipur.Kishorechandra was first arrested in November 2018 for uploading a video on social media which was critical of the government of Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh.Several charges under IPC that included sedition and National Security Act were slapped against him. He was released in April 2019 after the Manipur high court revoked his detention.He was again arrested in September 2020 on charges of sedition and promoting enmity between different groups on social media. Kishorechandra was released in December 2020 following which he joined Frontier Manipur and started hosting the talk show.In January this year, Chaoba and Dhiren Sadokpam, editor-in-chief of Frontier Manipur, were detained for over 24 hours based on an FIR filed by a police officer for publishing an opinion piece titled ‘Revolutionary Journey in a Mess’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-sends-notice-to-journalist-citing-digital-media-rules-withdraws-it-after-centre-steps-in-101614742815763.html

The NCB recently repatriated him back to BSF after his name cropped up during questioning of the drug trafficking accused arrested last year. The NIA also raided Kumar’s residence.Kumar was arrested after several hours of questioning on Monday.

In a statement in December, the NIA said the accused in the case were involved in cross-border smuggling of heroin in huge quantities from Pakistan and supplying it to Jammu & Kashmir and other parts of the country. “They were also in regular communication with the operatives of proscribed terrorist organisations Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), using encrypted chat platforms.

The ministry released a state-wise list of all these hospitals.Long wait times, glitches in Co-WIN slow vaccine driveAs vaccination gathered pace on March 2, the second day of 2nd phase vaccination, the Centre said if private hospitals have an adequate number of vaccinators, adequate space for observation of the vaccinated, adequate cold chain management and adequate arrangement for the management of any adverse effect, then states/UTs can proactively make efforts to use these private hospitals as vaccination centres.Private hospitals have also been asked to open vaccination slots for 15 days to a month so that people can book their appointment in advance. In the first two days, private hospitals were allowing advanced booking for only a day or two.The Centre has also asked states to not store vaccines or to create a buffer stock, apprehending any future shortage. It also asked the government to supply vaccines to hospitals for the entire duration for which sessions have been planned. "States/UTs should not store, reserve, conserve or create a buffer stock of the Covid vaccines at the state and district levels. The Central Government has adequate stock and will provide the required vaccine doses to the States and UTs," the health ministry said at a high-level review meeting on Tuesday with additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries of states and UTs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-private-hospitals-to-becomecovid-19-vaccine-sites-centre-allows-states-to-decide-101614741077452.html

"I think that was a mistake. Absolutely, that was a mistake. And my grandmother said as much. But the Congress party did not want to capture India's institutions. We do not have that capability," Rahul Gandhi said."What RSS is doing today is something different. They are capturing all constitutional institutions. So even if we defeat the BJP, we are not going to get rid of the RSS people in the institutions," Gandhi said citing the present situation in Pondicherry. He also mentioned how the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh could not work because of the RSS force in all institutions.LIVE: My interaction with Prof Kaushik Basu @Cornell University https://t.co/GfErZtSpW2On being asked about internal democracy in the party, Rahul Gandhi said to Basu, "You are asking this to a person who has been pushing for elections in the party, in youth organisations for a decade. I was literally crucified for this. I have been attacked by my party people."Can you do push-up with 1 hand, Rahul Gandhi asks TN students. Then a demo"Nobody asks whether there is internal democracy in BJP, BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) or Samajwadi Party (SP). There is a reason. We are an ideological formation. So it is more important for us to be democratic. It doesn't matter whether others are," Rahul added.Talking about Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, Rahul Gandhi said it was more painful for him as a son to see Rajiv Gandhi walking towards his death, knowing that he won't come out of what he was fighting than the actual death."It made me understand violence. It made me understand the other. So I remember it's a strange thing, I saw my father's killer lying on a Sri Lankan beach. And I felt bad for him. I was really upset for him. He is somebody else's father. So when someone talks about violence, I sort of sit quietly and say you don't actually understand violence. That's why you are so enamoured by you.""When Prabhakaran (LTTE leader) died, I picked up my phone and called my sister and said Priyanka this is strange that I am feeling bad. I should be happy about this. I am feeling disturbed that why are they humiliating the man like this. And Priyanka said she was feeling the same," Gandhi said.Talking about the RSS model, Rahul Gandhi said a former RSS person met him and explained to him the entire model."He said the innovation of Narendra Modi is to take large capital and fund RSS which used to be an organisation of small shopkeepers. So now the model is to scale up RSS using 2,3,5,7 crony capitalists. The Gujarat model is actually giving thousand of crores to RSS modules," Rahul said."He told me that the model was first tried on Pramod Mahajan. But it failed. It was done well by Narendra Modi in Gujarat. Crony capitalists have found out that to capture the political system, the route is through RSS," Rahul Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/emergency-was-a-mistake-says-rahul-gandhi-talks-about-father-prabhakaran-101614735905813.html

03-03-2021||India||Climate crisis to cost $100 billion to Indian firms in next 5 years: Report||Top Indian companies estimate an economic impact of about ₹7.14 lakh crore (nearly US$100 billion) over the next five years from the risks posed by the climate crisis, according to a report by CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), an organisation that works on a global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions.The report, titled “Building Back Greener”, said the numbers were based on responses by 42 of 220 Indian companies that responded to investor requests and disclosed climate data. Of the 220 companies that were covered by CDP, 60 are among BSE’s top 200.The report also highlighted that growing disclosure requirements were prompting more Indian businesses to wake up to the threat of the climate crisis, and commit to reducing their carbon footprints.Around 88% of 67 large companies covered by CDP reported incentivising top management for climate-related actions; 99% of the responding sample have board-level oversight of climate-related issues, the report said. Out of the 220 companies covered by CDP’s disclosure project 67 are large businesses and the rest are micro, small and medium enterprises.Meanwhile, the number of companies that identified the financial or strategic impact of climate-related risks rose from 88% in 2019 to 94% this year, as compared to the previous report released last year. Among the principal areas of concern were direct operations (the most severely affected and the exposed most to physical risks), followed by emerging regulations, and market risks.“Forty-two of 67 responding companies have monetised the economic impact of climate risks. The rest didn’t monetise the risks but did mention the risks they were facing. Most companies said they faced economic impacts from current and emerging regulations... They also fear emerging regulations like emission caps or emission trading schemes,” said Damandeep Singh, Director CDP India.He added that there were other risks such the impact of the climate crisis where valuation of their companies may fall; the future of the oil and gas sector; and impact on their reputations for being seen as not doing enough.The report said that four Indian companies — Hindustan Zinc, IndusInd Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tech Mahindra -- have made it to the CDP. A list for the first time in recognition of their bold climate action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-crisis-to-cost-100bn-to-indian-firms-in-next-5-years-report-101614732253720.html
03-03-2021||India||Delhi Assembly session next week: Govt may table state budget on March 9||The Delhi assembly’s budget session will be held from March 8 till March 16, the Delhi government announced on Tuesday after the state Cabinet finalised the dates.HT has learnt that the economic survey and outcome budget 2020-21 is likely be tabled on March 8, while the 2021-22 state budget — the seventh by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in its three terms in power — will be tabled on March 9.The Delhi Assembly last held a session on December 17 and 18, a special meet to debate the three contentious farm laws and an alleged ₹2,400 crore scam in the city’s civic bodies.The Delhi government proposed a ₹65,000 crore budget outlay for 2020-21, the highest till date and around 8.33% higher than the previous financial year’s expenditure. The total outlay in the AAP government’s first budget, presented in 2015-16, was ₹41,500 crore.This will be the first after the Covid-19 pandemic, with the infection and consequent lockdown severely denting the state government’s revenue.For 2020-21, Delhi had pegged budgeted revenue receipts (excluding borrowings) at ₹55,309 crore. Revised estimates for the year will be mentioned in the upcoming budget (2021-22) and actual revenue receipts for the year will reflect in the budget after that. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said last month that the government’s revenues dropped by around 42% because of the pandemic.The 2020-21 budget was tabled in the Assembly on March 23, even as Delhi planned a week-long lockdown, and the nation-wide lockdown had not been announced till then.The Delhi Budget this year (2021-22) is likely to focus on health, basic infrastructure and transport, said senior officials who are drafting the document.The senior officials said this year’s health budget will see allocations related to Covid-management and vaccination. In the last budget, the government made a special allocation of ₹50 crore to provide for adequate quarantine facilities to fight the infection.The other major investment, according to officials, is likely to be the cloud-based health information management system (HIMS) – a project the government plans to roll out in August this year.The HIMS project envisages digital health cards for patients, which will be essentially a QR code-based system that will keep a record of clinical details such as health checks, follow-ups, surgeries, medications and vaccinations for each patient. The system is also supposed to include a mobile phone application as well as a 24x7 call centre to help patients with health-related information, fix consultations and other assistance.The upcoming budget is also likely to see allocations to upgrade hospitals and increase bed capacities in state government facilities, said officials.“The Delhi government should invest in creating a strong and vibrant public health system, beyond hospitals. A strong public health system will help the Capital not only handle epidemics like Covid-19 but to address all sorts of health crises,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).In its past budgets, the AAP government has consistently allocated the maximum share of its resources for education, followed by health. This year, health care and medical infrastructure are likely to see increased allotments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-session-next-week-govt-may-table-state-budget-on-march-9-101614730159415.html
03-03-2021||India||Long wait times, glitches in Co-WIN slow vaccine drive||People seeking coronavirus vaccines in several parts of the country reported long waiting times, and being turned away because doses had not arrived at centres even when they reached after an appointment, as glitches continued in the Co-WIN platform for the second day of the campaign opening up to eligible members of the general public.Close to five million registrations — which officials estimate could include 10 million people — took place in the 24 hours after the government began accepting sign-ups and appointments from people above 60 and those older than 45 with specific medical conditions.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The Co-WIN platform can get very slow, which is why we turned away some appointments. I think it is not able to take the load. Most people prefer coming to the hospital directly for registration, which leads to overcrowding,” said a staff member at a private Delhi hospital, requesting not to be identified.The hospital in question vaccinated close to 250 people on Tuesday but had to turn away several for lack of time. “We came here around 3pm but were told that due to the rush, our turn won’t come before 5pm. Now when we have returned at 5pm, they closed the doors,” said Anita Kapur, 65, who had come from Noida to get the shot at Max Hospital in Saket.“I am not denying that people are facing difficulty in registering but it has been just a day since the facility was opened for general population so there will be logistical issues even regarding medicines, but it will all get streamlined in a few days,” said RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid Vaccination, during Union health ministry’s briefing on Tuesday.“Scalability is of a concern to us. But from the supply-side hospitals will have to publish their time table and sessions, which means it is like a train time table wherein hospitals are like trains and citizens are making reservations. That is how the system is supposed to work, and state governments are coordinating with the hospitals; and supply of vaccines to them is happening through the state governments. We are encouraging them to provide vaccines to them and involve more private hospitals,” he said.On Tuesday, there were close to 600,000 doses given, taking the total number of shots administered since January 16 (when the drive began) to 15.5 million.Admitting that there were glitches, Sharma said, “…Unfortunately glitches are something which has become associated with IT systems in India. Initially, there were glitches in the first version of the programme, which were rectified.”Close to 27,000 hospitals are currently providing Covid-19 vaccination across the country, including 12,500 hospitals in the private sector empaneled under Ayushman Bharat, Central Government Health Scheme and State health insurance scheme.Sharma and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level review meeting with states, directing them to involve for Covid-19 vaccination even those private hospitals that are not empanelled under any government scheme to open more options for people if required.States were also asked to utilise 100% capacities of private hospitals functioning as COVID Vaccination Centres (CVCs).The Centre also asked states to ensure adequate quantity of vaccines was maintained in all hospitals both government and private during the entire duration, to enable them to function as CVCs in a smooth manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-wait-times-glitches-in-co-win-slow-vaccine-drive-101614729949567.html
03-03-2021||India||Wife not husband’s chattel, can't be forced to live with him, says Supreme Court||A woman is not a chattel to be forced to live with her husband, observed the Supreme Court on Tuesday, hearing a case where a man sought an order from the court to his spouse to start living with him again. Chattel means slave or a tangible piece of property.“What do you think? Is a woman a chattel that we can pass such an order? Is a wife a chattel that she can be directed to go with you?” asked an SC bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta while hearing the man’s petition.At the core of the dispute is an April 2019 order on restitution of conjugal rights, passed in favour of the man under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) passed by a family court at Gorakhpur. The woman maintained that she was tortured by her husband over dowry after their marriage in 2013, compelling her to move out. In 2015, after she filed a case seeking maintenance, a Gorakhpur court asked the husband to pay her ₹20,000 a month. The husband filed his plea for restoration of conjugal rights in the family court after this.Once the Gorakhpur family court issued its restitution order, the man went to court, questioning the payment of maintenance when he is willing to live with her. He raised a point of law on his obligation to keep paying maintenance even after obtaining an order restoring his conjugal rights. The Allahabad high court refused this, following which he appealed in the Supreme Court.In her defence, the woman, through her lawyer Anupam Mishra, said the husband’s entire “game” was to avoid paying maintenance and pointed out that he approached the family court only after being ordered to do so. In the course of Tuesday’s hearing, the man’s lawyer said the top court should persuade the woman to go back to her husband, especially since the family court has ruled in the man’s favour. Mishra, representing the wife, countered thiat an appeal on that order is pending before the Allahabad high court.The persistent demand by the man to enforce the return of his wife prompted the bench to say: “Is a woman a chattel? Is a wife a chattel? You are asking us to pass an order for this as if she can be sent to a place where she does not want to go, like a chattel.” The bench declined the husband’s request for enforcement of conjugal rights, reminding him that his appeal before the top court was arising from dismissal of his petition by the Allahabad high court against the order to pay maintenance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-not-husband-s-chattel-can-t-be-forced-to-live-with-him-top-court-101614729536178.html
03-03-2021||India||SC tells states to install CCTVs in police stations, probe agencies in 5 months||The Centre and states were in the firing line on Tuesday before the Supreme Court for not complying with a three-month old order to install CCTVs in all interrogation rooms of central investigating agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency and police stations across the country.The Court accused the Centre of “dragging its feet” and directed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file a reply in three weeks indicating clear timelines for installation of closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) in the offices of CBI, NIA, Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Serious Fraud Investigation Office and any other agency having power of arrest and interrogation. The next hearing in the case will be on April 6.Court-appointed amicus curiae senior advocate Siddhartha Dave prepared a chart indicating unsatisfactory response from states as well with some proposing to achieve compliance of Court’s December 2, 2020 order by end of 2023.“These are matters of utmost moment concerning the citizenry of the country,” the bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said, asking most of the states to complete the process of budgetary allocation and installation of CCTVs by August this year. Relaxations were made for poll-bound states of West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and the largest state of Uttar Pradesh to achieve this task by the year-end.Bihar got the longest time of one-year to achieve compliance after the Court expressed serious displeasure on the state’s affidavit that neither disclosed a timeline or details of budget allocation. “It shows complete lack of any regard to the citizenry’s fundamental rights or orders of this Court,” the bench remarked. Two other states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan got a slight leeway by getting an additional one-month to the five-month rule owing to its large size. The MP government, which shelved the budget allocation for CCTV project to 2023, was pulled up by the Court for dragging its feet. The bench did not appreciate Jharkhand’s decision to get the task done by 2024. Terming the deadline “unrealistic”, the bench told the state not to “play around” with the Court’s order.The December 2 order required states and Centre to install high-definition CCTVs with night vision, audio recording and storage facility of a minimum period of 12 months to 18 months. In areas which faced power outages and issues of internet connectivity, the Court directed the respective state governments to provide the same expeditiously.About CCTVs in police stations, the Court directed installation of one CCTV each at all entry and exit points, main gate of the police station, all lock-ups, all corridors, lobby/ reception area, all outhouses, Inspector's room, Sub-Inspector's room, areas outside the lock-up room, station hall, in front of the police station compound, outside (not inside) washrooms/toilets, Duty Officer’s room, and back area of the police station.The states required to complete the installation of CCTVs in five months are Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Goa, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Nagaland and Odisha. The union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, and Daman and Diu were also directed to comply with the same timeline.Delhi sought nine months to make existing CCTVs equipped with audio recording and storage facility but the top court gave the National Capital Territory government four months to comply fully with its judgment.Punjab submitted to the Court that CCTVs were already installed in all police stations in 2018 but the same were not in accordance with the requirements set out by the December 2 order. Andhra too reported partial compliance. As an exception, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh got seven months to complete the installation work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-states-to-install-cctvs-in-police-stations-probe-agencies-in-5-months-101614711997938.html
03-03-2021||India||SC backs taxpayers in software royalty case||esolving a two-decade-old taxation conundrum, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that payments made by an Indian resident to a foreign recipient for the import of software that is to be sold in India will not be assessable as “royalty”. A top court bench, headed by justice Rohinton F Nariman, held that such payments for the use of software “will not give rise to any income taxable in India” and therefore, no liability would accrue for the resident firms to deduct TDS under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act.The bench, which also included justices Hemant Gupta and BR Gavai, clarified that the ruling will apply across the board; when a computer software is purchased directly by an end-user resident in India from a foreign supplier or manufacturer; when resident Indian companies act as distributors or resellers for other residents; when a foreign distributor resells to Indian users; and when software is sold affixed to a device by a foreign supplier to Indian residents.The judgment, which involved approximately ₹500 crore in tax revenue, will impact companies such as IBM India Ltd, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Hewlett Packard India, Mphasis Ltd, Sonata Software Ltd, and GE India, among others.The judgment will also impact over 100 companies that import software for sale in India, since the payments made by them will now constitute as “business income” in the hands of the recipient, and in the absence of a permanent establishment of such a recipient in India, no tax is required to be withheld at source.The dispute began after a Karnataka high court judgment in 2011 decided in favour of the tax department, holding that payments to non-resident firms for purchase of software should be treated as royalty, and obligating resident companies to deduct TDS at the time of credit or payment, whichever is earlier. However, some other high courts and the income tax tribunal took a divergent view, calling upon the Supreme Court to examine the question of law and settle it.Before the top court, the tax department contended that the sale of copyrighted software would constitute grant of an interest in their copyright under the Copyright Act, thus necessitating the deduction of tax at source under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act.The companies, on the other hand, emphasised that these transactions were in the nature of sale, and no part of copyright was transacted since the non-resident continued to have proprietary rights in the software.Accepting the companies’ submissions, the bench held that the amount paid by them to the foreign software suppliers did not amount to royalty, as a result of which, no liability to deduct TDS arose. It underlined that these sales did not attract the rigours of the Copyright Act because no right to reproduce had been given to the resident firms, and hence such payments could not come under the ambit of “royalty”.Experts said the verdict settled an important legal dispute.Smita Goel, partner at business legal services firm Algo Legal, said: “The Supreme Court has resolved a 20-year-old controversy with this verdict. Now, non-resident seller companies not having a business presence or permanent establishment in India, would be outside the ambit of taxation since payment received for the sale of computer software will be treated as business income.”Amit Maheshwari, tax partner, AKM Global, said: “This is a very important judgement and would have far-reaching implications. The SC has also gone behind the object of the Copyright Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-backs-taxpayers-in-software-royalty-case-101614708858870.html

The villager’s son who is the prime suspect is absconding.Police said the body was found in the afternoon in a village of Anoopshahar area and suspect that it could be a case of murder after sexual assault.Police have launched a hunt for the house-owner’s son named Harendra (22). The house owner has been taken into custody.Police said the girl had gone to collect cattle fodder with her mother and elder sister on the outskirts of the village on February 25. After some time, she went towards a house nearby in search of water to drink, but did not return, they said.Her mother and sister searched for her for some time and, thinking that she might have gone home, they also returned home. After not finding her at home, they searched at their relatives’ houses and the village and finally lodged a complaint at Anoopshahar police station on February 28 against Harendra.Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar Singh said police visited Harendra’s house on Monday but it was locked. The house is at a distance from the village. Harendra is a labourer and works in Delhi. Police quizzed his father, also a labourer, who told them that Harendra had come to the village three days back but he did not know where he was.“Police then searched the house and spotted recently dug wet soil in a corner inside the boundary of the house. When they dug the soil, they found the body of the missing girl,” Singh said.The SSP said prima facie it seems to be a case of rape and murder. The girl’s family had no enmity with anyone in the village.“The body has been sent for post-mortem examination and police teams have been formed to arrest Harendra,” the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-days-after-12-year-old-girl-disappeared-in-up-s-bulandshahr-body-found-in-pit-101614709660275.html

The computerised tomography (CT) scan of chest indicated that the lungs were functioning at 50-75% efficiency. The severity value of CT scan was bordering towards severe. He bled through nose and mouth towards the end stage, all of which are indications of coronavirus,” said Ravish Kumar Singh, an MBBS intern at NMCH, who was among five friends to visit the bereaved family at Dahiya village in Begusarai on Tuesday.Ashish Chaudhury, Shanu Anand, both MBBS students of 2015 batch doing final year internship; Anand Bhushan and Akash Kumar of 2016 batch, were the other medicos who visited the bereaved family.Begusarai civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Jha confirmed the death. “The student had tested positive on February 25 at Patna. He was admitted to Bhrit Jeevan, a private health facility in Begusarai on February 27, where he died late last night. I don't know if he had any pre-existing disease since post-mortem examination of Covid-19 patients are not done,” said Dr Jha.NMCH principal Dr Hiralal Mahto said that he got to know about the student’s death on Tuesday.“I got to know on February 28 that one of our medicos, residing in one of our hostels, has tested positive for Covid-19. I immediately asked the hostel warden to hospitalise him but was told that he had left the hostel without informing anyone. I got the news about his death today,” said Dr Mahto.Asked about more Covid-19 cases among medicos, Dr Mahto said, “Some of our students have shown symptoms of Covid-19. I have asked all medicos — roughly 700 — to undergo the RT-PCR test. I have even asked those showing symptoms of Covid-19 to get themselves hospitalized, but they are awaiting results of RT-PCR test.”The principal said he had ordered sanitization of the entire hospital and hostel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barely-22-days-after-taking-first-jab-of-vaccine-medico-dies-of-covid19-101614707989111.html
03-03-2021||Today's||Scratching the surface hasn’ helped. It is time to strike at the core issues||Improving governance and delivery systems have been a challenge for every government across the globe, particularly for democracies, where those who govern have to account for their actions. Countries devoid of democratic systems of governance, normally have no such concerns, their rulers can do as they wish. Consequently, the people suffer but their sufferings are of their own making because of their capitulation before unaccountable rulers. It was different when democratic forms of governance had not taken roots globally. Today’s narrative is different.But why, even in democracies, people are made to suffer poor, corrupt, and unaccountable governance. This issue has been debated for years not only in India but almost in every country. Many commissions and committees were set up by governments to study the problem of poor governance but to no avail. In our country, two administrative reforms commissions were set up, the first one in the year 1966 headed by Morarji Desai and later on by K Hanumanthaiah and the second one in 2005, headed by M Veerappa Moily. They submitted their bulky reports with a series of recommendations to improve governance. Despite all these administrative reforms commissions and various committees set up to curb corruption and improve delivery systems, we rank very low in the list of well-administered nations and rank high amongst corrupt nations.This is where we stand today despite having one of the best constitutions, a plethora of laws in place and a very independent, constitutionally mandated judicial system. So what went wrong?Our administrative structure led by All India Services such as the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS) adopted an approach of 5% vs 95%. It is reasoned that 95% of our issues and problems are “soft” problems that are easy to solve and can be tackled without disturbing the powerful interests and prevailing status quo in society. This 95% were and are the petty problems faced by our population and all the energies of our system are only invested in solving them. In comparison, the remaining 5% problems are the problems, which if corrected, would have not only disturbed the status quo but would have changed the power structures in our society. These problems were never touched and remained unattended for decades.I got a glimpse of this syndrome right at the beginning of my career when as a young IAS officer, I started enforcing compliance with the law by the power centres in the district as well.I was promptly summoned by the district magistrate for a reprimand. He started with a bit of “advice” before going into the specifics: That if I want to help the poor and needy, I should focus on 95% of the problems and the people. He said I was moving in the wrong direction by confronting head-on the other 5%.His “sound advice” for the future, as he described it, was that I should desist from going after the 5%, else I will not be even able to help solve 95% of the problems of the poor and needy because the powerful people will get me thrown out and I will not be able to deliver at all.This culture of inaction against these “5%” has cost the nation dearly. This is the prevalent administrative culture - of not disturbing the interest of the powerful, how so ever illegal they may be. This syndrome kept creating 95% of the problems for the rest of the population perennially. This kind of advice, by senior government officers, was passed on to generations of young officers and they were moulded and absorbed into the overwhelming breed of “tactful” public servants.Everyone in the system is trained and advised to be “practical”, “accommodating”, “tactful” and are given pragmatic tips to navigate the serpentine ways of our power structure. Barring a few exceptions, the advice tendered to the bureaucratic machinery is to avoid taking the core problems head-on, lest one gets hurt. The people who create the 5% of the problems continue brazenly because these elements not only have deep pockets but deeper roots: They have their patrons in higher positions in both the political and administrative echelons.This administrative culture has flourished for decades under political patronage and in full glare. How miserably this administrative culture has failed the nation is clear from the fact that for nearly seven decades, the system has been ignoring the “5% “ core problems on the pretext of working tirelessly to help the “95%” but the system has failed to resolve a single problem for all these years. In fact, the country is still struggling with all or most of the problems faced by our earlier generations with no resolution in sight.This bureaucratic culture has to change for the better. Political executives and the bureaucracy have to be told to attack the root of the problem in every sphere. Corrections at the periphery have not helped the situation. The time has come to strike at the core issues and resolve them. This has to begin at the top. Corruption is one of the core issues plaguing our nation but there is hardly any sincere effort to eradicate this menace. Only one example will suffice: Stop the all-pervasive corruption in the tax system and tax collections will increase manifold. Eradication of corruption will change the status quo in favour of the common man. That will usher in true “Swaraj“. We have had enough of sloganeering for all these decades, time has come to strike at the core issues.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

03-03-2021||Today's||Disengagement will not lead to friendship||Notwithstanding the recent exchanges between the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers and military commanders at the border, India-China relations remain at a critical stage. Negotiations on Depsang Plains, Demchok, Gogra and Hot Springs are anticipated to be difficult and will reveal whether China is serious about reducing tensions and restoring tranquillity at the border.The disengagement, which began on February 10 at the Pangong Tso’s northern and southern banks in Ladakh, is just the first tentative step in a process envisaging Chinese forces pulling back from areas where they are present to their April 2020 positions. Adding to the complexity is the absence of trust and blanket of suspicion that cloud the talks.The arc of military pressure created by China since early May 2020, initially in Ladakh and subsequently along the entire 4,057-kilometres of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), has enduring strategic implications. It blends military, civil and diplomatic instruments. Importantly, it has starkly contrasted the assiduously built myth of so-called historical and traditionally close ties between the two countries and peoples, and the reality that Beijing has not been sensitive to either India’s interests or need for good relations. India needs to now factor this across the entire gamut of the relationship.The nine-month-long stand-off in the high-altitude Ladakh region still continues with both countries mobilised along the entire LAC. A report indicated that since May, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) started constructing a military base on the Tibet-Bhutan border opposite Drowa village in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). An airport has been built at Yadong opposite Nathu La in Sikkim. These have the potential to add to tension on the Tibet-Bhutan border. Equally significant are the activities of TAR’s propaganda and public security teams, which visited Pangong, Shihquanhe, Demchok to explain the alignment of China’s “borders” to villagers and plans for developing “Pangong Lake as an international lake”.During this period, China also hosted a video conference where Nepal’s leadership pointedly reiterated Kathmandu’s commitment to the “one China policy”. Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Oli also chose this sensitive time to raise contentious issues with India. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, quite unusually, visited Tibet in August. He met TAR leaders in Lhasa and travelled to border areas across Pangong Tso and Chushul.China also sent mixed signals. There was a suspected cyberattack on India’s electricity grid. Coinciding with Wang Yi’s meeting with India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar in September, the editor-in-chief of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-owned Global Times, Hu Xijin, wrote an editorial asking China to prepare for war.Beijing’s punitive military action against India was not unexpected. Indicators include the establishment in 2016 of the PLA’s Western Theatre Command — the largest of China’s newly-created five military theatre commands — intended to ensure the projection of Chinese power into this region and protect the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Soon after the announcement of CPEC in 2015, Chinese leaders began telling Indian visitors, including at the highest level, to “resume talks with Pakistan, ease tensions, resolve the Kashmir issue and then look to improving ties with China”.After the disengagement at Doklam in 2017, training by the PLA’s ground and air forces in the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau visibly increased. Reports of these exercises in the Chinese military media included references implying they were part of preparations against India.The period ahead will be one of uncertainty and unease. Relevant for India are the assertions by Hu Shisheng, director of South Asia Affairs Department in the Chinese Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR). A think-tank of China’s ministry of state security (MoSS) — the external intelligence arm — CICIR periodically briefs China’s Politburo. Hu Shisheng asserted that India and China “were doomed to have a serious collision of interests or even military conflict from the very beginning of their independence and since establishing frontier and regional order”. Equally candidly, he observed that more complicated than border issues are the contention for influence and dominance and “order in the region involving relations among China, India and their neighbours”.Hu Shisheng’s subsequent article in Global Times (December 17) was more blunt. It accused India of adopting a negative and obstructionist approach towards China. He said, “India tends to disrupt China’s agenda in multilateral mechanisms” to prevent China’s rise and accused India of trying to dismantle the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) from within. He anticipated that as the gap between India and China widens, differences on regional and global issues would grow and “the favourable atmosphere for China-India cooperation” will fade. Both articles would have required prior high-level approval before publication.While there may be a temporary easing of military tension, there has been criticism in China of the disengagement. China could well attempt another military adventure in its bid to humiliate this government and frustrate India’s rise.India, involving a lieutenant-general and diplomat for the first time in the negotiations, should ensure its territorial and sovereign interests are not compromised. India-China relations will no longer be the same and India will have to exclude China from vital sectors of its economy and development.Jayadeva Ranade is a former additional secretary, Cabinet secretariat, Government of India, and is presently president, Centre for China Analysis and StrategyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/disengagement-will-not-lead-to-friendship-101614691588246.html
03-03-2021||Today's||The pandemic has added to the urgency of protecting wildlife||Every celebration is an opportunity for conversation. During its 68th session in December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly decided to observe World Wildlife Day on March 3. The reason was to raise awareness of the world’s wild animals and plants. The choice of date was to mark when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was signed in 1973.The theme for World Wildlife Day 2021 is Forests and Livelihoods: Sustaining People and Planet. The objective is to highlight the importance of forests with all their living residents and how they support the livelihoods of millions of people across the world. It also focuses on local and indigenous communities as an integral part of the forest ecosystems and their synergetic interactions.There is no way to avoid depending on wildlife, in urban or rural areas. Take just one example. If bees and other pollinators are not doing well, our food production mechanism will be severely affected, as predicted in the recently published Living Planet Report 2020 (LPR).Since the Covid-19 pandemic, people worldwide have become familiar with zoonotic diseases — where the infection is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to human beings. There are over 200 known types of zoonosis. Whether Covid-19 had a zoonotic origin is still being debated, but what we know is that zoonotic diseases are rising.This is attributed to two environmental risks. The first is the large-scale conversion of land for agriculture, which increases interactions between wildlife, livestock and human beings. The second is inadequate food safety standards in some parts of the world, including permitting the trade and consumption of high-risk wildlife species, which is increasing human exposure to animal pathogens.Human-wildlife conflict is also on the rise in India. This is most prominent when large mammals such as tigers, leopards, elephants, and ungulates like nilgai, wild boar, and human populations coexist and share limited resources. The distinction between human-use areas and those used by wildlife is thin and often broken, which increases conflict and poses a threat of zoonotic disease transmission. It is estimated that approximately 500 people and 100 elephants die every year in India due to negative interactions between humans and elephants. Most of these conflicts are avoidable.Negative interactions between humans and wildlife intensify when local communities feel that wildlife needs or values are given priority over their own needs. In case government authorities fail to address the bonafide needs of local people or work with them to address such conflict adequately, the negative interaction intensifies, becoming a conflict between humans and wildlife — and between humans about wildlife.An antagonistic approach develops among people towards wildlife, manifestations of which have been seen in recent times. Many will remember the poignant case of a pregnant elephant suffering a painful death after it reportedly ate a crude-bomb masked in a fruit that was meant to illegally kill wild crop-raiding herbivores. Too often, when wildlife conservation initiatives suffer, what weakens is the economic and social well-being of local people. Local support for conservation declines and, in effect, eco-development efforts meant to offset more general “costs” of living near a protected area may be hindered.Therefore, wildlife conservation needs to be prioritised, and development plans at country, state and district levels need to take cognisance of wildlife needs. Of late, we have seen that wildlife conservation needs are not adequately addressed while submitting developing projects, where a large swathe of forest lands is proposed to be diverted or a road passing through a large mammal corridor is proposed without appropriate mitigation measures. We tend to forget that wildlife and natural resources are mostly irreplaceable and cannot be bought. The pandemic in 2020 suggests that we need to reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases. For this, land-use change that destroys wildlife habitats needs to stop, and unsustainable extraction of wildlife for human use needs to be curbed.Dipankar Ghose is the director of the Wildlife and Habitats programme, WWF IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-pandemic-has-added-to-the-urgency-of-protecting-wildlife-101614691529433.html
03-03-2021||Editorials||The challenge within the Congress||The rift in the Congress has deepened. First, a rally was held in Jammu, ostensibly to honour Ghulam Nabi Azad, which saw the presence of key members of G23, the dissenters who wrote a letter demanding organisational changes in the party. Mr Azad then praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi — which led to Congress workers demanding his removal. Another G23 leader, Anand Sharma, criticised the party’s decision to ally with a political outfit led by a Muslim cleric in Bengal — which prompted a fierce response from others close to the party high command.Four separate issues have come together in the Congress. One, there is a general sense of drift after two consecutive Lok Sabha poll defeats, and erosion of faith in Rahul Gandhi’s ability to deliver victories. Two, there is an organisational crisis where internal channels to express and resolve grievances have collapsed and the leadership structure is unclear. Three, there are unfulfilled personal ambitions, including of the dissenters, which have now led them to speak up. And four, there is jostling to position oneself for possible elections to the Congress Working Committee and other positions.If this rift in the Congress leads to a stronger opposition, it is good for democracy. But the challenge for the challengers is that they seem to lack the mass base outside the party and internal strength within the party to force a change in leadership. The party establishment has co-opted a set of G23 leaders. At the same time, the Congress leadership should recognise that its real challenge is not the dissenters, but the party’s failure to win the confidence of citizens in elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-challenge-within-the-congress-101614778592976.html
03-03-2021||Editorials||Women’s right to autonomy, justice | HT Editorial||A Supreme Court (SC) bench, headed by the Chief Justice of India, in a case involving the bail plea of a rape accused, held that it might consider his petition if he were willing to marry the survivor, a minor at the time of the incident. This is unacceptable. As International Women’s Day approaches, it is a reminder of how little autonomy women have over their bodies and life choices. Such judicial observations give sanction to the violence a rape survivor faces and strip her of her rights.In this case, the girl was stalked by the accused, threatened with violence, and her family harassed. While the Bench made it clear it was not forcing the issue, the attempt was aimed at arriving at a “solution”, which if agreeable to the accused, not the survivor, stood to exonerate him. The rights of the survivor are protected under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, and this is what must be upheld. The fact that the survivor challenged the pre-arrest bail to the accused in a lower court shows that she wants to pursue justice. One wonders what might have happened had the accused responded positively to the court’s question (he didn’t because he is already married).There must be a greater effort at gender sensitisation across all levels of the judiciary to prevent such attempts to grant amnesty for violent crimes against women. Women’s rights are non-negotiable and there can be no recourse to extra-judicial methods to address crimes such as rape by suggesting that the accused had a way out by marrying the survivor. The SC bench would do well to rethink its approach and ensure that all such future cases are dealt with strictly within the letter and spirit of the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/womens-right-to-autonomy-justice-hteditorial-101614691530790.html
