While the Commission, headed by Justice Ranjana Desai, is the fifth since Independence, it is unique insofar as it has been formed when there is a constitutional freeze on the increase or decrease of the parliamentary and legislative assembly seats till after the population census of 2026.With regard to J&K, the Commission is sui generis. Even though set up under the Delimitation Act of 2002, it will redraw the constituencies of J&K in accordance with the provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019. This severely compromises the Commission’s mandate vis-a-vis J&K.The J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019, decided that two of the three key elements in the delimitation of assembly constituencies. First, the number of electors has already been decided, by stipulating the population census of 2011 as the base. For all other states, including the four going in for delimitation along with J&K, the population figures of the 2001 census are being used.Second, through the Act, the Union government has increased the number of representatives to the legislative assembly of J&K from 107 to 114. So far, changing the number of representatives has been the prerogative of the Delimitation Commission. It is mandated and empowered by clause 8(b) of the Delimitation Act of 2002 to decide on the “the total number of seats to be assigned to the Legislative Assembly of each State and determine on the basis of the census figures”.Having already decided on the number of electors as well as the number of elected, the only part of delimitation that has been left to the Commission is the electoral cartography — the redrawing of boundaries and enclosing people within the constituency framework. Notwithstanding these debilitating infirmities in the context of J&K, the redrawing of the constituencies is an extraordinarily complex and highly contentious exercise. It can potentially alter the electoral demographic balance.In all the legislative assemblies of the erstwhile state of J&K, there has been no imbalance, regional or otherwise, in the distribution of assembly seats. More specifically, contrary to perception, Jammu has not been discriminated against in representation. In the last legislative assembly, for instance, the Kashmir Valley, which had 55% of the population, had 53% of the seats. Jammu, with a share of 43% in the population, got 42.5% of the seats in the legislative assembly. Even on the “one person one vote” principle, it is as good as it can get, with 149,749 voters per constituency in Kashmir and 145,366 per constituency in Jammu.Post the downgrade and dismemberment of J&K in August 2019, the Kashmir division has a 56% share in population, while Jammu has a 44% share. The area of the Jammu division is now 62%, while that of Kashmir is 38%. Hence the clamour from Jammu-centric political parties and civil society for using area as a criterion for delimitation.However, the universally accepted and nationally followed rule for delimitation for constituencies is population. Approximately half of the countries in the world use population for delimiting, while another third use registered voters, a subset of the population. The remaining countries use citizen population, again a variant of population. Nowhere is it based on area and for good reasons.Be that as it may, the Commission’s approach to redrawing of constituencies in J&K should not, and indeed cannot, be the seat distribution between the Jammu division and the Kashmir division. What should be the end result can’t be the starting point. Both are administrative divisions and not electoral constituencies. This binary of Jammu versus Kashmir, which has now become a bipolarity, may be relevant for developmental decisions but not for representational purposes.Following the principle of “communities of interest” used universally in redrawing of constituencies, the Commission should follow a ground-up approach. Indeed, Section 60(2) (b) of the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019, specifies that “all constituencies shall, as far as practicable, be geographically compact areas, and in delimiting them, regard shall be had to physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units”. The operative part is “physical features”, which include natural boundaries created by dominant topographical features such as mountain ranges, or rivers.On this stipulated basis of topography, today’s J&K comprises four distinct regions — Jhelum Valley (South Kashmir, Central Kashmir and North Kashmir), Chenab Valley (Kisthwar, Doda, Ramban and Reasi), Pir Panchal (Rajouri and Poonch), and the Tawi basin or the plains (Jammu, Kathua and Udhampur).The assembly constituencies in and across these four regions need to be distributed on the basis of the share of population. With population as the base, the allocation can be tempered by giving some weightage to the density of population. If the inverse of population density is used, it will work as a relevant surrogate for area, since low-population density will get a higher weightage.Haseeb Drabu is a former finance minister of Jammu and Kashmir and an economistThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/jk-delimitation-go-by-the-population-rule-101614604164118.html

The shooter was arrested by Pune rural police on Monday evening while trying to flee the village. The deceased was identified as Ajay Ragu Sathe, while the arrested man was identified as Bapu Jore (30) both residents of Malin village in Mulshi. “It was a gun that was used to kill animals or in a village fare to burst balloons. It uses pellets so it is difficult to say how many were fired before the doctor’s report arrives,” said Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police, Pune rural police. Jore was found by the officials of Paud police station who are investigating the case. The issue was not long-standing and had come up only recently. The police do not have a record of previous fights between the families. The deceased had around 40 cows that used the stream as a source of drinking water. “There is a stream of water that runs through their fields. The deceased used to walk his cattle through there and they drank from it. In summers, it generally dries up and Jore was filling up the flowing stream to create a walking pathway and close the flow. They had a fight about it and Jore brought a gun from his possession and fired at Sathe,” said senior police inspector Amol Dhumal of Paud police station. A case under Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code along with the relevant sections of Arms Act was registered at Paud police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/farmer-arrested-for-shooting-neighbour-dead-over-common-water-stream-101614623303353.html
01-03-2021||Pune||Dagdusheth temple to remain closed today||The Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati temple and other ganesh temples in the city will remain closed on the occasion of Angarki Sankashti Chaturthi on Tuesday. The decision was taken after looking at the Covid surge in the last 15 days. “All the rituals will be conducted under the presence of priests, but no general public will be allowed to enter the temple. The link of e-darshan will be available for all,” said Ashok Godse, president of Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Public Ganpati Trust. “Footfall of around four lakh devotees is generally expected throughout the day so it is better to keep the temple closed looking at the rising number of Covid patients in the city,” added Godse. One of the oldest temples in the city, the Kasba Ganpati temple will remain open for darshan, however all the precautionary measures will be strictly adhered to. “We have made arrangements in such a way that only 10 persons that too with maintaining six-foot distance can enter the temple and no one will be allowed entry into the sanctum as people will have to take darshan from outside. We have also installed a screen at the main entrance,” said Shrikant Shete, president of Kasba Ganpati Mandal. In Chinchwad, at the Morya Gosavi Temple, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has imposed 24-hour curfew in temple premises. The curfew will start from midnight (March 2) and it will continue until midnight (March 3). The administration has appealed people to follow all implemented norms strictly. Along with the temple all the shops around the premises will remain closed for 24 hours. Sukharata Apartment chowk, Fakirbhai Pansare Urdu school chowk, Mangalmurti square, Chintamani Ganesh temple will be under curfew. “Only priests will be allowed in the temple and that too they have to carry identity card with themselves as police bandobast will be there around the temple,” added Mandar Dev, priest from Morya Gosavi Temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dagdusheth-temple-to-remain-closed-today-101614623302782.html
01-03-2021||Pune||Poll-bound PMC prioritises healthcare sector in a budget driven by schemes||The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to change its focus in the budget from other sectors to primarily focusing on improving health facilities in the city. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne presented the ₹8,370 crore budget on Monday for the year 2021-22. Considering it is an election year, the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) launched various schemes in the budget. In line with Mumbai’s Tata cancer and research hospital, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to erect its own dedicated cancer hospital in the city. The hospital is set to provide service to the whole western Maharashtra and Marathwada region. Rasne said, “I propose to erect the Nanaji Deshmukh cancer hospital. Neither Pune city nor western Maharashtra has a dedicated cancer hospital. This hospital would be built on more than 10,000 square feet plot at either Warje or Baner. A recent study shows that in the upcoming days, there would be more cancer patients and each family would need to go through it. The cancer treatment is very costly and to make it affordable, the PMC has decided to erect a dedicated cancer hospital.” Rasne said, “Along with the cancer hospital, the PMC has proposed to erect the urology hospital at Kothnis health clinic located at Shukravar peth. Many patients are suffering from urology related problems and kidney-related illness and the civic body will cater to them.” During the Covid-19 pandemic, the PMC faced a major problem of ICU beds. The PMC had an ICU facility only at Kamala Nehru hospital. Even Naidu hospital did not have an ICU facility. Rasne said, taking a lesson from Covid-19, we have decided to erect an ICU facility in all PMC-owned hospitals and made a budgetary provision of ₹5 crore for it. During Covid-19, many citizens faced psychological problems and mental issues. It proved that society needs psychological treatment many times due to stress and other pressures. In consideration of this requirement, the PMC has decided to erect psychological counselling centres at hospitals. Deepali Dhumal, leader of opposition, PMC said, “On one side, the municipal commissioner and the ruling party is claiming that there is less revenue and is putting a cap on expenditure. Every year there is less income than the target but now they have inflated the budget considering it is election year.”Aba Bagul, Congress leader said, “By keeping elections in mind, the ruling party has announced various schemes but they would just remain promises. The ruling party failed to keep their promises in the last four years. It is good that they are planning to push the HCMTR project. The PMC had huge potential and right now PMC needs to cross budget more than Rs10,000 crore but they haven’t identified any new income resources.” The PMC fiscal picture Income ( ₹in crore) Local body tax- 170 GST - 1985.88 Property Tax- 2656.67 Water Tax - 290 Meter water tax- 372 Government subsidy - 297.28 JNNURM- 1.37 PMAY - 185 Development charges- 205 Building permission- 980 Other income- 926 Loan - 300 Total - 8370 Expenditure Salary - 1698.41 Primary education - 344 Contract employees - 222.34 Loan and repay - 92.18 Electricity -276 Water expenditure - 99.95 Medicine - 124.35 Other expenditure - 1255 Maintenance- 17 Repairing- 38.07 Petrol - 30.40 Regional ward level works- 54.80 Ward office budget- 80.84 Development works- 4035,60 Total – 8,370 Focus on the healthcare sector - Total proposed expenditure: ₹145 crore 1) Formation of a dedicated cancer hospital located at either Warje or Baner ( ₹1 crore) 2) Formation of a special urology surgery hospital located at Shukrawar peth in Kotnis clinic ( ₹1 crore) 3) Construction of ICU centres in all PMC-run hospitals ( ₹5 crore)4) Completion of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee medical college ( ₹146 crore)5) Strengthening the Mukundrao Lele clinic located near Shaniwarwada ( ₹1 crore)6) Introduction of health awareness scheme to spread awareness in slums ( ₹5 crore)7) Introduction of heart attack-related tests at all PMC hospitals ( ₹2 crore)8) Formation of the blood bank at Kamla Nehru hospital ( ₹70 lakh)9) Formation of heart clinic for kids in the name of Rambhau Mhalgi ( ₹2 crore)10) Introduction of a breast cancer inspection programme ( ₹3 crore)11) Introduction of the Pandit Deendayal accident scheme for all property taxpayers ( ₹50 lakh)12) Fight against Covid-19 ( ₹10 crore) 13) Special Cardiac ambulances ( ₹1 crore) ======================BOX 2 Transportation (Total expenditure ₹223.7 crore) Commercial operation of Metro on five routes: ₹3.5 crore Swargate-Katraj-Nagar road BRT: ₹70 crore Signal for pedestrians: ₹1.5 crore Development of key roads Shivane-Kharadi road: ₹28 crore Katraj-Kondhwa road: ₹35 crore Balbharati-Paud road: ₹70 lakh Public transport development: ₹85 crore The DPR for Sinhagad road to Pune Cantonment, Swargate to Katraj, Shivajinagar to Hadapsar, Ramwadi to Wagoli, Vanaz to Chandni Chowk, Warje to Swargate are in the pipeline.

Kshirsagar is an interior designer and holds a bachelor’s degree in Science. DCP (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said that the duo had met over a dating app and were in a love relationship for eight months. The investigation into the case led the police to Kshirsagar’s residence where his wife informed them that he had attempted suicide at his residence on February 26, 2021, at 10.30 pm and was admitted at Mai Mangeshkar hospital in Warje. “The accused was in love with Pandit and the relationship was on for eight months. On further investigations, it was revealed that Sudarshan’s marriage had been fixed and for the past fifteen days, there was a dispute between them. Enraged over the development that Pandit would be away from him, Kshirsagar murdered him at Pashan hill at 8.30 pm on the night of February 26. The murder has been detected within 36 hours and the entire team worked tirelessly to achieve the breakthrough in the case,” Deshmukh added. The investigating team comprised of ACP Ramesh Galande, Chaturshringi police station in-charge Anil Shewale, police inspector (crime) Dada Gaikwad, investigating officer PSI Mohandas Jadhav, Mahesh Bhosale and constabulary. Pandit was found murdered on Pashan hill on Saturday morning. He was found lying in a trench located on Pashan hill. Kshirsagar had disrobed him and there was nothing on his body at the time the police team reached the spot. Kshirsagar first slit opened his throat and then smashed his head with a big stone. Pandit was a resident of Sutarwadi in Pashan and was a native of Jafrabad in Jalna district. He was pursuing his PhD studies in chemistry from the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL). He stayed with two others in a rented accommodation in Sutarwadi and did not go to the room on Friday night when he was murdered. Pandit’s cousin Sandeep Pandit (34) lodged an FIR with the Chatushrungi police station. He wanted to complete his PhD soon and wanted to support his family members in a good way. He belongs to a middle-class family based in Jalna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cops-pandit-brutally-murdered-by-boyfriend-he-met-over-dating-app-101614623242729.html

01-03-2021||Noida||Schools reopen in Ghaziabad after a year for classes 1 to 5||Ghaziabad: Government and private schools in the district reopened for students of classes 1 to 5 on Monday after remaining shut for nearly a year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The government primary schools witnessed about 70% attendance, but the students’ presence at private schools was thin, officers of the basic education department said. The officials said that the attendance in private schools fared badly as most of the schools have finished their academic session. They said that the attendance in about 126 private schools across the district reached about a maximum of 20%. In February, the UP government had issued standard operating procedure (SOP) for schools for resumption of classes 6 to 8 from February 10 and for classes 1 to 5 from March 1 with mandatory “parents’ consent” clause for sending children to schools. “Even for classes 6 to 8, the attendance in private schools was about 20%. It could also be due to the reason that parents are worried about emergence of Covid cases in several states,” said BB Chaudhary, basic education officer, Ghaziabad. “On the other hand, the overall attendance in government schools for classes 1 to 5 was very encouraging and estimated at about 70%. Several government schools reported a 100% attendance. We also have high attendance of about 60-70% in government schools for classes 6 to 8,” Chaudhary said. Some private schools said that studies for various classes have finished and it is only in the next session that the students will come for offline classes. “At our school, the syllabus is over. So, the current time is only for assessments. So, we started examination offline for classes 6 to 12. And we have an attendance of about 95-98%. We are following all the guidelines. From classes nursery to 6, we are going to start the online assessment now,” said a spokesperson of the Delhi Public School, Indirapuram. The Gautam Budh Nagar district basic education officer, Sanjay Upadhyaya, meanwhile said that on the first day of re-opening for class 1 to 5, schools recorded 45% attendance. “It is an encouraging turnout from the viewpoint of inaugural day for 512 schools for students of these classes. We are sure that the turnout will increase slowly in the coming days. We have made alternate arrangements for students. While on Mondays and Fridays, in-person lessons will be held for students of class 1 and 5, students of classes 2 and 4 have been asked to come on Tuesdays and Saturdays. For students of class 3, in-person classes will be held on Wednesdays and Thursdays,” he said. Subhash Jain, president of Ghaziabad chapter of the Independent Schools Federation of India, an association of about 100 private schools, said that attendance was dismal on Monday for classes 1 to 5. “The attendance was hardly 5%, while it was about 20% for classes 6 to 8. It is so because online classes are going on. In many schools, online examinations have started. So, offline attendance is very low. The new session for schools will start in April and we are preparing for offline classes. We expect that the government removes the ‘parents’ consent’ clause,” he said. Avrati Agarwal, head of government primary school at Nabipur in Muradnagar, said that unlike the private schools, attendance in her school was 100% on Monday. “We have 32 children enrolled for classes 1 to 5. Of these, 12 children were to attend their classes on Monday. So, all 12 children arrived. Of 32, we have parents’ consent received for 28 students so far. We provided children with masks and sanitizers, and balloons. For one week which we call as ‘shoonya week,’ we have been asked to take up activities for children so that they again become attuned to regular schedule,” Agarwal added. The members of parents’ association said that they conducted a survey of about 250 parents and about 97% of them were not willing to send children to schools. “The attendance is short as majority of parents are not willing to send children to school due to the emergence of Covid cases in many states and low vaccination coverage. Small children find it very difficult to adhere to Covid protocols. In our district, the vaccination coverage is still not there for teachers and staff of schools. So, it is better that offline classes starts from next session,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of Ghaziabad Parents’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/schools-reopen-in-ghaziabad-after-a-year-for-classes-1-to-5-101614623124497.html
01-03-2021||Noida||Residents demand dense forest in Noida||NOIDA: Residents of sectors 76, 77, 78 and other nearby sectors in Noida have demanded that the local authority should develop a dense forest along an internal road in the area.“We have submitted a letter to the Noida authority demanding a dense forest in our neighbourhood so it can benefit the people. We have also put our demands before top officials of the Noida authority and Noida MLA Pankaj Singh verbally,” said Amit Gupta, member of Progressive Community Foundation — a social group formed by the residents of Noida sectors 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 and others.There are dozens of group housing societies in these sectors, and the residents are demanding a forest in their vicinity. Each sector is home to dozens of high-rise societies. But they are yet to have adequate recreational green areas to mitigate the pollution which spikes during winters. And the land along the internal roads is yet to be developed.“If the land along the internal roads is not developed then many people will set up shops illegally and start operating, causing civic issues. But if the authority develops a forest on the vacant land, then it will not only help in protecting the government but also benefit them,” said Amita Singh, a resident of Noida Sector 76.According to the residents, around 69 acres of land is vacant along the internal road in sectors 76-77. “We have received a proposal, from the residents, about the development of a dense forest. We have assured them that the authority will develop a dense forest on the 69 acres of land located along the internal road in sectors 76-77 among other areas,” said Indu Prakash Singh, an officer who is on a special duty of the Noida authority heading the horticulture department.The authority officials said the 69 acres of land is earmarked for a green belt. “Since this land is meant for a green belt, we can easily develop a dense forest on this land. There is some land dispute on around 2-3 acres and the authority is about to resolve the issues. Once the issues are resolved, we will plant saplings on 69 acres and in next 2-3 years dense forest will be fully developed,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-demand-dense-forest-in-noida-101614623122859.html
01-03-2021||Noida||Noida breathes easy, air quality ‘moderate’ after three weeks||Noida: The air quality of Noida improved to ‘moderate’ levels on Monday as high wind speed ventilated pollutants, letting the city breathe its cleanest air in over three weeks.Neighbouring Ghaziabad and Greater Noida also showed improvement but remained within the ‘poor’ category of air quality, with pollution monitoring agencies predicting no serious deterioration immediately.The last time the air quality of Noida was ‘moderate’ was on February 6.According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to oscillate between the ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category.“Surface winds are moderate, and forecasted to increase and stay high for the next 48 hrs. A gradual increase in maximum temperature is also expected. Day-time high surface wind speed, warmer temperatures and elevated boundary-layer height have improved the ventilation and dispersion substantially and are influencing the AQI positively. The intermittent lifting of local dust under the prevailing meteorological conditions continues to remain the dominating factor to influence the AQI adversely,” said the SAFAR statement on Monday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Monday, on a scale of 0 to 500, improved to 169 against 218 a day earlier.The AQI of Greater Noida on Monday improved to 215, from 220 a day earlier. The air quality index of Ghaziabad was 208, against 248 a day earlier.An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. Weather analysts said the wind speed increased due to the comparative low-pressure gradient or difference in atmospheric pressure of the region to that of the northern Himalayan states.“The wind speed on Monday was high. It went upto 18 knots, which is about 35 kmph, due to which particle pollutants were swept away, leading to better air quality. Besides, the high wind speed sweeping the entire Indo-Gangetic plain led to a slight drop in maximum temperatures. If the wind speed remains good for the next few days, ventilation will be good and the air quality may further improve,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Meteorology and climate change, Skymet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-breathes-easy-air-quality-moderate-after-three-weeks-101614623063373.html
01-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Armed men rob pvt firm employees at Raj Nagar District Centre||Ghaziabad: Two employees of an edible oil manufacturing company were robbed at gunpoint by two suspects outside a bank at the Raj Nagar District Centre (RDC) in Ghaziabad Monday morning, the police said. This is the second robbery to have taken place in roughly 24 hours under the jurisdiction of the Kavi Nagar police station and police post; a family of four was robbed in the wee hours of Sunday at gunpoint inside their home wherein valuables worth ₹12 lakh were taken.The incident took place around 11.30am when Nitin Sharma, 27, who looks after the accounts of the firm, came in a Santro car with another employee, 25-years-old Jodhpal Singh. The police said they parked their car outside the bank and that Sharma was heading to the premises when two masked men on a two-wheeler came by. “I sensed something was amiss and headed towards the car, but the two men came close, pointed a pistol at me and fled with the bag,” Sharma told reporters, estimating that the amount looted could be about ₹8-10 lakh but that he does not have the correct figure. The suspects are stated to be aged around 20-25 years.He added that one more employee of the firm was scheduled to join them to make the deposit. RDC is the biggest commercial market in Ghaziabad and houses a number of bank branches, ATM kiosks, restaurants, malls, pubs and showrooms, where the police take up round the clock patrolling. The police said they have registered an FIR under IPC Section 392 (robbery) at the Kavi Nagar police station and have also asked personnel to remain alert in the RDC as well as other market areas.“We registered an FIR for robbery in relation to the incident. The two victims are from an edible oil manufacturing company near Loha Mandi and came to the RDC to deposit money in an account of another firm engaged in the same business. We have spoken to their company officials, but they are yet to give us the correct valuation of the cash taken away,” said Awneesh Kumar, circle officer (city 2).This raises doubts as to whether the employees were aware or not how much money they had come to unload, as cash deposits require filling up of bank slips with the exact amount, down to the currency note denominations.“Though there is talk of ₹10 lakh being looted, the company’s officials did not give us in writing the exact amount lost during the incident,” the circle officer said. He said that several teams have been formed to trace the suspects and CCTV footage from cameras in the RDC is in the process of being scanned to obtain clues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-armed-men-rob-pvt-firm-employees-at-raj-nagar-district-centre-101614623062824.html

01-03-2021||Gurugram||Rental prices in luxury housing segment show slow momentum||The average rentals in the luxury segment in seven residential markets across the country rose between 17 percent and 26 percent during the period of 2014 to 2020, found a report by a private real estate consultancy, called Anarock. The seven residential markets considered in the report include Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune. As per real estate experts, this is a less-than-impressive figure and points towards a slowing down of the momentum in premium residential housing. Golf Course Road in Gurugram saw an increase of 17 percent in rentals while the neighbouring Golf Course Extension Road saw a rise of 18 percent in rentals in the last seven years, the report stated. Surprisingly, the capital prices on Golf Course Road witnessed no appreciation during this period, while Golf Course Extension Road saw rise of seven percent, the report found.City-based experts said that the rental and capital asset figures depict the slow momentum in premium and residential housing in the last five years in the city. The return on investment on luxury housing has remained very low and this has been manifested by the low rise in housing rentals, said Vinod Behl, a city-based real estate expert. “The luxury and premium housing categories on Golf Course and Golf Course Extension Road have not appreciated as expected and this is the reason why the rental figures are also not impressive . Things will improve in the next one-and-a-half years as non-residential Indians, high net-worth individuals and senior company executives are looking for bigger homes and second homes due to work from home culture,” said Behl.As per the details shared in the report, housing rentals in key luxury markets saw better year-on-year growth between 2014-2020 than average capital prices in the same localities. It further said that reforms introduced by the government in the real estate sector such as the introduction of Real Estate Regulatory Authority(Rera), GST rules, and other supporting measures helped in improving the capital prices of assets from one to three percent while rentals market saw a sustained growth. Experts based in Gurugram said that while growth was seen in rentals between 2017 to 2019, in 2020, the city witnessed either no growth and even a little decline as people refrained from investing or upgrading their homes due to uncertainty caused by Covid-19 pandemic. “There is some relief now as the market is witnessing some traction, and the demand for premium category housing in both rental segment as well as from end users has revived. We are getting more enquiries now,” said Sanjay Sharma, a city-based real estate consultant. The report said that average rental for a 2,000 square feet apartment at Golf Course Road, which was around ₹60,000 in 2014 rose to ₹70,000 in 2020. Likewise, the rental for an apartment of same size on Golf Course extension road in 2014 was ₹42,500 and it rose to ₹50,000 in 2020. As far as capital appreciation is concerned, the property prices rose by seven percent on Golf Course Extension Road in this period while there was no rise in the property prices on Golf Course Road, the report said.Golf Course Extension Road is poised to emerge as one of the most important micro markets in the city as it has great access to major roads, good infrastructure and a good mix of properties suited to the demand, said Pankaj Bansal, director, M3M. “The proposed Metro connectivity and upgrade of Golf Course Extension Road will add great value. The area has a good mix of high-end residential and commercial properties, which will definitely help in boosting demand, “ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rental-prices-in-luxury-housing-segment-show-slow-momentum-101614622224427.html

DTCP officials said information is being sought from the developers regarding the number of units developed, those under construction, project area and similar other points as the department is building a statewide database of realty projects. DTCP officials on Monday said that show-cause notices are being sent to around 12 developers, who have not shared any detail with the department, along with 10 others, who have furnished only partial details of their projects. Officials said, till date, property details of around 3.5 lakh units have been obtained and these will be uploaded on the database so that information about projects is available on a real-time basis. Apart from creating a centralised database, property owners whose details are fed into the system would not be required to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the department for registration of property deed, required under Section 7A of the Haryana Urban Development Act, said officials.Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, said that work on building database is going on and action would be taken against developers, who don’t share details. “The planning wing is preparing this database and it will also take action,” he said. In another development, the enforcement wing of DTCP carried out a demolition drive on a large plot of land in Sector 14 opposite the Airforce School, said officials. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that a large road network and 40 plinths were demolished in the drive. “We had earlier taken action at this site but the owners did not refrain from violations so a comprehensive exercise was carried out today to clear out the area,” said Bhath. Officials also said that they will keep strict vigilance on plots in area around IAF depot as they have received complaints in this regard. “We will be keeping a watch in this area as well along with outskirts of the city,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-take-action-against-builders-for-not-sharing-project-details-101614622223373.html
01-03-2021||Gurugram||Attendance remains thin on first day of school reopening for classes 1 and 2||Government schools across the city saw a thin turnout as they reopened for students of classes 1 and 2 for in-person classroom sessions on Monday nearly a year after schools across the country were closed amid Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020. School principals said that the turnout was tepid since children in these grades were younger and not all parents were ready to send their children to school as yet. Ashok Kumar, head teacher of Government Model Sanskriti Primary School in Sector 4/7, said that 15 students out of 66 in class 1 turned up, whereas 43 students out of 162 were present in class 2. “We expect the attendance to increase in the coming week. The first few days after reopening usually see thin attendance. Our focus will be on bridging the learning gap now. While some students would need extra attention, most other students are in touch with us through online classes,” said Kumar. Schools across the country were closed in March last year amid the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Voluntary visits to schools in Haryana for doubt-clearing sessions were allowed from September onwards, followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. Schools were reopened for students in classes 6 to 8 on February 1 and classes 3 to 5 on February 24. Neelam, primary in-charge of the government primary school in Bhondsi, said that only one student each in classes 1 and 2 had visited the school on Monday. “The students are very young. Only two students came today, and they were not even masked. We couldn’t allow them to attend the classes and called their parents to take them back,” said Neelam, who goes by her first name. At government primary school, Darbaripur, only three students out of 20 had visited the school in class 1 whereas ten students out of 28 enrolled attended classes in class 2. Deputy district education officer Kalpna Singh said that since today was the first day, attendance was tepid. She said that she had directed teachers and children in senior grades to motivate students in younger classes to visit the school for classes. “The attendance will pick up with time gradually. We need to understand these children are young and they do not want constant reminders to attend school,” said Singh. Most private schools are continuing with online classes for students in classes 1 and 2 and are likely to take a call on the resumption of in-person classroom sessions in the new academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/attendance-remains-thin-on-first-day-of-school-reopening-for-classes-1-and-2-101614622222803.html

The couple tied the knot on Monday and Roul described it as the "best day" of her life.As she recalled the most horrid incident of her life and the painful years that followed, she shared her story from being a bedridden girl to the woman who chased the culprit and put him behind the bars even when the police had shut the case citing 'no clue'."In a society where the face of a girl is given more importance for marriage, I could never dream of it. I wanted to marry with the consent of my family and my boyfriend's family and it happened," said Roul, soon after the marriage concluded. The wedding took place at her village Kanakpur in Jagatsinghpur district on Monday evening.Also read: Covid-19 in Maharashtra - How various districts fared since Feb 24Roul, one of the three daughters of a widow, was pursuing her intermediate studies in 2009 in a local college when an army jawan named Santosh Vedant Kumar allegedly threw acid on her face after she said no to her marriage proposal. An army camp was running near her college when Santosh saw Roul and proposed to marry her. However, her family said they did not agree to the proposal as Roul was too young and wanted to continue her studies.The man allegedly continued to stalk her and on May 4, 2009, threw acid on her. Roul was just a teenager then. Around 80 per cent of her body got scarred in the incident and the lower half of her body was paralysed. "I was 17. I’d dreamt of being independent and supporting my family but my life felt like a joke. All because I refused a boy’s offer? He was a well-educated boy from the army. A man whom we trusted to protect us had ruined my life," Roul wrote on her Facebook page a few days ago recounting the horrible days of her life.Though an FIR was lodged, the case was closed in 2012 citing ‘no clue’ by the cops. The accused was living with his wife and child in Kupwara. Roul, meanwhile, spent five years in a hospital bed near her house. In 2014, Saroj Sahu, a medical representative from Balakati area of Bhubaneswar, saw her for the first time. The nurse was a friend of Sahoo and had invited him to see the problems the acid attack victim. Though Sahoo tried to speak to her, Roul did interact as she was too scarred by her experiences."So he’d speak to Maa instead. I had no vision, but whenever I’d hear Maa chuckle, I knew it was Saroj. Honestly, I really appreciated him for that. Fufaji (father's brother) refused to help. In fact, the few times he visited, he’d say things like, ‘Injection deke maar do usse’ (give her some injection and let her die). He’d say it to my face. To him, I was already dead. Every night, I’d pray for death. I no longer had dreams or goals. I’d forgotten how to laugh. But I felt the worst about Maa – instead of relieving her stress, I had added to it. My nurse friend & Saroj tried to help us, but we couldn’t just take money from them," Roul wrote in her Facebook post.She was hesitant. "All my friend’s had abandoned me. Why then was this man, who I’d never spoken to, visiting me? He’d gotten my address from his nurse friend. He brought along my favourite chocolates and motichoor ladoos – Maa’s favourites. But I was still wary of men," Roul wrote, reminiscing how Sahoo warmed up to her."Once, Maa was away and I peed in the bed. Without hesitation, he cleaned it up. I hugged him and cried. It’s the most vulnerable I’d ever felt. I asked him, ‘Why are you doing all this?’ and he simply replied, ‘Har kaam ke peeche reason nahi hota’ (there isn't a reason behind every action). I felt so close to him that day, I wish I could see him. Gingerly, I touched his face, hoping to map it out for myself."Sahoo briefly left his job as a medicine representative to provide support and attention to Roul. After recovering, Roul joined Sheroes’ help desk, a cafe run by acid attack survivors in Lucknow in 2015. Sahoo also joined Sheroes.Though Sahoo proposed to her in 2016, she could not see him as she had lost her eyesight. In July 2017, after she underwent eye surgery, she could partially see. On Valentine's Day, 2018, the two decided to get engaged at Sheroes where she started her first job and a new life. Sahoo is back to being a medicine representative now.Roul's alleged assailant, Santosh, would have got away had she not started collecting evidence as she spoke to his friends and recorded the conversations. As the case gained traction on social media, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik met her and facilitated the re-opening of her case. Santosh was caught in September 2017 and is behind bars since then."It’s strange that it took 2 men to change the course of my life. One, a man in a uniform who took an oath of ‘service before self’, who couldn’t comprehend a simple ‘NO’ from a girl. And another, a simpleton who saw a girl in her most vulnerable state, became her biggest support and pushed her to be the best version of herself. But most importantly, who waited for her to be ready," Roul wrote on her Facebook page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-acid-attack-survivor-marries-long-time-friend-recalls-journey-to-best-day-of-her-life-101614621676423.html
01-03-2021||Gurugram||Footfall of people aged 45-59 with co-morbidities expected to rise on Tuesday||The footfall of people between the ages of 45 and 59 years with existing co-morbidities for receiving Covid-19 vaccination is likely to pick up on Tuesday, according to the district health department officials, after only 87 people turned up on the first day of the drive on Monday. “Only limited people in the age bracket of 45-59 years could manage to get inoculated as they carried along with them their medical papers, filled the medical certificate form at the site and got it signed by the doctor available at the site,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “It (inoculation of people aged over 45 with co-morbidities) happened only at a few hospitals as many people only collected the hard copy of the medical certificate. But, people who have registered themselves today (on Monday) will come in the next few days with completed certificate forms,” said Singh. The union ministry of health and family welfare has already issued the format for the medical certificate, mentioning 20 co-morbidities. The form can be accessed through Co-Win portal and it can be uploaded directly after being signed by a medical practitioner. At many private hospitals, people collected a hard copy of the form. Ajay Bhatia, 46, a diabetic patient, who collected the form from Medanta Hospital, said, “I will get the form signed by the doctor today and will upload it on the Co-Win portal to easily get the vaccine shot by walk-in.” At a few private hospitals, people paid extra to get the medical certificate at the site itself. “While I was carrying prescriptions from my doctor, the doctors here said that they’d need a proper certification indicating the co-morbidity. They gave me a choice. I could either get the certificate from my regular doctor or get it made it here. The doctors went through my prescriptions and prepared the certificate here itself,” said Sharaj Kamboj, 57, a diabetic patient who got her first dose of the vaccine at Sunrise Hospital in Sector 10A. As per the district health department data, compared to government hospitals, where at least 13 people in this age group managed to get the shot after submitting the medical certificate, the count stood at 74 at private hospitals. A senior doctor in Artemis Hospital, who requested anonymity, said, “Not many approached with medical certificates on the first day. Those who enquired about it were told to get it signed by their doctors as our hospital doctors cannot sign it if they are not aware of the medical history of the patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/footfall-of-people-aged-45-59-with-co-morbidities-expected-to-rise-on-tuesday-101614622165142.html
01-03-2021||Gurugram||Beneficiaries unaware of vaccine details, officials say sufficient stock of both available||Vaccine beneficiaries in the city continue to remain uninformed about the Covid-19 vaccine being administered to them, with many saying they have received “Covid shots”, instead of specifying either Covaxin or Covishield, the two vaccines available for use in the country.While health department officials did not disclose the number of vials of each vaccine, they said that the department had sufficient quantities of both the vaccines. “We cannot disclose the name of the vaccine being administered at different sites. We simply refer to the two vaccines as Covid-19 vaccines. A majority of the places got Covishield while Covaxin was administered at limited sites,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. The Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc. and Bharat Biotech International’s Covaxin, developed in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), are the two available vaccines for protection against Covid-19 in the country. Both the vaccines comprise two doses that are to be administered within four to six weeks of one another. Aazad Singh, 72, who got the vaccine dose at Civil Hospital in Sector 10, said that he was unaware of the name of the vaccine that he had been injected with. “Neither did I ask the doctor about the name of the vaccine nor did they tell me. All I know is that I have received the Covid vaccine and I’m grateful for that,” said Singh. Dharmpal Yadav, 77, another beneficiary, said that while he wasn’t aware of the type of vaccine he had received, he was relieved to have taken the shot. “We were not told about the vaccine that we got but I am feeling perfect and don’t think there’s anything to worry about. I had been waiting for the vaccine for a long time and feel satisfied now,” said Yadav. “I have read reports that say that beneficiaries will not be told about the vaccine that they receive. As a citizen, we deserve the right to know the vaccine that we are being administered. Ideally, we should be told this before we decide to visit a hospital. I will definitely enquire and seek details from the doctor when my turn comes,” said Smriti Juneja, who had approached Kalyani Hospital in Sector 14 to get her in-laws’ vaccinated. Dr Sunaina Khetaripal, chief dietician at Kalyani Hospital, who was overseeing the vaccination process on Monday, said that the hospital had received Covishield vials and beneficiaries were made aware of the same. “We are administering Covishield and have been responding to queries from beneficiaries so that there are no doubts regarding the whole process,” said Khetaripal. Visitors at many private facilities also received certificates, specifying the name of the vaccine they had just received.Besides those who received the vaccine shot on Monday, many people were seen visiting health facilities and making inquiries about the vaccines. “I plan to get vaccinated by April and wanted to learn about the process before booking an appointment. I sought details about the vaccines and other aspects so that I can prepare myself. The vaccine will be a great source of relief and will certainly liberate us of the fear of Covid-19,” said Bhaskar, a college professor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/beneficiaries-unaware-of-vaccine-details-officials-say-sufficient-stock-of-both-available-101614622164567.html
01-03-2021||Gurugram||15-year-old Delhi girl gang-raped in Gurugram hotel||A 15-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped in a city hotel by two boys who befriended her through a common friend, the police said on Monday. The incident is alleged to have taken place on February 25, but was reported on Sunday night, following which a case was registered. The two boys and a girl, the common friend, all juveniles, were apprehended and sent to an observation home in Faridabad on Monday. According to the police, the girl is a student of Class 9 in a Delhi government school and had met the boys through a common friend, while they were planning to visit Connaught Place in Delhi. The police said that the common friend had brought along four friends, all boys of senior classes.“All of them went to a hotel in Maulahera in the city and took a room. When two boys left the room to buy food and drinks, the other two boys held her hostage and raped her, and her friend instigated them,” Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (west), said. Based on her complaint, a case was registered in which three of them were booked for raping the girl and the common friend was additionally charged with conspiracy. “So far in the initial probe, it has been found that the girl and her friends made a plan for an outing, and her friends called their acquaintances to join them. Trusting them, she agreed, after which they all went to the hotel where she was raped,” said Saharan. The girl, in her complaint, alleged that the two boys along with her friend locked the room, held her hostage and took turns to rape her. Saharan said that the girl became unconscious and sustained injuries due to sexual assault. At present, she is under treatment at a Delhi hospital. She filed the complaint two days after the incident, when she regained consciousness, the police said.A case was registered under sections 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and 17 (act of abetment) of the POCSO Act and sections 363 (kidnapping) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code at women’s (west) police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/15yearold-delhi-girl-gang-raped-in-gurugram-hotel-101614622163345.html
01-03-2021||Gurugram||Seniors rush to Gurugram hospitals to get their vaccine shot||On the first day of the nationwide launch of Covid-19 inoculations for the general population on Monday, 765 people aged above 60 years and 87 people aged between 45 and 59 years, having co-morbidities, took the vaccine shots in the district, said officials. The beneficiaries included walk-ins as well as those who had registered on the Co-Win portal and Aarogya Setu application.Despite technical troubles in booking slots for appointments, a large turn-out of people at private hospitals resulted in a 105.3% coverage, as the district health department allocated almost 800 doses for the general population on Day 1 of the second phase of vaccination. “Large numbers turned up at the vaccination centres on the first day. Initially, it was decided that at every vaccination centre, out of 100 doses, at least 40 will be reserved for the general public and about 60 doses as second shot for front-line and healthcare workers. As the footfall remained high afternoon, hospitals were allowed to utilise doses reserved for healthcare workers as many did not turn up,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Under the second phase of vaccination, aimed at covering the prioritised groups, more than 6 million people in Haryana have to be administered Covid-19 vaccines. At private hospitals in the city, people queued at up the Covid-19 vaccination centres from noon, the designated time for starting the inoculation process. A few large private hospitals, including Medanta, Artemis, Kalyani and Paras, among others, inoculated at least 40 people above the age of 60 years within three hours upon the start of the vaccination process.According to the district health department data, 447 people above 60 years took the jab at private hospitals, while 318 people turned up at the government sites, including urban primary health centres (UPHCs) and the Civil Hospital in Sector 10A. At Chandelok UPHC, people directly walked-in and got themselves registered at the site by giving their ID proofs and signing a form confirming their registration. Vinod Jain, a resident of Manesar, who visited the Civil Hospital in Sector 10, said, “Our house is located 10 kilometres from the hospital. We came for the second time with the Aadhaar card but didn’t know that the PAN card was also needed,” said Jain. He said that doctors asked him to sign a consent form, as he could not produce the PAN card. Most beneficiaries said that after failing to book time slots for vaccination through the portal, despite completing the registration process, they decided to walk into the vaccination centres.Surinder Malik, 75, reached Artemis Hospital after failed attempts to book a slot. “Since I was already registered on the Co-Win, the walk-in process got easy. The ID details were verified, consent form for registration has to be signed, along with the payment of ₹250 for the vaccine dose, and the process was complete.” At Medanta, however, many had to return after giving their names and contact details. “Since Co-Win was not working properly, I decided to visit the hospital for walk-in. But the staff took the details and said they will call later,” said 66-year-old Ila Gupta. The officials at the hospital’s registration desk said that only those registered on the Co-Win platform will be administered vaccines. Dr Sushila Kataria, internal medicine specialist, Medanta Hospital, said, “The process will be streamlined in the next few days. Currently, the allocated doses for people have been limited. With time, dose allocation will increase to 250 per day and 500 per day. Based on the capacity of the hospital, it will increase to 2,500 in later months.” The health department has already extended the public vaccination sites to 23 from Tuesday, while it will continue at 10 private hospitals. Yadav said that from Tuesday, the vaccination will start at 9am. “There were some hiccups on the first day at the portal level, which will resolve with time,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/seniors-rush-to-gurugram-hospitals-to-get-their-vaccine-shot-101614622163952.html
01-03-2021||Gurugram||Technical faults, site overload hamper vaccination registry||Teething troubles marred the self-registration process on Monday with beneficiaries complaining of delays, technical glitches and difficulties in reserving appointments on the first day of the second phase of vaccinations in the district. Vikram Sharma, 65, a resident of DLF Phase-4, arrived at Chanderlok Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) for inoculation after he failed to book an appointment for vaccination through the Co-Win portal. “When we click on any of the dates throughout the month, the application shows a ‘no slots available’ message. There is no activity on the page when one clicks the button for next step. But once you click on the OK button, it goes back to the first page for registration,” said Sharma, demonstrating the process on his phone. He was registered as a walk-in beneficiary by the hospital staff and received the first dose of the vaccine. A government employee, who requested not to be named, reached a private hospital around 12.30pm citing a similar issue. “There are no slots available for the entire month. Since the hospital was closer to my house, I thought they would resolve this issue and administer the shot. However, I couldn’t receive the dose today. The hospital staff noted down my name and contact details and said that they’d call me in the next few days,” the government employee said. Smriti Juneja, a resident, said she decided to get senior relatives vaccinated at Kalyani Hospital in Sector 14 after failing to book an appointment through the Co-Win portal. “We were able to register on the portal but couldn’t book an appointment. There was no available slot at least for the next two weeks,” said Juneja. Vineet Goyal, a 70-year-old resident of DLF Phase-4, said that the application was not user friendly. “I couldn’t open the section that mentions the date and time for vaccination. It wasn’t working for any of the vaccination sites. The site was quite glitchy,” said Goyal. Technical glitches and website overload also hampered the process of user registration. At the Civil Hospital in Sector 10, vaccination could not be initiated until 2pm due to delays, following which officials started maintaining a physical record of the process. Dharmpal Yadav, 77, a beneficiary, said he had reached the Civil Hospital in the morning but was asked to return later as the Co-Win app was not working. “I was told that the website is not working. The staff took down my details and around 2pm, I was asked to visit again for the shot,” said Yadav. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer, said that while there had been a few initial hiccups, the process would get easier in the coming days. “The portal has been recently launched so there will be some teething troubles. In the next two to three days, the process is likely to get streamlined and users will not face hassle while booking appointments for the vaccination process,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/technical-faults-site-overload-hamper-vaccination-registry-101614622162719.html
01-03-2021||Chandigarh||Surge in Covid cases in Haryana continues even as positivity rate dips||For a third successive week, coronavirus infections in Haryana continued to surge, recording an increase of 370 more cases last week as compared to the week before.As per the health department’s data, the state registered 1,054 new cases last week (Feb 22-28) as against 684 cases reported the week before (Feb 15-21). The steady increase in cases after a prolonged spell of decline which continued for 11 weeks prompted Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to convene a review meeting of the administrative secretaries to take stock of the preparedness.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that despite surge in infection, the current positivity rate is below 1% and the cumulative positivity rate has gone down to 4.8%.“The health department tested over 1.15 lakh individuals last week. So, our sampling rate continues to be good. In fact, we are testing over one lakh persons even when the infection is going down,” the ACS said.Arora said more than 1.5 lakh healthcare workers (HCW) have been given the first dose and over 71,000 have been given the second dose so far. Against 1.30 lakh registered frontline workers, 71,000 had been given the first dose.While an all-time low of 534 cases were reported between February 1-7, the state had reported an all-time high of 17,616 cases during September 14-20 last year.Officials said that the recovery rate is 98.4% and the mortality rate is 1.1%. As per statistics, 15 districts in state have a positivity rate in the range of 2.5% to 5.5%, meaning it is lower than the critical positivity rate of more than 6% but higher than the desirable positivity rate of less than 2 %.While three districts - Nuh (0.9%), Charkhi Dadri (1.2%) and Jhajjar (1.9%) have a desirable positivity rate of less than 2%, four districts - Faridabad (8.6%), Gurugram (7.1%), Rewari (7%) and Panchkula (6%) continued to have critical positivity rate of more than 6%.Free masks to people, police start 2 week drive to enforce Covid guidelinesThe Haryana Police have launched a two-week campaign on Monday to educate people and enforce wearing masks following Khattar’s directions to give five free masks to those found with uncovered face.“Publicity campaigns, including radio jingles regarding Covid guidelines should be launched and guidelines should be followed meticulously. Physical checking of industries and enforcement of Covid precautions at public places should be done regularly,” the CM directed while reviewing a meeting regarding Covid.He directed officers to ramp up Covid-19 management preparations coupled with aggressive surveillance, stringent containment, swift contact-tracing, focused clinical management and proactive information, education and communication activities. Additional director general of police (law and order) Navdeep Singh Virk said in view of the spurt in Covid cases and casual attitude among people, police have started two-week campaign to make people aware of risk of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/surge-in-covid-cases-in-haryana-continues-even-as-positivity-rate-dips-101614619043179.html
01-03-2021||Chandigarh||Tenure row: No plans to replace DGP, can continue till he retires, says Khattar||Putting an end to the row over the tenure of the state police chief, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday said that there is no plan to replace director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava.“We are not removing him as the DGP. After completion of two years, which is a minimum stipulation prescribed by the Supreme Court, the DGP has already been given an extension to continue till further orders. This means Yadava can continue as head of the police force till his retirement or when we decide to replace him. There is no decision to replace him. On the other hand, Yadava may like to go for a central assignment as he has been empaneled for holding a DG rank post at the Centre. That’s for him to decide,” Khattar said during a media interaction.As per the Rules of Business, the authority to appoint or transfer IPS officials is vested with the CM.State home minister Anil Vij had last week triggered controversy by writing to additional chief secretary (home) to send a panel of officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to be considered for the next DGP despite the fact that incumbent Manoj Yadava has over four years of service left.While Yadava completed two years on February 20, the state government on January 7 had extended his tenure till further orders.On whether he approved of the statements made by Vij on the tenure of the DGP, the chief minister said that Vij probably thought that the DGP’s tenure was merely for two years. “The SC’s directions are clear. Once the requirement of a minimum two-year tenure for the DGP is fulfilled, the state government can let the DGP continue beyond two years till he retires from service. It’s our discretion,’’ Khattar said.The CM added that Vij is pure-hearted and no one can question his intentions. “Vij is straightforward and speaks his mind. That’s his style of functioning. I have known him since the 90s and I know about his temperament since then. We will clear the air over this when we sit down together,” Khattar said.‘No law can be enacted for MSP’On the ongoing farmers’ agitation over the three farm laws enacted by the Centre, Khattar said it is not possible to enact a law prescribing minimum support price (MSP) for crops as was being demanded by farmer unions. “Politics, unfortunately, has taken over the issue and it is no longer being discussed on merits,” the CM said.‘Will write to Centre to convene meet for SYL’Khattar said he took up the issue of completion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal with Prime Minister Modi during the recent Niti Aayog meeting.“I will write to Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat again to convene a meeting with the Haryana and Punjab CMs to work out a solution for implementation of the SC’s January 15, 2002, and June 4, 2004, orders to complete the remaining portion of the canal by Punjab,” he said.The last such meeting was held in August last year on SC directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tenure-row-no-plans-to-replace-dgp-can-continue-till-he-retires-says-khattar-101614618923150.html

It said their numbers will increase as state president K Surendran’s state-wide yatra concludes in the state capital on March 7.Two former High Court judges, PN Raveendran and V Chidambaresh, joined the party on Sunday. Similarly, former director-general of Kerala police Venugopalan Nair, former navy admiral BR Menon, and All India Radio former director K A Muraleedharan had also joined the party, said the party, adding that more people will join in the coming days.Union home minister Amit Shah will participate in the concluding session of the rally in Thiruvananthapuram on March 7. The party is likely to announce its first list of candidates and a couple of film stars and former bureaucrats are expected to join the party on the occasion.“Kerala is really yearning for a change and time is ripe for a third alternative. Both fronts, the UDF and the LDF, are playing into the hands of communal forces. Even the Moppila rebellion of 1921 in Malabar had turned part of the freedom movement as part of the appeasement policy,” K Surendran said, adding the government had taken over thousands of acres of temple land in the state.Also read: ‘Against core ideology’ - Anand Sharma on Cong pact with Abbas Siddiqui’s partyHe reiterated the party's position that if voted to power, the BJP will abolish four temple boards (Travancore, Kochi, Guruvayur and Malabar Devasoms) and entrust responsibility to the respective shrines.“Temples are turning into a milking cow for respective governments. In all temple boards, politicians, at times non-believers, are getting filled. Let temples be managed by its priests and other office-bearers, not the government,” he said.On Monday, he called on Cardinal George Alancherry, head of the powerful Syro-Malabar church, at diocese headquarters in Ernakulam.This time, the party’s national leaders will be campaigning extensively in the state despite being a distant third in bipolar politics. The party’s recent performance in the local body elections, however, has given it some hope.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could muster around 16 per cent votes in the local polls. The party thinks it could win a few seats if it improves its vote share. The one seat it won (Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram) in the last assembly elections in 2016 was the party’s only notable poll outing in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/metro-man-e-sreedharan-s-entry-triggers-steady-flow-of-bigwigs-to-party-bjp-101614617195061.html

01-03-2021||Patna||Acute shortage of IAS officers in Bihar, many to retire this year||Bihar is working at just 56 per cent of the sanctioned strength of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers. It has just 202 IAS officers against the sanctioned strength of 359.Bihar home minister in-charge Bijendra Prasad Yadav said this while answering a starred question from All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MLA Akhtarul Imam in the Legislative Assembly on Monday.“Will the government tell the House the rationale of having such vacancies in the IAS which results in one officer holding additional charge of up to three departments and hampers developmental work?” Imam asked.Admitting the shortage of officers, the minister said that the Bihar government has urged the Centre for allotment of 54 officers based on the Civil Services exam, 2020. “The allotment of IAS officers is done by the Central government among states and Union territories on the basis of the Civil Services exams. Besides, appointments on 22 posts of the 2018 selection year, 15 posts of 2019 batch and 16 of 2020 batch under the promotion quota are also under process,” he added.Also read: ‘Against core ideology’- Anand Sharma on Congress-Indian Secular Front allianceThe minister said that there are 14 IAS officers holding charge of more than one department. “There are 11 IAS officers in the apex pay-scale of chief secretary while 15 IAS officers in the principal secretary rank are in the senior scale. We have requested the Centre for 54 officers from the 2020 Civil Services,” he added.The legislator, however, said that though there was a shortage of officers across the country, in Bihar, it was much higher compared to states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and even neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. “With more officers retiring this year, the situation will get even worse,” he added.Yadav responded to another query posed by Lok Janshakti Party’s Raj Kumar Singh regarding the delay in promotion of state government employees due to stay on all departmental promotion committee meetings till further order. Singh said that the delay has affected over 20,000 promotions. The home minister in-charge said it was due to the court order.The minister cited the apex court order of status quo in matters of reservation in promotion for SC/ST and its own April 11, 2019 notification whereby the state government had stayed all promotions. “The government had started the process but following the Patna High Court order in on a contempt plea in 2019, the process was stopped,” he added.However, the legislator said that there was no such order from the court to stop the promotion of all employees. He sought a copy of the government order stopping promotion. Rashtriya Janata Dal's (RJD) Alok Mehta also intervened and said that the court order was not being interpreted in the right perspective. “Sooner or later, the government will give promotion and arrear from a backdate. It is better the government grants promotion to its employees by the 2016 order,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/acute-shortage-of-ias-officers-in-bihar-many-to-retire-this-year-101614614860448.html

01-03-2021||Mumbai||'Cyber sabotage' attempt, says Anil Deshmukh on Mumbai power outage||Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday said that the massive power outage in Mumbai last October was an attempt at "cyber sabotage" according to a preliminary report.Addressing reporters here, Deshmukh said Maharashtra Cyber Cell has submitted a preliminary report whose findings state that evidence suggests that the grid failure in Mumbai on October 12 last year, that resulted in the city plunging into darkness and disrupting train services, shutting down the stock market and generally hitting economic activities, was likely to be a cyber sabotage. The report has been handed over to Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut.A report by a US-based cybersecurity firm claimed that Chinese-state sponsored groups, had targeted power sector in India with malware. This came months after the clash between troops of the two nations in Galwan valley in June 2020.The New York Times had on Sunday published a report based on the findings of the report." The report of New York Times has come now. But when Mumbai had gone under dark, we had set up a departmental inquiry committee. MERC (Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission) and Central Electricy Authority had also made their own committees. We have complained to Cyber Cell also," Nitin Raut said while speaking with mediapersons here."State Cyber Police Department investigated this and report was handed over to me today by Home Minister Anil Deshmukh ji. I will speak on this in legislature," Raut said.According to NYT report, the new study lent weight to the idea that the Mumbai blackout could be a "part of a broad Chinese cyber campaign against India's power grid, timed to send a message that if India pressed its claims too hard, the lights could go out across the country."Addressing a press conference here Deshmukh said: "On October 12 electricity failure, Maharashtra Cyber Cell report says, 8GB unaccounted data must have been transferred to Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) data. Protocol Data which means the server of MSEB was logged in on October 12."According to the Maharashtra Cyber Cell report, Deshmukh said: "there was the possibility of login attempts and 14 Trojan horses were landed on MSEB servers. There are chances of some foreign attempts."The Massachusetts-based cybersecurity company Recorded Future's study reported that a Chinese state-sponsored has been seen systematically utilising advanced cyberintrusion techniques to gain access to nearly a dozen critical nodes across the Indian power generation and transmission infrastructure."Since early 2020, Recorded Future's Insikt Group observed a large increase in suspected targeted intrusion activity against Indian organizations from Chinese statesponsored groups, the study said." From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future's midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and control (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India's power sector," the report said.According to the report 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including four of the five Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted campaign against India's critical infrastructure. Other targets identified included two Indian seaports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyber-sabotage-attempt-says-anil-deshmukh-on-mumbai-power-outage-101614611635379.html

In Punjab, the Congress government has backed the farmers’ agitation against the three new laws.But the Shiromani Akali Dal, criticised Governor V P Singh Badnore for not sending for the President’s consideration the Bills passed by the state Assembly last year to "counter" the laws.SAD members led by Bikram Singh Majithia came to the well of the House, shouted slogans and hurled papers in the air as the Governor began his address. They continued raising slogans during the almost 20-minute-long speech of the Governor.Aam Aadmi Party members also shouted slogans against the state government for its alleged failure in keeping its poll promises.Addressing the House, the Punjab Governor said, "My government is fully alive to the concerns of the farmers in the State as they are the pivot of the state's economy. We will not let the farmers and the farm workers suffer in any manner."Badnore said the Asssembly members are aware of the devastation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.“Thereafter, the agitation against three new farm laws enacted by the Government of India led to quite an unprecedented situation in the state,” said Badnore.The Governor said though the pandemic is presently under control, the farmers' agitation and its resultant effect on the farming communities is causing a "lot of anxiety" among the common man.Badnore said farmers feel that the new legislations enacted by the Centre do not address their concerns of "stagnating incomes" as a result of saturating productivity."They apprehend that these laws would disrupt the time-tested agriculture marketing systems established under the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961. There are also apprehensions about the dismantling of the government procurement of foodgrain at the minimum support price (MSP)," said Badnore.The Governor said his government had taken these concerns of farmers seriously. The House passed three amendment legislations to mitigate the anticipated adverse impact of the Central laws, he said."These legislations are pending for the Presidential assent under Article 254 of the Constitution," he said."My government strongly feels that the enactment of these three central laws is against the principles of cooperative federalism as agriculture is a state subject under entry 14 of List II of Schedule 7 of the Constitution," he said."The state chief minister has time and again urged the prime minister to reconsider these laws, concede to the demand of farmers and withdraw these new central legislations," said Badnore.On Covid-19, the governor stated that the pandemic has been contained but this should not be a reason to be complacent."My government shall continue to exercise due care and caution to prevent the resurgence of this virus in near future," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-governor-says-farm-laws-don-t-address-farmers-stagnating-income-problem-101614610003369.html

Punekars took this seriously and stormed the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Kamala Nehru hospital, one of three sites where vaccination had opened up.However, the civic body was unprepared to tackle the situation. Seniors citizens were left frustrated as the vaccination did not start until noon due to technical glitches and poor crowd management. At least 12 lakh people are expected to get the vaccine under phase two in Pune city alone. Not just senior citizens, or those within the age bracket of 45 to 59 years with comorbidities, had reached the hospital, but also frontline workers (FLW) and health care workers (HCW) whose names were missing from the earlier registration under phase one, also reached the hospital. Citizens complained that the FLWs and HCWs were being prioritised. Some citizens complained that given the rising number of cases in the city, no Covid-19 appropriate behaviour was being followed at the hospital. PMC’s Kothrud-located Sutar hospital, along with the Rajiv Gandhi hospital, also saw beneficiaries returning due to the glitches with the CoWin app, which halted vaccination for hours. A similar situation was seen at Sassoon General Hospital, the vaccination was delayed there too. Sunil Shaligram, who had come for his vaccination at the hospital, said, “There is complete confusion at Sassoon hospital. Senior citizens were in a queue for hours. Vaccination had to be halted for a while because of the technical problems.” Authorities at the hospital said that due to unregistered beneficiaries being vaccinated, the app was not able to verify ages and it added extra work for the hospital staff. Users also complained on social media platforms that the CoWin app was not functioning. Citizens were unable to register their names, or they were unable to download the app on their phones. Residents living in the city also said that they were being offered vaccination centres far from the city. Arun Iyer, an author, tweeted on Monday afternoon, “The PMC must provide a list of hospitals within PMC limits that are actually offering vaccinations. The CoWin portal has a long list of clinics/hospitals, but no slots for the month. I am not sure if they are booked out or a portal glitch.” Jabbed, and relievedHowever, beneficiaries were elated when they finally got the vaccine. Jatin Shejpal, aged 46, who came from Rasta peth to Kamala Nehru hospital, said, “I am suffering from thalassemia. I had got the comorbidity certificate and Aadhar card. However, when I reached the hospital, despite repeated attempts, the hospital was unable to register my name. After multiple attempts my name was registered and I could finally get the vaccine.”Husband and wife duo, Jatin and Varsha Shah, aged 62 and 57, both could get the vaccine after their son got their names registered on the CoWin app a day prior. Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean at Sassoon said, “The app was not working in the morning and so vaccination was delayed. In the afternoon we began the process. By evening all the registered health care workers had been vaccinated and now we will vaccinate the senior citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chaos-confusion-and-technical-glitches-mark-phase-2-of-covid-vaccination-drive-101614610341835.html

The Maharashtra Public Service Commission announced its revised dates for state civil service prelim examination around this time and we scheduled the batches from February 1. Now coaching centres have been closed again. How are we supposed to sustain the losses? Even when coaching centres were not open, we had to pay rent,” said Ranjan Kolambe, director, Bhagirath Academy.“Our scheduled batches and the planning has been disrupted because of this order. Our students are grown-ups and they can follow all the Covid protocols. We should get permission to operate. While coming back into the city after lockdown, the MPSC aspirants had to invest in hostels/rooms, mess and coaching classes. This decision is putting them in loss academically and financially,” siad Dnyaneshwar Patil, director, Gurukul Prabodhini.According to coaching class administrators, online coaching is not feasible for competitive examinations. “Our students are from rural areas. Online coaching for all the students is not feasible. There are several topics which have to be explained personally,” said Nagesh Gavhane, administrative officer, The Unique Academy.Following the Covid outbreak in Amravati and Akola districts and the closing of colleges in Pune district, daily passenger numbers on the Vidarbha route have decreased. Bus commuters on the wane“The passenger traffic to Vidarbha has drastically reduced. Passenger traffic to Amravati and Akola has reduced by 30-40 per cent in the last eight days since curfew began in Amravati. Now the curfew has been extended.

Currently, the situation is that we are not getting customers after 9.30 pm. The main business of bars, permit rooms and family restaurants is at night. As restaurants were allowed to be functional, we had called back our workers. Now how we are supposed to pay salaries. Business is only 30-40 per cent of the usual intake,” said Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune restaurant and hoteliers association.Theatre lockoutThe night curfew has had an impact on the theatre industry as well. Producers have had to cancel shows scheduled after 9 pm. Many cultural programme organisers have postponed events.Pune Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao emphasised on the necessity of the restrictions and mentioned that these are not harsh norms as compared to last year. Restrictions based on “sound scientific knowledge”“Mandais and markets are open. These are not harsh restrictions if we compare it to last year,” Saurabh Rao said.Rao said that the restrictions are not irrational and there is in fact a scientific study done by Tata Consultancy Services and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research on the correlation between the restrictions and the number of positive cases. “The aim of this report is to reduce the positive cases with minimum hardships (that are restrictions). The predictions of these institutions of positive case numbers were almost accurate for the months of December, January and February. Now the administration has a year of experience. I don’t want to impose any restrictions unscientifically. Whatever recommendations we make regarding restrictions to the guardian minister have to be based on sound scientific knowledge,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-biz-sectors-hard-hit-by-covid-restrictions-brace-for-another-loss-making-run-101614608901725.html
01-03-2021||Lucknow||Speed of execuyion of Jewar airport project reflects new work culture of UP: CM||The speed of execution of the Noida International Airport project near Jewar in the Gautam Buddh Nagar despite the prolonged Covid lockdown reflects the new work culture of Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday. The chief minister made this remark on the occasion of the inking of the state support agreement between the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited and the Noida International Airport Limited, a subsidiary of the Zurich Airport International AG, the developer chosen for the development of the airport. On the occasion, the chief minister also reviewed the progress of the project and expressed his government’s resolve to complete it on a priority basis. Underlining the importance that the state government accords to the Jewar airport, the chief minister said the project was lying pending with previous governments for almost 30 years, but his government decided in March 2017 itself to prioritise it in the interest of the state and the country. Recalling that there were only two operational airports – Lucknow and Varanasi -- in the state in 2017, the chief minister said barely three years later, however, it now has seven airports – Agra, Hindon, Gorakhpur, Prayagraj and Bareilly – besides those of Lucknow and Varanasi. “Not only this, The country’s largest state had only two international airports earlier – Lucknow and Varanasi. But it will soon have five international airports, including the upcoming ones in Jewar, Ayodhya and Kushinagar near Gorakhpur,” he added. The chief minister said he is of the view that good connectivity expedites the development process. "The process of operationalization of altogether 21 airports is underway in UP. This effort will be to make UP soar in the field of civil aviation," he said. While reviewing the progress in the execution of Jewar airport, Adityanath also appreciated the work of Zurich Airport International AG and assured its representatives of all possible help from the government in expediting the project. On the occasion, the chief minister also reviewed the progress in the rehabilitation of the people displaced due to the development of the Jewar airport. Owing to some areas of the village Rehi coming in the way of the development of the Jewar airport runways, the chief minister opined that the villagers from those areas should be vacated first. He also asked officials to enforce a better rehabilitation mechanism for the displaced people without inconveniencing them. He also advised setting up a committee headed by the Meerut divisional commissioner for rehabilitating displaced people and said this committee should also be having a retired judge or an IAS officer as the observer of the rehabilitation process. With the chief minister batting for a better mechanism for the rehabilitation process, the Gautam Buddh Nagar district magistrate informed him that the administration has acquired over 48 hectares of land in the Jewar Bangar area for the rehabilitation of the displaced people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/speed-of-execuyion-of-jewar-airport-project-reflects-new-work-culture-of-up-cm-101614605685579.html

Those ageing above 60 years and people above 45 years of age with specific co-morbidities participated in the vaccination drive with enthusiasm and zeal.Several places reported technical errors in the CoWin software which led beneficiaries waiting. The drive, however, later began with offline registration.The first person to get vaccinated in the second phase was Governor Kalraj Mishra who received his vaccine shot at Raj Bhavan in the state capital.“I thank the scientists for successfully developing the vaccine, following the complete standards and prescribed procedure in a short time,” he said.Also read: Tejashwi Yadav meets Mamata Banerjee, offers full support in Bengal polls﻿The Governor has appealed that those eligible for vaccination should get both doses on time without any hesitation. “ Do not be careless even after getting the first dose of the vaccine. Follow the norms of two yards distance, wear a mask and sanitise regularly,” he said.The first vaccine shot at Sawai Man Singh Hospital (SMS), the biggest government hospital in the state, was administered to Mangala Dixit, 72. She arrived with her younger sister Veerabala Joshi (66), brothers Dinesh Dwivedi (64) and Suresh Joshi (70) to get vaccinated. Mangla Joshi has been the deputy director in the education department.After getting vaccinated, Dixit said, “This vaccine is very safe. We got the motivation to get vaccinated after watching PM Modi getting the vaccine. The fear of safety issue faded away after watching the PM today.” She added that everyone should come forward to get vaccinated.“The feeling is good. There was no problem of any kind,” said Veerbala Joshi after getting the dose of the vaccine.In Jaipuria Hospital, there was a slight delay in the process of vaccination. Due to the problem of online registration, there were some minutes of delay. The online system at the satellite hospital in Banipark collapsed. After this, offline registration was done.Health secretary Siddharth Majahan said, “The vaccination is going on smoothly across the state. People are enthusiastic about the vaccination drive. There was some technical error in software but we have asked the centre to continue with the vaccination process and update the data when the error is resolved.”The second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination commenced smoothly in Kota.

In Ajmer, people were seen in a long queue to get vaccinated. At a hospital in Ajmer, offline registration was done when a problem was reported in online registration.In Udaipur, ex-Union minister Dr Girijiya Vyas received his first vaccine dose at the RNT medical college. Vyas said that every citizen should be careful towards their health and should show their responsibility towards society by getting vaccinated as per the government's schedule.She further said, "Many misconceptions are there in the society regarding the vaccine but it is safe.”The state health department had prepared to achieve the target of the inoculation of 16.3 million people in phase II of the vaccination drive. The vaccination will be free at government hospitals while people getting vaccinated at private hospitals will be charged ₹250 per dose.Rajasthan had achieved more than 85 per cent of the target in the vaccination drive for health and frontline workers.More than 4,000 sites have been prepared across the state, including 400 in Jaipur, to achieve the vaccination target.The Central government has approved doses for 6.8 million people above 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-begins-second-phase-of-covid-19-vaccination-101614606031414.html

01-03-2021||Today's||Who is stirring the caste cauldron in Karnataka?||The last few months have seen a series of caste agitations in Karnataka demanding either greater reservation or to be included in some preferred category of Scheduled Tribe or Scheduled Caste status.What is interesting is that it is not just traditional backward communities like Idigas, Valmikis and Ganga Mathastas but dominant communities like Lingayats, Vokkaligas and Kurubas who are undertaking these massive protests.Karnataka – formerly the princely state of Mysuru - was one of the earliest in India to implement some form of the reservation to ensure better representation to all sections of the society.It was the Mysuru King Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar who more than a century ago in 1918 set up a committee and subsequently implemented reservations for non-Brahmins.While it is generally accepted that the Lingayats, Vokkaligas and Kurubas are the three most numerically strong communities – in that order - there has not been a valid caste census undertaken in the last few decades.A feeble attempt at such a census called ‘socio-economic’ survey was undertaken by the previous Congress government headed by Siddaramiah. However, the report is yet to see the light of the day.The leaked findings of the survey indicated that the numbers of the three major communities might have been overstated and those of others like Muslims might have been understated.After the threat of backlash from some of the castes, the Siddaramiah government refused to release it and though subsequently both JDS, in coalition with Congress, and now the BJP has held the reins of power in the state, they have also not released it nor ordered any fresh survey.So in reality the numbers arrived at for each caste is based on an approximation of the more than three-decade-old Chinappa Reddy commission report of 1990. While all that is fine, why are the caste fires being stoked now and who is stirring the pot?Two primary reasons are being adduced for the current round of agitations. One is the shrinking economic opportunity – may be temporary and related to the Covid-induced economic slowdown – and second is the internal politics of BJP.Let us examine both.According to the union ministry of statistics and programme implementation, in 2019-2020 Karnataka was the second fastest-growing large state by GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) in the country next only to Gujarat.However, the pandemic-induced economic contraction has meant all-around pain. Analysts believe that the shrinking economic pie and consequent job losses have been one of the key reasons for the current social unrest, with various groups clamouring for a bigger share of a smaller set of opportunities.First, it was Idigas (the traditional toddy tapping community) also called Billava and Deevaru in parts of the state who form about 2.5 to 3 per cent of the state’s population demanding that they be moved from Other Backward Classes to the SC list.Next were the Ganga Mathasta (traditional fishermen community) who also go by various names like Bestha, Mogaveera, Koli, Kabbaliga, Madder and others, who protested, demanding that they be moved from the OBC list and be given the ST tag. This community is as numerically large as the Idigas.The Valmikis who already have the ST tag have sought 7.5% reservation in all jobs and educational institutions. However, what might have taken Yediyurappa by surprise is the demand of the dominant castes like Lingayats, Vokkaligas and Kurubas for greater reservations.Though the government has blamed the opposition for fishing in troubled waters by trying to take political advantage of the agitations, Yediyurappa may have to look within.Lingayats who include about 99 sub-sects are believed to be about 16-17 per cent of the population. Vokkaligas are estimated at between 11-13 per cent and Kurubas at 9-11 per cent.All of them have taken to the streets with religious leaders from their respective communities leading protest marches. Political leaders cutting across party lines belonging to respective castes have also participated in these marches.Such is the dominance of these communities that of the 22 chief ministers that have governed Karnataka till now, nine are Lingayats, six Vokkaligas, five belonged to the OBC community and there have been two Brahmins. However, Karnataka has never had a CM belonging to an SC, ST or a minority community.Now the largest sub-sect of the most numerically dominant caste in the state is demanding additional reservation privileges. Panchamshali Lingayats who form around 65-70 per cent of the Lingayat population are protesting on the streets. Yediyurappa, who for long has leveraged his position as the tallest leader of the Lingayat community, is caught in a Catch-22 situation, with a chunk of the community being egged on to protest against him.Of the nine Lingayat CMs of the state, eight were from the Banajiga sub-sect and one from the Sadr. Yediyurappa himself is Banajiga. Panchamshali Lingayats are being led by the CM’s fiercest critic in the party, Basangouda Patil Yatnal with the support of community seers demanding reservation under the 2A section.Yatnal is no political lightweight having been a former union minister in the AB Vajpayee government. Interestingly, for a usually disciplined party, Yatnal has not been pulled up the BJP high command – till now at least -- but only by some local leaders.This has led to speculation whether the intra-Lingayat caste protests are being encouraged to undermine Yediyurappa’s leadership of the community. It is no secret that the BJP high command has been looking to replace the 78-year-old leader and it may use the ongoing protests as an excuse to find a replacement.Whatever may be the reason – economic pain or an internal power struggle – the onset of summer has meant not only soaring mercury but also political temperatures on the boil, with protests by various communities only increasing.(Venkatesha Babu is a senior journalist and analyst with a keen interest in politics, economy and culture of Southern India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/who-is-stirring-the-caste-cauldron-in-karnataka-101614604265600.html

Yet when you ask her if her priority in a film is the stature of her co-star, she denies. “I have never gone with bigger stars, or said ‘oh there’s a big star, let me sign it’. There were places in my career in the beginning when I was getting some characters with big people. I didn’t feel like I wanted to. People would tell me to do just do it for the pairing, I would say no. If I don’t feel like, I won’t do it,” she makes it clear.Having done all kinds of commercial films, she continues, she now has got the “right balance” between content and commerce. “You should have a good part too, there has to be something concrete. I now have a name for myself in south, people have expectations. The moment I sign something crappy, people will feel hurt. Honestly, here fans take everything very personally, it’s very different from the north. The fan base in south, you will find nowhere else. You feel like you are answerable to them, you can’t pick up anything random,” says Khanna, who had started her film career with the Hindi film Madras Café.What’s more surprising is that she’s a Delhi girl, who had no exposure to Tamil, Telugu or Malayalam films, in which she actually works prominently now. Ask her how did she manage it, and the actor reveals, “When I entered Telugu film, I was serious about one thing that I want to learn the language. Unless I learn it, I would not be able to convince the audience. I am very hard on myself, and self motivated. Only when you know the language and culture, can you connect with them. So today, when you ask, people in Hyderabad will tell you ‘I am a Tleugu girl’, they have taken me home with them. That only happens when you put in that extra effort. Today, apart from singing, talking in Telugu, I feel like a Telugu girl. Malayalam is extremely difficult.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/raashii-khanna-the-fan-base-in-south-you-will-find-nowhere-else-you-feel-you-are-answerable-to-them-101614605242416.html

Pre-poll surveys conducted by Asianet News, IANS-CVoter and Flowers Channel have predicted an edge to the LDF in their surveys, also hinting at the possibility of the ruling front breaking the three-decade-old poll jinx of not giving a second term to the incumbent government.

He may be an ace swimmer and swam in many seas across the world but the waters here are different,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan took a dig at the Congress leader on Sunday, citing his sea bath off Kollam coast last week.He also chided the leader saying his sea voyage and subsequent bath have given a big boost to the tourism sector.Also read: Tejashwi Yadav meets Mamata Banerjee, offers full support in Bengal pollsDuring his last tour of the state (his second trip in two months), Gandhi had ventured into the Arabian Sea off Kollam on Wednesday along with fishermen to study their problems and jumped into the water after the net was cast and spent more than 15 minutes before returning to the shore. Visuals of his sea expedition had turned viral later.LDF leaders admit in private that his frequent trips to the state can turn the tables in the April 6 assembly elections like the last parliamentary poll wherein it lost all but one of the 20 Lok Sabha seats.The former Congress chief's entry in Wayanad as a candidate and the government’s handling of the emotional Sabarimala temple issue were cited for the Congress-led UDF's sweep in 2019.“He has changed his narrative of a national leader. The BJP is not a force to reckon with in Kerala. Instead of supporting secular forces that are fighting communal elements, he is weakening secular-democratic forces,” said Politburo member MA Baby, adding that his criticism of the BJP was only confined to his words, not deeds.”During the crucial Bihar elections last year, he was on a pleasure trip abroad. From his behaviour, we can gauge that he’s not at all serious. Instead of attacking the BJP, which is toppling Congress governments in many states, he’s training his guns on the Left,” he said, adding he was behaving as if Left parties were his main enemies.The strong Kerala lobby of the party has prevailed over its leader not to attend Sunday’s mega opposition rally in Kolkata where the Congress and the CPI(M) are allies.“After attacking the CPI(M) in Kerala, how can he change the script in Bengal all of a sudden? We told him about this and he agreed to our suggestion,” said a senior party leader, who did not want to be named.Party insiders said the state unit has asked the leader to campaign at least a week in the state.“We can understand the desperate mood setting in the CPI(M) camp. Rahul and Priyanka will campaign extensively in the state. We are planning their programmes in almost every district,” he said. During his last trip, Rahul Gandhi had sharpened his attack on the left saying there was a discreet understanding between the CPI(M) and the BJP that was the reason for slow progress in many cases probed by central agencies, including the sensational gold smuggling through the UAE consulate.Political observers also agree his vigorous campaign will change the scene. “In Kerala, more than 46 per cent of the population belongs to minority communities. As an alternative to Narendra Modi, he holds much sway among them,” said senior journalist and political analyst John Mary.Gandhi’s skipping the Kolkata rally has also upset the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which was planning a mega campaign against the Congress and the CPI(M) pointing out their contradictory positions in Kerala and West Bengal. But it said this ‘unholy alliance’ was nothing new.“You don’t have to go to faraway Bengal to witness this double standard. In neighbouring, Tamil Nadu both are in the DMK coalition,” said party state president K Surendran, adding that both were practising politics of convenience, not ideology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rahul-gandhi-s-frequent-forays-into-kerala-worry-left-101614603559366.html

01-03-2021||Chandigarh||SBI’s oldest branch in Punjab shut for not paying rent to Abohar Municipal Corporation||The oldest branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) in Punjab was sealed by the Abohar municipal corporation on Monday for unauthorised occupation of a public asset since 1982. According to the local body authorities, India’s largest public sector bank had defaulted on payment of monthly rent of nearly ₹1 crore. The authorities said that officials of the Abohar municipal corporation had failed to act against the illegal possession of its property by the bank on prime land in Bazaar Number 4 for four decades. With the help of the local police authorities, the Abohar MC took possession of the building but left the bank customers and staff in a quandary. Official sources said the SBI branch has estimated cash of ₹50 crore in the vaults besides a large number of lockers and important official data. When contacted, SBI branch chief manager Gaurav Aggarwal declined comment. Abohar municipal commissioner Abhijeet Kaplish said that in 1930, the then local body had given land on lease to the then Imperial Bank of India that was renamed State Bank of India after being nationalised following Independence. Monthly rent should have been ₹5 lakh: MC chief “The property on which the bank was functional was given on lease and its term ended in 1982. After that, the bank started paying a monthly rent of ₹20,000 arbitrarily fixed without any merit but continued its operations without renewing the lease. For the past two years, it stopped paying the rent to MC altogether. The anomaly came to my notice after I assumed office last year and the bank was apprised of the illegality. Our team calculated that the monthly rent of the building should be ₹5 lakh,” Kaplish said. After serving repeated notices, the local body filed a case under the Punjab Public Premises and Land (Eviction and Rent Recovery) Act, 1973 (Punjab Act 31 of 1973). On December 15, 2020, the collector court of the sub divisional magistrate directed the bank to vacate the premises. “The SBI management was even offered the land for ₹10 crore. But the bank did not show any interest and the pending dues were also not cleared after which the MC took control over its legitimate property today,” Kaplish said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sbis-oldest-branch-in-punjab-shut-for-not-paying-rent-to-abohar-mc-101614596121874.html
01-03-2021||Other||Rising air pollution led to 41,090 deaths in Punjab in 2019: Report||Punjab reported as many as 41,090 deaths attributable to air pollution, which is 18.8% of the total fatalities, in 2019, revealed the Down to Earth and Centre for Science and Environment’s annual report titled “State of India’s Environment 2021”.The report, which was released on Saturday, stated that 1.67 million Indians died due to air pollution in 2019 as per the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 on health and economic impact of air pollution in the states of India. Half of these deaths were in just five states including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Rajasthan. In Punjab, 1,148 million US dollars (1.49% state GDP) economic loss was ascribed to air pollution. “As many as 34,119 deaths (19% of total deaths) were attributable to air pollution range in Haryana in the year while the state pegged 1,566 million US dollars economic loss due to air pollution,” the report said.The report mentioned that two Punjab industrial clusters, including Jalandhar and Batala, were among 33 of the 88 clusters of the country where air quality evaluated in 2009 had worsened by 2018. In 2009, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) developed the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) to identify problematic industrial areas in the country. In the 2009 CEPI study, a total of 88 industrial clusters were identified as polluted industrial areas (PIAS) by CPCB and state PPCB.”Water pollution up in LudhianaThe report said that the industrial cluster of Ludhiana was among 45 of total 88 clusters where water pollution had increased. The city scored over 70 (CEPI score out of 100) in 2018, under the critically polluted cluster category, since 2009 in absence of adequate action to reduce the pollution.“Jalandhar and Batala were among 35 of the 88 industrial clusters between 2009 and 2018 where overall environmental degradation was witnessed in the period. In this category, CEPI score of Jalandhar was around 70 in the year 2009, but it has increased nearer to 80 (out of 100), while Batala scored over 60 in 2009 while it was closer to 70 in 2018,” the report said.The report underlined that despite environmental concerns, an industrial park was approved in July near the Mattewara forest range and the Sutlej in Ludhiana.Govt making all efforts: Environment secyPunjab environment secretary Rahul Tiwari said the Punjab government has been making efforts to curb air pollution. The government has cleared 23 plans to check pollution in the state. The plans are regularly monitored by his office and quarterly by the Punjab chief secretary and NGT panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rising-air-pollution-led-to-41-090-deaths-in-punjab-in-2019-report-101614594082244.html
01-03-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: The art of negotiation—Commercial Street edition||The thought occurred as I eyed a stunning silver dinner set in a jewellery store on Commercial Street in central Bengaluru—plates, tumblers, katoris, the works.The slight smile on the wizened shopkeeper’s face suggested that he was willing to bargain. But where to begin? Middle age brings many challenges: home, job, mortgage and the realisation that you can actually learn something from your parents. So I walked out of the store and called my mother.“Ma, teach me how to bargain,” I said plaintively.“My dearest child,” cooed my mother. “I knew you would see sense.”When she heard I was contemplating buying silver, she promptly passed the baton to a specialist. “Call Lily aunty,” she commanded. I come from a long line of bargaining women, who can, with one eye, take apart an object and drive the shopkeeper to tears with the other. In spite of this, or perhaps because I have watched them haggle down the price of everything from a teak dining table to a tamatar (tomato), I have been an awkward and sniffy bargainer—scolding my mother and aunts for being cheapskates.Also Read | India’s first hearing impaired female biker: I may not hear it, but I feel the windAll of last year, thanks to Covid-19, I took refuge online, buying Jai Hind pens, Agra dal moth, Amritsari achar, Hyderabadi lac bangles, beta-blockers, stinky cheese, equally stinky Ayurvedic oils and neti pots without speaking to a single human being. Bargaining was so last century, I thought.Then I saw the silver dinner set. Bengaluru, these days, behaves like Covid-19 was a dream, or at least a mirage. People still wear the requisite mask like it is a beard. But walk down Commercial Street, Brigade Road, Avenue Road or any of the thoroughfares that dot this city, and you will feel like you are in a mela.Commercial Street is no different. As the saying goes in Bengaluru, “You can buy everything except your parents here.”At this large jewellery store that shall remain nameless, people were crowding around the counters, buying gold and silver for the 2,000-people weddings that were beginning to take place in Palace Grounds. Lily aunty, with her penchant for precious metals, would fit right in.Lily aunty is from the Konkan coast. She has light green eyes, brown hair and light skin. For decades, the family gossip was that Lily aunty was half-French. But Lily aunty had one trait that endeared herself to all her jealous sisters-in-law: she was a killer bargainer. It wasn’t any one thing she did. It was who she was.Bargaining, like flirtation, is more attitude than technique, more style than skill. There are no set steps that you can follow. Instead, it is about being playful, irreverent, even sexy—channelling your inner Helen or Rekha—in Khoobsurat, not Umrao Jaan. You have to flatter and charm, tease and cajole—all the qualities that had been drummed out of me by a year of sheltering in place thanks to Covid-19.So we went, Lily aunty and I, to hobnob with the wedding shoppers. Fortified by a Maddur vada from Woody’s and some hot jalebis from Santhanam Sweets down the road, we arrived at one of the most famous names in jewellery in Bengaluru.“Remember, just because he says the silver plate costs ₹10,000 doesn’t make it so,” said Lily aunty with perverse but compelling logic. “To you, the silver plate may be worth ₹100. To you, a single scoop of badam halwa from Asha Sweets in Malleshwaram may be worth more than all the silver in his shop.”“Or a benne dosai from CTR (Central Tiffin Room) in Malleshwaram,” I added, feeling more hungry by the minute.“In other words, it is all a question of perceived value,” chimed in her husband, Rao uncle, the economics professor who was the designated driver, or in this case, given how crowded the area was, the designated “parker” of the car.Lily aunty looked at him like he had sprouted two heads. “What do men know of these matters?” she said, dismissively. Most men are famously bad bargainers. They don’t have the sense of entitlement of a Gujarati grandmother or the swagger of a Punjabi matron, both of whom can—without wincing—ask for something at a price that will put the merchant out of business.South Indians like Lily aunty and my mom fake ferocity and have a flair for insults—all delivered with a saccharine sweet smile—what I call the sexy rowdy approach—like Rajinikanth. But really, there is no rule book. I know Mathur women who flirt their way to a good deal. Their Lucknowi counterparts submerge a salesman under an ocean of polite flattery. Uninformed, unformed novices like me on the other hand, gloat when we get a car salesman to knock ₹1,000 off the ₹3,49,999 sticker price—instead of offering ₹1,000 for the car, as any self-respecting Indian grandmother would.“Lily aunty, go easy,” I said as we entered the store. “I live in this area. I don’t want to be thrown out of the store, or worse, blacklisted by all the shopkeepers of Commercial Street.”“First rule of bargaining: keep an open mind,” said aunty sagely. “The world, my dear, is full of possibilities.”With that cryptic statement, she sailed into the store in a cloud of imitation Dior perfume, jangling bangles, French chiffon, clutching a homemade pink potli bag.I bent my head from side to side like wrestlers do before a fight. And then I walked in to the arena. You won’t believe what happened.

01-03-2021||Pune||Pune’s Covid tally again on the rise, curbs extended||Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Pune with the district reporting 1,585 cases on Sunday. In a week’s time, Pune district reported 9,395 new cases, a daily case load average of 1,342, more than double of what the district reported two weeks ago, on February 14, when 617 cases were reported. This upsurge has forced the administration to extend restrictions on movement of people during night time and on schools and colleges till March 14. Experts believe that the surge could be because of the lackadaisical attitude of the people and could also be the attributed to the new variant which has possibly entered the district even as samples are being tested at Pune’s National Institute of Virology. Also Read | Tragic case of a woman, a minister and the Pune PoliceAs per the data from the district information office until February 21, since the imposition of fine, a total of ₹26.99 crore has been collected from 543,000 people in the district for not wearing masks and spitting in public.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical adviser to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 outbreak said, “Initially, the rise was noticed in Maharashtra’s Amravati and Yavatmal districts where interplay of multiple factors, such as a large number of people violating the Covid norms, erratic climate, and the mutation in the virus were noticed. The surge was witnessed in Pune and Mumbai as well.” During September last year when Covid was at its peak, Pune reported close to 5,000 cases every day. The district has had 409,000 cases since March 9, 2020, when first case was reported. Once the number of cases started rising again in February, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar chaired a meeting on February 21 to take a call on the various measures to contain the spread. The positivity rate, which is the number of positive cases per 100 samples tested, was about 6% during January 25-29 period. It rose to 10% in the first week on February and has gone up to 12.46% as of Sunday, February 28. Pune now has most active cases in the state, with over 15,000 people undergoing treatment in various hospitals or in home isolation. The district administration has found that the emerging hot spots in the city are the same places that were reporting cases almost four months into the pandemic. The new hot spots are being monitored with more testing among super spreaders and also aggressive contact tracing. The administration has also decide to reactivate departments such as revenue department, police department, food and drugs administration and gram panchayats to ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and also to impose penalty. According to Indian Medical Association (IMA) president, Maharashtra chapter, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, the sudden surge in the cases could be attributed to the entry of the mutated variant of the virus. “The government wants to hide this fact that the mutated variant either from UK or South Africa has already entered the city. If they admit it then it’ll mean that the government has failed to isolated the infected patients who came from these affected countries. Also, this will hamper the ongoing vaccination drive because the efficacy of the current dose has to be tested against this mutated virus too,” Bhondwe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-covid-tally-again-on-the-rise-curbs-extended-101614592462172.html

A lawyer in the case had earlier informed March 22 as the next date of hearing.Ranaut's advocate Rizwan Siddiquee argued in the court that the summons and process were issued against Ranaut without following the procedure laid down in law and hence, were "bad in law".Siddiquee said a petition would be filed in the Bombay High Court challenging the process issued by the magistrate.Akhtar's advocate Vrinda Grover, however, argued that even if the process is being challenged, Ranaut has to appear before the court as directed, in the absence of any stay on the summons by a higher court."It is the accused's right to appeal against the order, or even challenge the proceedings, that no one can deny and no one can stop, not even this court. However, she (Ranaut) has failed to comply with the order of this court and there is also no stay obtained from a higher court,"the lawyer argued.Grover then filed an application seeking a non- bailable warrant to be issued against the actor.This was opposed by Siddiquee.Magistrate Khan observed that Ranaut was at the liberty to approach a higher court to challenge the process issued against her, but that would not absolve her from appearing before this court.The court issued a bailable warrant against Ranaut and posted the matter for hearing on March 26.Last month, the Mumbai police submitted a report to the court, saying an offence of defamation was made out against the actor.Akhtar filed the complaint against Ranaut in November last year for allegedly making baseless and false statements against him which, according to him, damaged his reputation.In his complaint, the lyricist claimed Ranaut had made defamatory comments against him in an interview by dragging his name while referring to a "coterie" existing in Bollywood, following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year.Akhtar in his plea claimed the baseless comments made by Ranaut had caused damage to his reputation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bailable-warrant-issued-against-kangana-on-javed-akhtar-s-complaint-101614588652494.html
01-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana minister Vij says don’t need vaccine now. Explains his reason||Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij said on Monday he will not take the second dose of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease as he has a high antibody count after he recently recovered from Covid-19.“Today corona vaccination drive is beginning for the general public. Everyone should get it without any hesitation. I cannot receive the vaccine because after being infected by my antibody count is currently 300, which is quite high. Maybe the trial vaccine I had taken also had a role to play. I do not need the vaccine at this moment,” Vij’s tweet, roughly translated from Hindi, said.आज आम जनता के लिए कोरोना वैक्सीन शुरू होने जा रही है । सब को निस्संकोच लगवानी चाहिए । मैं तो नही लगवा पाऊंगा क्योंकि कोविड होने के बाद मेरी एंटीबाडी 300 बनी है जोकि बहुत ज्यादा है । शायद मैंने जो ट्रायल वैक्सीन लगवाई थी इसमे उसका भी योगदान हो । मुझे अभी वैक्सीन की जरूरत नही है ।The minister tested positive for Covid-19 in December last year, days after volunteering to be a part of the third phase trial of Covaxin. The trial for the third phase had begun on November 20.Vij’s comments came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi got the first shot of Covaxin. The Haryana minister said that PM after taking the vaccine has proven himself to be a ‘true hero’ and thanked him for addressing the issues around vaccine scepticism. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a true hero of the nation and every time he has come forward to lead the country. He was the first person to get vaccinated today and by doing so he addressed concerns surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine so that people fearlessly get vaccinated,” he said in another tweet. “Please go ahead and get vaccinated and do not subject yourself to false propaganda peddled by the opposition,” he added.प्रधानमन्त्री नरेंद्रमोदी जी देश के सच्चे नायक हैं हर घड़ी पर हमेशा उन्होंने आगे बढ़ कर देश को रास्ता दिखाया है ।आज भी उन्होंने सबसे पहले कोरोना वैक्सीन लगवाई है ताकि लोगों में किसी प्रकार की कोई भ्रांति न रहे और लोग विपक्ष के दुष्प्रचार में न आएं और आगे बढ़कर वैक्सीनेशन करवाएं ।Haryana, along with the rest of the country, began the second phase of vaccination on Monday. The state-run hospitals will administer the vaccines free of charge while government-empanelled private hospitals will charge ₹250 for the vaccination. Vij on Sunday had said that the state government is taking every step to ensure the success of the vaccination drive while trying to curb the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-minister-vij-says-don-t-need-vaccine-now-explains-his-reason-101614587900282.html
01-03-2021||Bangalore||Puneeth Rajkumar: Soon, we will have Kannada web shows as well||Cinema and OTT will continue to coexist and both mediums have great potential and more entertainment for audiences,” shares Puneeth Rajkumar, about his views on the debate on the two mediums. Last year, everyone wanted to be on the OTT boom bandwagon and Rajkumar, too, is excited about the prospects of the digital platforms. “Last year during the lockdown, it made a lot of sense to be on OTT. It is a technology that has worked well. There have been some really interesting web shows in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil last year and soon we will have Kannada web shows as well Now, we have projects made for OTT, including original films. We have to go with the flow and see how the market responds,” says the actor, who is looking forward to the release of Yuvarathnaa soon.Looking back on 2020, he says we all simply took care of ourselves and survived. “The film industry was badly affected like so many other industries. Our production company released two movies on digital platforms- production Law and French Biryani. We got back to work in September. Now that theatres are open, it will help the industry get back on its feet. I completed my film Yuvarathnaa and then started shooting for James,” shares Rajkumar. Apparently, there were reports that he would be reprising the role played by Vijay Setupathi in O My Kadvule but he negates the reports. “That’s not true. It would be a guest appearance. I will probably be in the film for 10-15 minutes,” he says.Celebrities kept in touch with the world and their fans through social media mostly last year and Rajkumar, too, enjoys interacting with fans. “I try to put up posts that bring positivity in life, rather than concentrating on news or other issues. I love travel blogs and I also like motivating people. I work out a lot so I put up some posts on that. Especially after 2020, all of us want to look at things that help us to grow in life, be positive, stay happy and fit in life which is more important than focusing on world news. Humans adapat to how life goes on. No one thought that we could stay at home for months. For a highly populated country like ours, we survived Corona and went on to do well, in terms of numbers.

01-03-2021||Other||Monday musings: Tragic case of a woman, a minister and the Pune Police||Maharashtra’s politics surrounding the death by suicide of 23-year-old woman and her association with minister Sanjay Rathod, finally culminated with his resignation on Sunday, a day before Maharashtra’s budget session is to begin. Rathod’s resignation may allow police to probe the matter fairly, but will it offer answers to multiple questions? From the day young woman, who hailed from Beed district, died at her rented flat in Wanowrie in Pune, audio clips played a crucial role in letting the media and opposition keep the pressure on the government and, more particularly, on the Shiv Sena, given Rathod belongs to the party. The audio clips have multiple conversations between two individuals who the BJP alleges are Sanjay Rathod and Arun Rathod; also Sanjay Rathod and the deceased woman… and so on. In one of the conversations, a man with a voice resembling that of the former minister is instructing another person to get hold of the woman’s mobile phone immediately after her death, something which points to an attempt to destroy the evidence, as alleged by the BJP. Who leaked those clips to the BJP leaders? The clips were originally in the possession of the Wanowrie police who are investigating the case. The home department in Maharashtra is currently led by the Nationalist Congress Party’s Anil Deshmukh, who was conspicuous by his silence, barring a brief statement, when he said a probe will be carried out in the matter. Deshmkuh’s party president Sharad Pawar, too, has maintained a studied silence on the issue, even after 20 days. When HT checked with police on Sunday, the investigating officer claimed that the clips are yet to be sent to the forensic lab to ascertain the identity of the voices. On the day the woman died by suicide on February 8, there were over 40 calls between Sanjay Rathod and her, claimed BJP leader Chitra Wagh, whose rise in the party is seen as astonishing as her switching loyalties four years back from the Nationalist Congress Party to BJP. The police have maintained all along that they are probing all the aspects of the case. BJP leaders accessing call details between the woman and the former minister is as surprising as the silence by the NCP and Congress, who share power in the state with Shiv Sena. Another allegation, is that after the death of woman, calls were made to 100 (control number), when the police personnel in control room advised the caller to dial another mobile number. After dialling the mobile number shared by the control room, the individual on the receiving end included one more person through a conference call. All this, as the BJP leader alleged, is as intriguing as the circumstances in which the young woman died by suicide. So far, police have not filed a First Information Report (FIR), without which no action can be taken against. The BJP, therefore, has stepped up the pressure to register an FIR. While police had initially maintained there is no complaint by the family, police can, suo moto take cognisance of the matter and file a complaint. On Sunday, when a woman claiming to be relative of deceased reached the Wanowrie police station with complaint application, the officials claimed the deceased’s father has distanced the family from the woman. So far, police have recorded the statement of Arun Rathod, who was present during the incident and shared a flat with her. But, his whereabouts are unknown. Sanjay Rathod, the Sena MLA from Yavatmal district, has neither denied his association with Arun, nor has he commented on it. The Sena politician has only vehemently denied his role in the death of woman. His resignation as a minister is the first major trouble the Maha Vikas Aghadi has faced just after it completed one year in power in Maharashtra. The move has emboldened the BJP, as it vows to be more aggressive in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-tragic-case-of-a-woman-a-minister-and-the-pune-police-101614582440559.html

01-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab budget session begins on note of protest||The eight-day budget session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha began on a note of protest on Monday morning with copies of governor VP Singh Badnore’s address being torn by opposition Shiromani Akali Dal members. During the first assembly session of an election year, the SAD upped its ante against the ruling Congress and took on the Capt Amarinder Singh government for its alleged “failure to fulfil promises made in the run-up to the 2017 polls”. While the SAD planned to gherao the assembly, members of the main opposition party, the Aam Aadmi Party, arrived for the session on bicycles to protest the rising prices of fuel. The budget estimates for the 2021-22 financial year will be presented on March 5. The opposition parties have demanded an extension of the session that will conclude on March 10 as “the problems faced by the state and its people can’t be discussed in detail in eight sittings”. The AAP plans to corner the government on the issues of minimum support price (MSP) for crops, alleged post-matric scholarship scam, farm loan waiver and rising power prices. “It has been 4 years and none of the promises made during the last polls have been fulfilled. The government has failed on all counts and the CM must explain it,” said leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema. On its part, the Congress is also planning to gherao Raj Bhawan against the fuel price rise, holding the BJP-led government at the Centre responsible for it. Keeping the 2022 assembly polls in mind, both the key opposition parties do not want to miss the opportunity to highlight the Congress government’s “failures on various fronts” during the four-year rule as it is its last budget. On the other hand, the cash-strapped government is expected to make a last-ditch effort to woo the electorate through populist measures. Also, the session, which is being held under the shadows of the ongoing farmers’ protest at the Delhi borders, coincides with completion of four years of the Congress in power. Since the protests have a tacit support of the Amarinder Singh-led government, the AAP and SAD plan to regain their lost ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-budget-session-begins-on-note-of-protest-101614581121280.html

The resignation comes amid mounting pressure from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had warned to stall the budget session of the state legislature, beginning on Monday, over the issue.“I have submitted my resignation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” Rathod told reporters outside Varsha, the CM’s official residence.Thackeray said he has accepted the resignation and would hold additional charge of the forest department. The CM also took on the BJP over playing “dirty politics” on the issue. He said the government has ordered an impartial probe in the case and guilty will not be spared.“...The opposition defamed me and my community through media and social media. It was done to destroy my political career. I want an impartial probe to be conducted in this matter and the truth should come out from it. So, I have tendered my resignation to CM,” Rathod said.During a press conference on the eve of the budget session, the CM said, “There should be a probe, but it should be impartial. If someone is found guilty, then the government’s firm stance is to act as per the law, no matter who the person is...”Calling it a small “beginning” in the suicide case, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said, “Ideally, Thackeray should have taken the resignation much earlier but we are happy that he has done so now, due to pressure from the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-minister-resigns-wants-impartial-probe-101614561763681.html
01-03-2021||Mumbai||Cops continue hunt for suspects as CCTV footage provides little clues||The Mumbai police investigating the recovery of 20 gelatin sticks from a Scorpio car near Antilia, the residence of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, said on Sunday that it was proving difficult to identify the driver of the Innova car that was following the Scorpio near the industry leader’s house because the driver wore a faceshield.In CCTV footage recovered from various places in the city, including the Mulund toll barrier where the Innova was seen heading towards Thane at 3.05am on February 25, the face of the driver is unrecognizable because of reflection caused by headlights of oncoming cars and streetlights on the faceshield, a police officer said.But there is other technical evidence being investigated by police and the National Investigating Agency (NIA). The first priority is to trace the drivers of both the Innova and Scorpio cars, said the officer.On the afternoon of February 25, the Scorpio was found abandoned on Carmichael Road, around 600 metres away from the Ambani residence. Twenty loose gelatin sticks were found in the car, although there was no timer or detonation device. Police subsequently released details of a letter found in the car, addressed to the Reliance chairman and his wife, claiming this was just “a trailer”. The SUV sported fake plates with the registration number of the lead car in the security convoy deployed for the industrialist’s wife Nita Ambani.The investigation revealed the Innova joined the Scorpio around 1.40am at Priyadarshani Park and then they together moved towards Antilia. The Scorpio was abandoned near Ambani’s residence at 2.18am while the Innova stopped for hardly a few seconds and moved towards Altamount road. It is assumed that the Scorpio’s driver later sat in the Innova somewhere nearby and escaped, police said.The Scorpio was stolen on the night of February 17 from Vikhroli. The owner of the SUV is a Thane resident and said his vehicle was parked at a deserted location in Vikroli area as its steering wheel had jammed. The next day he was informed that his car had been stolen. He then registered an FIR at the Vikhroli police station on February 18.The Innova’s number plate was also fake and police are trying to trace its owner and driver. Several police teams are working on the case. The Innova entered the city on February 25, through the Mulund toll plaza and was captured in the CCTV camera at 1.20am. After almost an hour and 45 minutes, it was seen heading back towards Thane from Mumbai and was captured in the CCTV camera at Mulund toll plaza at 3.05am.A purported organisation called Jaish-al-Hind, which is unheard of, allegedly claimed responsibility for planting the explosive-laden Scorpio but a senior police officer part of the investigating team said, “There is no such outfit by the name which has been mentioned in the letter. It seems like a prank and an attempt to extort money from the Ambanis”.The letter has not been received either by Mumbai police or by the Ambanis. Someone created a group by the name Jaish-al-Hind on a social messaging platform and was trying to take advantage, added another police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cops-continue-hunt-for-suspects-as-cctv-footage-provides-little-clues-101614561497104.html

01-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A semal in ITO||They fall down with a thudding sound one after another, the red semal flowers. Their blooming marks the arrival of Delhi’s most pleasant, though most brief season—when it’s neither cold nor hot, and that dengue fever is still some months away.The semal trees, unidentifiable the rest of the year, are suddenly as noticeable these days as those famous Buckingham Palace foot guards in red tunics. As if in flames, they tend to capture our attention in the most unexpected places—through a metro train window, or behind a shanty, or in one case, towering above a flyover.Semal is one of the 252 species of trees found in Delhi. Its branches grow in tiers. They radiate from the trunk like the ribs of an umbrella—as described in the website of Delhi government’s forest department. The best place to see them in great numbers is in the diplomatic avenue of central Delhi’s Neeti Marg, which is almost totally wooded with semal. Two huge trees on the front lawns of Teen Murti Bhawan are also worth a view. Another grand semal stands tall in Jor Bagh market. In a lane in Panchsheel Park, one such tree stands far above the surrounding trees and bungalows, and these days is looking as if someone had thrown holi’s red gulal powder up in the air.A particularly poignant semal you might wish to pay a visit to lurks over the ITO flyover in central Delhi. There, the first thing that amazes the viewer is the setting. The semal flowers are placed high on the tree’s branches. The tree itself is unusually tall, its trunk looming far above the elevated flyover. From a certain perspective, the flowers look as if they had freed themselves from the pulls of gravity and were bent upon escalating to the skies. In the evening, the absence of sun gives them a darker version of red, like clotted blood.But one branch dips and its semal flowers seem to long for the earth—indeed they are drooping down towards the busy rush hour, along with its dust and smog and noise.Suddenly, a bird lands on the topmost tip of the semal. It puckers around its neck, looking at the flowers. Some moments later, it flies away.And now a semal flower from the higher branches falls down on the road, surrendering to gravity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-semal-in-ito-101614549416300.html

Further, arrangements are in place to incorporate the third prioritised group in the upcoming days.Gauba is said to have told officials of all states and union territories to expedite vaccination of priority groups and closely monitor the trajectory of Covid infections to prevent a surge in cases.Official says 40% surge in weekly cases, data indicates otherwiseSubrahmanyan informed the meeting that Jammu and Kashmir is conducting mandatory tests on all incoming travellers via roadways, railways, and airways.He informed that J&K saw a 40% surge in weekly cases with travellers making for 2/3rd of all the positive cases.“In Srinagar district alone, 50% of the recorded positive cases were travellers,” he said.The government spokesman did not state which week the chief secretary was referring to and to which it was comparing. However when HT compiled the daily Covid-19 data provided by the government for the month of February, it found that the surge was not 40% but only around 21%. The data reveals that the UT recorded 403 cases in the first week of February, 432 cases in the second week, 526 cases in third week and 574 cases in the last week. In terms of percentage, the surge was 7% from the first week to second, 21% from the second week to third and nine percent from third to fourth week.

Senior Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Anand Sharma on Saturday had stated that Congress party was “getting weaker”. Farooq was responding to media queries here. “The point is what Rahul Gandhi is saying and what these G 23 leaders are saying…Why should I react to them. I mean what have I got to do with them. I am not saying any of these things which they are saying. It is for them to decide and set their house in order,” said Farooq. He, however, quickly added that he wanted Congress to be strong. “I want the Congress to be strong. I want Congress to unite and fight the divisive forces of the country. Congress must unite and become strong. People look up to the Congress to sort things out in the country. They are part of this nation and a party of 150 years,” added Farooq. On Saturday Rahul Gandhi alleged that democracy in India was “dead”. He was speaking at VOC College in Thoothukudi of Tamil Nadu ahead of the assembly elections, On killing of Krishna Dhaba owner’s son in Srinagar in a terror attack, Farooq said, “He was cremated today.

01-03-2021||Other||Azad heaps praise on PM for remaining connected to his roots||Former Rajya Sabha member and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not forgetting his roots despite becoming the PM of the country. He asked the audience to learn from the PM on how to remain grounded to his roots. Azad’s comments come day after G23 leaders held a well-attended public rally from the podium of Gandhi Global Family here on Saturday. On February 9, the PM had given an emotional farewell speech to Azad when the latter had retired from the Rajya Sabha. “I (will) not let you retire, I will continue taking your advice. My doors are always open for you,” Modi had said. Addressing a function of the Gujjar community at Gurjar Desh Charitable Trust here, Azad said, “I have seen that when some among the Gujjar community become MLAs, they feel that they shouldn’t be called Gujjars and some feel shy that they come from villages.”“I like many things of many big leaders… like I am from village and I feel proud of it. Our PM also says that he is from village and was nothing (non-entity) and that he washed utensils and sold tea. Politically, we may have serious differences and are opposed to him but he didn’t hide his true self. And, those who hide their true self, they live in a bubble… in an imaginary world. People should be proud of their roots,” he added. Azad further said, “I have travelled across the world, stayed in five star and seven star hotels but when I sit with my people in village, I get a real sense of satisfaction...their clothes may not be clean but the soil of village has a different fragrance. You don’t need cosmetic scents because we are born and have grown up there”. Azad regretted that in today’s world people are respected because of their position and status in the society. “So my advice to the new generation of Gujjar community is to remain grounded and take pride in their roots,” he added. Later, responding to media queries, Azad said that he had come to Jammu after one and a half years and Saturday’s Global Gandhi Family function was no show of strength. ‘No show of strength, it was just 10%, 90% still remains’ “There was no show of strength yesterday. I came here after one and a half year to attend long pending engagements here. Firstly, Covid consumed entire year and before it was budget session and winter session. Yesterday’s function was just 10 percent and 90 percent still remains,” he said. ‘We have got invite from 5 states, will campaign for Congress’ Reacting to Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Azad said, “How does he know that we aren’t going in the election bound states. For his information, we have got invite from all the five states and we will certainly go there for campaigning for the Congress.” Singhvi on Saturday had said that leaders in the “Group of 23” are respectable partymen in whom it took pride, but advised them to make their “best contribution” and display their “loyalty” to the party by campaigning to strengthen it in the states that are going to polls. West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam and Puducherry are going to elections in a phased manner from March 27. On revocation of Article 370 and making J&K a UT, Azad said it was like demoting DGP to the rank of constable. ‘Development visible on papers, nothing on the ground’ He also recalled that how under his chief ministership in the Congress-PDP government; he introduced the culture of working in double and triple shifts to expedite development in the three regions of the erstwhile state. “Unfortunately, the work is not done in even half shift now. I appeal the government here and will appeal Centre also that work on ground should be done. Roads are dilapidated, development is not visible on the ground, education and industries are in shambles, unemployment is peaking and taxes after taxes are being levied here. The taxes should be in consonance with income. While income of J&K is zero, taxes are 110%,” he said. “First of all economy has to be put back on rails and development activities have to be expedited. Ironically, development is visible on paper but there is nothing on the ground,” he added. J&K has to be given three to four times more funds by Delhi, like what used to happen during our time, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/azad-heaps-praise-on-pm-for-remaining-connected-to-his-roots-101614545359910.html
01-03-2021||Other||Had thought of quitting saffron party after being asked to step down for exposing corruption: Shanta||Former Himachal chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party’s veteran leader Shanta Kumar revealed in his recently released autobiography that he had thought of quitting the saffron party after he was asked to step down as Union minister in the Vajpayee government for exposing corruption in a government scheme. While the common belief was that Shanta Kumar had been removed as Union minister of rural development in 2003 for speaking up against the 2002 Godhra riots and the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, the former’s memoir titled “Nij Path Ka Avichal Panthi” paints a different picture.The 85-year-old veteran leader revealed that he had exposed a ₹300-crore scam in the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna of rural development department, which allegedly took place during the tenure of the sitting vice-president of India, Venkaiah Naidu. Naidu had given up the ministerial berth in Vajpayee government to become BJP’s national chief in 2002. Shanta Kumar revealed that while Naidu was angry, no one including the ex-PM Vajpayee, the then deputy PM LK Advani, then parliamentary affairs minister Pramod Mahajan or even the RSS supported him. Kumar recalled that senior central leaders and a few from Himachal had grouped up against him and he was eventually asked to step down. “However, I did not compromise on my principles,” he wrote. “I lost trust in them and the party. It was at that moment that the idea of quitting the party and exposing the scam in the House of Lok Sabha struck my mind. However, my wife stopped me,” added Kumar. ‘Ashamed to see party indulging in horse trading’The former two-term chief minister of Himachal Pradesh also wrote that he was ashamed to see his party, BJP, deviating from its principles and indulging in horse trading to topple governments. His remarks come close on the heels of the Congress government in Puducherry losing the trust vote after its MLAs quit the party to join BJP. By practicing unethical politics, governments can be changed but not the society, he wrote. “We came to politics to change the society and not the government,” he said quoting former PM Vajpayee. “I feel ashamed that my party indulged in the sale and purchase of MLAs. BJP became the world’s largest party due to its values and idealism, but it has now become power-hungry,” he wrote. Kumar also cautioned the BJP against compromising with its principles and said it should follow the path of Swami Vivekananda, whom the party reveres. He also hailed the Narendra Modi government for abrogating Article 370 and sought laws to curb the use of black money in elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/had-thought-of-quitting-party-after-being-asked-to-step-down-for-exposing-corruption-shanta-101614544338706.html

The minister’s son Raghumit Singh Sodhi is a director of M/s Savera Beverages.Interestingly, Congress legislator from Fazilka Davinder Singh Ghubaya has extended support to the agitation and demanded the state government to redress concerns of villagers.“I stand with the residents of my constituency. Their apprehensions are very serious in nature as the liquor factory may adversely affect the economic lifeline of the region. I have spoken to the chief minister in this regard and hope that a decision in support of farmers will be taken soon,” said Ghubaya on Sunday.Sodhis and Fazilka deputy commissioner Arvind Pal Singh did not respond to the calls.Official sources said the firm has all the necessary approvals to set up the distillery.“In all likelihood, residents of Hiran Wali and adjoining areas were not taken into confidence by the brewery management. The protest by farmers against the project also has a political angle and the entire matter is in the knowledge of the CM and the chief secretary,” said a source.According to the sarpanch of Hiran Wali Anil Kumar, Sodhis bought nearly 28 acres in 2013 and the panchayats had been opposing it since then.“In Fazilka, the topography is unusual where the groundwater table is less than 10-feet and any mishandling of wastewater by the brewery would severely affect the agriculture sector in the area. A panel of villagers visited three places in Bathinda and Patiala districts where liquor factories were started a few years ago. Residents of those villages told us how the ash and foul smell emanating from the liquor units has hit their daily lives,” said Kumar.Another activist from Ashwani Kumar of Begawali village said the Punjab government has adopted an indifferent attitude towards farmers. “Fazilka district administration is under political pressure and our representations have not been taken seriously. We demand the approval to establish a liquor factory should be withdrawn immediately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fazilka-villagers-oppose-setting-up-of-distillery-continue-to-block-nh7-101614543378688.html

01-03-2021||Delhi||Local issues top priority for voters in civic bypolls||New Delhi: An estimated 50.86% electorate voted on Sunday in the bypolls to five municipal wards that were touted as a precursor to the civic polls scheduled next year.Of the five wards, Kalyanpuri (under East Delhi Municipal Corporation) recorded the highest voter turnout at 59.72% and Shalimar Bagh (under North corporation) the lowest at 42.36%. Though the outcome of the bypolls will not alter the composition of the two municipal corporations, those who came out to vote said that they have voted for change and development of their ward. The Bharatiya Janata Party rules the three municipal corporation with a comfortable majority.The by-elections were also held in Chauhan Banger (041E) and Trilokpuri (02E) and Rohini-C wards.State election commissioner SK Srivastava said, “The voter turnout in the bypolls was good. The turnout in East corporation wards was more than the wards (Shalimar Bagh and Rohini-C) in North corporation. The three East corporation wards saw 56.92% voting whereas just 44.95% polling was reported from the North corporation wards.”This was the first election in the Capital to be held during the pandemic so the state election commission has made elaborate arrangements with dedicated waiting rooms, staff with PPE kits etc to allow Covid-19 positive patients to exercise their franchise.Thermal screening of voters, hand sanitisation was a common practice witnessed across all polling booths. Arrangements of masks were also made for those who reached polling centres without masks. At some polling stations authorities were also seen distributing polythene gloves to voters to cast their vote.“The last one hour (4.30 pm to 5.30 pm) was kept for Covid patients, but no one came to cast their vote,” said Srivastava. The result will be declared on March 3.For the residents of Kalyanpuri, a densely populated area with a large number of slum clusters and unauthroised colonies, garbage disposal, lack of streetlights, etc were among the key concerns that led them to the polling booths.“Garbage disposal and lack of street lights is a main problem in the area. So, instead of blindly following any particular party, this time I have voted for development,” Satish Kumar, a resident of Kalyanpuri said after exercising his franchise.The BJP is facing a litmus test Shalimar Bagh, which is considered the party’s stronghold. Of the five wards, this is the only ward which BJP won in 2017. “These bypolls will show strengths and weaknesses of main three political parties before the 2021 local body elections. There had been no development on local level. There are hundreds of dark spots in the ward as street lights at those places are yet to be fixed. Many times we have reported to local leaders but to no avail,” Karan Singh, a voter and a resident of Shalimar Bagh pocket-D, said after casting his vote.Bypoll was necessitated in Shalimar Bagh after the death of sitting BJP councillor Renu Jaju. The contest here is between Jaju’s daughter-in-law, Surabhi Jaju, AAP’s Sunita Mishra, AAP’s poorvanchali face in the region, and Congress party worker Mamta.As people voted local issues such as sanitation, which they say has worsened in the past few months due to frequent strikes by staff over non-payment of salaries, and area development, the three main political parties say that it will help them gauge the public mood ahead of civic polls next year.Political parties admit that the outcome of the bypolls will set the tone for municipal elections scheduled early next year. The ongoing tussle between AAP, the ruling party in Delhi, and BJP, which has been ruling the three municipal corporations for the past 14 years, over the municipal funding and financial mismanagement is going to be the key issue in the bypolls.In 2017, the BJP has won 181 seats, while AAP and Congress won 48 and 30 seats respectively. The three main political parties said the have already started preparations for the polls.Of the five wards, the AAP won Kalyanpuri, Chauhan Banger and Trilokpuri in 2017. Rohini-C ward is also AAP’s stronghold as the former councillor joined the party just before the assembly elections last year and is now a party MLA from Bawana.Sanitation topped the priority list for people in Trilokpuri ward. Dinesh Valmiki, a local resident, said the civic body has “failed” on the front of local development. “Salaries of municipal employees are not being paid so they go on strike and ultimately the public has to suffer. Sanitation and lack of proper drainage system are major issues being faced by the residents here,” Valmiki said while waiting in a queue to cast his vote.Voting in Trilokpuri ward also saw minor scuffle between volunteers of the AAP and the BJP over the issue of setting up tables near one of the polling centres. The matter was resolved soon.In Rohini-C, Kalyanpuri and Trilokpuri wards, women voters came out in good numbers to exercise their franchise.In Chauhan Banger ward, located close to Jafrabad Metro station, broken roads, lack of drainage, encroachment on pavements and roads were issues on which people voted.The BJP fielded senior party worker Mohammad Nazir Ansari from the ward while the AAP candidate was former Seelampur MLA Mohammad Ishraq Khan. The Congress fielded its youth wing leader Zubair Ahmad, son of former Seelampur MLA Mateen Ahmad.“There are a number of issues here as the area is among one of the most backward wards. Lack of proper drainage system, dug up lanes, encroachment and lack of sanitation services are among main issues here. In this bypoll, we have voted keeping in view the local area development,” said Asma Khatoon, who had come to vote with her husband.In Rohini-C ward BJP’s Rakesh Goel is pitted against AAP’s former Bawana MLA Ram Chander. The Congress candidate from the ward is ex-councillor Memwati Barwala.Rohini-C ward, which falls under Bawana constituency, saw a good number of women voters. “Local area development is our priority. Lack of street lights is a major problem in the region. It poses a security threat especially for women in the area. Dirty water supply is another issue here,” Sarita Goyal, a voter and resident of Prahlad Vihar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/local-issues-top-priority-for-voters-in-civic-bypolls-101614542017060.html

To fasten the nationwide mass vaccination programme amid the rising Covid-19 cases across the country, the Centre has instructed all the states to start the inoculation process for senior citizens and those above 45 with comorbidities from Monday. Eight centres have been selected for Day 1, of which four are Covid-19 jumbo centres, one is a Covid-19 hospital, while three are private hospitals empanelled under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). Until further directions from the Union health ministry, only Covishield vaccines will be administered in the third phase. Private hospitals said that as the directions came on Sunday, they were short on time to make the necessary preparations. They would receive the vials only on Monday morning. “Earlier we were told that the civic body would visit for inspection. But on Sunday morning, we got to know that we have already been selected. So, at the eleventh hour, we had to make all the preparations,” said a senior doctor from KJ Somaiya Hospital, which is one of the selected vaccine centres. The hospital has ordered additional freezers to store the vials. But BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said, “We have enough number of vials to start the third phase for citizens. We are expecting to get more vials from the government soon.” On Sunday, the civic body selected the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Mulund, Goregaon and Dahisar Covid-19 jumbo centres as well as the SevenHills Hospital in Marol. These five centres will provide vaccines free of cost. As per BMC, the central government had sent them a list of 53 private hospitals who are empanelled under MJPJAY and the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). Apart from KJ Somaiya Hospital (Sion), BMC has selected HJ Doshi Hindu Sabha Hospital (Ghatkopar) and SRCC Children’s Hospital (Mahalaxmi) to start the third phase. Each inoculation will cost ₹250 at these hospitals. All the three private hospitals already have an immunisation department. “We have the infrastructure in place. As we have been inoculating children for years, vaccinating adults won’t be a problem for us,” said Dr Varsha Dilip Phadke, dean, KJ Somaiya Hospital. From Tuesday, BMC will start the third phase in 19 more civic centres. However, before giving a go ahead to additional empanelled private hospitals, BMC said their officials would conduct inspections. “We need to check if the enlisted hospitals have the adequate infrastructure. They also need to train the staff for vaccination. We also have to check if they have intensive care units (ICU), in case a beneficiary develops an adverse effect after vaccination,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Meanwhile, major private, charitable hospitals such as Bombay Hospital, Jaslok, Lilavati and Nanavati, are upset that their names did not show up in the list submitted by the Centre. They have requested BMC to ensure their participation in the next phase. “We have played a major role in providing treatment to Covid-19 patients in the past 11 months. We have the infrastructure and the staff strength to inoculate the public. But instead of us, smaller hospitals and nursing homes which don’t even have ICUs have been selected,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital, who is in-charge of Covid-19 beds at city’s private hospitals. The list available with HT shows that many of the enlisted centres are just dialysis centres. Most dialysis centres do not have ICUs, but the availability of ICUs is a criteria required to get permissions. “Without permission from the central government, we can’t add empanelled private hospitals. We are hopeful of receiving more approvals and add private hospitals who are already inoculating healthcare workers in Phase 1,” said Kakani, adding, “We’ll also soon add other civic centres who are already conducting phases 1 and 2 of the vaccination drive.” To get the shots at private hospitals, citizens have to register on the Co-WIN app, which will be open from 9am on Monday. To get free vaccines at public vaccination centres, citizens can directly visit them between 12pm and 5pm. Citizens with comorbidities have to get a health certificate from a physician. A form has already been released by the Centre as a declaration of health certificate which has 20 comorbidities (diabetes, heart failure with hospital admission in the past one year, post-cardiac transplant, moderate or severe valvular heart disease, end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis, severe respiratory disease with hospitalisation in the past two years, primary immunodeficiency diseases/HIV infection, angina and hypertension/diabetes on treatment) in the list of priority patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/phase3-of-covid-19-vax-mumbai-civic-body-selects-8-centres-for-day-1-101614541943478.html

01-03-2021||Delhi||Feel unsafe in our own neighbourhood, say locals after Adarsh Nagar murder||Anvit Srivastavaanvit.srivastava@htlive.comNew DelhiThe Saturday night murder of a 25-year-old woman while trying to fight back against a snatcher on the busy Rajan Babu Road in Adarsh Nagar has left the residents of the neighbourhood “shocked and in fear” as they said that such incidents have become common. Locals alleged that the spot is barely 50 metres away from a police post, which often remains unmanned, because of which the snatcher managed to escape on Saturday.Rajini Babbar, a resident of lane number 10, said that every 5-10 days they hear of a similar crime in the area. “The fact that Simran was targeted right in front of her house is scary. It reflects that criminals have no fear of entering residential areas to commit a crime,” she said.General secretary of Adarsh Nagar Green residents welfare association, SN Singhal, also said that police presence in the area is insufficient, which encouraged criminal activities.“Almost every evening, anti-social elements gather in parks in the area and create nuisance, making it difficult for locals, specially women and girls, to even walk through the areas. When we call the police, they send a policeman who takes a round of the area and goes back. The SHO has been made aware of these problems repeatedly, but nothing was done. We are waiting for more similar incidents to happen. Today, I’ve written a letter to the area DCP, senior officers and other concerned people, requesting strict action in this regard,” Singhal said.Another woman, who lives in the same area but wished not to be named, said that the lane in which their houses are located, has gates but they are closed only late night around 11-11.30pm. “The road outside is a busy one, with shops on both sides. Who would think that an outsider can attack you in your own residential neighbourhood in front of so many people? This is very shocking,” she said.Simran’s cousin, Taranjit Singh, who also lives in the same neighbourhood, said the locality has often reported snatching and robbery incidents. “Police presence during the night is sparse, which encourages street crimes,” he said.The municipal councillor from Adarsh Nagar ward, Garima Gupta said that she has told the station house officer of Adarsh Nagar police station repeatedly to step up patrolling in the area during night time at least. “There is also a police post less than 50 metres from the spot of crime, which should always remain manned. So far there has been no serious action on such requests,” said Gupta, who had visited the spot.Deepak Tiwari, the security guard who witnessed the attack on Simran, also recalls how he had a face-off with two thieves around 8-9 months ago. “I had caught them trying to enter a house in the same area. I attempted to catch the duo, but they threw stones at me. I chased them, but they managed to escape,” he said.When asked about the allegations by local residents regarding the law and order, joint commissioner of police (northern range) SS Yadav refused to comment.Deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani also did not respond to multiple calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/feel-unsafe-in-our-own-neighbourhood-say-locals-after-adarsh-nagar-murder-101614541144137.html
01-03-2021||Other||Maharashtra cabinet nod for revised cost of ₹400cr for Thackeray memorial||The Maharashtra cabinet on Sunday approved the revised estimate for the construction of proposed memorial of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. The memorial, which will now cost ₹400 crore, will come up at the old bungalow of Mumbai mayor near Shivaji Park.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the executing authority for the project, had called for bids for the memorial at an estimation of ₹87 crore. However, the process was cancelled, as the quotation of the bids was very high.Later, the entire project was re-examined and there was an escalation in the cost, which went up to ₹400 crore.While MMRDA is in charge of the construction of the memorial, the Balasaheb Thackeray Rashtriya Smarak – a public charitable trust headed by Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray – is the authority that decides on the designs of the memorial. The project is now divided into two phases: the cost of phase 1 is ₹250 crore, while the second phase will cost ₹150 crore.In the first phase, the architecture, aesthetics and construction of the building for the memorial will take place. Phase one will also include the construction of a parking lot for visitors and focus on the mechanism of rain water harvesting at the memorial.The second phase will consist of the technological part of the memorial. This will include preparation of digital mapping, films, audio visuals, etc, for the memorial to start its operations.The erstwhile mayor’s bungalow on the proposed memorial plot is a Grade II-B heritage structure, and will remain untouched during the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-cabinet-nod-for-revised-cost-of-400cr-for-thackeray-memorial-101614541338451.html
01-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 25-year-old murdered during snatching bid in Adarsh Nagar||A 25-year-old woman was stabbed to death when she fought back against a snatcher in north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar on Saturday night.A CCTV footage of the incident, which was widely shared on social media on Sunday, shows the attacker first lunging at the chain of the woman, identified as Simran Kaur, as she is returning home from a nearby market with her mother and two-year-old daughter. Simran, however, immediately fights back, catching the snatcher off-guard and forcing him to retreat. As the snatcher flees, he fishes out a knife and stabs Simran multiple times, before escaping with an accomplice waiting on a scooter nearby. A security guard, on duty in the area, is also seen in the footage chasing the man on foot. Simran later collapsed just a few feet away from her house due to blood loss in front of her two-year-old.Police said they have arrested two men from Jahangirpuri for the murder.In Delhi, snatching cases had gone up by 27.11% in 2020 when compared to the previous year, data released by Delhi Police, during their annual press conference earlier this month showed. A snatching occurs in Delhi every 1 hour 6 minutes, the police data showed.According to investigators, Saturday’s incident took place between 9pm and 9.15pm when Simran — who lives with her husband in Patiala and had been in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar visiting her parents — was returning from a local flea market. Eyewitnesses and local residents said when Simran and her mother Mamta Kaur entered lane number seven from Rajan Babu Road, to reach their home, the snatcher approached them from behind.A police officer, who wished not to be named, said it has been established during initial probe that the man extended his arm to grab Simran’s chain or valuables, immediately alerting her and making her turn around. “Her two-year-old daughter, whom she was carrying in her arms, fell on the road as Simran lost balance while trying to fight back. The snatcher also fell while trying to flee. Seeing himself trapped, the man got up and stabbed Simran twice in her chest with a knife and managed to run away,” the officer said.The CCTV then shows Simran picking up her daughter again. However, she collapsed just a few seconds later, right in front of her parents house.The security guard, Deepak Tiwari, who was on duty at the time of the incident, said he was on the other end of the lane where Simran’s parent’s house is located. “It was roughly around 9.10pm when I heard her cry for help. I saw a man was attacking her and I chased after him. However, he jumped on a scooter, on which his accomplice was waiting, and they sped away. I could not see his face or note down the scooter’s registration number,” said Tiwari, who has been working in the area as a security guard for the last two-and-a-half years.Simran was rushed to Fortis Hospital in Shalimar Bagh, where she died during treatment. The crime was reported to the police around 9.45pm.On Sunday evening, deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani in a statement said that multiple teams were formed to arrest the accused and following multiple raids, the two men – Fardeen,19, and Aqibul, 22, both residents of Jahangirpuri — were arrested. The weapon used in Simran’s murder and the scooter that the men had used to flee the spot, were recovered following their arrests, the statement said.A Special Investigations Team (SIT) has also been formed to further probe the incident.On one side of the spot where Simran was killed, is her brother’s photo studio and on the other side is here father Daler Singh’s house, both less than 20 metres away from the spot where she collapsed .Local residents said there is also a police booth which is fifty metres away from the spot but mostly remains unmanned.Simran’s cousin, Taranjit Singh, 20, who lives in the same neighbourhood said the incident was unfortunate and tragic.“I got a call late night informing that she had to be rushed to hospital. When I reached hospital, she was in the operation theatre, where she succumbed,” Singh said.When contacted, deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani did not respond to calls and text messages.Delhi police also tweeted on Sunday, “Two arrested for murder of a young woman, committed in desperate attempt of snatching in Adarsh Ngr. Reaffirming our commitment to #ZeroTolerance to crime for safety & security of citizens, @DelhiPolice dedicated to swift & professional investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-25-year-old-murdered-during-snatching-bid-in-adarsh-nagar-101614540598897.html
01-03-2021||Mumbai||Annus horribilis: Maharashtra’s first Covid-19 patient recalls ordeal||On March 9, 2020, when the rest of India was readying for Holi, the festival of colours, a Pune-based middle-aged couple that had returned from Dubai a week ago after celebrating their wedding anniversary, tested positive for Covid-19. They were the first two persons in Maharashtra to be infected by the disease that soon became a global pandemic. They were not alone. Most of the nearly 40 people who had travelled with them in a group tested positive. The taxi driver who ferried them from Mumbai airport to their Pune home tested positive, and the next day, so did their daughter. Almost a year later, Maharashtra has recorded 2,155,070 cases, the highest for any state in India. It’s been an exhausting year for the Awati family, the husband Jivandhar (52) said over telephone from Jaipur where he had travelled for official work. “It is only now that our lives are getting back on track. I have resumed my work and physically and mentally I have completely recovered.” His family members declined to be named or interviewed for this story. After the Awatis tested positive, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) sealed all areas in a 3-km radius, a move that scared many and contributed to the Awatis being blamed on social media for bringing the coronavirus into the city. Their videos and personal information were uploaded on WhatsApp groups and other social media channels. “At this time,” the family said, “doctors and other staff at Naidu hospital were more than helpful to us, as were our relatives.” For both the couple and their daughter, March 2020 began with anxiety and fear, and it is only now – a year later – there is some semblance of relief. “The last 12 months have been the same for us as for everyone,” Awati, an engineer with a private firm, said. “We also faced a strict lockdown, but we were the first family to test positive. Unfortunately, the media and government’s spotlight was on us.” In an earlier interview to this newspaper in October 2020, a family member had said they had stopped watching news on television. “All we want is to look forward to a better life. A simple wedding anniversary trip turned into a nightmare.” Awati, a trained wrestler, said no one in the family faced any post-recovery complications. “We were always physically fit. I was a wrestler in my younger days. This helped a lot.” The Maharashtra health department was flummoxed when the first cases came to light. There was no established treatment protocol, and the only document they had was a list of guidelines from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “It was a new virus, and nobody knew much. As days passed, doctors began offering concrete treatment,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee. According to Dr Sudhir Patsute, medical superintendent, Dr Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital, “These patients (the Awatis) were physically fit and had mild symptoms. We gave them antivirals, antibiotics, paracetamol tablets and cough syrup, which was enough. They were discharged on March 25 after a 14-day isolation. They had tested negative twice. If a patient comes to us with the same condition today, they would probably be suggested home isolation. Since the Awatis were the first case, we took it seriously.” India’s first case of Covid-19 was detected in Kerala on January 30, 2020, but India did not introduce airport restriction or testing protocols until the third week of March. At Mumbai airport alone, 43,000 passengers would pass through every day without being checked. The Awatis landed in Mumbai on March 2 and soon developed mild symptoms like cough and fever. Even before the test results could come out on March 9, the couple was isolated at PMC’s Naidu infection control hospital. In addition to being distraught by the news of their daughter being infected, the couple faced sharp and sometimes rude questions from the media and acquaintances. “Within days, all our personal details including phone numbers and addresses were out through mainstream media and WhatsApp. We got calls from random people asking us details and a local newspaper also put out our address which added to our distress,” said Awati. “My family saw the video and read the comments below it. Many blamed us for the Covid outbreak in the state. In addition to fighting such a deadly virus we had to fight this too,” said Awati. The episode made him afraid of even coming out of the house. “People who knew us supported us. My family and my housing society neighbours helped us. We even got calls from politicians asking for our wellbeing. Now, we want to avoid all questions and just move on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/annus-horribilis-maharashtra-s-first-covid-19-patient-recalls-ordeal-101614540558109.html
01-03-2021||City||'Heritage development through demolition?': Odisha BJP MP's jibe at CM||A day after Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik presented a resolution in the Assembly seeking quicker completion of the Jagannath temple corridor project, BJP MP from Bhubaneswar, Aparajita Sarangi, in an open letter to Patnaik, asked whether heritage development was being done by destroying it.On Saturday, Patnaik had placed a resolution in the Assembly on ₹3,200 crore Jagannath temple corridor project that seeks to transform the area around the 12th-century temple in Puri into a heritage corridor.“The greatest identity of the Odia community is Lord Jagannath. Our history, culture, tradition and belief system are all centred on the Almighty. He is the symbol of Odia esteem and pride. All devotees, who come to the Jagannath temple in Puri to see the Lord, have a desire in their hearts to behold the deities in a calm, beautiful and spiritual environment. It is the responsibility of all of us to come back with a divine feeling,” said Patnaik while tabling the resolution that was unanimously passed by the Assembly.Also read: 'Congress must unite to defeat ‘divisive’ forces' - Farooq AbdullahHowever, Sarangi, who met the servitors of Puri's Jagannath temple as well as Bhubaneswar's Lingaraj temple, on Sunday wrote an open letter asking several questions about the demolition of several heritage structures within the 75-metre radius of the iconic temple."The last few days have allowed me to delve deeper into the proposed Heritage Development Project in Shree Kshetra and Ekamra Kshetra. I have extensively toured the areas proposed for development, especially the surrounding areas of the two temples, and got the opportunity to discuss with servitors, evicted families, commercial shopowners and street vendors. In the name of beautification, some of the most sacred 'mathas' of Puri, namely, Emar Matha, Mangu Matha, Languli Matha, Uttar Parshwa Matha and Dakshin Parshwa Mathas, have been demolished and razed to the ground. I believe that you are aware of the roles of the mathas (mutts) in the development of the Jagannath cult and their role in many of the rituals associated with Lord Jagannath," she wrote."I would like to know which heritage conservationist is advising your government on demolishing monuments which are integral to the growth of Jagannath cult, demolishing mathas established by the holiest of Indian saints, namely, Acharya Ramanuja and Guru Nanak," she stated, demanding reasons behind demolishing mathas which are "integral to the daily rituals of Lord Jagannath".The BJP MP also sought from the state government, the basis on which it was concluded that "replacing these 'invaluable' monuments with manicured lawns, fountains and toilets is going to enhance the spiritual experience of visitors coming to pray to Lord Jagannath.""It is all the more painful to learn that mathas associated with the most revered saints have been razed to the ground. People are left with a sense of disbelief that mathas/heritage monuments which were so closely associated with our religious belief system, integral to the daily and special rituals of Lord Jagannath, have been demolished," she said.Sarangi said though some may argue that the heritage development in Puri and Bhubaneswar is simply following the path of Kashi Bishwanath Heritage Corridor, in reality, the demolition between the temple in Kashi and the Ganga ghat in Varanasi only covered residential buildings and commercial shops and no heritage structures have been destroyed."Which heritage conservationist was monitoring and guiding the reckless demolition using heavy earth moving machinery like JCBs, bulldozers and Jackhammer drills in an extremely sensitive zone and in areas which are sentimentally, emotionally and spiritually two of the most sacred sites for the Hindus? The result is there for everyone to see - razed mathas set up by the most revered saints, demolition of an iconic library like Raghunandan Library, the discovery of broken remnants of several sculptures on account of drilling and excavation below the area surrounding Lingaraj Temple. All this would leave any self-respecting Odia in shock and disbelief. It is possible that present generation of Odias may not be asking questions on such mindless and reckless demolition. However, posterity is going to seek accountability for such a gigantic scale of destruction of Odisha's rich heritage and legacy which probably happened for the first time in independent India," she said.Sarangi said that though she supported the development work around Jagannath temple and Lingaraj temple, it has to be conducted within the framework of the law.She urged the chief minister to set up a committee consisting of senior officials of the ASI, the archaeology department of Odisha, representatives of the INTACH and a few heritage conservationists to assess the scale of destruction and examine whether existing laws have been violated or not."In case existing laws have been violated, accountability must be fixed and strict action must be taken against people responsible for the destruction of centuries-old heritage and legacy. An inquiry must be done to see whether provisions of Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, Places of Worship (Special Provision) Act, Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, Indian Treasure Trove Act, Charter for Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites (Venice Charter-1964), Charter for Protection and Management of the Archaeological Heritage (Lausanne Charter-1990), have been violated while taking up such demolition of centuries-old structures," she wrote in her letter.The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) did not comment on Sarangi's letter to Patnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heritage-development-through-demolition-odisha-bjp-mp-s-jibe-at-cm-101614539467069.html
01-03-2021||Other||Covid-19: Mumbai civic body asks Bhandup, Powai societies to ban gatherings||In a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has written to several housing societies and residential complexes in Vikhroli, Bhandup, and Powai, asking them to not arrange social gatherings in their premises. BMC has also asked the residents at these areas to stop using gardens, gyms and swimming pools in their societies.The corporation has further directed the societies to take all the necessary Covid-19 precautions such as checking temperatures of visitors who are entering the premises.The development comes in the wake of the rising cases, particularly from these areas. According to BMC’s data, S ward, under which Vikhroli, Bhandup and Powai are located, has eight of the 12 active containment zones in the city. Of the 127 buildings that have currently been sealed in Mumbai, S ward houses the highest (18) number of structures.However, the growth rate of Covid-19 cases in S ward is 0.26%, which is 0.2% lower than the city’s average growth rate of 0.28%. The doubling rate of S ward is 267 days, higher than the city’s 249 days.Currently, there are 466 active cases in S ward. The ward has recorded more than 14,000 cases and 721 deaths so far. A BMC official from S ward said, “The directions have been issued considering the rise in the cases. There’s no order for complete lockdown in the ward, but certain restrictions at society level have been issued to break the chain.”Bharatiya Janata Party corporator from Powai, Vaishali Patil, said, “After Diwali, there were fewer cases and the area witnessed hardly one or two cases daily. But for the past few days, there is a surge in the number of cases. We can’t afford another lockdown and hence citizens should themselves take precautions.”For the past few days, BMC has been taking localised decisions and is imposing restrictions in several clusters instead of the entire city.Last week, BMC’s A ward (includes areas such as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Churchgate and Colaba), had directed authorities to shut Oval Maidan from February 26, owing to the rising cases in the city. Around two weeks ago, housing societies in Chembur were put on high alert owing to the spike in Covid-19 infections.Meanwhile, on Sunday, a first information report (FIR) was filed against a 52-year-old Chembur resident on BMC’s complaint. BMC received a complaint from a housing society about the resident, who tested positive for the virus but was flouting the 14-day quarantine rule and roaming in the area. When the civic staff went to his home, the family refused to cooperate with them, officials said. On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 1,051 Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 325,917. Five deaths took the city’s toll to 11,475. As of Sunday, 305,273 patients have recovered from the virus. There are 8,299 active cases in the city. Mumbai’s fatality rate is 3.52%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-mumbai-civic-body-asks-bhandup-powai-societies-to-ban-gatherings-101614539658059.html
01-03-2021||Bhopal||MP govt to seek right to take criminal action against controversial web series||Madhya Pradesh government will send a proposal to the Central government seeking rights to take criminal action against web series for obscene and controversial content under the Information Technology Act, said a state home department official on Sunday.A decision to this effect was taken after BJP MLA from Mandsaur, Yashpal Singh Sisodia, raised the issue in the state legislative assembly during the budget session on Friday. A resolution to this effect was also passed by the state assembly.Sisodia said, “obscene language and scenes are being published without any censorship. Now, parents are worried about youngsters as they are learning abusive language and criminal activities through web series and the contents of social media. We are happy that the Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javdekar issued new guidelines for social media and OTT platforms but we want the state must have control over the content of web series.”Also read: 'Congress must unite to defeat ‘divisive’ forces' - Farooq AbdullahState home minister Narottam Mishra resounded Sisodia's words and said, “The state government will send a proposal to the Centre seeking rights of taking criminal action the director and producers of controversial web series as a section of people are targeting Hindu Gods and Goddess and religion through web series.”A home department officer, requesting anonymity, said, “We are preparing a draft to ask the Centre to empower the state to take action against objectionable content.

01-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra crosses 8,000 new Covid cases for fifth day in row||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded more than 8,000 Covid-19 new cases for the fifth consecutive day, while Mumbai reported more than 1,000 cases again, after a day’s gap. On Sunday, the state recorded 8,293 cases with 62 deaths. The number of cases in Mumbai was 1,051, compared to 987 on Saturday. The city saw five deaths. The state’s active Covid-19 cases stood at 77,008 while Mumbai’s active cases were 8,299. In case of active cases, Pune, which is facing restrictions like night curfew, stood first in the state with the number at 15,005, followed by Nagpur at 10,013. Amravati, which is facing a lockdown, has 6,599 active cases. Other regions like Thane, Buldhana, Wardha, Akola, Aurangabad, Washim, Jalgaon, Ahmedabad, Satara, Raigad and Nashik have more than 1,000 active Covid-19 cases. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray while addressing the media admitted that cases are increasing across the state. “We need to understand that cases are increasing, especially in Vidarbha. In several districts, the number is crossing last year’s peak. For this, citizens need to take precautions. I do not wish to impose another lockdown…,” said Thackeray. The third phase of vaccination, which was to begin from March 1 for citizens above 60 years and for those above 45 with co-morbidities, is awaiting clarity from the Centre. “We were in a meeting with the Central government officials and are preparing the programme for this new phase. The modalities will be finalised by Monday morning,” said a senior state government official, who refused to come on record. Citizens are confused. “I inquired with private hospitals, but even they are not sure about who will be allowed. I will check after the registrations open,” said Srikrishna Joshi, 64, a Parel resident. Thackeray, however, warned that vaccination is not the shield against the Covid-19 virus. “It is not that once you get vaccinated, you cannot contract the virus. You have to take adequate precautions like wearing a mask, washing your hands and maintaining social distance,” said Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-crosses-8-000-new-covid-cases-for-fifth-day-in-row-101614538938590.html

According to the officers, they had received information that Sameer Shaikh, 30, who was wanted in a preparation to dacoity case, was attending a wedding function at KB Hall in Kandivli (West). The officers said that when they entered the marriage hall, they noticed Shaikh dancing. As the officers approached the accused, they were stopped by Shaikh’s mother Ruksana and his sister Rubina. “We were not accompanied by women police constables so we could not respond to the women.

Stating that the body was decomposing, the police said the victim, who appeared to be around 35, seemed to have been murdered two days ago. His face was crushed with stones and a piece of cloth was wrapped around his neck.“Prima facie, it appears that the assailants strangled him to death and later crushed his face to conceal his identity. No identification proof or mobile phone was found near the body,” said sub-inspector Balwinder Singh, station house officer, Sahnewal police station.“The body was discovered by children playing in a ground near the factory after they entered the premises to find their ball.

01-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Admissions delayed, 1st-year law classes to begin in March||Classes for first-year batches of professional courses have begun but the seat allotment process for law aspirants is yet to be finished. With the state common entrance test (CET) cell still in the process of allotting seats, classes for first-year batch in law colleges will commence only in March this year.“Law students are used to delayed admissions and a shorter academic calendar, but this year seems to be the worst. Once again teachers will be expected to complete a full year’s syllabus in four or five months and students will be expected to rote learn,” said the principal of a reputed law college in Mumbai. Admissions to most professional courses were delayed by a few months this year, first due to the lockdown and then due to a petition filed in the Bombay high court for clarity on the status of the Maratha quota. In December, the registration process for most professional courses including law, engineering, architecture and pharmacy had to be delayed by a few weeks to give students time to make necessary changes to their admission form after the state government decided to continue admissions without the inclusion of socially and educationally backward class (SEBC) quota.After much delay, the first list of three-year and five-year law courses were scheduled to be released in the first week of February, but the same had to be postponed again after the state CET cell received complaints of error in student information. CET cell then had to conduct a third party audit to re-check information shared by students at the time of registration, leading to further delay. The first seat allocation list was finally released in the third week of February.“This is not the first time that admissions to law courses have been delayed, or the fact the basic process of registration and seat allocation have been marred with technical glitches. Year after year the state government talks about enhancing and upgrading the education system but basic admission process has not been streamlined,” said Sachin Pawar, president of Student Law Council. He further pointed at how delay in admissions also leads to a condensed academic period for first-year law students, leaving many grappling with too much to cope. “A curriculum meant to be taught over nine-10 months is covered in five months or less, and students are expected to cope up. This is one of the main reasons why more and more first-year students end up failing in one or more subjects in the first two semesters itself,” added Pawar. He added that this year, the delay also forced many law aspirants to opt for admissions in law institutes in neighbouring states, which could lead to higher seat vacancy in state Institutes.As per information shared by the state CET cell, seat vacancy in law colleges for the five-year course stood between 48%-60% over the past five years. The seat vacancy in the past five years was highest in 2016-17 academic year when almost 60% seats had no takers, while seat vacancy stood at 48%, 53% and 51% in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively. Many experts feel mushrooming of law institutes on a yearly basis could be one of the reasons for the high number of seat vacancy year after year.In August 2019, in a meeting of the general council of the Bar Council of India (BCI), it was decided to impose a three-year moratorium or a temporary suspension on grant of approval of affiliation to new legal education institutes, universities or deemed to be universities. It further had decided that only pending proposals, and no fresh applications, will be entertained for a period of three years minimum. “This decision of the bar council was taken mainly to address the issue of the large number of private law institutes mushrooming all over the country. Some states were witnessing high seat vacancy and Maharashtra is facing the same problem,” said a senior official from the University of Mumbai on condition of anonymity.Others pointed out that students too are very clear about their education and future prospects and many choose to drop a year in hopes of bagging a seat in an institute of their choice in the next academic year. “There are several law institutes spread across the state of Maharashtra and with every passing year, students are becoming very selective about their choice. A law institute in rural Maharashtra might be imparting good quality education but someone from tier 1 or tier 2 cities would not opt for the institute simply because of its location. This could be another reason for growing seat vacancy,” said Narayan Rajadhyaksh, former principal of New Law College, Matunga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-admissions-delayed-1st-year-law-classes-to-begin-in-march-101614537677806.html
01-03-2021||Mumbai||Covid impact: A year on, passengers yet to get refund from airlines||In early 2020, Lal Bahadur Singh had booked 11 air tickets – some for Bagdogra and some for Bhopal – for holidays at different times of the year. All his travel plans got cancelled with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March. Since then, Singh is awaiting his ticket refunds of up to ₹1 lakh from various airlines. One year on, passengers like Singh continue to negotiate with airlines on refunds after travellers had to forego their plans as Covid-19 cases spread across the country and flights were stalled. This comes after the Supreme Court (SC) in September 2020 directed airlines to provide immediate refund for tickets that were booked for travel up to May 24, 2020. Airlines were given time till March 31, 2021 to refund tickets affected due to lockdown. Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) also had issued a notification on April 16 last year ordering immediate refund for tickets booked during lockdown (March 25-April 14). As per DGCA’s monthly traffic report, refund-related issues continue to comprise a major chunk of complaints this year too. In January, ticket refunds formed 41.3% of the complaints. In December 2020, it was 61.4%, in November 62.4% and in October 83.9% passengers complained of refund issues to the regulator. “As per DGCA circular and SC order, regardless of cancellation date, if the flight is cancelled due to Covid restrictions, then full refund is payable. Most of my air tickets are from SpiceJet and Air India. While SpiceJet has assured to refund after March 31, I have got no response from the national carrier on the issue,” said Singh, a Mulund resident and a frequent traveller. HT spoke to passengers who were affected similarly, some of whom have more than ₹50,000 with the airlines with no certainty of refund. Goregaon resident Anuradha Joshi booked a SpiceJet flight on February 16 last year for Mumbai-Delhi travel on March 26, but cancelled tickets on March 23. “Despite several requests, Spicejet has not refunded my entire money. I paid ₹11,592 but Spicejet has put only ₹2,016 in the credit shell. Moreover, I have no idea what will happen to my return tickets to Mumbai that were booked in Air India as they have not been replying to my emails and calls,” said Joshi who has written letters to not only the airline but also to the Prime Minister’s Office and DGCA. SpiceJet spokesperson said, “Refunds are governed by the order of the Supreme Court and we are adhering to those directions.” Air India said the revenue system was severely impacted due to complete stoppage of flights during the lockdown period followed by gradual restoration of flights in domestic and international sectors (through Air Transportation Bubble arrangements). “In view of this unprecedented situation, Air India has stopped automatic refunds in Global Sales Distribution. Ticket refunds are being processed through Air India’s own offices within pre-assigned budgeted amounts. The refunds are progressively increasing with the increase in revenue of the company. Air India is planning to open automated refunds on more occasions as the situation improves.” In an attempt to make passengers utilise their tickets, Air India has relaxed a number of ticketing rules and offered passengers options. This includes change in flight, date, name (for domestic only) and route for passengers booked between March 15 and August 24. International passengers booked from March 15 till September 2020 too have been given options to change date/flight/routing/booking code till March 31, 2021 and value of the ticket is protected. Ticket cancellation charges are also waived for all these tickets. However, passengers continue to wait for their refunds. Sushma Patel, a Colaba resident, who was set to travel to Bhutan in May last year, took two trips in December to utilise her money stuck with airlines. “Ï preferred taking credit shell and making use of some money. However, around ₹26,000 are still with SpiceJet. I am clueless of the way ahead, in case the airline does not return my money.” The SC order had stated that the value by credit shell will be enhanced by 0.50% per month (6% per annum) till June 30 2020 and thereafter till March 31, 2021 by 0.75% per month (9% per annum). The Apex court had mentioned that only the airlines in financial distress could issue credit shell vouchers till March 31, 2021. After this, the airlines will have to refund the credit shell amount with such enhanced value. “It should be ensured by the passengers that all their refund after March 31 is made with the enhanced amount,” said advocate Shirish Deshpande, chairperson of consumer body Mumbai Grahak Panchayat that was party to the plea in SC. “Airlines and even agents are taking undue advantage of the ignorance of passengers about the SC verdict. The Apex court had clearly said that only airlines in distress have time till March 31, after that money has to be mandatorily refunded.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-impact-a-year-on-passengers-yet-to-get-refund-from-airlines-101614537437848.html
01-03-2021||Mumbai||What to keep in mind while investing in real estate||“Buy land, they’re not making it anymore,” said author Mark Twain. Most people invest in land or real estate to earn profits in the near or distant future. Like all other investments, investing in a property necessitates careful consideration of many factors or evaluation of the total amount that would be spent. This may impede returns intended from the purchase or sale or unforeseen losses. A property or land is not a liquid asset, which makes it impossible to convert into cash, if and when needed. Here’s what to keep in mind while investing in real estate:Check your credit scoreBanks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) first check the credit history of people applying for property loans. This is a factor that most people continue to be unaware of and ignore to check their credit score online before applying for loans. A lower credit score can result in the loan application being rejected. The ideal credit score is 750 or more, which means that borrowers with high credit score benefit from low-interest rates on their loan applications. However, lenders may also charge high-interest rates from loan applicants with credit score less than 750.Real cost of investmentFace value of the property is just one part of the cost incurred. In real estate investment, there are more expenses involved including Goods and Services Tax, registration, stamp duty, brokerage, furnishing, loan-related fees, etc. Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, an online market place for financial products and checking the credit score said, “The GST on under-construction flats which are not in the affordable housing segment is 5% without input tax credit (ITC). For affordable homes, the GST is 1% without the ITC. Sale of completed properties (where completion certificate has been issued) or the resale of old properties does not attract GST. In this case, you will need to pay stamp duty, not the GST.”Reiterating details regarding stamp duty, Shetty added, “Stamp duty on property registration is set by the state government, and different states have different stamp duty and registration charges. Even within a state, the stamp duty on property differs based on the jurisdiction under which property falls – municipal corporation limits, municipal council, or the gram panchayat. The age of the property may be taken into account, as may be the age and gender of the purchaser while calculating the stamp duty. For instance, many states offer rebates and discounts in stamp duty rates to women. States may also have special time-bound discounts on stamp duty to boost the sector. For instance, the Maharashtra state government announced a 2% reduction on stamp duty between January 1, 2021 and March 31, 2021, bringing down the stamp duty on property registrations to 3% for that three-month period.”Furnishing may cost extra. Besides, banks finance only up to 75% of the loan sought, which means that you must be ready to ready to bear 20-25% of the cost of the property.Check out the areaExtensive research must precede any property purchase. Apart from the amount that one must pay or retrieve as property loan, you must check infrastructural details of the area. Whether the price of the land or property would increase or remain stagnant in future is dependent on the surrounding area and infrastructure. Also, check if the land you propose to buy falls under the category of disputed property. CS Sudheer, founder & CEO, IndianMoney.com, an online advisor on financial products said, “Check for property title papers. Property should have a clear title. Take an encumbrance certificate, and cross verify. Check if the sanctioned plan is available with local municipal and town planning body. Ask for home loan approval from a reputed bank. As banks check the background, this will help you understand if the property that you intend to buy is free from litigation. Take help of a forensic documents examiner and advocate for getting better clarity.”Explore other investmentsParking all money in a major land or property transaction is futile. There are equally good investments that fetch equally good returns sans any loan or the burden of added taxes accruing from the possession of property. These include a healthy mix of mutual funds containing equity and debt. Investment and maintenance costs including yearly fees on Demat accounts, expense ratio, brokerage, among other things are negligible unlike the costs of maintaining your property. Besides, you can sell these financial instruments, in part or full, if you need money. However, selling off property for cash is not that easy, which means that you are likely to feel stuck during a sudden financial crunch.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/what-to-keep-in-mind-while-investing-in-real-estate-101614537257774.html

He also extorted two cases of imported liquor worth ₹42,000 from a shop in Sector 16, and visited a leather showroom in Sector 17 on February 20 and took away various belts and wallets using the same modus operandi, said police.After getting a complaint, police laid a trap and arrested him while he was trying to sell off the extorted liquor in Sector 22 on Saturday night. Some of the bottles were also recovered.“During the probe, no link emerged between Gurnam Singh and anyone in the governor’s office,” said senior superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Chahal. “We are in the process of verifying from other shop owners if they were also duped in a similar manner.” Chahal said the accused has been active in the city for a couple of months, and it is being verified whether he has any accomplice. He was produced in court on Sunday and sent to one-day police remand.A case under Sections 384 (extortion), 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at the Sector-17 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/man-held-for-posing-as-punjab-guv-s-secretary-duping-traders-101614537197696.html

The plan was to extend it to all sectors from March 1, as the MC General House approved the modified terms of the memorandum of understanding on February 15 and garbage collectors started signing it.Most of their demands, including sharing of user charges, life insurance, welfare fund and disbursal of income generated through sale of usable dry waste among them, were incorporated in the MoU.To start collecting user chargesThe MC will also start adding user charges to the water bill in the areas where it takes over garbage collection. “In the southern sectors, where the service will be launched on Monday, charges will be imposed for March onwards,” said Arora. The civic body will also start the trial of payment of bill through point of sale machines in a couple of northern sectors.On problems being faced in northern sectors, MC commissioner KK Yadav said: “The service will run in coordination with residents in a sustainable manner. Issues, such as timings of vehicles, will be resolved keeping in view their needs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-extend-garbage-collection-to-12-more-sectors-101614537078011.html

Though timings are from 10am to 5pm, health officials urged people to come early for vaccination. At the time of administering the first dose, the staff will inform the beneficiary about the next date of vaccination.Deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said the drive will be extended to around 20 government and private heath facilities. He said only those private hospitals will be roped in where people can avail themselves of central or state insurance schemes. Dr Meenu Sasan, nodal officer, health department, Panchkula, said separate slots will be created for Covid warriors who could not get vaccinated earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/health-depts-geared-up-for-next-vax-phase-in-chandigarh-tricity-101614537018403.html
01-03-2021||Delhi||Final-phase of contactless ticketing on Delhi buses to begin on Monday||The state transport department on Monday will roll out the month-long final phase of the contactless ticket system in the network of cluster buses in Delhi, which are operated by concessionaires, the government said in a press statement.Last week, the government introduced the contactless ticket system in the Delhi Transport Corporation’s (DTC) fleet of 3,760 buses. Through the trial, it will now cover the cluster fleet of 2,990 buses.The government launched the first phase of trials concerning the contactless ticket scheme in June 2020, soon after it started relaxing lockdown norms in phases. The idea was to cut down on physical human interaction, and minimise the risk of Covid-19 spreading.Passengers can make use of this service through the ‘Chartr’ app. Almost all buses now have QR code stickers pasted on the back of each seat, which can be scanned to make payments through the app. Several buses also had posters, written in Hindi, explaining how one should proceed with the online ticket purchase by using the app.Three such trial runs were conducted by the government till the scheme was introduced in the DTC fleet on Wednesday.The government said in its statement, around 400,000 tickets have been booked through the ‘Chartr’ app till now and 67% of the total tickets were pink passes -- the free tickets for women passengers.In Delhi, women commuters are exempted from paying for bus tickets under a government scheme launched in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/finalphase-of-contactless-ticketing-on-delhi-buses-to-begin-on-monday-101614535697573.html
01-03-2021||Delhi||In Delhi, 192 centres to vaccinate 60+ and those above 45 with comorbidities||Starting Monday, people aged above 60, and those above 45 with comorbidities, will be able to get vaccinated for the coronavirus at centres in 192 hospitals in the national capital, Delhi government officials said.Of the 192 vaccination sites, 56 are in government hospitals, where the doses will be administered for free, and 136 are in private hospitals, which will charge a maximum of ₹250 per dose, said a senior government official who asked not to be named.To be sure, these centres will be among the 312 existing vaccination points in the Capital, which till Sunday inoculated only health care and frontline workers against Covid-19.People aged between 45-59 years who have any of the 20 specific comorbidities listed by the Union health ministry — which include severe heart diseases, lung diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes and hypertension clubbed with other health conditions, HIV infection and cancer — will be eligible to take doses of the vaccines against Covid-19 in these 192 sites, the state government official said.The government centres that will open up for the two groups include those in GB Pant Hospital, Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital, Maulana Azad Medical College, Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, NDMC Charak Palika Hospital, Northern Railways Hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, AIIMS, GTB Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, IHBAS and Safdarjung Hospital, according to a list prepared by the state health department.The private centres which will open up for the two groups include vaccination points in BLK Memorial Hospital, Jeevan Nursing Home, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Max Patparganj, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Primus Superspeciality Hospital, Fortis Shalimar Bagh, Jaipur Golden Hospital, Max Superspeciality Hospital Shalimar Bagh, Fortis C-doc Hospital in Greater Kailash, Max Superspeciality in Saket, Batra Hospital, Fortis Escort Heart Institute, Indraprastha-Apollo Hospital, Metro Hospital, Moolchand Hospital, Venkateswar Hospital, and Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, according to the list.“We will take all steps to ensure that no inconvenience is caused to any of the beneficiaries. More people should try getting vaccinated at the earliest,” said Dr Namrata Makkar, deputy medical superintendent at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, one of the 192 centres.The list, however, did not specify how many of these centres will administer the Covishield vaccine — manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) – and how many will offer Covaxin, which has been developed by Bharat Biotech.A senior health department official said, “The vaccination sites at AIIMS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, and a few others will be administering doses of Covaxin.”Vaccine drive turnout in Capital remains lowMeanwhile, in the ongoing vaccination drive, fewer than half of all registered beneficiaries in the Capital have received shots of a coronavirus vaccine, shows state government data.Of around 700,000 health care and frontline workers registered for the vaccine in Delhi, as on Sunday, 328,967 have taken the shots since January 16, when the inoculation drive was launched across the country.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “There is no point waiting now. People should use such opportunities to get vaccinated as early as possible. Cases are rising in other countries and several states in India. We never know what awaits us. On part of the government, along with scaling up the vaccination drive, they should intensify their campaign on why, even after taking the vaccine, people should continue to wear masks, maintain social distance and adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-delhi-192-centres-to-vaccinate-60-and-those-above-45-with-comorbidities-101614535457724.html
01-03-2021||Other||Delhi: February this year second warmest since 1901, says IMD||February this year was the second warmest in the Capital since 1901, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a temperature spike that came due to clear skies, and fewer western disturbances than usual. However, weather experts clarified that this was not an indication that summer this year will be hotter than usual.IMD recordings show that the mean maximum temperature (MMT) in February this year was 27.9°C.The highest mean maximum temperature in February was recorded in 1960 and 2006, when the this level in both years shot up to 29.7°C.The average MMT for the month of February is 22.1 degrees Celsius.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the high temperatures recorded this month were primarily due to clear skies, caused by fewer western disturbances.He also said the higher-than-usual February temperature does not mean that Delhi’s summer will be warmer than usual, and that the mercury levels were caused by an isolated weather phenomenon that will not affect temperatures over the rest of the year.“As against the average of six western disturbances that February usually gets, the city got only one active western disturbance, on February 4. With such a prolonged period without a western disturbance, the sky remained clear, which led to an uninterrupted passage of sunlight. This caused the day time temperature to be higher,” Srivastava said.On February 25, the city also recorded the highest maximum temperature for the month since 2006, when the mercury rose to 33.2°C. 34.1°COn Sunday too, the temperatures remained higher than normal. At the Safdarjung weather station, which is the official marker for the city, the maximum temperature was 32.3°C, seven higher than the season’s normal. The minimum touched 15.6°C, three above normal.IMD forecast said that temperatures are expected to fall slightly till March 2, after which the rising trends will return. From March 3 to March 6, the maximum temperatures are expected to hover between 30°C-32°C.Meanwhile, as the temperatures continue to inch up, air quality in the Capital has been improving. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality of Delhi on Sunday was 208, in the ‘poor’ zone. On Saturday, the average AQI was 203, also categorised as ‘poor’ in the AQI scale.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) forecast said, “The winter fury appears to be over but now Delhi air will start getting influenced by mineral dust. High surface wind speed, higher temperature, and higher boundary layer heights are influencing AQI positively. Hence, AQI is forecasted to be in ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category in the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/february-this-year-second-warmest-since-1901-imd-101614535456840.html
01-03-2021||Delhi||₹5,000-crore plan to deal with traffic around redeveloped govt colonies||Union housing and urban affairs ministry and the Delhi Development Authority may discuss this week the funding for an approximately ₹5,000 crore integrated transit plan aimed at handling the expected rise in vehicular traffic around eight government colonies that are being redeveloped by the CentreThe Delhi L-G has asked the DDA to discuss the funding for the project with the urban affairs ministry before it is cleared by UTTIPEC, the apex body for traffic and transportation projects in Delhi.Officials said the plan includes a nearly 14-km elevated corridor from INA at Aurobindo Marg to Mahipalpur underpass at National Highway-8 and connecting all the flyovers between Moolchand and Moti Bagh, just before the start of the elevated Metro corridor on the Ring Road.The corridor, a senior DDA official said, will be an alternate route to the IGI airport covering all the general pool residential accommodation (GPRA) colonies in south Delhi —Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Srinivaspuri, Kasturba Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Mohammadpur and Thyagraj Nagar.The proposal for corridor was tabled by Delhi’s Public Works Department (PWD) in the governing body of the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) in December last year.The PWD got a feasibility study done for the corridor for approval on behalf of the National Buildings Construction Company (NBCC-India) that is involved in the redevelopment of four government colonies in south Delhi.As per the minutes of the UTTIPEC meeting, seen by HT, the L-G asked DDA vice-chairman to organise a meeting with HUA ministry to “discuss the proposal regarding funding issue”. “GB (Governing Body) directed the proposal to be placed in the governing body meeting of UTTIPEC after detailed discussion with MoHUA,” read the minutes of the meeting, which was finalised on January 14.It is learnt that DDA is preparing a proposal to discuss with HUA ministry to get clarity on the funding of this project. “It is an expensive project. Before it is cleared by UTTIPEC, the LG just wanted that there should be clarity on its funding,” said a senior DDA official.The meeting between the DDA and HUA officials to discuss the issue is scheduled this week, said a senior HUA ministry official. “The construction of the transit corridor will be done by CPWD. A revised estimate is under preparation,” said the HUA official.The Centre is constructing over 25,000 dwelling units and a commercial complex in the seven residential colonies. NBCC India has already redeveloped East Kidwai Nagar.NBCC-India, which is redeveloping Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar and Netaji Nagar, asked Delhi PWD in 2018 to conduct the feasibility survey of the corridor. A senior NBCC India official said, “The approval process for funding the elevated corridor is going on. It is being discussed with the ministry and will be finalised soon. A meeting was held in this regard in the ministry last month. The process is in the final stages,” said a NBCC official.While the alignment of the elevated corridor is yet to be finalised, the PWD official said, the plan is to start the corridor from INA and go through Africa Avenue, Nelson Mandela Road and end at Mahipalpur underpass.Though the feasibility study was done by Delhi PWD, which is the road-owning agency in Delhi, the construction of the corridor is likely to be done by the central Public Works Department as it is a central government-funded project.A senior Delhi PWD official said, “We were asked to just carry out the feasibility study and get it cleared from UTTIPEC. We will not be executing the project.”Sarvagya Srivastava, former Delhi PWD engineer-in-chief, said, “With new high-rise development in these colonies, the traffic is bound to increase and the existing road network is not designed to take that kind of load. The Ring Road has already reached the capacity versus volume ratio. The corridor is an afterthought; ideally population density should be planned according to the infrastructure. There is no option but to construct an elevated corridor, as there is no space to widen the road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rs-5-000-crore-plan-to-deal-with-traffic-around-redeveloped-govt-colonies-101614535398064.html
01-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi traffic police to install cameras in 31 locations||After the success of camera-based prosecutions last year when Covid-induced curbs were in place, the Delhi traffic department will install additional speed detection and red-light violation cameras in around 31 spots across the Capital by March 31, said senior traffic police officials.“We are maintaining the balance between technology and human intervention in policing,” said joint commissioner of police (traffic), Manish Agarwal. “Cameras are very effective for violations such as speeding, because traffic officials on the roads cannot screen all the cars that travel beyond the speed limit. However, cameras equipped to detect this violation can track each and every vehicle that goes beyond the set limit,” he added.He added that during and after the Covid-19 lockdown — which was imposed from March 25 and began being lifted in phases in the first week of May — the department relied heavily on camera-based fines to ensure the safety of commuters and its own staff.By March 31, the traffic police department is looking to increase the number of speed detection cameras at 25 locations. Another six spots will get red-light detection cameras, which are installed at traffic junctions and equipped to record violations such as stop-light jumps, stop-line violations and driving against the flow of traffic. These cameras also record speeding offences.Traffic officials in charge of the project said over 50 cameras will be installed in the 25 locations, and nearly 100 cameras will be installed at the six junctions where multiple violations will be detected.The speed detection cameras will be installed on Mathura Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, National Highway-48, Rohtak Road and Mukarba Chowk. The red-light violation cameras will be set up at intersections around Peeragarhi Chowk, Britannia Chowk, Azadpur Chowk and Burari.Currently, the city has over 150 cameras installed at 37 locations, including ITO, Naraina, Rao Tula Ram Marg, Dwarka, Dhaula Kuan, Sarai Kale Khan, Mayapuri, among others.Traffic police data released last month showed that despite the three-month-long nationwide lockdown last year, when vehicular movement was low, the number of issued fines saw a significant increase compared to previous years.The traffic police issued 13,802,973 fines in 2020, as against 10,580,249 fines in 2019.Delhi also saw a sharp drop in accident fatalities last year, when the Capital reported 1,163 fatal accidents, down from 1,433 in 2019.Traffic officials explained that last year the department also made progress in digitally serving notices of violations to offenders. The department, officials said, has been working towards sending more and more challan notices through SMS.“By making linkage of mobile numbers mandatory while registering of vehicles, we have been able to send over 60% of the total challan notices via sms. Till 2019, this figure was only around 49%. Since people are getting notices on their phones, the challan payments have also gone up. The risk of notices getting lost in mail has been eradicated,” a senior traffic officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-traffic-police-to-install-cameras-in-over-20-locations-101614535397011.html

He suggested that countries were hastening to loosen those measures, betting on vaccines to bring an end to the Covid-19 pandemic."If countries rely solely on vaccines, they are making a mistake. Basic public health measures remain the foundation of the response," Tedros said.He noted that Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire became the first countries on Monday to begin vaccinating people with doses supplied by COVAX, the international programme to provide vaccines for poor and middle-income countries. But he also criticised rich countries for hoarding vaccine doses."It's regrettable that some countries continue to prioritise vaccinating younger healthier adults at lower risk of diseases in their own populations, ahead of health workers and older people elsewhere," Tedros said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-infections-rise-for-first-time-in-7-weeks-says-who-101614618338203.html
01-03-2021||World||Italy PM Draghi fires Covid-19 commissioner, with vaccination drive in spotlight||Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Monday fired Italy's special COVID-19 commissioner Domenico Arcuri and replaced him with an army logistics expert, in a signal the government wanted to speed up vaccinations.The move followed growing complaints about Arcuri's handling of the crisis and concern that the anti-COVID vaccine campaign was moving forward too slowly.It is one of Draghi's first major decisions since becoming premier last month and follows his firing last week of the chief of the civil protection agency. That step was also seen as an attempt to improve Italy's response to the COVID crisis.The new coronavirus commissioner was named as General Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, a former commander of NATO forces in Kosovo and head of army logistics since 2018.Draghi told parliament last month that he wanted to involve the military in the nationwide vaccine roll-out plan.Italy launched its inoculation campaign at the end of December, and has so far administered 4.3 million jabs including second shots.In all, it has received 6.3 million vaccine doses from manufacturers, but supply delays, which have also affected other European Union states, have hampered efforts.The country is due to receive millions more doses this month, but critics have said there is no coherent plan in place to allow for the sort of massive vaccination programmes that Britain and Israel instigated.Draghi said last month there was a growing case for Italy to follow the British example of making it a priority to give first jabs to as many people as possible.At present many EU countries, including Italy, are following drugmaker recommendations to give people two separate vaccinations and are holding back doses as a result.Arcuri, who also heads the national investments agency Invitalia, was appointed special COVID commissioner last year by the then-prime minister Giuseppe Conte.He has come under pressure in recent months after a judicial investigation alleged that one of his longtime acquaintances had received 12 million euros from a Chinese consortium after it won a major contract from the commissioner's office.Magistrates have placed the friend under investigation for alleged corruption. Arcuri is not under investigation himself, and has denied any wrongdoing.In its statement on Monday, Draghi's office thanked Arcuri for his "commitment and dedication ... in a moment of particular emergency for the country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-pm-draghi-fires-covid-19-commissioner-with-vaccination-drive-in-spotlight-101614617170148.html
01-03-2021||World||329 candidates nominated for 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by Feb 1 deadline||The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Monday that there are 329 candidates — 234 individuals and 95 organisations — that were nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by the February 1 deadline.The Oslo-based organization said that it was the third highest number of candidates ever, adding the current record of 376 candidates was reached in 2016.A vast group of people — heads of state or politicians serving at a national level, university professors, directors of foreign policy institutes, past Nobel Prize recipients and members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee — can submit a nomination for the prize.However, the nominees aren't announced by the very secretive board in Oslo, but those doing the nominating may choose to make it public, raising publicity both for the nominee and the proposer.The Associated Press earlier has reported that the 2021 nominees include exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and two other Belarus democracy activists, Veronika Tsepkalo and Maria Kolesnikova; the Black Lives Matter movement; Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate who has become a leading voting rights advocate; and former White House adviser Jared Kushner and his deputy, Avi Berkowitz, who negotiated a series of Middle East agreements known as the Abraham Accords.Groups nominated in 2021 include the World Health Organization for its role in addressing the coronavirus pandemic; NATO; Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF; and Polish judges defending civil rights.The UN World Food Program won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Committee announces its annual decision in October. The peace prize and other Nobel prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.Five Nobel Prizes were established under the terms of Alfred Nobel's will. A sixth prize, for economics, was created by the Central Bank of Sweden in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel.Each prize carry substantial cash awards that are adjusted each year. In 2020, they came with a 10-milion krona (USD 1.1 million) cash award — which often is shared — along with diplomas and gold medals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/329-candidates-nominated-for-2021-nobel-peace-prize-by-feb-1-deadline-101614617187145.html
01-03-2021||World||China sets aim to vaccinate 40% of population by June||China is lagging in its coronavirus vaccination rollout because it has the disease largely under control, but plans to inoculate 40% of its population by June, Chinese health experts said Monday.Zhong Nanshan, the leader of a group of experts attached to the National Health Commission, said the country has delivered 52.52 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of February 28. He was speaking at an online forum between US and Chinese medical experts hosted by the Brookings Institution and Tsinghua University.The target is the first China has offered publicly since it began its mass immunization campaign for key groups in mid-December.China has been slow to vaccinate its people relative to other countries, inoculating only 3.56% of its population of 1.4 billion so far, according to Zhong. Ranked first in the world in terms of percentage of population is Israel, which has vaccinated over 90% of its people. The US has vaccinated about 22% of its population.Chinese health experts say the country has enough vaccine supply for its population, although the country has pledged to provide close to half a billion doses abroad, roughly 10 times the number it has delivered at home.“The current vaccination pace is very low due to outbreak control (being) so good in China, but I think the capacity is enough,” said Zhang Wenhong, an infectious diseases expert based in Shanghai who also spoke on the panel.Developers of China’s four currently approved vaccines have said they could manufacture up to 2.6 billion doses by the end of this year. Still, vaccinating China’s massive population will be a daunting task.Even at the rate of vaccinating 10 million people a day, it would take roughly seven months to vaccinate 70% of its population, Zhang noted.The experts all acknowledged the complex task of vaccinating the world's population, pointing to the slowness in the global rollout of vaccines.“Demand will outstrip supply for many months, and unless there is more manufacturing, … for years,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.They also cautioned against expecting a quick return to normal.The head of China’s Center for Disease Control, Gao Fu, predicted that life could return to an “approximate normal” in summer next year.Gao, along with Zhong and other Chinese health experts, urged more US-China cooperation. Gao specifically called on the U.S. and China to cooperate on COVAX, an initiative to distribute vaccines more fairly across the developing world.“Let’s work together,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sets-aim-to-vaccinate-40-of-population-by-june-101614615145187.html

Investors were also watching Washington as a big economic stimulus bill moved to the Senate.The S&P 500 added 2.1% as of 10:40 a.m. Eastern. More than 95% of the stocks in the index were higher, led by energy companies and airlines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.Much of the focus on Wall Street is on the bond market.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.43% after going as high as 1.5% last week, the highest level in more than a year. Higher interest rates can slow the economy and discourage borrowing.Bond yields, which influence interest ratest on mortgages and many other kinds of loans, have been steadily climbing much of the year, as investors have bet that vaccination efforts and more government stimulus will lead to strong economic growth this year. However, along with strong economic growth comes concerns of inflation.A handful high-level officials with the Federal Reserve will make speeches this week, which will give investors additional information on how concerned the nation's central bank is about the economy and inflation. Lael Brainard, an advocate for looser monetary policies, will give a monetary policy speech on Tuesday and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give a speech on Thursday.The House of Representatives approved Biden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill on Friday and it now goes to the Senate for approval. The bill infuses cash across the struggling economy to individuals, businesses, schools, states and cities battered by Covid-19.The stimulus bill would include yet another round of one-time payments to most Americans, including an expansion of other refundable tax credits like the child tax credit, and additional aid to state and local governments to combat the pandemic.Johnson & Johnson rose 1.5% after the Food and Drug Administration gave approval for the company's own coronavirus vaccine, one that does not require extensive refrigeration like the ones made by Moderna or Pfizer.Investors will get several big economic reports this week, including February's jobs report on Friday. On Monday a report on manufacturing came in better than expectations, and new orders also came in better than expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stocks-climb-more-than-2-as-investors-get-back-to-buying-101614614322817.html
01-03-2021||World||Chinese hackers target SII, Bharat Biotech, says security firm||A Chinese state-backed hacking group has in recent weeks targeted the IT systems of two Indian vaccine makers whose coronavirus shots are being used in the country's immunisation campaign, cyber intelligence firm Cyfirma told Reuters.Rivals China and India have both sold or gifted Covid-19 shots to many countries. India produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold in the world.Goldman Sachs-backed Cyfirma, based in Singapore and Tokyo, said Chinese hacking group APT10, also known as Stone Panda, had identified gaps and vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure and supply chain software of Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker."The real motivation here is actually exfiltrating intellectual property and getting competitive advantage over Indian pharmaceutical companies," said Cyfirma Chief Executive Kumar Ritesh, formerly a top cyber official with British foreign intelligence agency MI6.He said APT10 was actively targeting SII, which is making the AstraZeneca vaccine for many countries and will soon start bulk-manufacturing Novavax shots."In the case of Serum Institute, they have found a number of their public servers running weak web servers, these are vulnerable web servers," Ritesh said, referring to the hackers."They have spoken about weak web application, they are also talking about weak content-management system. It's quite alarming."China's foreign ministry did not reply to a request for comment. But responding to a question on whether Chinese hackers had a role in attacking India's power grid which caused a blackout in Mumbai last year, the ministry said it was a staunch defender of cyber security."China firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyber attacks," its embassy in New Delhi said on Twitter, quoting the foreign ministry. "Speculation and fabrication have no role to play on the issue of cyber attacks."SII and Bharat Biotech declined to comment. The office of the director-general of the state-run Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said the matter had been handed to its operations director, S.S. Sarma.Sarma told Reuters CERT was a "legal agency and we can't confirm this thing to media".Cyfirma said in a statement it had informed CERT authorities and that they had acknowledged the threat.The U.S. Department of Justice said https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion in 2018 that APT10 had acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security.Microsoft said https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum in November that it had detected cyber attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting vaccine companies in India, Canada, France, South Korea and the United States. North Korean hackers also tried to break into the systems of British drugmaker AstraZeneca, Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-astrazeneca-no-idUSKBN2871A2 has reported.Ritesh, whose firm follows the activities of some 750 cyber criminals and monitors nearly 2,000 hacking campaigns using a tool called DeCYFIR, said it was not yet clear what information APT10 may have accessed from the Indian companies.Relations between nuclear-armed neighbours China and India soured last June when 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in a Himalayan border fight.

01-03-2021||World||Police investigate possible role of foreigners in Barcelona protests||Police are investigating the role of foreign citizens in riots over the jailing of a Spanish rapper that have rocked Barcelona for the past two weeks, a police source said.Catalan regional police detained six Italians and one French citizen on Saturday. On Monday they inspected two houses outside Barcelona which were illegally occupied and where at least some of the detained appeared to live, the source told Reuters.Police have arrested more than 100 people since the protests over the jailing of rapper Pablo Hasel erupted on February 16. The exact role of the foreigners was unclear.Miquel Samper, interior affairs minister in the Catalan regional government, told reporters on Monday that police face an "unprecedented complex situation" as the protesters could meet and take action quickly. Some were foreign anarchists, he said.The protests escalated on Saturday. A police van was set on fire with an officer inside who managed to escape. Protesters also smashed the fronts of shops and banks, including along Barcelona's central La Rambla boulevard.One of the arrested foreigners was related to the van attack, the source said.Hasel has been sentenced to nine months in prison after being convicted of glorifying terrorism and insulting the monarchy, galvanizing defenders of freedom of speech and sparking protests. The conviction also prompted the government to announce it would relax free speech legal restrictions.He was convicted for lyrics and tweets that included references to Basque separatist group ETA, calling Spain's former King Juan Carlos a mafia boss, and likening Spanish judges to Nazis.Samper said on Sunday a group of 150 and 200 protesters were behind the demonstrations' escalation into riots, some of whom threw petrol bombs, and they had engaged in direct violence with no apparent reason.Business organizations and police unions have demanded a firmer government action against the riots after damages to property already amounts to over two million euros.

"And if President Biden considers it, he can give us an answer in the conversation ... about the vaccines."He did not elaborate on the request, but said vaccines were very important to Mexico. Mexican magazine Proceso said Lopez Obrador had asked Biden for help on vaccines in January.Immigration, security, climate change and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal were also likely to feature in their talks, Lopez Obrador said.Lopez Obrador, a leftist, was also asked whether the two would discuss a contentious electricity bill he has championed which strengthens the position of the state-run electricity utility, the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE).The president has cast the legislation as a matter of national sovereignty, arguing that past governments skewed the electricity market in favor of private operators.Business groups have condemned the bill, saying it risks violating the USMCA and endangers Mexico's renewable energy targets because it puts wind and solar generators at a disadvantage against the CFE, a heavy user of fossil fuels.Lopez Obrador said their dialogue would be open, but that Biden respected Mexico's sovereignty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-hopes-for-us-answer-on-covid-19-vaccines-in-biden-talks-101614612720149.html

Palestinians have been critical of the rapprochement, worried that their own unmet statehood goal might be sidelined.Israel opened an embassy in Abu Dhabi in January. Israel considers Jerusalem its capital but this is not widely recognised abroad. The Palestinians want their own capital in the east of the city, which Israel captured in a 1967 war.The UAE would follow Jordan and Egypt in setting up an embassy in or near coastal metropolis Tel Aviv.According to the UAE Foreign Ministry, Al Khalja has experience in the energy, disarmament, business development and oil investment sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-uae-ambassador-arrives-in-israel-eyes-tel-aviv-embassy-101614609638519.html
01-03-2021||World||Experts urge independent probe into Kremlin critic Navalny's poisoning||Two top human rights officials urged an international probe into the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and called Monday for his immediate release from prison.Agnès Callamard, the Special U.N. Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and Irene Khan, the Special U.N. Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, said Navalny’s poisoning was intended to “send a clear, sinister warning that this would be the fate of anyone who would criticize and oppose the government.”“Given the inadequate response of the domestic authorities, the use of prohibited chemical weapons, and the apparent pattern of attempted targeted killings, we believe that an international investigation should be carried out as a matter of urgency in order to establish the facts and clarify all the circumstances concerning Mr. Navalny’s poisoning," they said in a statement.Navalny, the most prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell sick on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and was flown while still in a coma to Berlin for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have denied any involvement in the poisoning.In December, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as a fake.Callamard and Khan on Monday published their official letter sent to the Russian authorities in December and noted that “the availability of Novichok and the expertise required in handling it and in developing a novel form such as that found in Mr. Navalny’s samples could only be found within and amongst state actors.”The experts emphasized in a statement released by the U.N. that Navalny “was under intensive government surveillance at the time of the attempted killing, making it unlikely that any third party could have administered such a banned chemical without the knowledge of the Russian authorities.”Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 upon returning from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from the nerve agent poisoning. The arrest triggered massive protests, to which the Russian authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown.Last month, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the ECHR has ruled to be unlawful.Last week, Navalny was sent to serve his prison sentence to a prison outside Moscow despite the ECHR's demand for his release.Russian officials have dismissed demands from the United States and the European Union to free Navalny and stop the crackdown on his supporters.The rights experts noted that an international probe into Navalny's poisoning is “especially critical” now when he is in prison. They called for his immediate release and reminded Russia that it's “responsible for the care and protection of Mr. Navalny in prison and that it shall be held responsible for any harm that may befall him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-urge-independent-probe-into-kremlin-critic-navalny-s-poisoning-101614610654229.html
01-03-2021||World||Nepal President summons lower house session on March 7, after top court's order||Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Monday summoned a session of the House of Representatives on March 7, days after the apex court reinstated the lower house in a landmark verdict that annulled embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli's "unconstitutional" decision to dissolve it.President Bhandari called for the commencement of House on recommendation of Government of Nepal, in accordance with Article 93 (1) of the Constitution of Nepal, according to a notice issued by the President’s Office on Monday.As per the notice, the 275-member lower house will begin at 4:00pm on the slated date.The presidential order to summon the House meeting follows the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Prime Minister Oli’s move to dissolve the House on December 20.A five-member constitutional bench led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher last week annulled the Oli government's "unconstitutional" decision to dissolve the lower house of Parliament.The court had ordered the government to summon the House session within the next 13 days.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', also a co-chair of the ruling party.As many as 13 writ petitions including the one by the ruling party's Chief Whip Dev Prasad Gurung were filed in the apex court seeking the restoration of the lower house parliament.In its ruling, the apex court termed the dissolution of the House as "unconstitutional".The ruling party suffered a vertical split following Oli’s decision to dissolve the lower house.Prime Minister Oli on Sunday challenged the splinter faction led by 'Prachanda' to remove him from the top post if he can."Remove me if you can. If I am ousted, I’ll emerge victorious with a two-thirds majority in the next election," 69-year-old Oli said.Prachanda has been making efforts to garner support from the opposition Nepali Congress and Janata Samajbadi parties in an apparent bid to oust Oli from power.Oli's Press Advisor Surya Thapa last week said the prime minister will not resign immediately and implement the Supreme Court’s verdict against him by facing Parliament.Oli is under pressure to step down following the court verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-president-summons-lower-house-session-on-march-7-after-top-court-s-order-101614610556644.html
01-03-2021||World||What we know about the new Brazilian Covid-19 variant P.1||Britain on Monday sent out a public appeal to locate the mystery individual infected with an extremely infectious variant of coronavirus first detected in the Manaus city of Brazil.Britain sent out the 'please get in touch' appeal after the test resulted positive for the individual but failed to be contacted due to improper detailsThe Manaus or P.1 variant is considered to be highly infectious and appears to affect the immune response of the coronavirus vaccines presently available, as per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Till now, six individuals in Britain have been detected infected with the P.1 variant of the novel coronavirus.Here is what we know so far about itThe P.1 variant belongs to the lineage of B.1.1.28, that was first detected in Japan by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in four travellers that had arrived from Brazil, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The cause of concern in the P.1 variant is the three key mutations out of 17 mutations in its spike protein receptor domain-K417T, E484K, and N501Y says CDC.As per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is evidence that suggests the mutations in the P.1 variant can affect the ability of the prevalent antibodies through previous infections or vaccinations to identify and neutralize the virus."There is evidence to suggest that some of the mutations in the P.1 variant may affect its transmissibility and antigenic profile, which may affect the ability of antibodies generated through a previous natural infection or through vaccination to recognize and neutralize the virus," the CDC said.Also Read | Ukraine throws away unused Covid-19 shots as doctors skip their own vaccinationsThe presence of the E484K mutation in the variant which is also the key mutation in the South African variant of the coronavirus makes it more dangerous. "The evidence we have suggests that certainly the South African variant and potentially this Brazilian variant, which is somewhat similar - the vaccines we have at the moment are less effective at reducing at least mild disease and possibly transmission," Reuters quoted Adam Finn, a member of the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as saying.CDC also said that as per a recent study on the cluster found in the Mansaus city of Brazil, 42 per cent of the population was identified with P.1 variant in late December. It is worth noting that in the same region, it is estimated that approximately 75 per cent of the population had been infected by Covid-19 as of October 2020. But since mid-December the region has witnessed a surge in the coronavirus cases. Hence the presence of the variant raises serious concern about the increased transmissibility of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-we-know-about-the-new-brazilian-covid-19-variant-p1-101614605943003.html
01-03-2021||World||Ukraine throws away unused Covid-19 shots as doctors skip their own vaccinations||Ukrainian medical facilities have thrown away some unused Covid-19 vaccines after doctors failed to show up for their own appointments to be vaccinated, ruling party lawmakers said on Monday.Ukraine has just begun vaccinating its 41 million people against Covid-19 after receiving a first batch of 500,000 doses of Indian-made AstraZeneca shots last week, but faces a battle against vaccine scepticism that predates the pandemic.The government has prioritised giving shots to frontline medical workers but cited statistics showing that 47% of Ukrainians do not want the vaccine."It is important for us to understand how all the processes are set up, why doctors refuse to be vaccinated," Oleksandr Korniyenko, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's Servant of the People party, told a televised meeting."This is very bad, but there is no other option... if a person does not come, it (vaccine bottle) can be kept open for 2-3 hours, after which it must be disposed of," the head of parliament's health committee Mykhailo Radutskyi said.A total of 3,141 shots were administered of Feb. 28, including just 90 shots in the past 24 hours, health ministry data showed.Health Minister Maksym Stepanov said the government was working to ensure vaccines do not get thrown away, adding this also happened in other countries.He was vaccinated on television on Monday and said Zelenskiy would take the shot soon."I proved by my own example that the vaccine we are vaccinated with is an absolutely safe vaccine, it is an effective vaccine," he said.A significant part of the population of Ukraine, like many post-Soviet republics, is traditionally wary of vaccines, fearing side effects from poor quality drugs. Such mistrust allowed a measles outbreak to grow into an epidemic in 2019.Covid-19 cases have picked up after a lull during a tight lockdown at the start of the year, especially in Kyiv and western Ukraine, where the government set up mobile hospitals to cope with a sharp spike in cases. Ukraine has registered 1.3 million cases with 26,050 deaths from Covid-19 as of March 1.In the northern city of Chernihiv, only 87 out of 280 doctors agreed to be vaccinated, the secretary of the city council said in a Facebook post on Feb 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-throws-away-unused-covid-19-shots-as-doctors-skip-their-own-vaccinations-101614608421593.html
01-03-2021||World||Elizabeth Warren, other progressives propose ‘ultra-millionaire’ tax||Senator Elizabeth Warren, joined by Representatives Pramila Jayapal and Brendan Boyle, proposed a new wealth tax on households with a net worth of more than $50 million.The lawmakers said Monday the new tax, dubbed the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, would create a “fairer” economy with a 2% annual tax on households and trusts valued at between $50 million and $1 billion. All net worth over $1 billion would be taxed at 3%.“The ultra-rich and powerful have rigged the rules in their favor so much that the top 0.1% pay a lower effective tax rate than the bottom 99%, and billionaire wealth is 40% higher than before the COVID crisis began,” Warren said in a statement. “A wealth tax is popular among voters on both sides for good reason: because they understand the system is rigged to benefit the wealthy and large corporations.”A wealth tax would be difficult to pass in the current U.S. Senate, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats control the agenda, since Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties, but most bills require support from 60 senators to advance.And Democrats have been unable to muster even 50 votes from some administration proposals, including a $15 hourly minimum wage. A wealth tax likely would be even more divisive.However, Democrats are planning to use special budget reconciliation procedures to pass a bill with a simple majority later in the year that will include parts of a massive infrastructure package. At that point, taxes to pay for the build out would be on the table. And under Senate rules, tax increases generally are allowed in budget bills.The bill’s co-sponsors include Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Mazie Hirono, also of Hawaii.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elizabeth-warren-other-progressives-propose-ultra-millionaire-tax-101614607781456.html
01-03-2021||World||US Democrats shelve minimum wage tax to speed work on stimulus||Senate Democrats are jettisoning a proposal to use the tax code to penalize corporations that don’t raise the minimum wage for their lowest-paid workers in an effort to keep President Joe Biden’s broader stimulus plan on track for quick passage, according to two people familiar with the matter.Democrats were left seeking alternatives after the Senate parliamentarian ruled Thursday that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief legislation failed to qualify under fast-track budget rules that Democrats are using to pass the stimulus without Republican support.The Senate could begin consideration of the stimulus measure as soon as Wednesday — with final votes as soon as late Thursday — pending full Democratic support and sign off from the parliamentarian.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders proposed tax penalties on big companies that pay low wages along with incentives for smaller companies as an alternative. But it became clear over the weekend that getting all 50 Senate Democrats to agree on specific language would risk missing the March 14 deadline for extending expiring supplemental unemployment benefits, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.The decision removes a major complication in the Senate and could speed approval of the rest of the package in the chamber. In addition to getting the backing of all 50 senators who caucus with Democrats, the tax language also would have had to pass muster with the parliamentarian, the House and the administration and be signed by Biden -- all in a two-week period.Still, dropping the minimum wage increase from the stimulus could create other headaches for both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.In the House, the stimulus legislation with the $15 an hour minimum wage narrowly passed on Saturday by 219 to 212, without any Republican support. Pelosi lost two moderate Democrats on that vote, and she can’t afford many more defections.Pelosi said Friday she’s “absolutely” confident she could pass a stimulus bill without a minimum-wage provision in it, but that remains to be seen.Progressives in the chamber have made the minimum wage hike a signature issue as they angle to set the party’s future direction. Although there hasn’t been an explicit threat to scuttle the broader stimulus bill, which includes the extra unemployment benefits and $1,400 direct payments to many Americans, the conflict is bound to increase tension between the two wings of the party with Biden in the middle.Progressive lawmakers on Monday sent Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris a letter organized by Representative Ro Khanna demanding that they set aside the parliamentarian’s ruling and include a minimum-wage increase in the Covid-19 relief package.New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the leader of a group of young, vocal progressives, signed the letter and is among those urging Senate Democrats to get rid of a rule that gives the minority power to block most legislation.“Really our options right now, at least our immediate options on this specific issue, is to do something about this parliamentary obstacle or abolish the filibuster,” she said on Friday.The White House has said Vice President Kamala Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, won’t overrule the parliamentarian’s decision. And a few Democrats, including West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, have said they are opposed to overturning Senate rules.Expectations of the stimulus plan’s passage helped propel U.S. equities to record highs last month, and any major setbacks could unsettle investors. While some economic indicators have picked up, legislative delays would disrupt help going to millions of Americans still out of work thanks to the pandemic.The last time Congress voted to increase the minimum wage was in 2007, when a measure phasing in a hike from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 was attached to a war funding bill by Pelosi and signed by President George W. Bush. Since then, many states have raised their wage standard above the federal minimum.There are other possible avenues for Democrats to try, including attaching vetted language to Biden’s “Build Back Better” package later this year, which is also likely to move via the fast-track budget rules. Otherwise, they would need to find 10 Republicans to agree to advance a wage hike. Republicans blocked a $10.10 minimum wage in 2014.But even that may be a difficult road to take. Manchin said last week that he could back $11 an hour, phased in over two years and then indexed to inflation. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema has also expressed opposition to increasing the wage to $15 an hour, but so far has not outlined what she would support. Montana Senator Jon Tester said he is in favor of a different phase-in, but thinks a compromise can be found.Biden so far is hinting that it may be time to move on from the minimum-wage fight for now, given the urgency of the pandemic. Fighting for it once the economy is in better shape may make the increase an easier sell to pro-business moderates.“We have no time to waste,” Biden said Saturday. “If we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus, we can finally get our economy moving again.”Close Biden ally Senator Chris Coons of Delaware on Sunday reinforced that message when asked about the nascent tax proposal.“This isn’t the last bill we will adopt this year. There may be several other chances for us to move a minimum wage bill. But I look forward to hearing from Senators Sanders and Wyden this week,” he said on CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-democrats-shelve-minimum-wage-tax-to-speed-work-on-stimulus-101614609824521.html
01-03-2021||World||Can Southeast Asian diplomacy end crisis in Myanmar?||The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) holds a meeting of foreign ministers on Tuesday to discuss the crisis after Myanmar's Feb. 1 coup, which will include representation from the military government.WHY ASEAN?The United Nations, United States, European Union, China and Asian powers have all identified ASEAN as a potentially pivotal player in resolving the crisis in Myanmar, which is one of its 10 members.The group has the unofficial motto "One Family" and tends to stress stability and development above political rights.Its diverse membership includes Indonesia, the world's third biggest democracy, but also communist Vietnam and Laos and Brunei, one of the world's last absolute monarchies.CAN ASEAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE?Several ASEAN diplomats told Reuters the group's credibility was at stake over Myanmar.ASEAN has advantages in its standing as the region's premier multinational forum and its connections to junta members, but its requirement for consensus and principle of non-interference make agreement harder. As a member, Myanmar must agree with any action too.Critics, including the advocacy group ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, say the body has repeatedly failing to tackle human rights abuses in the region.Diplomats and analysts say the most that might happen in the short-term is the encouragement of dialogue between the junta and its opponents to avoid worse bloodshed.Longer term, an Indonesian plan for ASEAN to oversee a new election to ensure it is fair and inclusive could allow the junta to step down and put Myanmar back on the course to democracy, its proponents say.But ousted parliamentarians and protesters have rejected a new election - demanding respect for a ballot last year that was swept by Aung San Suu Kyi's party.WHAT PART COULD SANCTIONS PLAY?The United States and some Western countries have introduced targeted sanctions on junta leaders and Myanmar's ousted elected leaders and protesters would happily see more.But given its structure - and Myanmar's membership - any sanctions are unlikely from ASEAN.That said, regional businesses could feel the impact of Western sanctions on military-linked businesses.While financial centre Singapore, also a close U.S. ally, said it rejected sanctions itself, its central bank also told financial institutions to be vigilant about the risks of dealing with companies or individuals that could be under sanctions by other nations.WHAT ABOUT ASIA'S BIGGEST POWERS?Both China and India border Myanmar and have big investments there and links to the military. Their promises of coronavirus vaccines gives them added leverage, diplomats and analysts say.China has said the priority must be stability and that other countries should avoid interfering in what calls Myanmar's "internal affairs" to avoid making the situation worse.Democratic India has not been much tougher in public. At the weekend, its embassy in Myanmar called for dialogue and restraint from both sides after security forces killed at least 18 protesters.Some analysts say neither China or India is likely to want to take forceful action against the coup-makers - fearful that it could push Myanmar closer to their strategic rival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-southeast-asian-diplomacy-end-crisis-in-myanmar-101614609376045.html
01-03-2021||World||Joe Biden putting tech over troops at core of US-China policy||The Biden administration is moving to put semiconductors, artificial intelligence and next-generation networks at the heart of US strategy toward Asia, attempting to rally what officials are calling “techno-democracies” to stand up to China and other “techno-autocracies.”The new framing for the US rivalry with China has been given added urgency by the sudden global shortage of microchips needed in products such as cars, mobile phones and refrigerators. The strategy would seek to rally an alliance of nations fighting for an edge in semiconductor fabrication and quantum computing, upending traditional arenas of competition such as missile stockpiles and troop numbers.Current and former government officials, along with outside experts, say the administration’s plans in the technology sphere are a microcosm of its broader plans to take up a more alliance-oriented but still hostile approach to China after a more chaotic approach under President Donald Trump.“There’s a newfound realization about the importance that semiconductors are playing in this geopolitical struggle because chips underlie every tech in the modern era,” said Lindsay Gorman, a fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund of the US. “It’s an effort to double down on the technological comparative advantage that the U.S. and its democratic partners.”It’s an approach partly based partly on denying China access to certain technology for as long as possible, looking to quash Chinese juggernauts like Huawei Technologies Co. and even taking a page from the Communist Party’s playbook by boosting government involvement in key industries when needed.It comes as Chinese Communist Party leaders including President Xi Jinping are expected to lay out how they intend to make technology a centerpiece of future development at the National People’s Congress beginning later this week.Several people familiar with the administration’s planning, and especially that of Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council’s Asia coordinator, say he foresees a broad approach that puts greater emphasis on a few key partners such as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, while offering incentives to bring chip fabrication back to the US.Chips figure in plans to bolster the Quad -- a once-sputtering alliance of the US, Japan, Australia and India that got a boost of support during the Trump era -- including by eventually bringing more technology production to South Asia.The battle over microchips -- and the focus they’re being given in the early days of the Biden administration -- is being forced upon the new White House by necessity. A global shortage of chips, due in part to stockpiling by China and a surge in demand during the pandemic, has forced some American automakers to shutter plants and exposed weaknesses in US supply chains, with their heavy dependence on a few manufacturers in Asia.On Wednesday, President Joe Biden ordered a global supply chain review for microchips as well as large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals and strategic materials such as rare earths. Most US chips come from Taiwan, which China still claims as its territory, and the US gets almost all its rare earths from China. China quickly dismissed the pledge to find alternative supply sources as unrealistic.Officials say it’s too early to detail what the US strategy will look like. The idea of techno-democracies challenging techno-autocracies appeared in a Foreign Affairs magazine report late last year that called for “an overarching forum in which like-minded countries can come together to hammer out joint responses” to the challenge from China.“We have to confront this challenge together -- China’s abuse, China’s predatory practices, China’s export of tools it uses to further its brand of techno-authoritarianism,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a Feb. 22 briefing.The approach is already getting a positive response from Congress, where lawmakers are proposing a number of bills aimed at bolstering US technology, such as the Chips Act, which would offer incentives to bring chip manufacturing back home, and the Endless Frontier Act to invest more broadly in technological advancement.F-35s to Phones”The president was very receptive, as was the vice president,” Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said after meeting Biden at the White House on Wednesday. “We all understand this is important, not only to our economy, but to our national security, because these cutting-edge, high-end semiconductors -- they operate on everything from the F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter to our cell phones.”Although many of the ideas in the emerging plan carry over from the Trump administration, its proponents say one of the differences is the effort to align disparate elements into a unified strategy. Under Trump, getting tough on China often clashed with his focus on securing a trade deal with Beijing, muddling the message.Biden’s supporters say his strategy will include working more closely with other countries. And it’s looking to strengthen existing partnerships that were rarely utilized. Chief among them is the Quad and the belief that India may be newly willing to set itself against China given recent tensions between the world’s two most populous nations.“One of the key objectives is to expand and deepen the foundations of power and influence in the region and we do that best when we are working in concert with allies and partners,” said Rexon Ryu, managing partner of the Asia Group, a Washington-based strategic advisory firm. “It’s less about telling countries what they can’t do in 5G and artificial intelligence but more about what we can do together.”It’s also based on a sense that China has essentially forced the U.S. to start breaking off elements of business and technology relations in a pattern known as decoupling. China has essentially erected its own Internet infrastructure, barring many US media outlets and social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, and has shown a willingness to use the size of its market and its economic might as a weapon to make other nations fall into line.One irony of the state of US-China relations is that for all the traditional hand-wringing in the US about capitalism versus Communism, there’s increasing bipartisan support in Washington for a bigger government role in providing incentives and investments in companies.“In order to compete we’re going to have to change the way we play the game,” said Elizabeth Economy, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. “China’s not going to adapt to the rules of the road as we structured them so we have to adapt.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-putting-tech-over-troops-at-core-of-us-china-policy-101614607366581.html
01-03-2021||World||‘Track, Trace, Expel’: How China treated some foreign journalists in 2020||Working conditions for journalists continued to decline in China in 2020 with the government harassing, intimidating and expelling reporters from the country using all arms of state power, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC) said in its annual report on Monday.The report said China expelled the largest number of foreign journalists since the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 - at least 18 foreign journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post were expelled.“All arms of state power - including surveillance systems introduced to curb coronavirus - were used to harass and intimidate journalists, their Chinese colleagues, and those whom the foreign press sought to interview,” the report said.“Visas became a tit-for-tat fight, as the US government capped visa numbers for Chinese journalists in America, leading to the departure of scores of Chinese, many of whom worked for state media.”Titled “Trace, Trace, Expel: Reporting on China Amid a Pandemic”, the report said that for the third consecutive year, not a single correspondent said working conditions had improved.As many as 150 of 220 correspondent members representing news organisations from 30 countries and regions were interviewed.China, the report added, used the pandemic to control journalists. New surveillance systems and strict controls on movement, implemented for public health reasons, were used to limit foreign journalists, it said.“On many occasions, correspondents were forced to abandon reporting trips after being told to leave or be quarantined on the spot,” the report added.Visa restrictions were also used to put pressure on reporting with at least 13 correspondents given press credentials valid for six months or less. Foreign reporters are usually granted one-year visas to be renewed annually.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin dismissed it as “baseless”.“We always welcome media and journalists from all countries to cover news in China according to the law... what we oppose is ideological bias against China and fake news in the name of press freedom,” Wang was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency on Monday.The Chinese government doesn’t recognise the FCCC and routinely dismisses it’s annual reports on working conditions of journalists in the country.The report said more eyes than ever are trained on China, a rising power whose influence can be felt in every corner of the globe. “China is also slated to host the Winter Olympics in early 2022 – only a year from now. At such a moment, the FCCC urges Chinese authorities to allow foreign journalists to do their jobs - reporting on this extraordinary country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/track-trace-expel-how-china-treated-some-foreign-journalists-in-2020-101614607942425.html
01-03-2021||World||UK factory output grows at slowest since May, consumer lending slides||British manufacturers reported their slowest output growth since May last month, hit by Brexit and Covid-19-related delays, and consumers cut back heavily on borrowing in January as they returned to lockdown.Britain's economy is set to shrink sharply in early 2021 though manufacturers are upbeat about prospects later in the year, when they expect lockdown restrictions to end.The speed of the recovery for households will also be critical. Bank of England data showed consumer borrowing in January suffered its biggest annual decline since records began in 1994, sliding 8.9%.Britain entered a third national lockdown in January, closing schools, non-essential shops, restaurants and most other businesses open to the public, though people can still travel to work if needed.Finance minister Rishi Sunak has announced an extra 5 billion pounds ($7.0 billion) of support for services firms and plans to offer more aid in an annual budget on Wednesday."All eyes are now on Wednesday's budget to see if the chancellor has any surprises up his sleeve that will give the (manufacturing) industry's businesses a boost for the latter part of the year," said Simon Jonsson, a partner at accountants KPMG.The BoE expects the economy to shrink 4% in the first three months of 2021 - a sharper decline than during any quarter of the 2008-09 financial crisis though much less than the 20% drop last spring.The weak consumer borrowing suggests a slump in spending on non-essentials. Official retail sales data showed overall purchases fell by 8.2% in January.Some of the weak borrowing also reflects repayment of loans by better-off households.The BoE expects pent-up household savings to be unleashed when lockdowns end, but the scale of any bounce is uncertain.Manufacturing has fared better than consumer-facing sectors. Nonetheless, February's IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)'s key output component showed growth slipped further after a sharp drop in January."Continued COVID-19 related disruption, now exacerbated by manufacturers' cautious navigation of the new UK-EU trading arrangement, has created a scenario in which logistical and supply-side challenges are limiting the rate of economic recovery," said James Brougham, an economist at industry body Make UK.The broader manufacturing PMI touched a two-month high of 55.1, slightly higher than suggested by a preliminary reading.However, much of the rise reflects longer delivery times and higher costs - which historically were linked with increased activity but more recently have represented a constraint.Confidence for the year ahead was its highest in more than six years. This is despite new post-Brexit customs rules which took effect in January and increased the cost and complexity of trade with the European Union, especially for smaller firms.Materials costs rose at the fastest rate in four years and delivery times lengthened sharply too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-factory-output-grows-at-slowest-since-may-consumer-lending-slides-101614603347274.html

That could include restricting people’s movements, she said.By declaring a state of emergency, the government can use stipulations in the constitution to close bars and stop dining at restaurants serving the public for a three-week period starting March 8. It’s preparing an aid package to the affected businesses.The number and incidence of coronavirus infections have increased fast during February, and mutations may put the health-care system under strain, the government said. The Nordic country has now reported more than 56,000 infections and 742 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-declares-state-of-emergency-as-covid-19-pandemic-intensifies-101614599644125.html
01-03-2021||World||UK's Labour party spokesperson calls Sunak 'economically illiterate'||UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is “economically illiterate,” while his policies have cost jobs and risk strangling the country’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, according to Anneliese Dodds, the opposition Labour party’s finance spokeswoman.Two days before the chancellor is due to deliver his annual budget, Dodds attacked Sunak for overseeing a “year of short-termism” that has led to mass firings, wasted money and uncertainty among businesses and families about support from the government.“After a year of last-minute scrambles, of U-turns, waste and mismanagement, what families and businesses need from the chancellor is a clear plan,” Dodds told a Bloomberg webinar on Monday.She called for a “responsible” budget program rather than continuation of “a rolling cycle of chopping and changing, leaving businesses and families scratching their heads and anxious about what’s coming next.”The chancellor should make his furlough program more flexible, fix gaps in support that means “millions” of people have been excluded, and extend support for people asked to self-isolate because of infection with or exposure to the virus, Dodds said.Sunak has consistently been rated the most popular member of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet after rolling out 300 billion pounds ($418 billion) of spending to fight the coronavirus and support workers through the pandemic. But the UK has also suffered one of the worst economic hits in the world, with output plunging almost 10% last year.Polls still show the Tories remain better rated by voters than Labour on the handling of the economy by a double-digit margin, something Dodds acknowledged as a source of frustration. She said that Sunak’s successive short-term extensions of his furlough program have led to tens of thousands of redundancies.The ‘Sunak Effect’“While he dithers and delays, people right across the country lose their jobs,” she said. “Coronavirus may have closed large parts of our economy. But this government crashed it.”The Treasury didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Conservative government’s willingness to boost public spending during the pandemic has deprived Labour of one of its traditional lines of attack, and even earned Sunak praise at one point from Len McCluskey, the left-wing leader of the Unite Union.The chancellor now faces the thornier and less popular task of unwinding his support programs as the government starts to lift the restrictions it imposed to contain the outbreak. The prime minister has said he hopes the last businesses will be able to reopen from June 21.‘Spectacularly Unjust’With the government’s assistance programs due to end in March and April, Dodds called for Sunak to extend measures including the furlough program, a business rates holiday, as well as a reduction in value-added tax. She also questioned his decision in November to freeze the pay of millions of public sector workers.“That is spectacularly unjust. It’s also economically illiterate,” Dodds said. “If you take money out of people’s pockets, they’ll tighten their belts and spend less.”The chancellor gave a series of interviews at the weekend in which he hinted at the need for tax rises to close a peacetime record budget deficit, while promising to keep supporting companies and workers through the pandemic.Sunak Hints at UK Tax Rises and Vows to Maintain Covid SupportOfficials have suggested US plans to raise corporate taxes give the UK scope to do likewise, while still retaining the lowest rates in the Group of Seven major industrialized economies. UK media have also suggested Sunak may freeze the thresholds at which different rates of income tax kick in, drawing hundreds of thousands of Britons into higher tax brackets.“Now is not the time for tax rises on struggling businesses or families,” Dodds said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-labour-party-spokesperson-calls-sunak-economically-illiterate-101614604952949.html
01-03-2021||World||Germany's Merkel faces growing pressure to ease Covid-19 curbs||Chancellor Angela Merkel faces further pressure to lay out a path to ease Germany’s coronavirus lockdown after Finance Minister Olaf Scholz became the latest senior official to call for a quicker reopening of Europe’s largest economy.Scholz -- the vice chancellor and the Social Democratic candidate to succeed Merkel in September’s election -- threw his weight behind proposals to step away from a reliance on using the seven-day incidence rate to manage Germany’s pandemic.As more aggressive variants spread, the measure of new infections has been inching up, moving the country further away from targets Merkel has set for loosening curbs. Her coronavirus cabinet, which includes Scholz, is meeting on Monday to prepare for a critical meeting with state leaders on Wednesday.Increased testing “must have an impact on what is possible in terms of moves to open up,” Scholz said late Sunday in an interview with the Bild newspaper. “It’s not going to happen all at once, but there must be a step-by-step process that everyone can understand.”To facilitate a faster reopening, he said he wants companies to test workers and citizens to be able to get free Covid-19 checks. His comments indicate a growing consensus in Germany to move away from the incidence rate to determine pandemic policy.Merkel opened the door to the move last week, saying testing could create a “buffer” to allow for opening above her target of 35 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The figure rose to 65.8 on Monday, according to the RKI public health institute.Helge Braun, Merkel’s chief of staff, said Sunday the government is planning to test “significantly more than we have done so far” to help prevent another wave of infections as curbs are lifted.While some children have returned to schools and hairdressers were allowed to reopen on Monday, most of Germany’s lockdown restrictions remain in place. With the pandemic-weary public growing restless ahead of national elections, officials are keen to ease the strain.Markus Soeder -- Bavaria’s premier and a potential chancellor candidate for Merkel’s conservative bloc -- on Monday discussed strategies for tackling the pandemic together with his counterpart from the state of Saxony, warning against a hasty opening.Germany’s infection fell steadily after peaking just before Christmas, but the downward trend has been halted for around two weeks, prompting fears that more virulent strains of the disease could trigger another surge in cases.With the country’s inoculation campaign slowly ramping up, the country’s STIKO vaccination committee is poised to reconsider its decision not to recommend the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine for people aged 65 and older.“There will be a new updated recommendation very soon,” STIKO head Thomas Mertens said at the weekend. Last month, Germany decided to keep it’s recommendation for the vaccine to be administered only to people aged 18-64, saying there were insufficient data on its effectiveness for older recipients.The situation across the European Union is looking increasingly alarming, after a stuttering start to the bloc’s vaccination campaign. Italy is tightening restrictions in Milan, Turin and other areas, the Czech Republic will impose its toughest lockdown yet, and Germany introduced a test requirement at its border with the French Moselle region to tackle the spread of mutations.Austria’s government is meeting with scientists, opposition parties and provincial governors in Vienna on Monday to discuss how to proceed. Since Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s administration eased a strict lockdown three weeks ago, the incidence rate jumped to 162 from around 100 in early February, making the widepspread reopening of restaurants, cafes and hotels before Easter unlikely.EU health ministers will hold a video call later on Monday and the European Commission will urge them to massively scale up testing and genome sequencing for virus variants.While arguing for a cautions lifting of restrictions, Scholz warned that Germany shouldn’t move too fast and risk having to reimpose lockdown measures.“What we cannot allow is an opening up and then shortly after have to close down again because we have miscalculated and the infection rates are rising dramatically again,” Scholz said. “But if we can somehow stabilize things and improve the situation with the help of tests and progress on vaccination, then we have more options.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-merkel-faces-growing-pressure-to-ease-covid-19-curbs-101614591414702.html
01-03-2021||World||Ex-French President Sarkozy found guilty of corruption||Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty by a Paris court of corruption after he offered to pull strings to help a magistrate land a prestigious job in return for a favor.The 66-year-old was also sentenced to a one-year prison term, though under the French system he’s unlikely to serve it, even if he fails to overturn the verdict on appeal.“Sarkozy used his status as former French president,” said Presiding Judge Christine Mée on Monday as she read out the court’s decision. She said the wrongdoing he committed was “particularly serious.”The conviction of Sarkozy -- who still enjoys some popularity in the nation -- is another setback to a political career that stuttered after his failed 2012 re-election bid. The judgment puts the former president on the back-foot weeks before he’s due back in court on separate charges that he illegally exceeded campaign-spending limits ahead of his electoral defeat.He isn’t the first former French president to go on trial in modern times. But the late Jacques Chirac was too sick to attend court before he was found guilty in 2011 of misusing Paris city funds.Aside from the one-year jail term, the judges also gave Sarkozy a two-year suspended sentence.The other defendants -- Sarkozy’s lawyer and the former magistrate -- both received the same sentences as the former president.Defendants aren’t normally incarcerated if the non-suspended portion of their sentence isn’t longer than two years. They typically have to wear electronic bracelets and obey a curfew instead. Additionally, appealing a first-instance sentence suspends its execution.Monday’s judgment centers on tapped phone calls of Sarkozy dating back to 2014, after he’d left high office.Sarkozy was heard telling his lawyer that he would put in a good word to help the now-retired magistrate Gilbert Azibert clinch a sought-after position in Monaco if he helped in a legal fight to stop investigators using the former president’s diaries.In court, Sarkozy had dismissed the conversations at “chatter” that was misinterpreted by prosecutors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exfrench-president-sarkozy-found-guilty-of-corruption-101614605198440.html

The survey asked 1,127 adults in the UK and 1,005 in the US and got similar results. The research also added that the proportion of people attracted towards the opposite sex increases with age. According to the survey, 76 per cent of people aged between 41 to 54 were solely attracted to the opposite sex and 81 per cent of 55 to 75 year old gave the same answer.This shows changing ideas of sexuality and increasing acceptability towards different sexual preferences in both the countries.Expert in the psychology of sexual orientation at Trent University in Ontario, Canada, Karen Blair told the Times that the increase shows the ease that young people feel to reveal their sexual preferences. “The increases at least partially represent an increase in willingness and ability to come out. Each recent generation has faced fewer and fewer external pressures to conform to heterosexuality.”Gallup survey in the USA Gallup survey done in the US this week had found that a record 5.6 percent of Americans identify themselves as LGBTQ, of which the majority said that they identified as bisexual. The survey also showed a 1.1 percent increase in the people identifying as LGBTQ which is the largest increase since the survey began in 2012.The results, based on more than 15,000 interviews conducted throughout 2020 with Americans aged 18 and older, found that younger generations were more likely to say that they are LGBTQ with one in six adults aged between 18 and 23 identifying as such. This number dropped to less than two per cent in respondents who were born before 1965.The survey also revealed that of those interviewed 11.7 per cent identified as lesbian and 11.3 per cent as transgender. According to the survey, women are more likely than men to identify as LGBTQ as 6.4 per cent women identified as LGBTQ as opposed to 4.9 per cent men. Political differences also influenced this choice as according to the survey 13 per cent of liberals, 4.4 per cent of moderates and only 2.3 per cent of conservatives identified as LGBTQ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/generational-gap-what-2-surveys-in-uk-and-us-reveal-about-sexual-attraction-identity-101614604218512.html

Iran, he added, “is Israel’s greatest enemy and we are striking it across the region.”Late Sunday, Syria reported that it was dealing with an Israeli missile attack on targets near Damascus. Israeli media said the Israeli air force attacked Iranian targets in response to the assault on the ship. The military had no comment.The Israeli-owned car carrier, which was flying a Bahamas flag, was struck by an unexplained explosion near the Strait of Hormuz. None of its crew was hurt and the ship proceeded to Dubai for repairs.The Associated Press, citing two unidentified American defense officials, said the vessel sustained two holes on its port side and two holes on its starboard side just above the waterline.Frictions between the enemies have been high as the Biden administration explores rejoining the Iran nuclear deal, which Netanyahu opposes. Iran has accused Israel of sabotaging a nuclear facility in July, and of killing a top Iranian nuclear scientist in November, an assassination it has vowed to avenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-pm-netanyahu-accuses-iran-of-attacking-israeli-ship-in-persian-gulf-101614582201580.html

01-03-2021||World||Defying deadly crackdown, crowds again protest Myanmar coup||Police in Myanmar’s biggest city fired tear gas Monday at defiant crowds who returned to the streets to protest last month's coup, despite reports that security forces had killed at least 18 people a day earlier.The protesters in Yangon were chased as they tried to gather at their usual meeting spot at the Hledan Center intersection. Demonstrators scattered and sought in vain to rinse the irritating gas from their eyes, but later regrouped.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar after five decades of military rule. It came Feb. 1, the same day a newly elected Parliament was supposed to take office. Ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s party would have led that government, but instead she was detained along with President Win Myint and other senior officials.The army has leveled several charges against Suu Kyi — an apparent effort by the military to provide a legal veneer for her detention and potentially to bar her from running in the election the junta has promised to hold in one year. On Monday, Suu Kyi made a court appearance via videoconference and was charged with two more offenses, her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters.Accused of inciting unrest, she was charged under a law that dates from British colonial days and has long been criticized as a vaguely defined catch-all law that inhibits freedom of expression. That charge carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The other charge from Monday carries a one-year sentence.Following her detention on the day of the coup, the 75-year-old Suu Kyi was initially held at her residence in the capital of Naypyitaw, but members of her National League for Democracy party now say they don't know where she is.Since the takeover, a movement of protests in cities across the country has been growing — and the junta's response has become increasingly violent.The UN said it had “credible information” that at least 18 people were killed and 30 were wounded across Myanmar on Sunday. Counts from other sources, such the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent television and online news outlet, put the death toll in the 20s.Any of the reports would make it the highest single-day death toll since the military takeover. The junta has also made mass arrests, and the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported that as many as 1,000 people were detained Sunday, though it has only confirmed 270 of those. Several journalists have been among those detained, including one for The Associated Press.At least five people are believed to have been killed Sunday in Yangon when police shot at protesters, who have remained non-violent despite provocation from the security forces and pro-military counter-demonstrators.People erected makeshift sidewalk shrines Monday at the spots where several of the victims were shot and also paid their respects by standing outside the hospitals where the bodies were being released to families.In Dawei, a small city in southeastern Myanmar where an estimated five people were killed Sunday, the number of protesters on the streets Monday was lower than usual. Marchers there split into smaller groups, parading through the city to the applause of bystanders who also made the three-finger salutes adopted by the resistance movement to show their support.Confirming the deaths of protesters has been difficult amid the chaos and general lack of news from official sources, especially in areas outside Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw. But in many cases, there was evidence posted online such as videos of shootings, photos of bullet casings collected afterwards and gruesome pictures of bodies.In a statement published Monday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper, Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry declared that the junta “is exercising utmost restraint to avoid the use of force in managing the violent protests systematically, in accordance with domestic and international laws in order to keep minimum casualties.”But UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the crackdown, calling the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters and arbitrary arrests “unacceptable,” and expressed serious concern at the increase in deaths and serious injuries, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.“What the world is watching in Myanmar is outrageous and unacceptable,” the UN’s independent expert on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a separate statement. “Words of condemnation are necessary and welcome but insufficient. The world must act. We must all act.”He proposed that countries could institute a global embargo on the sale of arms to Myanmar, “tough targeted and coordinated sanctions” against those responsible for the coup, the crackdown and other rights abuses, and sanctions against the business interests of the military.Social media posts from Myanmar have increasingly urged the international community to invoke the doctrine of the “responsibility to protect” to intervene directly to restrain the junta.Any kind of coordinated measures, however, would be difficult to implement as two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and Russia, would almost certainly veto them on the basis of being opposed to interference in the internal affairs of other countries.In Washington, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan issued a statement saying the US is “alarmed” by the violence and stands in solidarity with Myanmar's people, “who continue to bravely voice their aspirations for democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights.”Washington has imposed sanctions on Myanmar because of the coup, and Sullivan said it would “impose further costs on those responsible,” promising details “in the coming days.”Security forces began employing rougher tactics on Saturday, taking preemptive action to break up protests and make mass arrests. Many of those detained were taken to Insein Prison in Yangon’s northern outskirts, historically notorious for holding political prisoners.Among the arrests made Sunday, the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners was able to identify about 270 people, bringing to 1,132 the total number of people the group has confirmed being arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.An AP journalist was taken into police custody on Saturday morning while providing news coverage of the protests. The journalist, Thein Zaw, remains in police custody.The AP called for his immediate release.“Independent journalists must be allowed to freely and safely report the news without fear of retribution. AP decries in the strongest terms the arbitrary detention of Thein Zaw,” said Ian Phillips, the AP's vice president for international news. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Myanmar also condemned the arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-deadly-crackdown-crowds-again-protest-myanmar-coup-101614602378545.html
01-03-2021||World||Nepal worried about future supply of Covid-19 vaccines||Nepal has had a successful start of its Covid-19 vaccination campaign, but authorities are worried about future supplies as the country competes with dozens of other nations for much-sought vaccines produced by a handful of manufacturers.The government is negotiating with India's Serum Institute to obtain 5 million doses for the second stage of the campaign, in which 3.7 million elderly people are to be inoculated starting this weekend, Health Minister Hridayesh Tripathi said Monday.Nepal received a gift from the Indian government in January of 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine manufactured under license by India's Serum Institute. Nepal also purchased another 2 million doses from the company at a subsidised rate with the help of the Indian government."There is huge worldwide demand for vaccines from a handful of companies and we could be at the very end of the list,” Tripathi said. “So far, we have been able to get vaccines with both political and administrative help from India. However, I am very worried now.”He said he is hopeful that Indian authorities will again help their small northern neighbour.“We will not be able to get the vaccine through simple commercial deals with the company because we are competing with dozens of other countries, so we need the influence of the (Indian) government,” he said.Nepal is also receiving a gift of 500,000 doses of a Chinese vaccine this month. Tripathi, however, said Nepal has not decided whether to purchase more of it.“The AstraZenneca vaccine is the one preferred by the world and also approved and recommended by the World Health Organization,” he said.Russia has also offered to provide 25 million doses of its Sputnik vaccine, but Nepal has asked for additional documents before it can start reviewing it, he said.Nepal has also been promised 2.25 million vaccine doses under COVAX, the ambitious WHO programme to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world's poorest people, of which 300,000 doses are likely to arrive later this month.Tripathi said the government is targeting the inoculation of the country's entire adult population by September.Nepal has reported 274,216 Covid-19 cases, including 2,777 deaths.Health officials are worried that there could be a new wave of infections because of a series of political rallies by tens of thousand of demonstrators over Parliament's dissolution by President Khadga Prasad Oli last December and its restatement by the Supreme Court last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-worried-about-future-supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-101614601948655.html
01-03-2021||World||Voting rights challenged at US Supreme Court as states change rules||Voting-rights advocates are worried as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in an Arizona case that could undercut the landmark law that’s protected the rights of minorities at the polls for a half century.Tuesday’s clash over the 1965 Voting Rights Act comes as Republican-controlled states consider a barrage of new restrictions that could make it harder for minorities to cast ballots in 2022 elections. It follows November’s presidential contest in which Donald Trump refused to concede and instead made baseless assertions of widespread fraud.And the case comes before a Supreme Court that, bolstered by three Trump appointees, has only grown more conservative since it nullified a key component of the law in 2013.“The court could decide this in a number of ways which could include weakening or limiting” the law, said Myrna Perez, a voting rights litigator at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice.The case centers on the law’s Section 2, a provision that’s now the primary tool for challenging voting laws as discriminatory. Section 2 took on heightened importance after the high court’s 2013 Shelby County decision effectively killed a separate section that had required some states to get federal clearance before they changed their voting rules.A federal appeals court invoked Section 2 to invalidate two Arizona policies as having a disproportionate impact on minority voters. The San Francisco-based court struck down a law that made it a crime for most people to collect or deliver another person’s early ballot, a practice critics call “ballot harvesting.” The appeals court also voided Arizona’s longstanding policy of rejecting ballots cast in the wrong precinct.In addition, the majority said the ballot-collection law amounted to intentional discrimination, violating both Section 2 and the Constitution’s 15th Amendment.Racial Disparities“Both restrictions disparately impact minority voters, who disproportionately rely on ballot collection and are twice as likely as white voters to vote out-of-precinct,” according to a brief from the Democratic National Committee, which is challenging the rules. “These disparities are directly attributable to the ongoing effects of Arizona’s documented history of racial discrimination.”But Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, said in an interview the rules don’t deprive anyone of an equal opportunity to cast a ballot.“Arizona, like a lot of states, has common-sense measures designed to protect the integrity of the ballot and the election process,” said Brnovich, who will be arguing for the state on Tuesday. “And you have out-of-state, left-wing groups that are trying to undermine or challenge those rules and regulations.”The argument will be the Supreme Court’s first on election law since the 2020 presidential vote, and the first with three appointees of the losing candidate, Trump. The court is scheduled to rule by June.The case will be as much about the method the court uses as the outcome. The court has never said what standard should apply when Section 2 is invoked to challenge laws that make it harder for minorities to register and vote.Section 2 bars any voting practice that “results in a denial or abridgement” of the right to vote based on race. The measure says courts should look at the “totality of the circumstances” to determine whether some groups “have less opportunity” to participate than other voters.No Biden BriefA lineup of litigants, also including the Arizona Republican Party and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, is presenting the court with an array of tests to implement those words.The Trump administration proposed its own standard before leaving office, and argued for upholding the rules, but President Joe Biden’s administration withdrew the brief this month. The new administration said it agreed that the Arizona restrictions were valid, while disavowing the legal standard the Trump team had urged.“Even the Biden Department of Justice agrees that Arizona’s voting laws don’t violate the Voting Rights Act,” Brnovich said.The new administration chose not to file its own brief and, in a rarity for a Voting Rights Act case, won’t be arguing on Tuesday.The Brennan Center, which filed a brief opposing the Arizona rules, says legislators around the country have introduced more than 165 bills this year to restrict voting access, more than four times the number from a year ago. The swing states of Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia have the largest number of pending bills, according to the policy institute.If those laws can’t be challenged under Section 2, “it would be taking away one of the big tools, in fact the main tool we have left now, to protect voters against racial discrimination,” Perez said.The cases are Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, 19-1257, and Arizona Republican Party v.

01-03-2021||World||Some local Beijing communities start giving elderly Covid-19 shots||Some local communities in Beijing have started giving Covid-19 vaccine doses to people older than 60, even as the city's disease-control authorities publicly advises this age group against inoculation.In some countries, including the United States and Britain, people older than 65 are among top priority groups in their Covid-19 vaccination rollouts, as the elderly have a higher risk of death and hospitalisation after contracting the virus compared to younger adults.China's vaccination program, under which 40.5 million doses had been administered as of Feb. 9, excludes those ages above 59 and those younger than 18, with Chinese vaccine makers citing less complete clinical trial data for minors and the elderly.According to notices from staffers of a few communities in Beijing's central Dongcheng district, seen by Reuters, residents older than 60 can go to designated sites to get their shots, without disclosing which the four China-developed vaccines would be available. The vaccinations are not mandatory.However, an article published online by the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control on Sunday categorised these older than 60 as unsuitable for vaccination, in line with national guidelines.It is unclear why the Dongcheng district was telling the elderly to be vaccinated.The city is not fighting the spread of any Covid-19 cluster. Beijing last reported a local case on Jan. 29.China is due to kick off its annual meeting of parliament on Friday, when thousands of delegates from across the country will gather in Beijing.The information office of Beijing Municipal People's Government didn't immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.China has four locally developed vaccines approved for general public vaccination, including two from China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), one from Sinovac Biotech and one from CanSino Biologics Inc (CanSinoBIO), all of which have been used in smaller-scale vaccination programmes before clearance for wider use.The formal approvals for vaccines from CanSinoBIO and Sinovac were for people older than 18, without age cap, according to company statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-local-beijing-communities-start-giving-elderly-covid-19-shots-101614585781623.html

A previous investigation by New South Wales police was suspended after the alleged victim committed suicide last year.According to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the rape happened in Sydney in 1988."The individual involved here has vigorously rejected these allegations. And so, it's a matter for the police," Morrison told reporters in Sydney.Australian Federal Police confirmed they had received the complaint but declined any further comment.Morrison said the minister would keep his cabinet position, pending the outcome of the police investigation.Opposition lawmakers have called on Morrison to suspend the minister pending an investigation.The allegation comes as Morrison's government is under public pressure after three former staff members of his ruling Liberal party said they had been raped by an unidentified colleague.One victim who went public with her allegations has made an official police complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-prime-minister-morrison-stands-by-minister-accused-of-rape-101614584190654.html

As a starting point, Iran wants the U.S. to lift sanctions that Trump reimposed, stifling oil exports and hurting the economy. Biden wants the Islamic Republic to first resume its compliance with the multilateral agreement that seeks to curb its nuclear program.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested last month that European Union foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell “choreograph the actions that are needed to be taken by the U.S. and the actions needed to be taken by Iran.”Zarif’s comments had raised the prospect that the two sides could take synchronized steps to return to the deal. Informal talks had been expected to take place this month.Raising the barrier to diplomacy, Iran has restricted snap international inspections of its nuclear sites, providing access only for an additional three-month period under an arrangement with the global atomic watchdog announced Sunday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nuclear-deal-time-not-ripe-for-talks-with-us-and-europe-says-iran-101614592773771.html
01-03-2021||World||Donald Trump raises climate issue; says India, China, Russia not clean||In his first public speech since leaving the White House, former US president Donald Trump has raised the climate issue while criticising his successor Joe Biden for rejoining the "very unfair" Paris Agreement, saying what good does it do when America is "clean" but China, Russia and India are not.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Committee in Orlando, Florida on Sunday, the 74-year-old leader, who left the White House on January 20, came down heavily on the Biden administration for putting the “United States back into the very unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord without negotiating a better deal”.“First of all, China does not kick in for 10 years, Russia goes by an old standard which was not a clean standard… but we get hit right from the beginning when it costs us hundreds of thousands and millions of jobs, it was a disaster... but they go back in.“We have the cleanest air and cleanest water… and what good does it do when we're clean, but China is not and Russia is not and India is not, so they are pouring fumes... you know the world is a small piece of the universe and we're trying to protect everything,” Trump said amidst applause from his supporters.On February 19, the US officially returned to the historic Paris climate accord, 107 days after it left at the behest of former president Trump.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had termed that decision as a “major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.”In the past also, Trump has criticised China, India and Russia for pollution.In October last year, he accused China, India and Russia of not taking care of their "filthy air" as he justified America's withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate agreement.“Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. The air is filthy," Trump had said during the final presidential debate with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden in Nashville, Tennessee.Days earlier while speaking to his cheering supporters at an election rally in North Carolina, he had blamed countries like China, Russia and India for adding to the global air pollution and asserted that his country has the best environmental numbers.China is the world's biggest carbon emitter followed by the US, India and the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-raises-climate-issue-says-india-china-russia-not-clean-101614594447365.html

"I feel ready to go.”She was expected to meet staffers and speak briefly with non-governmental groups that support a key fisheries reform proposal being discussed at the WTO, before attending her first meeting of the General Council — made up of envoys from the international trade body's 164 member states.Some of those meetings with will be limited because of measures to fight Covid-19, and the closed-door General Council meeting is to be largely by videoconference.Okonjo-Iweala's victory in a hotly contested race last fall was delayed largely because the US administration under Donald Trump supported another candidate. Her appointment came through last month when the Biden administration cleared the way for her selection at the trade body, whose rules require consensus.The WTO, which works to craft accords that can ensure smooth international trade, is facing headwinds such as rising protectionism. Its dispute settlement system has been blocked because the United States has almost singlehandedly prevented appointments to its Appellate Body — a rough equivalent to an appeals court.Okonjo-Iweala said last month that “wide-ranging reforms” are needed at the WTO, and that her first priority would be to address the economic and health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic — such as by working to lift export restrictions on supplies and vaccines to get them distributed to countries in need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wtos-first-female-director-general-arrives-for-1st-day-on-job-101614594149673.html

They will confer again on Wednesday to decide how to proceed with the rest of Germany’s coronavirus restrictions, which at present run until March 7.Some states also allowed businesses such as florists and hardware stores to open on Monday. Most stores have been closed nationwide since Dec. 16. Restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities have been closed since Nov. 2 and hotels are allowed only to accommodate business travelers.There are increasing calls for restrictions to be further relaxed, but also a desire to remain cautious. A steady decline in infection figures has stalled, and even been reversed in some areas, as a more contagious variant first discovered in Britain spreads.“This week will set the course for the coming months,” Bavarian governor Markus Soeder, an advocate in recent months of a cautious approach, said. He called the virus situation “unstable.”“It's really important that we make smart decisions this week,” he said. “Smart decisions means that the mood must be taken on board — we must find the right balance between caution and opening, and we absolutely must not lose our nerves ... and simply fulfil all wishes.”Germany’s disease control center reported 4,732 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, compared with 4,369 a week earlier. Another 60 deaths were reported, bringing the total to 70,105.Germany had given 4.7% of its population a first vaccine shot as of Friday, while 2.4% had received a second jab — relatively slow progress that has drawn sharp criticism.Bavaria and two neighboring states plan to give a total 15,000 doses of vaccine to the neighboring Czech Republic, which currently has the highest infection rate in the European Union.Soeder said the “symbolic measure” ultimately helps Germany, because Czech authorities want to use it in high-risk areas near the frontier and vaccinate cross-border commuters.___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-considers-way-ahead-on-covid-19-as-hairdressers-open-across-country-101614592713737.html
01-03-2021||World||UK seeks person infected with Brazilian coronavirus variant||The UK is trying to trace a person infected with a Brazilian variant of the coronavirus that authorities say may be more resistant to vaccines.Six cases of the mutation, which originated in the Amazonian city of Manaus, have been detected in the UK, Public Health England said on Sunday. While five have been found, the identity of the final patient is still unknown because they failed to complete a test registration card, leaving health officials without the information needed to find them.Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi toured the broadcast studios on Monday morning to appeal to anyone who took a Covid-19 test on February 12 or 13 and hasn’t yet had a result to contact the National Health Service. He told Times Radio that the authorities are working with the postal system to try to identify the missing patient.The arrival of the variant in the UK opens the government up to criticism about its quarantine policy, which was finally introduced on February 15 -- several weeks after scientists said blanket restrictions were needed. Compulsory hotel quarantine is now in place for arrivals from 33 countries and territories, including Brazil, while those coming from elsewhere are asked to isolate at home.The latest “variant has been designated ‘of concern’ as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa,” PHE said. “It is possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this.”Health officials are contacting all passengers on the February 10 Swiss Air flight LX318 from Sao Paulo to London Heathrow via Zurich in order to test them and their households, PHE said.Zahawi said surge testing is also taking place in Gloucestershire -- where two of the cases were detected -- as a precaution.“There’s minimal reason to believe that there may be further spread because they have been isolating correctly,” he told Sky News.He defended the UK’s border policy, saying that even in Australia, which has a stricter regime, authorities have had to deal with variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-person-infected-with-brazilian-coronavirus-variant-101614591975502.html

With the third vaccine, the US eyes deliveries of J&J vaccine on Tuesday with the aim of boosting the country’s vaccination drive.The United States reported 51,204 new Covid-19 cases and 1,097 related deaths on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University, taking the national tally to 28,605,669 and the death toll to 513,091 since the pandemic began. At least 96,402,490 vaccine doses have been distributed and at least 75,236,003 doses have been administered, according to CDC. At least 49,772,180 people have received one or more doses of the vaccine and at least 24,779,920 people have received two doses.Read more: US children could receive coronavirus vaccine by year-end: Anthony FauciAlthough there has been a decrease in the number of new cases recorded, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, said that the baseline is too high warning that some Americans are easing up on safety measures too soon, thus threatening the same post-dip surges that the US suffered in 2020.Read more: Fauci worried that US coronavirus cases will stick at 70,000 a dayThe US also faces the challenge of increased spread of Covid-19 variant strains as the country reported at least 2,463 cases of coronavirus variants that were first spotted in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, according to CDC.

01-03-2021||World||China still has ‘major concerns’ about Boeing’s 737 Max planes||China still has major safety concerns about Boeing Co.’s 737 Max, the deputy head of the country’s aviation regulator said Monday when asked if it was considering following others in allowing the plane to fly again.Once issues have been fully addressed, China will conduct a final review of the aircraft, Dong Zhiyi said at a briefing in Beijing. Authorities have been in “full communication” with Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, he said.China, a crucial market for Boeing and the Max, was the first country to impose a ban on the aircraft after a crash in Ethiopia in March 2019 that killed 157 people. The previous October, a Max jet operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea, claiming 189 lives. Both disasters were partly blamed on software that pushed the planes into nosedives.Other nations followed China’s lead on the flight ban, resulting in the Max being grounded globally for about 20 months. Several countries have certified it to fly again in recent months and it is back in service in places including the U.S., Europe and Brazil. Australia lifted its ban on the plane last week, as did Saudi Arabia on Monday, state media reported. But China hasn’t budged.A spokesman for Boeing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Boeing’s China orders largely dried up in the past four years amid heightened tension between Washington and Beijing around trade and other areas, as well as concern over the Max, which was a best-seller.“I do believe that when a constructive relationship is begun, then things will quiet down and the Chinese will want to get airplanes,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun said in December, the same month the Max returned to commercial service in the U.S. for the first time since the grounding.China has three main criteria that need to be met before allowing the Max to fly again: changes in design aimed at fixing the plane’s problems need to be approved by China, pilots need to be retrained to fly the jetliners following those changes, and the conclusions from the Ethiopian and Indonesian crash reports need to be clear.The nation’s major carriers -- Air China Ltd., China Southern Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. -- are all Max customers, along with about 10 other Chinese airlines.In its latest outlook on the Chinese market, Boeing said the country will continue to be the main driver of the aviation industry’s worldwide growth over the next 20 years. China’s airlines are likely to buy 8,600 new airplanes worth $1.4 trillion during the period, the U.S. manufacturer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-still-has-major-concerns-about-boeing-s-737-max-planes-101614591921025.html

At the time, Islamabad's agreeing to pay a higher price had drawn criticism from experts.Many Pakistanis have been rallying, angry over long power cuts in the summer and shortages of natural gas in winter, to demand an uninterrupted supply of electricity and gas. Khan's government has said it was trying its best to overcome an energy shortfall through different measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hopeful-of-saving-3-billion-in-10-years-with-qatar-new-gas-deal-101614589705338.html
01-03-2021||World||Clock is ticking for Joe Biden if he wants to salvage the nuclear deal with Iran||US President Joe Biden has stressed many times that the US will return to the nuclear deal reached in 2015 with Iran -officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - provided that Iran complies with the terms of the deal.For his part, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Tehran would only return to compliance if the US first lifted economic sanctions. However, time is running out and Biden has to act quickly, as there are various developments - such as new restrictions imposed by Iran on UN inspections- that make the reaching of an agreement on the subject very urgent.This is a concern shared by the EU foreign policy Chief Josep Borel, as coordinator of the JCPOA, who stressed last Friday that "we do have a diplomatic window of opportunity to focus on solutions to bring back on track in order for everybody to fulfil their commitments."The US and EU imposed sanctions on Iran in 2010, as there were fears that Iran's nuclear programme was used as a cover to build nuclear weapons. In 2015 Iran reached an agreement with the US, China, Russia, UK, France and Germany, imposing restrictions on uranium enrichment and the type of centrifuges used for enrichment, as well as allowing international inspections of its nuclear facilities, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.Ignoring the opposition of the international community, in May 2018 former US president Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement and imposed draconian sanctions on Iran which had a devastating effect on the country's economy. Responding, the Iranian regime, exceeded the limits set for uranium enrichment and on stockpiles and operated banned centrifuges.Joe Biden in his presidential campaign clearly supported a return to diplomacy with Iran, but the big question now is who will make the first move. Iran insists that the US lift Trump's sanctions first and be compensated for the hardship it suffered as a result of the crippling sanctions, while the US clearly demands that Iran must return to compliance with JCPOA first.Under a law passed by the Iranian Parliament last December, as from February 23, Tehran will stop allowing short notice "intrusive" inspections of sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency", unless there is an easing of US sanctions. It also said it would erase surveillance footage of its nuclear facilities. This, of course, makes the need to reach an agreement on reviving the JCPOA quite urgent.An incident, which aggravated the existing difficulties for the resumption of negotiations was the recent rocket attack by Iran's proxies on US-led forces in northern Iraq, in which a civilian contractor was killed and a US soldier was injured. The US retaliated in a predawn attack on Friday when two US warplanes destroyed nine buildings and damaged two others at a camp used by Iranian-backed militants. Asked what message he was sending to Iran with the airstrike in Syria, Biden told reporters: "You can't act with impunity. Be careful."Another factor that the Biden administration has to take into account is the fact that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a moderate, will not stand as a candidate in the elections scheduled for next June and he may be succeeded by a hardliner who much more hostile to the West.It seems that the Biden Administration has decided to take a two-step process on the nuclear deal. First to stop Iran's acceleration of nuclear activities, by lifting some sanctions and convince Tehran to return to ICPOA and then reach a more comprehensive follow-up agreement, with the new Iranian government.As Dr Ezgi Uzun, of Sabanci University, points out: "The follow-up agreement envisages the negotiation of the collective package of issues (including the Ballistic Missile Programme, Iran's Shia militia recruitment activities in the Middle East and relations with other countries in the region, all irreversibly brought to the world agenda by the Trump Administration, in addition to the nuclear program) on an international platform that will bring together the US, EU, Iran and several other countries in the region. The Biden administration is waiting for the elections in June for the follow-up agreement."It should be stressed, however, that there are people who say that it is not a good idea to include other issues, such as ballistic missiles, Iran proxies etc, as this will harm the chances of reaching an agreement. Josep Borrell, the EU's High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, told the Atlantic Council on February 23, that "maybe there are other issues that have to be taken into consideration, but don't put everything together at the same time. Then you are going to block the process... if you start talking about pending issues in the beginning, you will never restart."Ali Reza Eshraghi, a visiting scholar at the UNC Center for the Middle East says: "It is highly unlikely that the US and Europe will be able to strike a broader agreement with Iran unless they first rejoin the original JCPOA - under either the current or next government in Tehran. The longer the US takes to rejoin the JCPOA, the greater the support in Tehran for accelerating the Iranian nuclear programme. In the coming weeks, European and US efforts should focus on a swift return to the JCPOA rather than holding out for the unlikely prospect of a new nuclear formula with Iran."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clock-is-ticking-for-joe-biden-if-he-wants-to-salvage-the-nuclear-deal-with-iran-101614588730583.html

They are more confident and independent."The Chinese Embassy's post was later removed by Twitter after it drew ire and calls for removal given the Chinese government's oppressive campaign against Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.The Chinese government has increased its "groundless prosecutions" with long prison sentences for Uyghurs and other minority communities in recent years in China's Xinjiang province, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).HRW, a non-governmental body that conducts research and advocacy on human rights last week had said since the Chinese government escalated its repressive "Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism" in late 2016, the region's formal criminal justice system has convicted and sentenced more than 250,000 people."While few verdicts and other official documents are publicly available due to Xinjiang authorities' tight control of information, a Human Rights Watch analysis of nearly 60 of these cases suggests that many people have been convicted and imprisoned without committing a genuine offence," HRW said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xinjiangs-birth-rate-drops-sharply-as-focus-grows-on-uyghur-genocide-101614588345690.html
01-03-2021||World||US wasted billions on cars, buildings in Afghanistan: Report||The United States wasted billions of dollars in war-torn Afghanistan on buildings and vehicles that were either abandoned or destroyed, according to a report released Monday by a U.S. government watchdog.The agency said it reviewed $7.8 billion spent since 2008 on buildings and vehicles. Only $343.2 million worth of buildings and vehicles “were maintained in good condition,” said the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, which oversees American taxpayer money spent on the protracted conflict.The report said that just $1.2 billion of the $7.8 billion went to pay for buildings and vehicles that were used as intended.“The fact that so many capital assets wound up not used, deteriorated or abandoned should have been a major cause of concern for the agencies financing these projects," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general, said in his report.The U.S. public is weary of the nearly 20-year-old war and President Joe Biden is reviewing a peace deal his predecessor, Donald Trump, signed with the Taliban a year ago. He must decide whether to withdraw all troops by May 1, as promised in the deal, or stay and possibly prolong the war. Officials say no decision has been made but on Monday, Washington's peace envoy and the American who brokered the U.S.-Taliban deal, Zalmay Khalilzad, was back in the Afghan capital for a tour of the region.Taliban insurgents and the Afghan government have been holding on-again-off-again talks in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar but a deal that could bring peace to Afghanistan after 40 years of relentless war seems far off.After Kabul, Khalilzad will travel to Qatar's capital of Doha and neighboring countries, including Pakistan, to push anew for progress in the Doha talks and a cease-fire to end the relentless violence.Analyst Bill Roggio of the Long War Journal said the findings by SIGAR are not surprising. The reasons for the financial losses include Taliban attacks, corruption and “throwing money at the problem without considering the implications,” he said.“It is one thing to build a clinic and school, it is another to operate, maintain, and in many cases defend this infrastructure from Taliban attacks,” said Roggio. "Additionally, the West has wildly underestimated the impact of Afghan corruption and in many cases incompetence. It was always a recipe for failure.”U.S. agencies responsible for construction didn't even ask the Afghans if they wanted or needed the buildings they ordered built, or if they had the technical ability to keep them running, Sopko said in his report.The waste occurred in violation of “multiple laws stating that U.S. agencies should not construct or procure capital assets until they can show that the benefiting country has the financial and technical resources and capability to use and maintain those assets effectively,” he said.Torek Farhadi, a former adviser to the Afghan government, said a "donor-knows-best” mentality often prevailed and it routinely meant little to no consultation with the Afghan government on projects.He said a lack of coordination among the many international donors aided the wastefulness. For example, he said schools were on occasion built alongside other newly constructed schools financed by other donors. The construction went ahead because once the decision was made — contract awarded and money allocated — the school was built regardless of the need, said Farhadi.The injection of billions of dollars, largely unmonitored, fueled runaway corruption among both Afghans and international contractors. But experts say that despite the waste, the need for assistance is real, given the Afghan governments heavy dependence on international money.The worsening security situation in Afghanistan also greatly impeded the monitoring of projects, with shoddy construction going undetected, said Farhadi, the former Afghan government adviser.“Consult with the locals about their needs and sustainability of the project once the project is complete,” he urged U.S. funding agencies looking to future projects. “Supervise, supervise, supervise project progress and implementation and audit every single layer of expenditure.”Going forward, Roggio said smaller, more manageable projects should be the order of the day. To build big unmanageable projects that Afghanistan has neither the capacity nor technical expertise for after 40 years of relentless war “feeds into the Taliban narrative that the government is corrupt, incompetent, and incapable of providing for the Afghan people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-wasted-billions-on-cars-buildings-in-afghanistan-report-101614587618180.html
01-03-2021||World||China builds system to launch its newer nuclear missiles from underground silos||China appears to be moving faster toward a capability to launch its newer nuclear missiles from underground silos, possibly to improve its ability to respond promptly to a nuclear attack, according to an American expert who analysed satellite images of recent construction at a missile training area.Hans Kristensen, a longtime watcher of US, Russian and Chinese nuclear forces, said the imagery suggests that China is seeking to counter what it may view as a growing threat from the United States. The US in recent years has pointed to China's nuclear modernisation as a key justification for investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming two decades to build an all-new US nuclear arsenal.There's no indication the United States and China are headed toward armed conflict, let alone a nuclear one. But the Kristensen report comes at a time of heightened US-China tensions across a broad spectrum, from trade to national security. A stronger Chinese nuclear force could factor into US calculations for a military response to aggressive Chinese actions, such as in Taiwan or the South China Sea.The Pentagon declined to comment on Kristensen's analysis of the satellite imagery, but it said last summer in its annual report on Chinese military developments that Beijing intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by putting more of them in underground silos and operating on a higher level of alert in which it could launch missiles upon warning of being under attack.“The PRC's nuclear weapons policy prioritises the maintenance of a nuclear force able to survive a first strike and respond with sufficient strength to inflict unacceptable damage on an enemy,” the Pentagon report said.More broadly, the Pentagon asserts that China is modernising its nuclear forces as part of a wider effort to build a military by mid-century that is equal to, and in some respects superior to, the US military.China's nuclear arsenal, estimated by the US government to number in the low 200s, is dwarfed by those of the United States and Russia, which have thousands. The Pentagon predicts that the People's Liberation Army Rocket Forces will at least double the size of its nuclear arsenal over the next 10 years, still leaving it with far fewer than the United States.China does not publicly discuss the size or preparedness of its nuclear force beyond saying it would be used only in response to an attack. The United States, by contrast, does not rule out striking first, although President Joe Biden in the past has embraced removing that ambiguity by adopting a “no first use” policy.Kristensen, an analyst with the Federation of American Scientists, said the commercial satellite photos he acquired appear to show China late last year began construction of 11 underground silos at a vast missile training range near Jilantai in north-central China. Construction of five other silos began there earlier. In its public reports the Pentagon has not cited any specific number of missile silos at that training range.These 16 silos identified by Kristensen would be in addition to the 18-20 that China now operates with an older intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-5.“It should be pointed out that even if China doubles or triples the number of ICBM silos, it would only constitute a fraction of the number of ICBM silos operated by the United States and Russia,” Kristensen wrote on his Federation of American Scientists' blog. “The U.S. Air Force has 450 silos, of which 400 are loaded. Russia has about 130 operational silos.”Nearly all of the new silos detected by Kristensen appear designed to accommodate China's newer-generation DF-41 ICBM, which is built with a solid-fuel component that allows the operator to more quickly prepare the missile for launch, compared to the DF-5's more time-consuming liquid-fuel system. The DF-41 can target Alaska and much of the continental United States.China already has a rail- and road-mobile version of the DF-41 missile.“They're trying to build up the survivability of their force,” by developing silo basing for their advanced missiles, Kristensen said in an interview. “It raises some questions about this fine line in nuclear strategy,” between deterring a U.S. adversary by threatening its highly valued nuclear forces and pushing the adversary into taking countermeasures that makes its force more capable and dangerous.“How do you get out of that vicious cycle?” Kristensen asked.Frank Rose, a State Department arms control official during the Obama administration, said recently there is little prospect of getting China to join an international negotiation to limit nuclear weapons. The Trump administration tried that but failed, and Rose sees no reason to think that will change anytime soon.“They're not going to do it out of the goodness of their heart,” he said, but they might be interested in talking if the United States were willing to consider Chinese concerns about related issues like US missile defenses.Rose says China's main interest is in building up its non-nuclear force of shorter- and intermediate-range missiles, which, combined with a cyberattack capability and systems for damaging or destroying US satellites, could push the United States out of the western Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-developing-tech-to-launch-newer-nuclear-missiles-from-underground-silos-101614587119488.html

01-03-2021||World||Myanmar court files 2 more charges against Suu Kyi; protesters march again||A Myanmar court filed two more charges against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday, a lawyer acting for her said, as protesters marched in defiance of a crackdown by security forces that killed at least 18 people the previous day.Suu Kyi looked well as she took part in a court hearing via video conferencing in the capital, Naypyitaw, and she asked to see her legal team, lawyer Min Min Soe told Reuters.The leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) has not been seen in public since her government was ousted in a Feb. 1 military coup, when she was detained along with other party leaders."I saw A May on the video, she looks healthy," the lawyer said, using an affectionate term that means "mother" to refer to Suu Kyi.Suu Kyi was initially charged with illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Later, a charge of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols was added.On Monday, a charge was added under a section of the colonial-era penal code prohibiting the publication of information that may “cause fear or alarm” or disrupt “public tranquillity”, Min Min Soe said.Another charge was added under a telecommunications law, the lawyer said, which stipulates equipment needs a licence.The next hearing will be on March 15.Myanmar has been in chaos since the military seized power after alleging fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's NLD in a landslide.As Suu Kyi appeared in the video conference court hearing, police in the main city of Yangon used stun grenades and tear gas to disperse protesters, witnesses said, a day after the worst violence since the coup.There were no immediate reports of any casualties on Monday but the previous day, police opened fire on crowds in various parts of the country killing 18 people, the U.N. human rights office said."We have to continue the protest no matter what," Thar Nge said by telephone after police firing tear gas forced him and others to abandon a barricade in a Yangon street."This is my neighbourhood. It's a lovely neighbourhood but now we're hearing gunfire and we don't feel safe at home."The military has not commented on Sunday's violence and police and military spokesmen did not answer calls.Earlier, police with water cannon and military vehicles were mobilised at protest hotspots in Yangon as crowds gathered to chant slogans.'ABHORRENT'Demonstrators marched in the northwestern town of Kale holding up pictures of Suu Kyi and chanting "democracy, our cause, our cause".Live video on Facebook showed a small crowd in hard hats gathered across a street in the northeastern town of Lashio, chanting slogans as police marched towards them. Protesters also marched in the central town of Bagan.The coup, which brought a halt to tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule, has drawn hundreds of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets and the condemnation of Western countries.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced what he called "abhorrent violence" by security forces, while Canada's foreign minister, Marc Garneau, called the military's use of lethal force "appalling". Both urged a united response.Tom Andrews, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said it was clear the junta's assault would continue so the international community should ratchet up its response.He proposed a global arms embargo, more sanctions from more countries on those behind the coup, sanctions on the military's businesses and a U.N Security Council referral to the International Criminal Court."Words of condemnation are welcome but insufficient. We must act," Andrews said in a statement."The nightmare in Myanmar that is unfolding before our eyes will get worse. The world must act."A committee representing lawmakers who won seats in the November election said at least 26 people were killed in the violence on Sunday, a tally Reuters was unable to verify.In a post dated Feb. 28, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper warned "severe action will be inevitably taken" against "anarchic mobs" that the military could not ignore, despite having previously shown restraint.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said at least 270 people were detained on Sunday, from a total 1,132 it said had been arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.While some Western countries have imposed limited sanctions, the generals have traditionally shrugged off diplomatic pressure with support from China and Russia.The junta has promised to hold a new election but not set a date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-court-files-2-more-charges-against-suu-kyi-protesters-march-again-101614586463381.html
01-03-2021||World||Countries call on drug companies to share vaccine blueprint, technical know-how||In an industrial neighborhood on the outskirts of Bangladesh’s largest city lies a factory with gleaming new equipment imported from Germany, its immaculate hallways lined with hermetically sealed rooms. It is operating at just a quarter of its capacity.It is one of three factories that The Associated Press found on three continents whose owners say they could start producing hundreds of millions of Covid-19 vaccines on short notice if only they had the blueprints and technical know-how. But that knowledge belongs to the large pharmaceutical companies who produce the first three vaccines authorized by countries including Britain, the European Union and the US — Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. The factories are all still awaiting responses.Across Africa and Southeast Asia, governments and aid groups, as well as the WHO, are calling on pharmaceutical companies to share their patent information more broadly to meet a yawning global shortfall in a pandemic that already has claimed nearly 2.5 million lives. Pharmaceutical companies that took taxpayer money from the US or Europe to develop inoculations at unprecedented speed say they are negotiating contracts and exclusive licensing deals with producers on a case-by-case basis because they need to protect their intellectual property and ensure safety.Critics say this piecemeal approach is just too slow at a time of urgent need to stop the virus before it mutates into even deadlier forms. Last month, WHO called for vaccine manufacturers to share their know-how to “dramatically increase the global supply.”“If that can be done then immediately overnight every continent will have dozens of companies who would be able to produce these vaccines,” said Abdul Muktadir, whose Incepta plant in Bangladesh already makes vaccines against hepatitis, flu, meningitis, rabies, tetanus and measles.All over the world, the supply of coronavirus vaccines is falling far short of demand, and the limited amount available is going to rich countries. Nearly 80% of the vaccines so far have been administered in just 10 countries, according to WHO. More than 210 countries with a collective population of 2.5 billion haven’t received a single shot.The deal-by-deal approach also means that some poorer countries end up paying more for the same vaccine than richer countries. South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Uganda all pay different amounts per dose for the same AstraZeneca vaccine — more than governments in the European Union, according to studies and publicly available documents. AstraZeneca said in an email that the price of the vaccine will differ depending on factors such as production costs, where the shots are made and how much countries order.“What we see today is a stampede, a survival of the fittest approach, where those with the deepest pockets, with the sharpest elbows are grabbing what is there and leaving others to die,” said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.In South Africa, home to the world’s most worrisome Covid-19 variant, the Biovac factory has said for weeks that it’s in negotiations with an unnamed manufacturer with no contract to show for it. And in Denmark, the Bavarian Nordic factory has capacity to spare and the ability to make more than 200 million doses but is also waiting for word from the producer of a licensed coronavirus vaccine.Governments and health experts offer two potential solutions to the vaccine shortage: One, supported by WHO, is a patent pool modeled after a platform set up for HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis treatments for voluntary sharing of technology, intellectual property and data. But not a single company has offered to share its data or transfer the necessary technology.The other, a proposal to suspend intellectual property rights during the pandemic, has been blocked in the World Trade Organization by the United States and Europe, home to the companies responsible for creating the vaccines described as the best way to stop the spread of coronavirus. That drive has the support of at least 119 countries among the WTO's 164 member states, and the African Union, but is adamantly opposed by vaccine makers.Pharmaceutical companies say that instead of lifting IP restrictions, rich countries should simply give more of the vaccines they have to poorer countries through COVAX, the public-private initiative WHO helped create for equitable vaccine distribution. The organization and its partners delivered its first doses last week — in very limited quantities.But rich countries are not willing to give up what they have. Earlier this month, Ursula Von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, used the phrase “global common good” to describe the vaccines. However, by the end of the week, the European Union had imposed export controls on vaccines, giving countries the power to stop shots from leaving their borders in some cases.The long-held model in the pharmaceutical industry is that companies pour in huge amounts of money and research in return for the right to reap profits from their drugs and vaccines. At an industry forum last May, Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla described the idea of sharing IP rights widely as “nonsense” and even “dangerous.” AstraZeneca’s chief Pascal Soriot said that if intellectual property is not protected, “there is no incentive for anybody to innovate.”Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, called the idea of lifting patent protections “a very bad signal to the future. You signal that if you have a pandemic, your patents are not worth anything.”Advocates of sharing vaccine blueprints argue that, unlike with most drugs, taxpayers paid billions to develop vaccines that are now “global public goods” and should be used to end the biggest public health emergency in living memory.“People are literally dying because we cannot agree on intellectual property rights,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat who has been deeply involved in the WTO discussions.Paul Fehlner, the chief legal officer for biotech company Axcella and a supporter of the WHO patent pool board, said governments that poured billions of dollars into developing vaccines and treatments should have demanded more from the companies they were financing from the beginning.“A condition of taking taxpayer money is not treating them as dupes,” he said.In a Feb. 3 interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading pandemic expert in the United States, said all options need to be on the table, including increasing aid, improving production capacity in the developing world and working with pharmaceutical companies to relax their patents.“Rich countries, ourselves included, have a moral responsibility when you have a global outbreak like this,” Fauci said. “We’ve got to get the entire world vaccinated, not just our own country.”It’s hard to know exactly how much more vaccine could be made worldwide if intellectual property restrictions were lifted, because the spare production capacity of factories has not been publicly shared. But Suhaib Siddiqi, former director of chemistry at Moderna, said that with the blueprint and technical advice, a modern factory should be able to get vaccine production going in at most three to four months.“In my opinion the vaccine belongs to the public,” said Siddiqi, who is still active in the field. “Any company which has experience synthesizing molecules should be able to do it.”Back in Bangladesh, the Incepta factory tried to get what it needed to make more vaccines in two ways, by offering its production lines to Moderna and by reaching out to a WHO partner. Moderna did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the Bangladesh plant, but its CEO, Stéphane Bancel, told European parliamentarians that the company’s engineers are fully occupied on expanding production in Europe.“Doing more tech transfer right now could actually put the production and the increased output for the months to come at great risk,” he said. “We are very open to do it in the future once our current sites are running.”Muktadir said he was also in discussions last May with CEPI, or the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, one of WHO’s partners in a global effort to buy and distribute Covid-19 vaccines fairly, but nothing came of it. CEPI spokesman Tom Mooney said the talks last year with Incepta didn’t raise interest, but that CEPI is still in discussions “about matchmaking opportunities including the possibility of using Incepta’s capacity for second wave vaccines.”Muktadir said he fully appreciates the extraordinary scientific achievement involved in the creation of vaccines this year, wants the rest of the world to be able to share in it, and is willing to pay a fair price.“Nobody should give their property just for nothing,” he said. “A vaccine could be made accessible to people — high quality, effective vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-call-on-drug-companies-to-share-vaccine-blueprint-technical-knowhow-101614586088647.html

And the White House has a reason for that, as explained by press secretary Jen Psaki on Sunday.Psaki told CNN that there are more "effective ways" to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the killing as well as leave room with the Saudis on "areas of mutual agreement".Secretary of State Antony Blinken had earlier explained that Biden wants to "recalibrate" but not "rupture" its relations with Riyadh, a longstanding Middle East partner."This is not the Saudi smack-down that many expected," Varsha Koduvayur, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies think-tank in Washington, told news agency AFP.The US on Friday released fresh declassified file on the killing of Khashoggi, who was critical of the Saudi kingdom and the crown prince, popularly know by his initials MBS, which cited intelligence reports from CIA and other agenies to say that the killing took place on the orders of the crown prince.Khashoggi, a US resident, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018. He had gone to the consulate to get a document that he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee Hatice Cengiz who was waiting outside.Turkish officials say Khashoggi, 59, was strangled and his body was cut into pieces by a 15-man Saudi group inside the kingdom’s mission. His remains have never been found.The conclusion in the report that the prince approved an operation to kill or capture Khashoggi was based on his decision-making role inside the kingdom, the involvement of a key adviser and members of his protective detail and his past support for violently silencing dissidents abroad.After the report was released, Blinken announced sanctions against 76 Saudi individuals under what he called a new “Khashoggi Ban” policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khashoggi-killing-white-house-official-explains-why-saudi-crown-prince-not-sanctioned-101614586244417.html

The three-hour-long car rally featured flags from both the countries and involved 22 Indo-Canadian organisations.The first consignment of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is scheduled to arrive in Toronto on March 3. The shipment will have 500,000 doses. A total of two million shots will be sent to Canada by mid-May.One of the organisers of the car rally, Naresh Chavda, a legal professional from Toronto, said the objective was “to strengthen Indo-Canadian unity because India is helping Canada with vaccines, and to celebrate that”.The Brampton rally took place in the shadow of increasing tensions in Canada as pro-Khalistan elements have been showing solidarity with those demonstrating against farm reform laws passed in India. During the event, some protesters had tried to block the rally, but were cleared by police. Participants at the rally recalled that some of the protesters shouted abusive slogans and caused minor damage. In a flier sent out earlier, the rally’s organisers had warned participants to stay away from reacting to people who opposed the event.“We require peace because of the way in which Khalistanis are destabilising the community in the GTA and Vancouver due to anti-Indian government protests, while, at the same time, India is helping many countries including Canada with vaccines,” said one of the organisers who wished not to be named.Also this weekend, a ‘kisan’ rally (pro-farmer rally) was held with the backing of the Ontario Gurdwara Committee, Sikh Motorcycle Club of Canada, Guru Nanak Mission Canada, and the Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar Canada. One of the organisers, Sukhminder Singh Hansra, a leading pro-Khalistan figure in the country, told HT that there was “amazing enthusiasm” for the rally with a “big gathering” as people listened to speeches and a play on radio.Meanwhile, left-of-centre and union groups took out a full-page advertisement in leading Canadian daily, Toronto Star, criticising the Indian government over the farm laws that have sparked protests in India. Under the headline “Statement of Solidarity with Farmers of India”, the advertisement says the “recent declarations of support for the farm laws by the IMF and the US government indicate the range of forces backing them, adding an anti-imperialist dimension to the struggle against them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-rally-near-toronto-hails-indo-canadian-collaboration-in-covid-vaccine-supply-101614586281453.html
01-03-2021||World||Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's extradition to US enters final round in Canadian court||The high-stakes battle by Chinese Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou against extradition to the United States enters its final stage in a Canadian court on Monday, after more than two years of legal skirmishes and diplomatic barbs.The daughter of Huawei founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei faces charges in the United States of bank fraud and conspiracy over the commercial activities of a former Huawei subsidiary alleged to have violated US sanctions against Iran.As the case enters its final months, Meng's defence lawyers are set to assert that abuses by Canada and the United States have denied her the right to a fair process.The case has roiled Canada's diplomatic relations with China, its second largest trading partner behind the United States.Meng is accused of having lied to the HSBC investment bank about Huawei's relationship with subsidiary Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran. If convicted, she could face more than 30 years in a US prison.Meng and Huawei both deny the charges. Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer.Two Canadian citizens -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- remain imprisoned in China. They were detained days after Meng's December 2018 arrest during a stopover in Vancouver, and after Beijing threatened Canada with severe consequences over what Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng called Meng's "unconscionable" detention.Ottawa has long maintained Kovrig and Spavor were "arbitrarily" jailed in retaliation for Meng's arrest, while affirming the independence of Canada's judicial system in dealing with the US extradition request.Beijing, meanwhile, has called the charges against Meng "completely political," and part of a plot to crush its top global technology firm. Washington last year banned US semiconductor chipmakers from selling to Huawei, which it accuses of stealing American trade secrets.'Bartering chips'The latest hearings begin just days after US President Joe Biden publicly demanded the two Canadians' release, saying Tuesday during a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, "Human beings are not bartering chips."Ottawa recently unveiled a declaration signed by 58 countries against "arbitrary detention in state-to-state relations."And when the Canadian parliament denounced China's treatment of its ethnic Uighurs as genocide, Beijing angrily slammed it as a "malicious provocation.""The Canadian side's attempt to pressure China by using 'Megaphone Diplomacy' or ganging up is totally futile and will only head towards a dead end," China's embassy in Canada said.In the upcoming hearings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Meng's lawyers are expected to argue that former US president Donald Trump "poisoned" the case when he said he might intervene in her prosecution in exchange for Chinese trade concessions.Lawyers for Canada's attorney general have urged the judge to dismiss the allegations, saying in court filings that the remarks were made by "a president no longer in office, about a possible intervention in this case that never occurred."Defence lawyers will then argue that Meng's rights were violated during her Vancouver airport detention and interrogation; that the United States misled Canada when it requested her arrest; and that extraditing her would break international law because none of Huawei's alleged crimes had any direct connection to the United States.Over the past two years, Meng has suffered several legal setbacks.A judge last month rejected her plea to relax her bail conditions, which include a curfew, the wearing of a monitoring anklet, and daytime supervision. Canada argued she might try to escape.Meng remains under house arrest in her Vancouver mansion.Her extradition trial is scheduled to wrap up in mid-May, barring any appeals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-executive-meng-wanzhou-s-extradition-to-us-enters-final-round-101614583716725.html
01-03-2021||World||India Covid-19 cases may rise as summer will force people indoors: Expert||A top Canada-based epidemiologist has cautioned India to guard against a possible surge in coronavirus cases in the months ahead as the summer forces people indoors.The warning came from Toronto-based Prabhat Jha, epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Unity Health St Michael Hospital and executive director of the Centre for Global Health Research.Jha is also the lead investigator in the Million Death Study conducted in India in collaboration with the Registrar General of India.Jha told HT that the principal “element for transmission” is now considered to be “an indoor, closed, less ventilated space”.Just as there was a winter peak in countries such as Canada as falling temperatures drove people indoors, a similar a phenomenon may be relevant to India in the context of the summer’s heat, the expert said.More caution needs to be exercised during the months of May and June as temperatures rise, he said, adding, “The upward tick now seen in many states is a result of people being more lax with masks and indoor gatherings. This may get worse with summer heat.”Jha and his research team are working on a study looking at the possible causes behind the decrease in cases in countries such as India. He said the “most probable” reason for this trend was that “a large number (of people) are already infected”.As per data from 18 large Indian cities covering a population of nearly 110 million, between 50-60% of adults are already infected. He said the trajectory in India has been “atypical” as nearly 75% of cases have been asymptomatic - directly opposite to the trend in the West.Jha cited the inching up of daily cases in India, particularly in Mumbai, as a cause for concern.He said the relatively low mortality rates in India so far could be attributed not just to fewer infections, but also factors like “hyper-stimulation of the immune system” due to multiple reasons, such as the population being exposed to other coronaviruses in the past, and the prevalence of diseases such as measles.“But we have to be very careful,” cautioned Jha, referring to a gradual increase in infection rates over the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-may-spike-in-india-due-to-summer-warns-canada-based-expert-101614580461322.html

01-03-2021||World||South Korean prez hopes Tokyo Olympics may allow for US, North Korea talks||South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said on Monday that the Tokyo Olympics could provide a chance to reopen talks between North Korea and the United States, North Korea and Japan, and the two Koreas.Speaking at a ceremony marking the 102nd anniversary of the March 1 Independence Movement Day in Seoul, Moon also said South Korea will work with Japan for the success of the Tokyo Olympics, which could help the two countries recover from the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.Moon's speech came as North Korea's relations with South Korea and Japan have soured after its denuclearisation negotiations with the United States fell apart in 2019.Seeking to take a page from its 2018 Winter Olympics, Seoul is pinning high hopes on the Tokyo Olympics to revitalise diplomacy with North Korea despite uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic and Pyongyang's cutoff of exchanges with the outside world."The Games scheduled for this year may serve as an opportunity for dialogue between South Korea and Japan, South and North Korea, North Korea and Japan, and North Korea and the United States," Moon said at a public park in Seoul where independence fighters declared the country's freedom in 1919 from Japanese colonial rule."I hope that both Korea and Japan will be able to revive our economies, which were hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, and jointly create a new order in the post-Covid-19 era."Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula continues to dog bilateral ties.In January, a Seoul court for the first time ordered Japan to compensate 12 former "comfort women" who were forced to work in its wartime brothels, following a 2018 ruling by South Korea's Supreme Court that two Japanese firms should compensate some wartime forced labourers.Both rulings drew a rebuke from Tokyo, which says the women and labour issues were settled under a 2015 deal and 1965 treaty, respectively.Moon said he was "ready to sit down" for talks with Japanese officials on those issues while seeking "wise solutions based on a victim-centred approach.""We must not let the past hold us back," he said. "I am confident that if we put our heads together ... we will also be able to wisely resolve issues of the past."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-prez-hopes-tokyo-olympics-may-allow-for-us-north-korea-talks-101614573177899.html
01-03-2021||World||Former US President Donald Trump hints at 2024 run for the White House||Former US President Donald Trump on Sunday hinted at another run for the White House in 2024, as he repeated the discredited claim that the last election was “stolen” from him.The former US president also said that he is not launching a new political party as had been speculated, and called for Republicans to unify.Taking the stage for the first time since leaving office, Trump launched an attack on his successor, President Joe Biden, saying he has had the “most disastrous first month of any president in modern history”.Trump’s remarks came on the closing day of the annual conference of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a popular forum for Republican White House aspirants to hawk their wares. It was held in Orlando, Florida.“As you know, they just lost the White House,” said Trump, repeating his claim about the November election, as he set up his 2024 run for the US presidency. “I may even decide to beat them for a third time,” Trump added, referring to his first win in 2016 and the defeat in 2020, which he continues to portray as a victory.Trump, 74, remains a dominant figure for the Republicans despite the party losing the White House, the Senate and the House since 2018 on his watch. As a straw poll of the attendees at the CPAC showed, he is the frontrunner for the party’s nomination for president by a wide margin. Asked who they will vote for in a Republican primary for the 2024 nominee, 55% of the respondents picked Trump. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, a staunch Trump ally, finished a distant second at 21%, and South Dakota governor Kristi Noem was further behind with 4% for the third slot.Nearly seven out of 10 respondents said they would like Trump to run again; 15% said they would not and 17% were unsure. An overwhelming 95% of the respondents said they wanted the party to pursue Trump’s agenda and policies and only 3% said the party needed to change course. The rest were unsure.“We’re not starting new parties,” Trump told the attendees, refuting reports that were based on suggestions from his aides to counter Republicans who wanted the party to sever ties with him, appalled by his role in the January 6 Capitol riot that earned him the dubious distinction of being the only US president to be impeached twice.“We have the Republican Party. It is going to unite and be stronger than ever before,” Trump said.He named the 10 Republicans who voted with Democrats to impeach him in the House on January 13, and the seven Republicans who voted to convict him in the Senate trial, which failed because it fell short of the two-third majority needed to go through.“We cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country,” said Trump, calling for unity within the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-president-donald-trump-hints-at-2024-run-for-the-white-house-101614572960989.html
01-03-2021||World||Myanmar pro-democracy protests: Military junta kills at least 18||Security forces in Myanmar opened fire and made mass arrests Sunday as they sought to break up protests against the military’s seizure of power, and a UN human rights official said it had “credible information” that at least 18 people were killed and 30 were wounded.That would be the highest single-day death toll among protesters who are demanding that the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi be restored to power after being ousted by a Feb. 1 coup. About 1,000 people are believed to have been detained Sunday.“Deaths reportedly occurred as a result of live ammunition fired into crowds in Yangon, Dawei, Mandalay, Myeik, Bago and Pokokku,” the UN Human Rights Office said in a statement referring to several cities, adding that the forces also used tear gas, flash-bang grenades and stun grenades.An Associated Press journalist was taken into police custody on Saturday morning while providing news coverage of the protests. The journalist, Thein Zaw, remains in police custody.The AP called for his immediate release.“Independent journalists must be allowed to freely and safely report the news without fear of retribution. AP decries in the strongest terms the arbitrary detention of Thein Zaw,” said Ian Phillips, AP vice president for international news. The Foreign Correspondents Club of Myanmar also condemned the arrest.The Democratic Voice of Burma reported that as of 5pm in Myanmar, there had been 19 confirmed deaths in nine cities, with another 10 deaths unconfirmed. The independent media company broadcasts on satellite and digital terrestrial television, as well as online.DVB counted five deaths in Yangon and two in Mandalay, the largest and second-largest cities.It registered five deaths in Dawei, a much smaller city in southeastern Myanmar that has seen tens of thousands of protesters nearly every day since the coup. Witnesses said Sunday’s march was also large and people were determined not to be driven off the streets.Confirming the deaths of protesters has been difficult amid the chaos and general lack of news from official sources, especially in areas outside Yangon, Mandalay and the capital of Naypyitaw. But in many cases, photos and video circulated showed circumstances of the killings and gruesome photos of bodies.The independent Assistance Association of Political Prisoners reported it was aware that about 1,000 people were detained Sunday, of whom they were able to identify 270. That brought to 1,132 the total number of people the group has confirmed being arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.Gunfire was reported almost as soon the protests began Sunday morning in Yangon, as police also fired tear gas and water cannons while trying to clear the streets. Photos of shell casings from live ammunition used in assault rifles were posted on social media.Initial reports on social media identified one young man believed to have been killed. His body was shown in photos and videos lying on a sidewalk until other protesters carried him away.In Dawei, local media reported at least three people were killed during a protest march, supported by photos and video. Photos on social media showed one wounded man in the care of medical personnel.Before Sunday, there had been eight confirmed reports of killings linked to the army’s takeover, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the crackdown, calling the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters and arbitrary arrests “unacceptable,” and expressed serious concern at the increase in deaths and serious injuries, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.“The secretary-general urges the international community to come together and send a clear signal to the military that it must respect the will of the people of Myanmar as expressed through the election and stop the repression,” Dujarric said.US officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken also condemned the violence. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan issued a statement saying the US is “alarmed” by the violence and stands in solidarity with Myanmar people “who continue to bravely voice their aspirations for democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights."Washington has imposed sanctions on Myanmar because of the coup, and Sullivan said it would “impose further costs on those responsible,” promising details “in the coming days.”The Feb. 1 coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party would have been installed for a second five-year term in office, but the army blocked Parliament from convening and detained her and President Win Myint, as well as other top members of Suu Kyi’s government.On Sunday morning, medical students marched in Yangon near the Hledan Center intersection, which has become the gathering point for protesters who then fan out to other parts of the city.Videos and photos showed protesters running as police charged at them, and residents setting up makeshift roadblocks to slow their advance. Some protesters managed to throw tear gas canisters back at police. Nearby, residents were pleading with police to release those they picked up from the street and shoved into police trucks to be taken away. Dozens or more were believed to be detained.“The world is watching the actions of the Myanmar military junta, and will hold them accountable,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for New York-based Human Rights Watch. “Live ammunition should not be used to control or disperse protests and lethal force can only be used to protect life or prevent serious injury.”Security forces began employing rougher tactics on Saturday, taking preemptive actions to break up protests and making scores, if not hundreds, of arrests. Greater numbers of soldiers also joined police. Many of those detained were taken to Insein Prison in Yangon’s northern outskirts, historically notorious for holding political prisoners.According to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, as of Saturday, 854 people had been arrested, charged or sentenced at one point in relation to the coup, and 771 were being detained or sought for arrest. The group said that while it had documented 75 new arrests, it understood that hundreds of other people were also picked up Saturday in Yangon and elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-pro-democracy-protests-military-junta-kills-at-least-18-101614561611754.html

01-03-2021||World||In first post-White House speech, Donald Trump says his political journey 'far from over'||In his first public appearance since leaving office, former US President Donald Trump suggested he may launch a third presidential bid, but said he has no plans to start an alternative to the Republican Party."I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together four years ago is far from over," the former president said in his first speech since leaving the White House last month.Speaking at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, Trump said: "We are gathered this afternoon to talk about the future -- the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country."Trump began his address by asking the crowd: "Do you miss me?" He announced he is "not starting a new party" and, making note of the mostly maskless audience, said "there are no masks, there's no double masks.""Actually, as you know they just lost the White House," Trump said of Democrats, repeating the lie he he won the election last fall. "Who knows, I may even decide to beat them for the third time," he added, stopping short of declaring his 2024 plans.He lashed out at his successor, US President Joe Biden, saying that the new administration is anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science, Sputnik reported.Trump said: "Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history. It was Trump's first major public appearance since leaving office.Trump particularly pointed to the emerging border crisis in the US, criticizing Biden's immigration policy and calling it a betrayal of America's core values."Already the Biden administration has proven that they are anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science," Trump said, adding "In just one short month we have gone from 'America First' to 'America Last.'"The CPAC is an annual forum, held this year in Florida by the American Conservative Union. Sunday is the final chapter of the four-day event, which is expected to give the ex-POTUS a platform to announce his future political plans.The former president said that the Democrats can lose the White House four years from now, and repeated his allegations of election fraud."[US President Joe] Biden has failed in his number one duty as chief executive enforcing America's laws. This alone should be reason enough for Democrats to suffer withering losses in the midterms and to lose the White House decisively four years from now," Trump asserted. "Actually, you know, they just lost the White House."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-first-post-white-house-speech-donald-trump-says-his-political-journey-far-from-over-101614560779869.html
01-03-2021||World||Beijing could be preparing for a full-scale invasion of Taiwan: Report||China's 'gray zone' warfare against Taiwan is now at the highest level, which could mean that Beijing is preparing for a full-scale invasion, Focus Taiwan reported citing local military experts warned on Thursday.Gray zone conflicts are activities by a state that are harmful to another state and are sometimes considered to be acts of war, but are not legally acts of war.Shu Hsiao-huang, an analyst at the government-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said that in gray-zone conflicts, the participants rely on unconventional tools, tactics and the use of non-state entities that do not cross over into formal state-level aggression.Due to ambiguity of the enemy's actions, the targets of 'gray-zone' warfare are often uncertain how to immediately respond, he said.Over the past years, Beijing has been conducting "gray-zone" warfare against Taipei, using tactics such as propaganda campaigns, economic pressure, online rumours, and disinformation via content farms to put political pressure on the Taiwan government, Shu said.That type of warfare against Taiwan is now at its highest level, which could mean that Beijing is preparing for a full-scale invasion, although high tensions do not necessarily mean physical war, he said.At the forum, former Defense Minister Andrew Yang said Beijing has been engaged in a "war of attrition," with the aim of wearing down Taiwan politically, militarily, and psychologically.Fortunately, the international community in recent years has been paying closer attention to China's military manoeuvres near Taiwan, and they are also on high alert over the growing military threat posed by Beijing, Yang said.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-could-be-preparing-for-a-full-scale-invasion-of-taiwan-report-101614559204536.html
01-03-2021||World||China to strengthen global influence campaign amid rising discontent: Report||Facing disapproval around the world over a slew of issues including Xinjiang, Hong Kong, coronavirus handling and Indo-Pacific, Beijing is expected to step up its global influence campaign after the Communist Party of China (CPC) issued revised regulations on united front work in early January.Lin Cheng-jung, a researcher at Taiwan government-funded think tank Institute for National Defense and Security Research, in an article published in the institution's Defense Security Bi-weekly on Feburary 20, said that the CPC is expanding its influence campaign from domestic to international audiences, utilizing modern technology and other creative ways, with Taiwan as one of its primary targets, Focus Taiwan reported.On January 5, the CPC Central Committee published its revised regulations on united front work after a five-year trial period.The united front is defined by the CPC as an alliance of different political forces to advance the party's interests. The united front work, as observed by international experts, however, is achieved largely through using its political influence.In 2021, the CPC is expected to focus on "invisible emotional warfare" against Taiwan by making as many friends as it can in Taiwan and overseas that support the unification of Taiwan and China, he concluded.Lin said the revisions signify that the CPC is aiming to institutionalize its united front work to face domestic and external challenges more effectively, including internal reforms, religious and ethnic conflicts such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet.According to Lin, the scope of the CPC's global influence campaign encompasses politics, economics, the military and education including Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the more than 500 Confucius Institutes all over the world.The CPC hopes to export its cultural values and ideologies to other countries through these Confucius Institutes and to lure developing countries to its side with money through the BRI, he said.Lin pointed out that the CPC's united front tactics evolve through time and that the party now uses the popular app TikTok to air political ads, reaching people in as many as 150 countries around the world.Another social media platform worth watching for the CPC's influence campaign is the Clubhouse, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-strengthen-global-influence-campaign-amid-rising-discontent-report-101614556895825.html
01-03-2021||World||Donald Trump teases possible 2024 run, rejects third-party idea at CPAC||Former President Donald Trump rejected the idea of starting a third political party and instead teased the idea of a 2024 run in a speech Sunday at a conservative conference.“I am not starting a new party. That was fake news, no,” Trump told supporters minutes into his speech that closed the four-day Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida. “Wouldn’t that be brilliant? Let’s start a new party and let’s divide our vote so that you will never win. No, we’re not interested in that.”Trump rattled off the accomplishments of his term in the White House, repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election and added, “Who knows? I may even decide to beat them a third time.”The speech to CPAC was Trump’s first public appearance since he left office 39 days ago. Since then, he’s kept an uncharacteristically low profile, hampered in large part because he is banned from Twitter and Facebook in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that led to his impeachment and subsequent acquittal in the Senate.In emailed statements and a handful of interviews to friendly outlets, he’s blasted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, eulogized talk show host Rush Limbaugh and made unfounded allegations of election fraud — all while avoiding questions about his future in the party.His remarks ratified the consensus of the conference that this is not a conservative movement wallowing in in its loss to Democrat Joe Biden as much as it’s a government-in-waiting, counting down the three years and 11 months for Trump to “Make America Great Again” again.In a straw poll, 97% of attendees approved of his leadership of the party, 70% want him to run again and 55% said he was their preferred candidate in 2024. (The other top contenders were Trump loyalists: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, followed by South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and Donald Trump Jr.)Trump’s rousing reception at the most important conservative gathering on the calendar highlights just how much Trump has transformed the movement in just five years.In 2016, Trump abruptly canceled his appearance at the event amid plans for a walkout from conservatives who questioned his commitment to the cause and demands that he answer questions from a moderator like the other candidates.On Sunday, he was the closer of a three-day festival of Trump-flavored conservatism that bore his undeniable imprint.The conference included at least seven panels credulously discussing Trump’s claims of a stolen 2020 election despite dozens of court rulings finding otherwise.Major figures from the Trump cabinet — at least, those still loyal to the former president — were given speaking slots: Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell and Budget Director Russ Vought.Prominent conservatives who have left Trump’s orbit were nowhere to be found, including McConnell and his wife, former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney. Even Trump’s old running mate, former Vice president Mike Pence, declined an invitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-teases-possible-2024-run-rejects-third-party-idea-at-cpac-101614551557445.html
01-03-2021||World||South Africa to ease Covid-19 restrictions after 'dramatic decline'||South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said the country will start relaxing coronavirus restrictions, moving from alert level three down to level one, after a "dramatic decline" in infections.The easing of the measures, due to begin at midnight, will see most economic activity resume as the country moves to rebuild its virus-shattered economy.In a televised address to the nation, Ramaphosa said the country had made big strides in the past eight weeks, recording a steady drop in infections and hospital admissions."Due to the decline in infections, the country can now ease some of the restrictions on movement and economic activity," Ramaphosa announced."We do so cautiously," he added.Ramaphosa said the country had recorded just under 10,000 new infections over the past week, down from more than 40,000 in the last week of January and some 90,000 in the same week in December.He attributed the "dramatic decline" to the public health measures, changes in behaviour, and accumulating immunity in those that had become infected.Under level one restrictions, the country's curfew will now only run from midnight to 4am.The head of state spoke a day after the country received the second batch of Johnson & Johnson vaccines arrived in the country.So far, more than 63,600 healthcare workers have been vaccinated since the country began inoculations nearly a fortnight ago.The elderly, teachers, miners, police officers, soldiers, civil servants and people older than 18 with co-morbidities will be vaccinated in the next phase of the three-phase rollout campaign from the end of April.The government, which has been accused of being slow to acquire Covid vaccines, has secured an agreement to procure 11 million one-shot doses from Johnson & Johnson, 2.8 million of which are expected in the second quarter.Twenty million Pfizer jabs have also been secured, while an additional 12 million doses expected via the COVAX facility, according to Ramaphosa.Having recorded more than 1.5 million infections of which nearly 50,000 have been fatal, South Africa still has the highest number of cases and deaths on the continent.It aims to inoculate around 40 million people -- 67 percent of the population -- by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-to-ease-covid-19-restrictions-after-dramatic-decline-101614548679023.html
01-03-2021||World||Iran rules out nuclear deal meeting, says time not 'suitable'||Iran on Sunday dismissed Europe's offer for an informal meeting involving the United States on the troubled 2015 nuclear deal, saying the time is not "suitable" as Washington has failed to lift sanctions.The European Union's political director earlier this month proposed the informal meeting involving all parties of the Vienna deal, a proposition accepted by US President Joe Biden's administration.Following Biden's election, the US, the European parties to the deal -- France, Germany and Britain -- and Tehran have been trying to salvage the accord, which granted Iran international sanctions relief in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme.The accord has been nearing collapse since former president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign against Tehran."Considering the recent positions and actions of the United States and the three European countries, (Iran) does not consider the time suitable to hold the informal meeting proposed by the European coordinator," foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement."There has still been no change in the US positions and behaviour yet," he added, saying the Biden administration has continued "Trump's failed policy of maximum pressure".Biden has signalled readiness to revive the deal, but insists Iran first return to all its nuclear commitments, most of which it suspended in response to the sanctions, while Tehran demands Washington take the first step by scrapping the sanctions."While we are disappointed at Iran's response, we remain ready to reengage in meaningful diplomacy to achieve a mutual return to compliance," a White House spokesperson said Sunday."We will be consulting with our P5 1 partners on the best way forward," the spokesperson added, referring to the group of the five permanent members on the UN Security Council, plus Germany.The foreign ministry statement comes ahead of a quarterly meeting Monday of the United Nations nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors, which is likely to discuss Iran's recent restrictions of some nuclear inspections."Remember: Trump failed to meet because of his ill-advised 'Max Failure'," Khatibzadeh wrote on Twitter shortly after his statement.Tehran's position is unchanged "with sanctions in place... Censuring is NOT diplomacy. It doesn't work with Iran", he added.'End sanctions'The US "has not even announced its commitment to fulfilling its responsibilities" under the deal and the UN Security Council resolution that enshrined it, the spokesman said in the statement."America must end its illegal and unilateral sanctions and return to its (deal) commitments. This needs neither negotiations nor resolutions," he added.Iran "will answer action with action, and just as it will return to (deal) commitments in accordance with the lifting of sanctions, it will respond to hostile actions and behaviours in the same way".Khatibzadeh said Tehran would continue to consult with other parties to the nuclear agreement, and European Union Foreign Minister Josep Borrell "in his capacity as the (deal) coordinator, both bilaterally and multilaterally".Iran last Tuesday started to restrict some site inspections by the IAEA, in continuation of suspended nuclear commitments in response to the US failure to lift its sanctions.London, Paris and Berlin said they "deeply regret" the move and that they were "united in underlining the dangerous nature of this decision".IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said last week an interim three-month deal agreed during a visit to Tehran was "far from an ideal situation", but will allow the body to continue monitoring "all the key activities".It will facilitate "time for the indispensable diplomacy that will be deployed", he added.Under the temporary agreement, data on Iran's nuclear programme "will be stored and not handed over to the IAEA," according to Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.The Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation has said that if US sanctions are still not lifted after three months, it will start erasing the recordings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-rules-out-nuclear-deal-meeting-says-time-not-suitable-101614547984196.html

The March 5-8 trip will provide a sorely-needed spiritual boost to Iraq's beleaguered Christians while furthering the Vatican's bridge-building efforts with the Muslim world.But from a purely epidemiological standpoint, as well as the public health message it sends, a papal trip to Iraq amid a global pandemic is not advisable, health experts say.They note that wars, economic crises and an exodus of Iraqi professionals have devastated the country's hospital system, while studies show most of Iraq's new Covid-19 infections are the highly-contagious variant first identified in Britain.“I just don't think it's a good idea,” said Dr. Navid Madani, virologist and founding director of the Center for Science Health Education in the Middle East and North Africa at Harvard Medical School's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.The Iranian-born Madani co-authored an article in The Lancet last year on the region's uneven response to Covid-19, noting that Iraq, Syria and Yemen were poorly placed to cope given they are still struggling with extremist insurgencies and have 40 million people who need humanitarian aid.In a telephone interview, Madani said Middle Easterners are known for their hospitality, and cautioned that the enthusiasm among Iraqis of welcoming a peace-maker like Francis to a neglected, war-torn part of the world might lead to inadvertent violations of virus control measures.“This could potentially lead to unsafe or superspreading risks,” she said.Dr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious disease control expert at the University of Exeter College of Medicine, concurred.“It's a perfect storm for generating lots of cases which you won't be able to deal with,” he said.Organisers promise to enforce mask mandates, social distancing and limitations on participation in papal events, with the possibility of increased testing sites, two Iraqi government officials said.The health care protocols are “critical but can be managed," one government official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.And the Vatican has taken its own precautions, with the 84-year-old pope, his 20-member Vatican entourage and 70-plus journalists on the papal plane all vaccinated.But the Iraqis who will be gathering in the north, center and south of the country to attend Francis' indoor and outdoor Masses, hear his speeches, participate in his prayer meetings and organize the logistics of a complicated trip, are not.And that, scientists say, is the problem.“We are in the middle of a global pandemic. And it is important to get the correct messages out,” Pankhania said. “The correct messages are: the less interactions with fellow human beings, the better.”He questioned the optics of the Vatican delegation being inoculated while the Iraqis are not, and noted that Iraqis would only take the risk to attend such an event because the pope was there.In words addressed to Vatican officials and media, including AP journalists, he said: “You are all protected from severe disease. So if you get infected, you're not going to die. But the people coming to see you may get infected and may die.”“Is it wise under that circumstance for you to just turn up, and because you turn up, people turn up to see you and they get infected?” he asked.The World Health Organization was diplomatic when asked about the wisdom of a papal trip to Iraq, saying countries should evaluate the risk of an event against the infection situation, and then decide if it should be postponed or can be held safely.“If they're having birthday parties, for example, it's all about managing that risk,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19. “It's about looking at the epidemiologic situation in the country and then making sure that if that event is to take place, that it can take place as safely as possible.”Francis has said he intends to go even if most Iraqis have to watch him on television to avoid infection. The important thing, he told Catholic News Service, is “they will see that the pope is there in their country.”Francis has frequently called for an equitable distribution of vaccines and respect for government health measures, though he himself tends to not wear face masks. Francis for months has eschewed even tightly controlled, socially distanced public audiences at the Vatican to limit the chance of contagion.Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton's Faculty of Medicine, said the number of new daily cases in Iraq is “increasing significantly at the moment” with the Health Ministry reporting around 4,000 a day, close to the height of its first wave in September.Head said for any trip to Iraq, there must be infection control practices in force, including mask-wearing, hand-washing, social distancing and good ventilation in indoor spaces.“Hopefully we will see proactive approaches to infection control in place during the pope's visit to Baghdad,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-good-idea-experts-concerned-about-pope-trip-to-iraq-101614502719994.html
01-03-2021||India||Supreme Court ends bail of over 2,000 prisoners given on Covid-19 ground||The Supreme Court on Monday set a 15-day deadline for 2,318 undertrial prisoners in Delhi to surrender after they were released on bail in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhatt said, “Now the situation is improving. We will order the prisoners out on interim bail to surrender in 15 days.”On October 29 last year, the top court had stayed a direction passed on October 20 by the Delhi High Court directing 2,318 undertrial prisoners to surrender in a phased manner.This decision was challenged by NGO National Forum on Prison Reforms which pointed to the grim reality of overcrowded prisons and sought stay of the HC order in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The petition pointed out that implementing the HC order will result in widespread confusion as prisoners will be forced to approach different trial courts. It also claimed that the surrender of close to 5000 prisoners will lead to overcrowding, heightening chances of a Covid-19 spread inside jail.From time-to-time, the top court kept extending its order of stay and lifted it only on Monday.The court kept the matter pending in order to monitor implementation of its order. The court also wished to know about the status on overcrowding of prisons across the country and sought a report on this aspect from Amicus curiae Gaurav Agarwal.The High Court had directed 2318 undertrials involved in heinous offences to surrender in a phased manner latest by November 13. Soon after the lockdown came into effect in March last year, the Delhi HC took suo motu notice of the pending interim bail pleas of prisoners before various trial courts and High Court and granted blanket extension till May 15. By subsequent orders in May, June, and July, the interim bails got extended. In addition to this, some 350 odd prisoners were also granted interim bail by the Delhi High Court as well.The HC in its October 20 order had said, “Now the situation has changed and all courts at High Courts and district level are functioning through physical or videoconferencing mode.”The HC also noted that inside the jails, there was no scare of Covid-19 outbreak as out of 16,000 prisoners only three were infected and were being kept under isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-ends-bail-of-over-2-000-prisoners-given-on-covid-19-ground-101614622652834.html
01-03-2021||India||Congress divided over alliance with cleric Siddiqui in Bengal||Serious differences appeared in the Congress on Monday over having an electoral alliance with Bengal cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front (ISF) in the upcoming assembly election while the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its adversary, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accused the Congress and the Left parties of playing communal politics by wooing the cleric as an ally.In a significant development, deputy leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, accused the party’s Bengal president and Lok Sabha member Adhir Ranjan Chowdury of diluting the party’s core ideology and the secularism that Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed.“Congress’ alliance with parties like ISF and other such forces militates against the core ideology of the party and Gandhian and Nehruvian secularism, which forms the soul of the party. These issues need to be approved by the CWC,” Sharma tweeted in the evening.“Congress cannot be selective in fighting communalists but must do so in all its manifestations, irrespective of religion and colour. The presence and endorsement West Bengal PCC President is painful and shameful, he must clarify,” Sharma said in the second tweet, indirectly referring to Chowdhury’s presence at the CPI(M)’s mega rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds on Sunday when Siddiqui delivered a speech.Meanwhile, the sixth round of seat-sharing talks between the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), hit a wall in Kolkata with Chowdury declaring that his party cannot spare any seat for the ISF in Murshidabad and Malda, the districts having maximum Muslim population in Bengal and where the ISF wants to contest several seats."We are in charge of a state and don't take any decision on our own without any permission," ANI quoted Chowdhury as saying.“We wanted to contest 130 out of the state’s 294 seats and sat with the Left parties with a formula based on the 2016 poll results. We decided that the Congress and the Left parties would contest the seats they won and the ones where they came second in 2016. There was no other party in the picture when our talks started. They (ISF) came later and now the Congress has been allotted only 92 seats. How can we spare seats for others? Let the talks continue. We hope to reach a conclusion,” Chowdhury said at the party office.Despite the imbroglio in the seat-sharing talks, Biman Bose, Left Front chairman and senior leader of the CPI(M) which has already spared 30 seats for the ISF, held out hope of sorting things out.“We hope the seat-sharing will work out in the next few days,” he said.But another senior Marxist leader who did not wish to be named warned that the Congress’ rigidity could jeopardize the alliance.“If the Congress does not spare seats for the ISF the future of the third front may be jeopardized,” he said.“We still hope that the seat sharing will work out. Chowdhury has not officially communicated anything to us yet. We are not in this contest for our political gains. We represent all secular forces, the Dalits, the backward classes and the tribal people,” ISF president and Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s elder brother Nausad Siddiqui told HT on Monday night.In his speech on Sunday, Abbasuddin Siddiqui said he will not appease the Congress.“Our people will support Left Front candidates in every seat they contest. The Left Front has allowed us to contest around 30 seats. You might be thinking why I did not name the Congress. I want to make it clear that we will not appease anyone. We have come as partners. If anyone offers us the hand of friendship we will accept it,” Siddiqui said at the rally.Chowdhury’s strong reservations about Siddiqui became public at the rally.He stopped his speech when Siddiqui arrived on the dais in the middle of the event and people cheered to greet him. Chowdhury could be heard (over the public address system) telling Biman Bose and CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim that he would end his speech but they persuaded him to continue.“The ISF leader should have been more careful and patient,” Bose said on Monday.“Bose is the state’s most senior politician. We will follow his advice,” said Nausad Siddiqui.Both the Congress and CPI (M) also came under attack from the BJP and the TMC for their ties with the ISF.“The rally made it clear that Abbasuddin Siddiqui is dictating terms to the Congress. How can a party which calls itself secular be led by a religious leader,” said BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta, taking a potshot at Chowdhury.“The CPI(M) and the Congress have both put into question their secular credentials,” said senior TMC leader and panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee.But Bose rubbished the allegations that the Marxists have joined hands with a religious leader with an eye on the elections.“Abbasuddin Siddiqui may be a religious leader but ISF is a secular front. He will not field only Muslims. Members of the tribal community and backward classes will also contest for the ISF," Bose said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-divided-over-alliance-with-cleric-siddiqui-in-bengal-101614619587598.html

This will be the first of the many public meetings Adityanath is scheduled to address in Bengal where the BJP is looking to unseat the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC, which is hoping to win a third consecutive term in the state.“He could be raising the issue of migrant labourers in West Bengal and love jihad. He could also flag the issue of zero tolerance on corruption in UP besides highlighting the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya,” said BJP’s UP unit general secretary Chandra Mohan.BJP leaders said that the UP chief minister, known for his aggressive style of campaigning, has been fielded as a star campaigner for his impact on the Hindu voters.A BJP leader who did not wish to be named said the party’s strategy was to respond to TMC and their leaders in the “most befitting manner”.“In view of the impact on the people of the Hindu community in West Bengal, the BJP leadership has fielded CM Adityanath with the announcement of elections. He will influence the campaign with his aggressive style of campaigning and the considerable influence he wields on voters. That is why he is among the most sought-after leaders,” he said.“In Malda from where Adityanath will begin campaign on Tuesday, he is likely to give a glimpse of the development model of UP. The CM’s public speech would focus on his model of dealing with mafia and criminals in UP, enriching the cultural heritage of the state and the economic growth in the state,” the party leader said.Adityanath has been drafted by the BJP in nearly all election campaigns outside the state.He was the only chief minister of the BJP, who campaigned in the municipal elections in Hyderabad. The effect of his campaign was also seen in the election results, party leaders said.“The BJP won 48 seats in a forceful performance and pushed Asaduddin Owaisi's party to number three. Earlier in the Bihar elections, Yogi Adityanath influenced the results on more than 75 seats in Bihar elections where he held 19 meetings in 17 districts. He highlighted the issue of terror, crime and corruption and helped NDA candidates triumph in 50 of these seats,” the state government’ media wing said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityanath-heads-for-malda-to-begin-poll-campaign-in-bengal-101614615242032.html

It will also provide real-time details of high peak hours’ traffic at toll plazas."There is zero waiting time at 80 per cent of the total toll plazas. Toll collection through electronic tolling has reached 93 per cent from 80 per cent during the last fortnight after the FASTag was made mandatory," Gadkari said.Also read: ‘Against core ideology’ - Anand Sharma on Congress-Indian Secular Front allianceHighlighting the advantages of the live monitoring of toll plazas, the minister said that in a recent incident in Mumbai, where a vehicle was found parked outside an industrialist's house, the officials were able to detect the toll plaza through which the vehicle entered and who was sitting in it. Based on the information, the police is now investigating the case, he said. The Union minister was referring to the incident when a vehicle with explosive material was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in South Mumbai last month.“It is a simple help to improve traffic congestion problem at toll plazas/city roads/highways by using central monitoring system along with bundle of analytics and quick decision-making outputs. This is eventually likely to facilitate saving the commute time, improve customer experience, save fuel wastage cost and reduce carbon footprint. It uses several technologies like Satellite Imagery, GIS, Remote Sensing along with a proprietary algorithm to remotely monitor the congestion status on the roads. The frequency sample of data can be as low as even 1-5 minutes depending on the requirements,” the ministry said in a statement.Gadkari also launched a rating system for highways across the country. The ministry has also released the ratings for 18,668 kilometres of completed 4/6 lane National Highway stretches covering 343 toll plazas. Gadkari said 11,035 kilometres of national highways have been constructed during this year.“This has been done by the NHAI under MoRTH which has taken the initiative to improve its accountability towards road users who pay a user fee for the use of developed National Highways. This initiative has been taken as per the vision of improving the quality of public services. The fundamental objective of highway rating is “minimum time with maximum safety in stress-free environment” from highway users’ perspective,” the ministry said in a statement.Each toll plaza of a highway will be judged based on three major criteria - efficiency, safety and user services. These criteria are further divided into a total of 39 parameters which include average speed, road condition and facilities for public, service road, delay at the toll plaza, accidents, incident response time, wayside amenities and general cleanliness, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fastags-will-save-rs-20-000-crore-per-year-on-fuel-gadkari-101614615354346.html
01-03-2021||India||India sending rice, HCQ tablets as humanitarian assistance to drought-hit Madagascar: MEA||India is sending a consignment of 1,000 metric tonnes of rice and 100,000 hydroxychloroquine tablets to Madagascar in response to the east African country's appeal for assistance to deal with a humanitarian crisis triggered by a severe drought, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Monday.The humanitarian assistance is being delivered on-board Indian Naval Ship Jalashwa, which will leave with the food and medical assistance on March 3 and is expected to reach the Port of Ehoala in Madagascar between March 21 and 24, 2021, the MEA said in a statement.The prompt Indian assistance to the Madagascar government was conveyed by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a phone conversation with Madagascar's Foreign Minister Tehindrazanarivelo Djacoba A S Oliva, the MEA said."Good conversation with FM of Madagascar @Tehindrazanari1. Informed him that Indian humanitarian assistance would be delivered in the coming days. Will include food and medical supplies," Jaishankar tweeted after the call.During the phone conversation, Jaishankar recalled the excellent bilateral ties of friendship between India and Madagascar, and that India has always been among the first responders when it comes to assisting the people of Madagascar in such humanitarian crises.In response to the urgent appeal made by Madagascar for international solidarity and assistance to deal with the humanitarian crisis in South of Madagascar due to severe drought, the government is sending a consignment of 1000 metric tonnes of rice and 100,000 tablets of HCQ to Madagascar, the MEA said.In September 2018, a consignment of 1,000 metric tonnes of rice was delivered on-board an Indian naval vessel to Madagascar.Indian Navy was the first to respond when Cyclone Diane struck Madagascar and prompt assistance was delivered under Operation Vanilla by INS Airavat in January 2020.In March 2020, INS Shardul visited the port of Antisiranana and delivered 600 tonnes of rice as HADR assistance to Madagascar from India for dealing with heavy floods in the Northern region of Madagascar, the statement said.Jaishankar assured his counterpart from Madagascar that as a maritime neighbour across the Indian Ocean, the government and people of Madagascar can always count on the support and solidarity of the government and people of India.The two foreign ministers also discussed other issues of mutual interest.During this trip, INS Jalashwa will also have on board an Indian naval training team, which is being deployed in Madagascar for capacity building and training of the Malagasy Special Forces for two weeks.INS Jalashwa will also call at Port Anjoun in the Republic of Comoros where it will deliver a consignment of 1,000 metric tonnes of Indian rice.The supply of this food assistance was announced by Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu during his visit to Comoros in October 2019.The supplies of food assistance and support for capacity building to the friendly countries of Madagascar and Comoros is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of SAGAR and India's time-tested role as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region, the MEA said.Meanwhile, Jaishankar also spoke with his New Zealand counterpart Nanaia Mahuta for the first time and discussed the Covid-19 challenge as well as the expectations of an early recovery."Our shared interests are expressed bilaterally and in the Indo-Pacific. Look forward to meeting her in person," Jaishankar tweeted.In another tweet, Jaishankar said, "Keeping our CARICOM commitment. Made in India vaccines arrive at Antigua for Antigua & Barbuda, St Kitts & Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent & Grenadines and Suriname."The external affairs minister also retweeted Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne's tweet thanking Prime Minister Modi for the 500,000 AstraZeneca vaccines that he shared with the Caribbean to assist in the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sending-rice-hcq-tablets-as-humanitarian-assistance-to-drought-hit-madagascar-mea-101614614314256.html

It doesn't matter that I had to wait for two hours as it was the first day. I felt no discomfort after getting the vaccine. I will now ride back to my village. The only regret is that my wife couldn't come with me as we have only one helmet. I will now buy one for her today itself and bring her tomorrow," Sahu said.He added, "I have no health issues, not even blood pressure or diabetes. But I was keen to get the vaccine as it will not only protect me from the infection but also protect others. None of my family members stopped me from taking the jab. People should come forward to get the vaccine as this is the only way out to check the spread of the pandemic."Vaccination for the second phase started late at almost every centre across the state on Day 1. Long queues could be seen at few centres as people were made to wait due to some technical reasons including verification of their identities."Vaccination was successfully carried out at all government and private centres on Day 1. People were very interested in taking the vaccine, which is a very positive sign. We are going to scale up the number of vaccination centres across the entire state. Some centres witnessed crowding as the process started late there. But things will be spruced up from tomorrow," state nodal officer (vaccination) Dr Ajit Prasad.Mismanagement could be seen at Ranchi's Sadar hospital where people were kept waiting for hours in the name of verification of identity.Three vaccination rooms and one observation room was set up for the purpose. While vaccination for the second dose of health care workers was carried out in one of the rooms, inoculation of front line workers and senior citizens for the first dose was done in two other rooms.People were seen violating the Covid-19 protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing."I came here after completing online registration. But, here I was asked to go through the verification process first. When I approached for the same, I was told that people who came for the second dose would be dealt first and thereafter the verification process would start," said a senior citizen Anand Shankar Mohanty.Women residing at an old age home at Hesag in Ranchi's Hatia locality were also administered the vaccine on Monday. The district administration facilitated the transportation of these women for vaccination at Doranda's community health centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/80yearold-rides-bike-70-km-to-get-first-shot-of-covid-vaccine-in-ranchi-101614612518054.html
01-03-2021||India||Finance ministry considers cutting taxes on petrol, diesel: Report||India's finance ministry is considering cutting excise duties on petrol and diesel to cushion the impact of record high domestic prices, three government officials close to the discussions said.A doubling in the price of crude oil over the past 10 months has contributed to record fuel prices at gas stations in India. But taxes and duties account for roughly 60% of the retail price of petrol and diesel in the country, the world's third biggest consumer of crude oil.As the coronavirus pandemic hit economic activity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government twice raised taxes on petrol and diesel in the last 12 months to boost sagging tax revenues instead of passing on the benefits of low oil prices last year to consumers.India's Finance Ministry has now started consultations with some states, oil companies and the oil ministry to find the most effective way to lower the tax burden on consumers without federal finances taking a big hit, the sources said."We are discussing ways in which prices can be kept stable. We will be able to take a view of the issue by mid-March," said one of the sources.The sources, who asked not to be named as the deliberations are private, said the government wants oil prices to stabilise before cutting taxes, as it does not want to be forced to change the tax structure again, should crude prices rise further.India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said: "I can't say when we will reduce taxes on fuel, but (the) centre and states have to talk to reduce fuel taxes".India's Finance Ministry and oil ministry did not respond to an email requesting comment.The high fuel prices have prompted some Indian states to cut state-level taxes on petrol and diesel to rein in prices.Another one of the sources said a decision on fuel taxes may only be made following a meeting of OPEC and major oil producers, also known as OPEC+, later this week."There is an expectation that OPEC+ would agree to ease oil output curbs, we hope oil prices will stabilise after their decision," this source said.India has called on OPEC+ to ease production cuts as higher crude prices are hitting fuel demand in Asia's third largest economy and are contributing to inflation.The high fuel prices could also affect Modi's popularity ahead of state assembly polls in four states in March and April.Modi and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are already facing their biggest political challenge in years with tens of thousands of farmers protesting against three farm laws passed by his government in 2020.The federal government and states together raised some 5.56 trillion rupees ($75.22 billion) in revenues from the petroleum sector in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, based on government data.In the nine months of this fiscal year (April-December 2020), contributions from the sector were about 4.21 trillion rupees, despite a significant decline in local fuel demand, the data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-ministry-considers-cutting-taxes-on-petrol-diesel-report-101614611351065.html

And they believe that ongoing farmers’ movement could be an opportunity for them to connect with people in the region and other parts of the state,” a political expert said.The AAP has already announced it would contest the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly.Also read: Union ministers Amit Shah, S Jaishankar get Covid-19 vaccine after PM ModiIn his speech, Kejriwal emphasised that he tried to provide every possible assistance to agitating farmers at the Ghazipur and other borders of the national capital. The farmers are demanding a repeal of the Centre's three contentious farm reform laws.“It should not be an issue for the Union government even if it suffers a loss of ₹1-2 lakh crore by purchasing crops at the MSP (minimum support price) for the happiness of millions of farmers,” he said in the backdrop of the agitation.He also brought up the issue of sugarcane payment arrears. Sugarcane is a very important crop for the region’s rural economy and politics. He asked why the state government was unable to mount pressure for clearance of these dues.The crowd cheered him as he said, “Bring a government of good intentions and it would ensure that mills deposit money in the accounts of farmers before they return to their villages after dumping their load of sugarcane in the mills.”He spoke of how he “tamed” mighty power distribution companies in Delhi to ensure that people get free electricity and an uninterrupted power supply.The AAP chief again said, “If you bring a government with good intentions.... you would (get) free electricity and water in villages.”Kejriwal also criticised the government on the increasing fuel prices and cooking gas cylinders. A person even brought a cooking gas cylinder to the mahapanchayat as a symbolic protest against the increasing prices.AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, who played a key role in holding the mahapanchayat, has been attacking the Yogi Adityanath government over various issues in the last few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-panchayat-part-of-aap-s-plan-to-make-its-presence-felt-in-uttar-pradesh-101614611171985.html

01-03-2021||India||JD (U) rides piggyback on Brand Nitish on CM’s 70th birthday to revive party||After a poor performance in last year’s assembly election in Bihar, the ruling JD (U) on Monday embarked on a mission to leverage Brand Nitish on the chief minister’s 70th birthday to rebuild the party.The party organised programmes at every village across the state as Vikas Diwas to highlight the development work done under Nitish Kumar in the last 15 years.This is the first time that Kumar’s birthday has been celebrated in such a big way by the JD (U).The JD (U) had taken a serious hit in the 2020 assembly election, winning only 43 seats out of 115 it contested. After the shock and dismay, the JD (U) set itself a target to revitalize and rebuild the party from the grassroot level and affected several changes including change of national and state party presidents.“Our leader Nitish Kumar through his tireless work and service has restored the old glory of Bihar. Today people of state are living proudly in any part of the world,” said JD (U) national president R C P Singh, while justifying the celebration of Kumar’s birthday as Vikas Diwas.“He has shown the way by bringing in development with justice. Today, the Centre and several states are emulating schemes brought by him. The JD (U) workers will take his work, schemes of the government to each and every person and that is why we are celebrating his birthday as Vikas Diwas,” reasoned Singh.JD (U) national principal general secretary K C Tyagi described Brand Nitish as a phenomenon that ushered in clean and honest politics.“Post Lalu-Rabri regime, Brand Nitish has emerged as a new phenomenon in Bihar’s politics. Brand Nitish is a phenomenon which stood for good governance, politics sans nepotism and dynastic rule. It stood for development, clean and honest politics. These traits have made him one of the most successful chief ministers of the NDA,” said Tyagi.The party's principal general secretary said that he has served various ministries at Centre and burnished his reputation with his clean image. “We acknowledge that several forces (including LJP) tried to affect Brand Nitish and were able to affect us too. But the party is going to revive the brand which is opposed to sycophancy,” said Tyagi.A 70-pound cake was cut on the occasion at Athawan assembly constituency in Nalanda district, home to both R C P Singh and Nitish Kumar. Gifts, sweets and clothes were distributed among the poor by party leaders at several places.The party has left behind its recent setback in Arunachal Pradesh where six of its seven MLAs joined the ruling BJP and has set its sights on other northeastern states. It has identified 32 out of the 126 assembly seats in Assam where the party may field candidates in the three-phase election in the state between March 27 and April 6. The JD(U) is also contesting the West Bengal assembly election.“What has added to our belief of a better performance in Assam and West Bengal is that people have great respect for Nitish Kumar and they trust him. The development works done by Kumar, especially in Assam’s Nagaon district, during his tenure as Union railway minister when rail lines were laid for over 120 km, is still remembered by people.

And, so all four of us have come for it," said son Rakesh Malhotra, a 63-year-old businessman.Residents of Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi, the Malhotras were very keen to get vaccinated. However, his blood pressure was showing a bit over the normal level, so he waited in the corridor, while his wife and parents, queued up for their turns to receive the Covishield vaccine."My dad retired as a senior officer from Air India and still has keenness to go for a brisk walk in the morning, which he has stopped now due to Covid," Rakesh Malhotra told PTI.He said his 1932-born father had migrated to India from the Pakistan side after the Partition."He survived that and we all have been safe from Covidso far. And, vaccination will further help now. Our PM today led from the front and got the shot himself. It will motivate others to get vaccinated," the son said.Among other family members who showed up in a group of four to get the jabs were the Sharmas and the Sahels, all four Covid survivors.Chader Mohan Sharma, 65, and wife Kavita Sharma, 64 came along with her brother Madhusudan Sahel and spouse Rita Sahel at the NHI vaccination centre.Sharma, who retired from a central government job, said, he and his wife had contracted the infection in November and other family members too were inflected."Even some of little children had Covid-19, and touchwood, we all survived it.

She only did all the Co-WIN registrations for both of us," Anil Chawla said.Asked to compare the raging pandemic period last year and the vaccination drive going on at present, Sunita Chawla said, "It's like black and white, darkness and hope, and hope is very essential in life to survive".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/89yearold-couple-4-family-members-who-survived-covid-19-to-get-jabs-101614603285344.html

On Monday, Singh took to Twitter to announce that Kishor has joined him as his Principal Advisor, nearly 12 months before the northern state goes to polls.“Happy to share that @PrashantKishor has joined me as my Principal Advisor. Look forward to working together for the betterment of the people of Punjab!” Singh tweeted on Monday.Happy to share that @PrashantKishor has joined me as my Principal Advisor.

He will also get an Executive Class travel in train/by air as admissible to a Cabinet Minister.Congress came to power in Punjab in March 2017 with 77 seats in the 117-member state assembly, displacing the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-BJP combine. However, back then Singh reportedly decided to keep Kishor ‘at bay’ in the state, expressing ‘open disdain’ for his ways, especially for campaigns such as ‘Coffee with Captain.’ Also, as per reports, the Congress leader did not care to complete several programmes designed by Kishor’s team to project Singh as the ‘leader of the state.’ This after Kishor and his team ‘rubbed several leaders the wrong way’ in Uttar Pradesh, where the party suffered a drubbing.Kishor, who is currently working with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee ahead of the upcoming West Bengal assembly elections, earlier played a significant role in Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party’s victory in the 2014 general elections. He is also a former ally of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. Last year, he helped Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal in getting re-elected as the chief minister of Delhi.Kishor is also working with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and its president MK Stalin for the forthcoming Tamil Nadu assembly elections.

01-03-2021||India||Tejashwi Yadav meets Mamata Banerjee, offers full support in Bengal polls||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav met Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee Monday afternoon and offered his full support to her in the coming assembly polls in Bengal.“Many people from Bihar and other states reside in Bengal. I appeal to all people from Bihar to unitedly support Mamata Ji. I will use my full strength to support her. This election is about protecting Bengal and its culture, which is unique. This is a fight to save Bengal’s values. Our leader Lalu Prasad Ji wants this,” Yadav said referring to his father, shortly after meeting Banerjee at Nabanna, the state secretariat.Former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav is currently serving jail sentence in the fodder scam case that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) started probing in mid-1990.The RJD will contest a few seats as an ally of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). Yadav arrived in Bengal two days ago and held meetings with party workers.“At a time when the nation’s ministers should be working hard to save the country and the people they are all camping in Bengal. The BJP is spreading lies. It is selling the assets of the nation, such as the railways and the Steel Authority of India,” said Yadav.Banerjee was present when the young RJD leader was talking to reporters.“I congratulate Tejashwi. He is a young leader. The BJP used all kinds of tricks to stop him from winning the Bihar elections. But I know he will lead Bihar very soon. The way Laloo Prasad Ji is suffering in jail is unfair. The BJP should get the message. Wherever Tejashwi is fighting, I am fighting. And where I am fighting, he is fighting. You (BJP) cannot win this election no matter how hard you control the media and how big you talk,” said Banerjee.Yadav accused the BJP of not doing anything for the development of Bihar. “They did not even make Patna University a Central university. They promised to generate 20,00,000 jobs but nothing has happened. During the Covid-19 lockdown labourers from Bihar were treated badly. Nothing was done to send them home from other states. People died while walking on highways and were run down by trains. Their numbers were more than those who died of Covid-19,” said Yadav.“In sharp contrast, Mamata ji was on the streets, helping people. No matter how much we praise her, it won’t be enough,” said Yadav.The RJD is an ally of the Congress in Bihar and the two parties are trying to contest the Assam election together.Asked whether the RJD's support to the TMC against which the Congress is contesting in Bengal, would affect his party's political equations with the grand old party, Yadav said, "Our alliance with Congress is in Bihar. These alliances depend on political situations which vary from region to region."Bengal Congress leaders did not comment on Yadav's statements till Monday evening.The RJD and Maharashtra's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders held talks with TMC leaders last month and agreed to form an alliance against the BJP in the Bengal assembly polls.Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal (United), or JDU, the Samajwadi Party (SP) from Uttar Pradesh; Jharkhand’s ruling party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena have also decided to contest the polls either in alliance with the TMC or independently.The entry of the regional parties has triggered the possibility of a split in votes cast by Hindi-speaking and tribal people.A large number of people with roots in Bihar are permanent residents of Bengal. The state is also home to a large number of migrant workers from Bihar.BJP’s Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh brushed aside any threat to the party from the RJD’s alliance with the TMC."Many regional parties were seen supporting Mamata Banerjee before the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 but we have seen how they faced defeat. They will face the same fate again. Those who lack confidence need crutches. We are confident of winning more than 200 seats," Ghosh said.While the BJP has been claiming that it will win more than 200 of the 294 assembly seats in the state while election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by Banerjee in 2019 after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, has announced on social media that he will leave his profession if the saffron party bags more than 99 seats.BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh, who formed the TMC’s Hindi cell before joining the saffron camp in 2019, recently told HT that no regional party can make any difference in the coming polls since it is a direct contest between the BJP and TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-yadav-meets-mamata-banerjee-offers-full-support-in-bengal-polls-101614602762971.html

We have killed corona. Farmers’ immunity level is strong because they work hard on their fields. Farmers are not afraid of coronavirus,” Rajewal told PTI.Another senior leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan (75) said the fear of contracting the disease is "not enough" to distract them from their fight."There is no corona for farmers. I will not get vaccine shots, but we will not ask anyone to not get the shot," said the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), which is leading the protest at Delhi's Tikri border.However, Dharmendra Malik, the media in-charge of Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait who is leading the protest at the Ghazipur border, said if the local administration makes arrangements for protesting farmers, Tikait will not have any problem getting vaccinated.The 70-year-old Kulwant Singh Sandhu, a member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, said he will not receive the vaccine shot."We are not afraid of coronavirus. Thousands of farmers are staging sit-in protests at Delhi borders, but not a single case of coronavirus has been detected there," Sandhu said.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his first dose of Covid-19 vaccine at the AIIMS here and appealed to all those who are eligible to get inoculated.“Took my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against Covid-19," he tweeted."I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine.

Modi said.The second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive began on Monday in the country.In the first phase, starting January 16, over 3.6 lakh beneficiaries comprising healthcare workers and frontline workers, have been vaccinated in Delhi.On Monday, the drive began to give jabs to persons aged 60 and above, and those in 45-59 age bracket with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-afraid-of-coronavirus-won-t-take-jabs-farmer-leaders-in-vulnerable-age-group-101614602073483.html
01-03-2021||India||PM taking Covid-19 vaccine a powerful message: NHA chief RS Sharma||As the government opened up vaccination to the general public today in phase 2 of its Covid vaccination drive, Hindustan Times’ Sunetra Choudhury spoke to the man who is responsible for the system of registration. National Health Authority (NHA) chairperson RS Sharma, who oversaw the Aadhaar drive, told HT that the government expects vaccination to scale up from the current 800,000 per day to at least 2.7 million daily in this phase. Edited excerpts: The Prime Minister got his jab this morning. What kind of an impact will it have?It’s the most positive message to everybody, especially those who were doubting the vaccine, feared that it will have side effects. The PM taking the jab is a very, very powerful message. He has been the spirit behind the entire citizen-centric approach we have taken from today. Can you clarify the registration process? Initially, it was meant to be via CoWIN app but now we are told that it is only through the website.Glad to clarify as I have also been sent screenshots saying this part is not working. There are, as of now, only two inlets, so to speak, besides the walk-in. One is the website (cowin.gov.in) where you can register up to four persons by providing your mobile number. Once you register, you can schedule appointments. The other way is through the Aarogya Setu app which has created an extension where you can also go and register. So was it decided later on to not have a different app?No, the confusion was not created by the government nor was there any miscommunication. Confusion gets created by WhatsApp messages, etc. We have always maintained that there will only be two sources besides being able to walk in and get yourself registered and get vaccinated immediately, provided there is vacancy. In future, in the next couple of months, people can create their own apps, get it certified and register people.Also Read | No issue in CoWIN portal, walk-in systems to be streamlined: Harsh VardhanAt what stage does one choose their slot?After you register, you can go back to the website or the Aarogya Setu app. When you log in, you can see your details and then you schedule the appointment. The two-step process (registering and then scheduling) is so that you can choose slots of your choice or at a time you want to. You can also reschedule as many times as you want. Suppose you have a slot tomorrow and something urgent comes up, you can just reschedule on the site. The idea is that the vacancy created by your change can be taken by someone else. Earlier, it was the health and frontline workers and now, it is a demand-driven situation. So, the possibility of no-show is much less.So how has been the response?Well, 1.5 million people have registered thus far (3pm). If there are two people registered with one phone number, then we can assume there are 3 million registrations. I think people are quite willing to take the vaccine and there is a huge demand at this point of time. The software is capable of handling any numbers at this point of time. We have scaled up our system. There may be some issues on the SMS gateway (for OTP generation) but otherwise, our infrastructure at the back-end can handle it.How do think the pace of vaccination will be impacted? Till now, less than 1% population has been vaccinated. Going by that speed, it will take years to complete the process.I am not involved with the numbers but more like a plumber, providing support to this drive. As an individual, however, I see a huge spurt in numbers and we’ll be able to scale up very fast. It also depends on private sector hospitals’ speed, also on the supply, etc. We have a total of 12,500 private hospitals that have come on board today and 15,000 hospitals in the public sector. So 27,500 institutions in all, and even at a conservative estimate of each one vaccinating 100 people, we will have over 2.7 million inoculations in a day. How many people were we vaccinating in the previous phase?We have clocked 800,000 vaccinations a day, which was the maximum. So we will clock better, but estimating numbers isn’t my area.What percentage of our healthcare and frontline workers would you say have been covered already?I think we have done fairly well. I don’t know exact numbers but, about 80%, maybe more. How will the walk-in option for vaccination work?Walk-in is for slots which have not been filled up. For instance, suppose there are 100 vials for the public, and there have been a few no-shows. If it’s 3pm or 4pm, then you could walk into a centre and get that shot. In rural areas, we will motivate people to walk in and get vaccinated. The system is flexible enough to allow online scheduling and also to provide documents and get instant vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmtaking-covid-19-vaccine-a-powerful-message-nha-chief-rssharma-101614602002483.html
01-03-2021||India||Bombay HC sets aside quota in Goa municipal polls for constitutional breach||The Bombay High Court at Goa has quashed and set aside the notifications for reservations to five of the 11 municipal councils that are scheduled to go to polls later this month ruling that the reservations were arbitrary and without application of mind besides also violated the principles laid down in the constitution.In a judgment pronounced on Monday while disposing a bunch of petitions which challenged various aspects of the notification issued by the State Director of Municipal Administration, the court ruled that the government erred in failing to ensure a minimum of 33% seats are reserved for women besides also pointed out to irregularities in reservations for other categories including for Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and other backward classes.Instead the Court has directed that the Director of Municipal Administration issue a fresh notification within 10 days from Monday, thereby ensuring inter alia, reservation for women of not less than one-third of the total number of seats reserved for direct elections to the Municipal Councils.The elections which were scheduled for March 20 will have to be rescheduled for the five councils while the six others for which the order doesn't apply are expected to go ahead as scheduled. Municipal elections in Goa are not held on party lines.The primary grouse of those who approached the High Court was that the Director of Municipal Administration failed to reserve ‘no less than’ 33% seats for women pointing out that the number of seats reserved for women was less than 33% largely because the state ‘rounded-off’ the fraction to the lower limit rather than the upper limit, which the court ruled could not be applicable.“The expression used in the Constitution as well as in the Municipalities Act, being "not less than" or "no less than", make it clear that even a fraction cannot be ignored because by ignoring the same, the reservation would be minimized than 1/3rd and if it is done so, it would amount to infraction of the constitutional mandate,” the High Court bench of Justice M S Sonak and Bharati Dangre, ruled.“The fraction even if it is created in calculating 1/3rd reservation cannot be permitted to be rounded off towards the earlier denomination and the normal principle for rounding off, which is based on logic and common sense; "if part is one half or more, its value shall be increased to one and if less than one half the value shall be ignored", cannot be made applicable here,” the High Court ruled.“The Director after having admitted that there was no policy based on which the reservation has been made or rotation policy implemented, appears to have regarded the absence of such policy as a licence to make reservations based on his whims and caprices. Different yardsticks have been applied in respect of different Municipal Councils,” the High Court also said.Opposition parties which had accused the government of malicious intent in the reservation policy have claimed that the verdict was a slap on the face of the Pramod Sawant-led government.“With [the] High court striking down the Director of Municipal Administration Notification dated 4th February 2021 on Municipal Ward Reservations, It is [the] beginning of [the] End of @BJP4Goa Governments Jumla Raj with Manipulations in Electoral Polls.

The Trinamool, on its part, termed it "fake news".The BJP said the woman is the mother of Gopal Majumdar, a local party worker, who was attacked by TMC supporters. The woman, who lives with her son, was also assaulted, the BJP alleged and posted her photographs and videos on social media. In the video, the woman could be heard telling a news channel that TMC supporters barged into her house around 4:30 am and assaulted her and her son. She also said that she could not identify the assaulters. "They told me not to disclose who did this," the 82-year-old woman said.Agnimitra Paul, president of the women’s front of the Bengal BJP, visited Majumdar on Monday afternoon and demanded that the alleged assaulters be arrested.“Chief minister Mamata Banerjee claims to be the daughter of Bengal but there is no respect for a mother in her state,” said Paul.The TMC leadership alleged that the BJP was spreading fake news to gain political mileage before the assembly elections. “No TMC worker assaulted the woman. It is fake news,” said panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee.Education minister Partha Chatterjee said in a tweet that the woman was a victim of family feud. He also tweeted a video in which a man who identified himself as the grandson of the woman denied that she was assaulted.“There is no truth in this. My grandmother is bedridden for three years. When I heard about the alleged assault I went to her house. I asked her how can the TMC be dragged into an internal feud of the BJP. Nobody assaulted my grandmother,” Gobinda Majumdar said.An official of the Nimta police station said on condition of anonymity that they would look into the allegation once a written complaint is made.West Bengal elections will be held in eight phases from March 27 to April 29, making it the longest ever polls in the state. The results will be declared on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-vs-trinamool-now-over-attack-on-82-year-old-woman-in-bengal-101614600452508.html
01-03-2021||India||Brace for very hot days and warm nights in NW India this summer||The entire Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) region, including Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, is likely to experience both hot days and warm nights during the March to May season, according to India Meteorological Department’s seasonal outlook for the pre-monsoon season on Monday.Above-normal seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures are likely over most subdivisions of north, northwest and northeast India, few subdivisions of the eastern and western parts of central India and few coastal subdivisions of northern peninsular India according to the outlook. Below-normal maximum temperatures are likely over some subdivisions of the southern peninsula and adjoining central India.Also Read | Delhi: February this year second warmest since 1901, says IMDOver the IGP region, there is a 60% to 70% probability that maximum temperatures are likely to be 0.56 to 0.71 degrees Celsius above normal while minimum temperatures are likely to be about 0.12 degrees Celsius above normal. There is a 70% to 100% probability that maximum temperatures in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and the Konkan region in the west coast will be 0.66 to 0.86 degrees Celsius above normal.The probability forecast for minimum temperatures indicates that above-normal minimum temperatures are likely over most of the subdivisions of north India along the foothills of Himalayas, northeast India, western part of central India and, and southern parts of peninsular India. Most of the subdivisions of east and adjoining central India, and few subdivisions of extreme northern part of the country are, however, likely to experience below-normal minimum temperatures.Interestingly, the outlook also states that currently, moderate La Niña conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific, and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are below normal over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The latest Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) forecast indicates that La Niña conditions are likely to sustain during the upcoming hot weather season from March to May.“Yes, La Niña has a cooling influence but La Niña is not the only factor that the model considers. There is climate change and other variations which can impact weather. So even if La Niña conditions are moderate, it doesn’t necessarily mean a less warm summer. Frequency of heat waves is likely to be higher in northwest India, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Konkan, etc. We also have to remember that this model only gives us an average for the season. There can be large day-to-day variations which will be highlighted in IMD’s daily forecasts,” explained DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD, Pune.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above-average rains and colder winters.IMD is preparing new policies for better preparedness during summer. It will issue heat wave warnings valid up to five days daily which will be updated by the national weather forecasting centre. Impact-based heat wave warning will also be issued wherein the general public is advised how to protect themselves. For example, if a severe heat wave is likely to persist for more than two days or total number of heat wave days are likely to persist for over six days then extreme care will be suggested for vulnerable people. There will be a high likelihood of developing heat illness and heat stroke among all age groups during such conditions. IMD will also provide meteorological support to states and districts for preparation of heat action plans. A GIS-based web page has been created for heat wave warnings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brace-for-very-hot-days-and-warm-nights-in-nw-india-this-summer-101614599302123.html

The Chief Minister must take back his decision of lockdown in the Amarvati. People are struggling in that part already and lockdown is causing more problems to them as they are already on streets and it is outrageous," he said.He further said that there are discrepancies in the Covid-19 test and its numbers in that area, because of this Amravati is getting a bad reputation in the country.Amid a surge in coronavirus cases in the past few days, the Maharashtra government has imposed a lockdown in Amravati.Meanwhile, Maharashtra has reported 8,293 new Covid-19 cases, 3,753 recoveries and 62 deaths in the last 24-hours, the State Health Department informed on Sunday."The state has so far reported a total of 21,55,070 Covid-19 cases, out of which, 77,008 are the active cases," the Maharashtra Health Department said.A total of 52,154 people have died due to Covid-19 in the state so far.

01-03-2021||India||‘Disastrous’, say green activists as J-K govt gives free pass to stone crushers||The Jammu and Kashmir government's recent decision to do away with licenses to start operation of stone crushers and hot and wet mixing plants has sparked outrage among environmentalist who have warned that the step could have disastrous consequences for the union territoryLast week, the government notified the J&K Stone Crushers/ Hot and Wet Mixing Plants Regulation Rules, 2021 which dispensed with the requirement of a license to start operation of stone crushers/ hot and wet mixing plants in Jammu and Kashmir to promote ‘ease of doing business’ by creating a business-friendly environment."The decision will facilitate establishment and functioning of stone crushers, hot and wet mixing plants and boost the supply of raw material required in the construction sector. This will also expedite completion of various mega-projects in Jammu and Kashmir," said the government notification.Environmentalists have flagged the decision and described it as dangerous for Jammu and Kashmir."This will certainly affect the environment. The question is who will determine the site of a crusher plant, where will the materials come from and who will determine its output? The more the crushers the more the chances of pollution increase even if all the requirements are complied with. Besides, there will be more possibilities of illegal mining," said Gowhar Ahmad, an environmentalist.He said that Kashmir is already facing a dust problem and the crushers will aggravate the problem.Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an RTI and environment activist said that instead of promoting industrial units with less carbon emissions, the government has given free hand to pollution causing industries. "This will lead to a disaster and also cause pollution and destroy our streams and rivers."Jalal Jeelani, an environment film maker also said the decision will lead to more pollution. "We have already lost many wetlands, streams and hills due to human interference. This will open more doors for pollution and nobody will be able to stop it."According to the government notification, the new rules recognize a stone crusher/hot and wet mixing plant as a mineral-based (raw material) processing unit different from those involved in mineral mining activity."As such, the applicability of provisions regulating the working of industrial units has been extended to cover these units, thus, doing away with the need of obtaining respective licenses from the Mining Department. However, if a stone crusher/hot and wet mixing plant undertakes mining of minerals as an additional line of activity, it shall then be additionally governed by the rules applicable to mining industrial units," the notification said.It also said the new rules make it obligatory on the mineral processing units to procure minor minerals from a valid mining concessionaire registered with the Mining Department. The Department has been authorized to inspect such units, ascertain the source of the raw material and undertake seizure of the illegally sourced minerals."The decision provides major relief to the entrepreneurs by removing the burden of double registrations wherein the unit holders had to go through the rigorous procedures of registrations and licensing with the Industries and Commerce Department as well as the Mining Department," the notification said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disastrous-say-green-activists-as-j-k-govt-gives-free-pass-to-stone-crushers-101614595184270.html

Accordingly, action has been taken to address these threats.""NCIIPC informed through mail on Feb 12 about threat by Red Echo through malware Shadow Pad that 'Chinese state-sponsored threat Actor group known as Red Echo is targeting Indian Power sector's Regional Load Dispatch Centres along with State Load Dispatch Centres'," the ministry added.It also said that the government took prompt action by blocking all IP addresses and domains listed in NCIIPC mail.

Let the government hold talks when it has the time," he said.Tikait also said farmers’ "mahapanchayats" will be held at several places in the country till March 24.When asked about the violence during a tractor parade on the Republic Day in New Delhi, he alleged that the government created the trouble.On the issue of farmers destroying their standing crop at different places, Tikait said the BKU has told farmers that the time for such action has not come yet."But why is the government not appealing to farmers not to take such a step," he asked.Tikait said farmers will intensify their agitation if the wheat crop is not sold on the minimum support price (MSP) in Uttar Pradesh and they will hold dharnas outside district headquarters across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govts-silence-indicates-it-is-planning-steps-against-farmers-stir-tikait-101614595270403.html

At least 18 people were killed and 30 more injured when Myanmar police fired on protesters across the country on Sunday, the UN human rights office said, citing credible information it had received. It said the use of lethal force against non-violent demonstrators is “never justifiable” under international human rights norms. “Embassy of India is deeply saddened by loss of lives in Yangon and other cities of Myanmar [on Sunday]. We express our heartfelt condolences to families and loved ones of those deceased,” the Indian embassy in Yangon said on Twitter. “We would urge all to exercise restraint and resolve issues through dialogue in a peaceful manner,” it added. Also Read | Myanmar court files 2 more charges against Suu Kyi; protesters march againThe deaths on Sunday marked the bloodiest day in weeks of protests against the February 1 military coup. The deaths occurred as a result of live ammunition fired into crowds in Yangon, Dawei, Mandalay, Myeik, Bago and Pokokku, UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said. Since the beginning of the coup, police and security forces have targeted an “ever-increasing number of opposition voices and demonstrators by arresting political officials, activists, civil society members, journalists and medical professionals”, Shamdasani said. On Sunday, police detained at least 85 medical professionals and students and seven journalists who were at demonstrations. More than 1,000 people were arbitrarily arrested and detained without due process in February, and some of them remain unaccounted for, Shamdasani added. India has adopted a cautious position on the developments in Myanmar because of its good relations with both the civilian leadership and the military, as well as its security concerns linked to the northeastern states. India’s security forces have worked with their Myanmar counterparts in recent years to pressure militant groups from the northeast that have bases in the neighbouring country. Soon after the coup, India had expressed deep concern and emphasised its support for the process of democratic transition in Myanmar. It also called for the rule of law and the democratic process to be upheld.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerned-by-loss-of-lives-in-myanmar-india-calls-for-restraint-101614595101738.html

We (judges) are sitting at a distance," Justice Shinde said.He referred to the incident of 60 advocates testing positive for Covid-19 at Amravati district in Maharashtra."Fortunately, we have not had any untoward incident here. We are going in the right direction and we don't want to go back to hearing cases virtually," Justice Shinde said. He asked everyone, including lawyers, to wear masks at all times.Justice Gautam Patel of HC had last month issued a notice complaining of overcrowding in court and had directed everyone to strictly adhere to safety norms.Last week, Justice Prithviraj Chavan had refused to hear a case as the lawyer appearing in the matter had removed his mask.Amid the outbreak and lockdown, the HC had suspended physical hearings in April last year and began conducting hearings for urgent matters through video conferencing system.It subsequently began a combination of virtual and physical hearings, and in December last year, resumed physical hearing for almost all cases.Currently, all courts in HC function at full capacity, hearing cases physically from Monday to Thursday.On Fridays, some courts conduct virtual hearings for cases where the lawyers or parties are not based in Mumbai, or, if there is a specific request for such hearings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-judge-warns-against-overcrowding-in-court-101614591703710.html

We must come forward and take whichever vaccine is available. There's been controversy comparing one vaccine to other, that has also been laid to rest today," Guleria told news agency ANI."PM took Covid-19 vaccine and showed that we must do the same when turn comes. It will go long way in getting over vaccine hesitancy. All over 60 years of age and those above 45 years with comorbidities must take vaccine. It's the only way to come out of pandemic," he added.Guleria added that PM Modi wanted to put the nursing officers at ease and therefore he joked, talked to them in local language and enquired where they were from. "It really helped because nurses were not aware of whom they would be vaccinating," he said."This (PM receiving Covid vaccine jab) will be a big game-changer. I am sure a large number of people will come and take the vaccine. We have opened many sites to accommodate people, both in govt and private sector.

01-03-2021||India||‘Not a shot fired’: Ceasefire brings peace to India-Pak border, big test ahead||A renewed pledge last week by India and Pakistan to adhere to a ceasefire pact along the Line of Control (LoC) and international border in Jammu and Kashmir is working on the ground, people aware of the matter said but underscored that the truce would face its biggest test over the next few months when the snow, which clogs infiltration routes, starts melting.“The ceasefire is a win-win for India and Pakistan and for the border population in the two countries,” said a top police officer in Jammu and Kashmir after the first review of the ceasefire starting May 24 midnight indicated that it had led to a huge change on the ground. “Not a single shot has been fired along the border since the ceasefire came into force,” the officer said.The two armies announced the ceasefire after a discussion between India’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha, and his Pakistani counterpart, Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria on February 22. Diplomatic and military back channels had been preparing the ground for the discussion for monthsAlso Read: The difficult path to Indo-Pak peaceIn a statement released three days later, the defence ministry said the two sides agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns that could disturb the peace to achieve “mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders”. The promise to adhere to the ceasefire agreement of November 2003 came into effect from January 24 midnight.The peace along the border comes after firing and shelling by border guards on both sides for several years. The incidents had peaked in 2020 when, according to data tabled in Parliament last month, Indian security forces reported 5,133 ceasefire violations; an average of 14 every day or one violation every two hours.According to data compiled by the Border Security Force alone, there have been 302 instances of cross-border firing after 1 August 2020 till 25 February when the ceasefire pact kicked in. Of these, 67 cross-border firing incidents were reported in the first two months of this year. Nearly 95% of these 302 firing incidents reported from the border are under the BSF’s Indreshwar Nagar sector headquarter.The BSF guards the international border with Pakistan and is also deployed at some locations along the Line of Control under the army’s command.Indian security forces responded to these violations and lately started the use of extended range Excalibur shells that can target important towns across the border to retaliate the Pakistani army targeting villages on this side of the fence. In the last three years alone, 341 civilians had died in the border firing that included small arms and artillery shelling.Haji Mohd Shafi, village head of Pukharni, a border village in Jammu’s Rajouri district, thanked prime ministers of the two countries for the ceasefire. “We can now sleep and work in peace,” he told news agency ANI.Indian security officials, however, conceded that the ceasefire would face its biggest test over the next few months when the snow on the high mountain passes starts melting. This is when attempts to infiltrate terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir start to increase.In the past, Pakistani Rangers often opened fire on the Indian side to give the terrorists cover fire. Or to distract Indian border guards away from locations and routes being used by the terrorists to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir.If this happens again, it would bring the stated intentions of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan’s army into question, an official said.To be sure, PM Khan has attempted to put the onus to create an “enabling environment for further progress” in bilateral ties on India. “I welcome restoration of the ceasefire along the LOC. The onus of creating an enabling environment for further progress rests with India,” Khan tweeted on Saturday, his first reaction to the ceasefire by the two armies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guns-go-silent-along-india-pakistan-border-after-ceasefire-big-test-next-101614589848098.html

The TDP has alleged that the YSR Congress, with the help of police, is forcing the opposition candidates to withdraw their nominations in the municipal elections scheduled to be held on March 10.“Political parties are taking out rallies on account of elections and thousands of pilgrims are visiting Tirumala temple. Why are you imposing restrictions only on us?” TDP chief Naidu asked policemen.Several TDP leaders from Chittoor district, including former minister N Amarnath Reddy, former MLA M Sugunamma, MLC BN Dorababu and district TDP president Pulivarthi Nani were kept under house arrest.The TDP leaders held dharnas at the Mahatma Gandhi statues in Chittoor and Tirupati towns in protest against the alleged atrocities by the YSR Congress Party leaders in the municipal elections.The police, however, have refused to give permission to stage any dharnas citing the coronavirus pandemic and also because of the enforcement of the model code of conduct that prohibits any agitation by any political party.Naidu landed in Tirupati airport at around 10.30 am to take part in the dharna programmes of the TDP. Senior police officials who were already present at the airport detained him.The police authorities refused to concede the request of Naidu to allow him to at least submit a memorandum to the district collector and superintendent of police. They seized the mobile phones of Naidu and his associates.When the police served him with a notice stating that he would have to be arrested if he violated the prohibitory orders, an angry Naidu squatted on the floor at the airport lounge in protest. With folded hands, the police officials pleaded with him not to create disturbance at the airport, but the leader was unmoved.They said the collector and the SP would come to the airport to receive his representations. As an opposition leader, he had every right to meet the officials, the leader asserted.According to latest reports, the authorities are making efforts to send the TDP chief back to Amaravati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrababu-naidu-detained-at-tirupati-stages-sit-in-at-airport-floor-101614588764443.html

That shows who stands by corruption," he said in an apparent reference to Modi holding the hands of the two leaders at a government function here last month."Corruption, commission, collection" is an oft repeated statement by Stalin to target the ruling AIADMK over graft charges.Further, Stalin said seat-sharing talks in the DMK-led alliance have commenced from Sunday while the party manifesto was also getting ready.A 'special' meeting will be held on March 7 at Tiruchirappalli by the party where he will release a 10-year "vision document" to make Tamil Nadu numero uno in all sectors in a decade, Stalin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mk-stalin-says-bjp-sided-with-corrupt-aiadmk-in-reply-to-amit-shah-s-remarks-101614587694210.html

The government has expanded the vaccinations campaign and under which citizens aged above 60 years and those above 45 years with comorbidities will be given the shot against the coronavirus disease. PM Modi reached New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) early in the morning where he was given the indigenously developed Covaxin by Sister P Niveda. He told Niveda that the jab was administered so quickly that he didn’t even feel it. “Laga bhi di, pata hi nahi chala (Is it done already? Didn’t even feel it)”, he said to the nurse from Puducherry. Modi also urged eligible citizens to show up at vaccination centres to get the shot and contribute to making India Covid-19 free. “I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India COVID-19 free!" he wrote on Twitter.Here’s a look at the photos of PM Modi taking the vaccine doing the rounds on social media:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-takes-homegrown-covaxin-shot-interacts-with-health-staff-in-photos-101614580032954.html
01-03-2021||India||Covid-19: A year later, how politics changed and did not change||To discern any change in politics — and remember changes in politics are, more often than not, incremental and take years to have a noticeable impact — the first clue is political vocabulary. The coinage of new terms reflect new ideas, and in turn, get reflected in political communication. Once the vocabulary gains legitimacy or appeal, there is an impact on both political mobilisation — it is ideas that constitute the basis for any organised activity — as well as policymaking — these ideas, when in power, get translated into action. This, then, generates debate and opposition, and ideas which had, till then, enjoyed limited traction, become a part of everyday discourse. A year after Covid-19 hit the national capital, it is instructive to examine — from the prism of politics — what has changed and what has not. Vocabulary offers a clue. On March 1, 2020, when the first case hit the national capital, no one had thought that terms such as mahaamaari (pandemic), do gaj doori (six feet distance, to describe social distancing), lockdown, migrant workers, unlock, corona warriors (to hail frontline workers), RT-PCR (the gold standard for Covid-19 testing), testing labs, Covishied and Covaxin (the two vaccines currently deployed in India), and aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) would become a part of everyday discourse in India. No one had thought that the idea of video conferencing between the prime minister and state chief ministers or between the prime minister and world leaders would become such a regular occurrence that it wouldn’t be even seen as a departure from the older physical format of meetings. Also Read | Covid-19 cases in India may rise as summer will force people indoors: ExpertNo one had thought that the impact of Covid-19 — reflected in this new discourse and new methods of interaction — would result in swasthya, health, becoming a public policy priority of the highest order, with increases in budgets and allocations and renewed commitment to health-related institutions. No one had thought that demand for better health care, more facilities for health workers and speedier vaccination would come from below in the crowded political marketplace of demands. And no one had thought that the link between health and economy — reflected in the long march of migrants back home — would become so starkly clear. Yet, all of this has happened. And that reflects the story of political transformation in India 2020-21. But alongside, it is important to remember what has not changed. Politics remains driven as much by real or perceived identity-related grievances. There remains a powerful Centre, led by a dominant Bharatiya Janata Party, which has, for most part, so far, been able to politically overcome the disruption caused by the pandemic. There remains a weak national Opposition, which has neither been able to present an alternative model of how they would have dealt with the pandemic and associated challenges or leverage the discontent the pandemic produced among citizens. There remains an even greater economic challenge of generating jobs at a time when inequality has only become more stark and more starkly visible. There remains both cooperation and discord in India’s federal structure, with differences between the Centre and states ruled by non-BJP forces. There remains the everyday staple of political rhetoric, as can be seen in states going for polls over the next eight weeks. And there remain questions about the health of India’s institutions and whether democracy can navigate the dominance of one party while ensuring checks on it. But along with this, the change is palpable. There may be differences on the quantum of public spending on health, but there is little doubt that no government can now afford to go to the people without a report card on what it has done to handle the pandemic and improve health systems. There may be differences on the quantum and nature of welfare spending, but political parties cannot discard the idea of State support to the vulnerable — at a time when instruments of welfare came to the rescue of India’s poorest citizens. Also Read | India begins next phase to vaccinate its elderly and ill against Covid-19There may be differences on the Centre’s new economic paradigm of embracing reforms and the private sector, but it clearly stems from a sense that the political economy cannot function in business-as-usual mode if India is to become “self-reliant” — and remember, the idea of self reliance itself is a product of the pandemic which disrupted global supply chains, brought home the reality of dependence on China, and the need to develop autonomously. And there may be differences on India’s foreign policy posture, but the pandemic has added to the urgency of making difficult geopolitical choices. The change is palpable in unlikely realms too, including the government’s relationship with big tech. Political communication — if you are on the side of the ruling dispensation or a part of the Opposition or a member of civil society organising protests — has become overwhelmingly dependent on digital communication. And while the dispute between sovereign States and online platforms was a long time coming, it is perhaps not a coincidence that this has intensified in recent months as the value of digital platforms has become even more pronounced. The pandemic has affected both social and economic structures. And if this is the case, politics and governance cannot be divorced from the underlying changes. It is still too soon — India is still confronting the pandemic — to accurately gauge the nature and scale of changes. It is also tempting to underplay the continuities and overplay the disruption . But what is clear is that the pandemic presented, arguably, one of the most difficult challenges the Indian State has confronted. When it emerges from it, scarred but also healed, the State — just like citizens — will not be the same. It will be better, in some ways, and it may be worse, in other ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19a-year-later-how-politics-changed-and-did-not-change-101614582021499.html

Our party organisation used to run from two rooms. Now, the party has expanded and the BJP formed the government on its own by winning maximum seats. Therefore, the party should have its offices in every district of the country and there should be arrangements for party workers to function,” said Nadda, explaining the party’s expansion drive.Nadda said the party's target was to build 700 party offices in the country, out of which, 400 have been built. He said out of the 80 BJP offices to be built in UP, 53 BJP have been built and the remaining 27 will be built by 2021. These offices, Nadda said, will be a medium for the party workers to inculcate quality values.Nadda said that the party office was equipped with all digital facilities, including e-library, conference hall, and video conferencing hall, however, it was only a hardware, which needed the software of party workers to gather new information and impart new vision and direction to the society, while working for the party’s development.Also Read: Kashi BJP gets hi-tech office, Nadda calls it 'medium' for best quality valuesHe claimed that since the BJP was working to carry the country forward, therefore, those with the opportunity to work in the BJP were lucky.“In India, all the national parties became regional parties.

Retail fuel prices had marked a record high on February 27 when the rate of per litre petrol went up by 24 paise and that of diesel increased by 15 paise for every litre in Delhi.The prices of petrol and diesel in New Delhi on Monday stood at ₹91.17 per litre and ₹81.47 per litre respectively. In Mumbai, the price of petrol stood at ₹97.57 per litre and the price of diesel stood at ₹88.60 per litre. In other metro cities like Chennai fuel prices retailed at ₹93.11 for petrol, and at ₹86.45 for diesel. In poll-bound Kolkata, where the ruling government cut value-added tax (VAT) on fuels by Re 1 on February 20, petrol prices remained steady at ₹91.35 per litre and diesel stood at ₹84.35 per litre.The price of petrol and diesel has been witnessing a rise this month as oil companies keep increasing prices. Union minister for petroleum, natural gas and steel Dharmendra Pradhan said on Sunday that he has asked his counterparts in major oil-producing nations to ramp up production so Indians can be relieved of exorbitant fuel prices. Pradhan also said that fuel prices will witness a drop once winter ends.“Increase in petroleum price in the international market has affected consumers too.

01-03-2021||India||Chinese hacker groups target at least dozen Indian organisations||Was a power outage that shut down Mumbai’s stock exchange and train services last October linked to the reported intrusion by Chinese state-sponsored groups into the computer networks of Indian power utilities and load dispatch centres? That’s the question being asked in cyber security circles after Recorded Future, a US-based security consultancy reported that Chinese groups had intruded into the networks of at least a dozen Indian state-run organisations since mid-2020 in an attempt to insert malware that could cause widespread disruptions. Among the organisations targeted were NTPC Limited, the country’s largest power conglomerate, five key regional load dispatch centres that help in the management of the national power grid by balancing electricity supply and demand, and the ports at Mumbai and Tuticorin, says the new study by Recorded Future, which tracks the use of the internet by state actors for cyber-campaigns. All 12 organisations would qualify as critical infrastructure, according to the Indian National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre’s (NCIIPC) definition. The activity apparently began much before clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in May 2020, which triggered the border standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and there was a “steep rise” from the middle of last year in the use of a particular malware linked to Chinese state-sponsored groups to target “a large swathe of India’s power sector”, Recorded Future said. The report further said the alleged intrusions by the Chinese groups, some with known links to the Ministry of State Security (MSS), or China’s main intelligence and security agency, and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), were not limited to the power sector. There were apparent efforts to target numerous government and defence organisations, the report said. “In the lead-up to the May 2020 skirmishes, we observed a noticeable increase in the provisioning of PlugX malware C2 infrastructure, much of which was subsequently used in intrusion activity targeting Indian organizations. The PlugX activity included the targeting of multiple Indian government, public sector, and defense organizations from at least May 2020,” the report said. PlugX has been “heavily used by China-nexus groups for many years”, and throughout the rest of 2020, Recorded Future’s investigators “identified a heavy focus on the targeting of Indian government and private sector organizations by multiple Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups”. Although Recorded Future was unable to conclusively state whether the insertion of malware by the Chinese groups led to any disruptions, the report pointed to a massive power outage in Mumbai on October 12, 2020, that was allegedly caused by malware inserted at a state load dispatch centre in Padgha. Maharashtra power minister Nitin Raut had said at the time that authorities suspected sabotage was the cause of the outage. The two-hour outage resulted in the closure of the stock exchange, while trains were cancelled and offices across Mumbai, Thane and Mavi Mumbai were shut down. “At this time, the alleged link between the outage and the discovery of the unspecified malware variant remains unsubstantiated. However, this disclosure provides additional evidence suggesting the coordinated targeting of Indian Load dispatch Centres,” Recorded Future said in its report. A senior official of the Maharashtra energy department said the state’s cyber police unit would take appropriate action and suggest preventive measures. An investigation launched after the power outage in October was still underway. Dinesh Waghmare, principal secretary of the state energy department, said, “We had asked Maharashtra cyber police to investigate the matter as there was suspicion of sabotage. However, the investigation is still on and they have not come to a conclusion as yet.” “Preventive measures will also be taken,” Waghmare said. He was also in-charge of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) when the outage occurred on October 12. A day after the grid failure brought many parts of the city to a complete halt, state energy minister Nitin Raut had also said the possibility of sabotage couldn’t be ruled out. Also Read | China rolls out first locally made single-dose Covid vaccineRaut was expected to speak on the issue during the first day of the Maharashtra assembly’s budget session. Recorded Future identified the Chinese group involved in the intrusion activity as Red Echo and said it had strong overlaps – in terms of both the technology it uses and its victims – with other groups such as APT41/Barium and Tonto Team that have been involved in similar cyber-campaigns. The 12 organisations targeted by Red Echo included Power System Operation Corporation Limited, NTPC Limited, NTPC’s Kudgi power plant, Western Regional Load Dispatch Centre, Southern Regional Load Dispatch Centre, North Eastern Regional Load Dispatch Centre, Eastern Regional Load Dispatch Centre, Telangana State Load Dispatch Centre, Delhi State Load Dispatch Centre, the DTL Tikri Kalan (Mundka) sub-station of Delhi Transco Ltd, VO Chidambaranar Port and Mumbai Port Trust. All these groups use ShadowPad, a modular backdoor tool that has been utilised by China-backed groups in network intrusion campaigns since 2017. “We assess that the sharing of ShadowPad is prevalent across groups affiliated with both Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) and groups affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and is likely linked to the presence of a centralized ShadowPad developer or quartermaster responsible for maintaining and updating the tool,” the report said. Stuart Solomon, Recorded Future’s chief operating officer, told The New York Times that Red Echo “has been seen to systematically utilise advanced cyberintrusion techniques to quietly gain a foothold in nearly a dozen critical nodes across the Indian power generation and transmission infrastructure”. While the activities of many Chinese-sponsored groups of hackers in the West have been linked to cyber and economic espionage, Recorded Future concluded Red Echo’s actions in India were aimed at potential access to networks and insertion of malware to “support Chinese strategic objectives”. “Pre-positioning on energy assets may support several potential outcomes, including geostrategic signalling during heightened bilateral tensions, supporting influence operations, or as a precursor to kinetic escalation,” the report said. Recorded Future reported its findings to India’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), which acknowledged receipt of the information but didn’t say whether it had found the malware in the targeted organisations, The New York Times reported. There was no official word from central authorities in New Delhi on the reported intrusions by the Chinese groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-hacker-groups-target-at-least-dozen-indian-organisations-101614572360610.html

We are at an advanced stage of preparation and this will come into effect as the new session begins in 2021."Prime Minister Narendra Modi is passionate about preserving and perpetuating Indian values, heritage and cultural ethos and is putting in immense effort so that the children and youth of our country are made aware of our rich culture and tradition," the minister said."We can also introduce those values via modern technology and put it to optimum use," he said.He said many games played on mobile and other gadgets are "violent, explicit, addictive and tend to create a complex in the mind of children"."PUBG was just one example of it, but criticising those games is not the solution. The solution is to create our own games and apps in line with #MakeInIndia for the world so that these are adopted world over for their basic values that are an integral part of our Indian ethos," Javadekar said.He said this effort by Modi government will fructify and lead the nation into creating new games that promote Indian cultural ethos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-mobile-games-violent-addictive-pubg-just-one-example-prakash-javadekar-101614567220455.html

Can we right away start a 100-day campaign for the sake of cleaning up water sources around us and conserving rainwater? With this very thought in mind, in a few days from now, Jal Shakti Abhiyan ‘Catch The Rain’ is being initiated by the Jal Shakti Ministry,” Modi said.Continuing with his Atmanirbhar Bharat pitch, Modi spoke about applying science in day-to-day life, raised the mantra of ‘Lab to Land’ and mentioned several examples of how people are applying scientific principles to create better products. “When every citizen of the country will spread the spirit of science in his life and in every field avenues of progress will open up, the country will become self-reliant too.”But with water remaining the dominant theme of his Mann Ki Baat, Modi read out letters on water storage techniques, shared how locals have found ways to rejuvenate water bodies and signalled what needs to be done in this regard. “We shall get existing rain water harvesting systems repaired, clean up lakes and ponds in villages, remove impediments in the way of water flowing into water sources; thus we shall be able to conserve rainwater to the maximum,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-urges-use-of-indian-goods-101614564116010.html

01-03-2021||India||India, US reaffirm strategic partnership at bilateral meeting of UN envoys||India and the US reaffirmed their strategic partnership and efforts to strengthen multilateralism, during a meeting between the UN envoys of the two democracies on Sunday, as Washington praised New Delhi for supplying critical Covid-19 vaccines across the world.US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, held a series of bilateral meetings with her UN Security Council counterparts.India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T S Tirumurti, on Twitter, wrote that during the meeting with Thomas-Greenfield the two sides reaffirmed their strategic partnership."Pleasure to meet new @USAmbUN Permanent Representative @LindaT_G and discuss priorities of US Presidency of @UN #SecurityCouncil," Tirumurti tweeted.“We reaffirmed our strategic partnership. India's vaccine contribution was welcomed. We'll work together to strengthen multilateralism,” he tweeted.Beginning its two-year tenure as a non-permanent member of the powerful 15-nation council in January, India had said it comes into the Security Council as the largest democracy in the world, representing one-sixth of humanity and "with a strong commitment to reformed multilateralism, rule of law, fair and equitable international system, peace, security and development."Thomas-Greenfield, who formally presented her credentials to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week, asserted that "multilateralism is back, and diplomacy is back, and America is back, and we're ready to get to work."Ahead of the US assuming the Security Council presidency on March 1 for the month, Thomas-Greenfield held meetings with all 14 of the Permanent Representatives to the UN on the Security Council."In meetings with the Permanent Representatives to the United Nations from Estonia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, Tunisia, and Vietnam, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield discussed the upcoming US presidency of the UN Security Council and conveyed the Biden administration's commitment to renewed engagement with the international community," United States Mission Spokesperson Olivia Dalton said in a statement.In her discussions, Thomas-Greenfield raised issues of mutual interest and concern, including US policy on regional issues, opportunities for future cooperation at the UN, shared priorities in the UN Security Council, and the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Dalton said in the statement.India's efforts and contribution towards providing critical supplies of the Covid-19 vaccines around the world are being widely applauded, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres hailing India for being a “global leader in pandemic response efforts”. India has provided coronavirus vaccines, critical medicines, diagnostic kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment to more than 150 countries.India has also announced a gift of 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for UN Peacekeepers, ensuring that it will be possible to administer the required double doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the 94,484-UN Peacekeepers across the 12 missions.Under the initiative 'Vaccine Maitri' -- translates to 'Vaccine Friendship' -- India is providing immunisation doses to the world.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had told the Security Council last week that India is a significant contributor to the international vaccine alliance, COVAX, and that it was also directly sending vaccines to friends and partners."Starting with our immediate neighbours, 25 nations across the world have already received 'Made in India' vaccines. Forty-nine more countries will be supplied in the coming days, ranging from Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean to Africa, South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands,” Jaishankar had said.Guterres had said that efforts by India in developing and manufacturing one of the two vaccines currently granted 'Emergency Use Listing' by the World Health Organisation brought “much-needed supply to the global vaccine market”.Two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine were given the WHO's 'Emergency Use Listing'.The versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, produced by AstraZeneca-SK Bioscience (AZ-SKBio) and the Serum Institute of India (AZ-SII), are now available for global rollout through the COVAX Facility.Addressing reporters at the Security Council stakeout, after presenting her credentials to Guterres, Thomas-Greenfield had said that the United Nations is the world's "most important forum" for bringing people and countries together.She said the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris knows that "when America is at the table and acting in accordance with our values, the United States is an indispensable institution" for the advancement of peace, security, and collective well-being.“We're clear-eyed about the difficult work that needs to be done, from elevating human rights to reforming the UN itself, to addressing conflicts old and new around the world, and we look forward to engaging our allies and our partners to get it done. After all, we're stronger when we are working together," she had said in her brief remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-reaffirm-strategic-partnership-at-bilateral-meeting-of-un-envoys-101614561284845.html
01-03-2021||India||After two years, activity heats up at Cong war room||With the poll season here for four electorally significant states and a Union territory, the Congress party’s “war room” at 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road, is buzzing with activity after a long lull.The property with two conference rooms, a few cabins, a canteen and a separate unit for the Congress social media unit is in so much demand that senior party leaders who need to hold meetings for respective states or issues have to book in advance.“It’s like you have to send a request for a slot in one of the conference rooms. And often you would get a communication that the desired slot has already been taken by some other group,” said a senior Congress leader.Manish Chatrath, AICC incharge for Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, also manages this prime estate in the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi for the party.The rising demand for the war room also coincides with the shrinking real estate space for the Congress in the national capital. Till two years ago, the party had spread out its activities in at least five places in central Delhi. It created separate spaces for research, data analysis, social media, and liaison while the core poll activities took place at the property on 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road.Now, some of these properties are no more used by the party’s backroom boys, said two leaders involved in the poll exercises.“Before the 2019 elections, a new operations room was created in a small bungalow in Lodhi Estate. The property hosted key meetings related to strategy, campaign and even data analysis. Every evening, a host of senior leaders would meet there. But now, that bungalow is not used any more,” said a second senior leader.The activity at 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road, therefore, has increased manifold. Officially, the property belongs to a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress. But it has been refurbished as a highly secure office. While Congress president Sonia Gandhi has never visited the place, Rahul Gandhi has frequently come for key meetings.“No Congress leader, except the general secretaries and above, can enter the place without prior appointment. If your name is not given to the private security guards at the main gate, you will be denied entry,” said another Congress leader handling affairs of an eastern state.Such is the level of security that except a few top leaders, no one can take their cars inside even as there is ample parking space. A few years ago, a biometric entry and exit system was put in place for the regulars. “The social media team that works from the same property uses a separate gate altogether and their office has been walled off,” said a person familiar with the matter.While the office décor and style of work remains the same, it has, however, lost Ahmed Patel, one of the few senior leaders who would come almost daily at the war room. One of the office cabins would be allotted to Patel, who died due to Covid complications, before every election. After many years, the Congress is going to the polls without Patel in the war room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-two-years-activity-heats-up-at-cong-war-room-101614561039366.html
01-03-2021||India||Cong’s Ghulam Nabi Azad hails PM Modi for ‘not forgetting roots’||Former Rajya Sabha member and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not forgetting his roots despite becoming the country’s PM.Azad said PM Modi speaks frankly about his past as a tea-seller and does not try to hide his background from the world.Addressing a function by Gujjar Desh Charitable Trust in Jammu, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said people should learn from the PM about how one remains grounded to their roots. Azad’s comments come day after Congress leaders who recently wrote a letter to party president Sonia Gandhi held a well-attended public rally from the podium of Gandhi Global Family.On February 9, the PM gave an emotional farewell speech to Azad when the latter retired from the Rajya Sabha. “I (will) not let you retire, I will continue taking your advice. My doors are always open for you,” Modi said.An emotional Prime Minister had recalled how Azad had reached out to him in 2006 after tourists from Gujarat were killed in a terrorist attack and had said the person who will replace the Congress leader will find it tough to match his contribution.Addressing the function on Sunday, Azad said: “I have seen that when some among the Gujjar community become MLAs, they feel that they shouldn’t be called Gujjars and some feel shy that they come from villages”.“I like many things of many big leaders… like I am from a village and I feel proud of it. Our PM also says that he is from village and was nothing (non-entity) and that he washed utensils and sold tea. Politically we may have serious differences and are opposed to him but he didn’t hide his true self. And those who hide their true self, they live in a bubble… in an imaginary world. People should be proud of their roots,” he added.Azad said: “I have travelled across the world, stayed in five star and seven star hotels but when I sit with my people in village, I get a real sense of satisfaction...their clothes may not be clean but the soil of village has a different fragrance. You don’t need cosmetic scents because we are born and have grown up there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congs-ghulam-nabi-azad-hails-pm-modi-for-not-forgetting-roots-101614560885006.html
01-03-2021||India||Year into pandemic, economy in polarised place||India’s first case of domestic transmission of Covid-19 was detected on March 2, 2020. This set the stage of restrictions on mobility to prevent infections from spreading. It was on March 24 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a comprehensive nationwide lockdown beginning March 25. This lockdown, which lasted for 68 days, was among the most stringent in the world and virtually brought all non-essential economic activities to a halt. India’s GDP plunged by 24.4% in the first quarter (April-June) of 2020-21.The economy has gradually recovered and come back in expansion zone in the third quarter (October-December) with a GDP growth of 0.4%. Almost all forecasts expect things to improve going forward. Does this mean the economy has overcome the pandemic’s disruption? Answering this question requires nuance, especially given the lack of crucial necessary empirical evidence. With this caveat in place, one can summarise the economic trajectory over the last one year.Economic activity suffered a massive disruption, but was restored as lockdown restrictions were removedFear of the virus had started disrupting economic activity, especially in the service sector, even before the imposition of the lockdown. This increased significantly post-lockdown. Trends in India’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMI) capture this clearly. PMI Services collapsed to just 5.4 in April 2020. A PMI value below 50 signifies contraction in economic activity compared to previous month. With gradual easing of lockdown-related restrictions, things started improving, but it was not until October 2020 that both the manufacturing and services PMI came back in expansion zone. Other high frequency indicators, such as the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) tell a similar story. NIBRI was reported to be at 99.3 – 100 being the pre-pandemic base – in the week ending February 21.Indian economy will still end up with a lower GDP than it had before the pandemicTo be sure, this sequential recovery will not be enough to compensate for the pandemic’s loss in the current fiscal year. India’s GDP is expected to contract by 8% on an annual basis in 2020-21. This will not be the first GDP contraction in independent India, but it will be the largest ever. Also, this is the only time India will suffer an economic contraction entirely on account of developments in the non-farm economy. Agricultural gross value added (GVA) is expected to grow at 3%, and it has provided a timely cushion to the otherwise crisis-ridden economy. An international comparison of growth rates shows that India will be among the worst-affected economies by Covid-19, suffering the 8th largest contraction among the 30 countries for which IMF’s World Economic Outlook has given GDP growth rates. Job markets, especially for blue collar workers, might still be in bad shapeEven the high frequency indicators, which portray a sequential recovery in the economy, have been warning that the employment has not recovered as fast as production. This is especially true for the blue-collar workforce, which did not have the option of working remotely during the lockdown. The sudden lockdown inflicted a huge shock to India’s migrant workforce, whose earnings are important drivers of consumption spending in some of India’s poorest and largest states. To be sure, not all of the headwinds to wages are because of the social-distancing restrictions. Earnings results show that companies have squeezed labour and other costs to maintain, even improve profits despite sales and revenues declining. That wages face headwinds in the economy can be seen from the fact that real rural wages have been contracting for four consecutive months beginning August 2020.A prolonged squeeze on wages does not bode well for mass demand in the economy. There are both bulls and bears in the economy right nowThe Indian economy, a year after the pandemic struck it, is a polarised place. There are sections, especially among the well-off, which believe that the worst is over for the economy and the future promises unmitigated and perhaps even unprecedented growth. This can be seen in the current exuberance in the stock markets and euphoria around critical second-generation reforms and aggressive disinvestment proposals presented in this year’s Budget. The P-E multiple in BSE, which measures price of stocks to their earnings is at an all-time high, suggesting that it is future prospects rather than current earnings that are encouraging investors to put more money in the market. On the other hand, overall consumer sentiment, as measured by the RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey, continues to be in the red. When read with the weakness in labour markets and shifting balance of power in favour of capital, this does not sound very surprising. Such a glaring mismatch between economic sentiments cannot go on forever, and one of these will have to converge with the other. We do not have enough empirical evidence to say what direction this alignment will eventually take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-into-pandemic-economy-in-polarised-place-101614558955632.html
01-03-2021||India||Dispatch X: A columnist looks back||For 10 months last year, at least five days a week, very rarely more, even more rarely less, I wrote a column on the coronavirus disease, Covid-19. It was mostly focused on science and data — the two things that I have maintained are needed to fight Covid-19 — although there were digressions into economics, the nature of work and play, literature, and music.I stopped writing the column on January 1. It was the day India announced the launch of the vaccine — and it was, I believed (and still do), the beginning of the end. Sure, Covid-19 will be around for a long time; it may never be eradicated; but the vaccines render it powerless.There’s been a lot to write about since then, and there are times I have considered restarting the column. The mutant strains of the Sars-CoV-2 virus have really come into their own in recent months, and we learn about them with every passing day. India has made several avoidable missteps in its vaccination drive, just like it did with its testing protocols in the initial days of the pandemic. And the number of cases in the country appears to be on the rise, although it is still around a sixth of the peaks seen last year, and the fact that I have repeatedly got it wrong about a second wave (something I am delighted about because who would wish for one?) stops me from terming it as such.There has been no let-up in the volume of scientific papers being published on the virus, its effects, and vaccines and other treatments, and I continue to read a lot more scientific literature than I did before the outbreak of the disease — December in China, and early March in India — when the first local cases were registered.We knew little about coronaviruses (although they weren’t unknown) before the pandemic. We would have known a lot less if not for Sars, which emerged in 2002-03, flared up, and then died out. Over the past year we have learnt more about the virus itself, details that point to a level of sophistication unseen in other viruses, and aimed at increasing its power to infect cells. This has resulted in a plausible theory about its bio-engineered origins in a laboratory somewhere in China, but it’s just as plausible that the virus jumped from bats to humans through an intermediate species, picking up some weaponry along the way. Sars-CoV-2 isn’t as lethal as some other viruses but it is highly infective, and the combination perhaps makes it among the most dangerous pathogens humans have faced. Someday (soon, maybe) we will understand the evolutionary journey of the virus, and, if our scars are healed by then, perhaps even marvel at it.We have answers, at least partial ones to many questions — why the virus affects some more adversely than it does others? Why some people become superspreaders? Why the death toll in the US and the UK are high? And we do not have answers to others, including, for those of us in India, the mystery of the country’s Covid-19 numbers, or, if a smaller mystery-within-a mystery is needed, the reason for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar’s low Covid-19 infections and deaths. Or why, in general, states with good public health parameters have fared worse than those with poor ones.Beyond the numbers, though, history will record events of 2020 (and 2021) along three dimensions: scientific, government, and individual.The scientific response to Covid-19 has been staggering in its speed and ingenuity. All previous records for vaccine development have been broken, not once, not twice, not three times, but several times over. A clutch of repurposed drugs and some new ones are now available to treat Covid-19. Death and hospitalisation rates have progressively reduced (with some exceptions). Science is winning.The response of governments has been mixed — not surprising because of the scale and the complexity of the problem and the speed with which the disease emerged, and not surprising because governments have traditionally had an uneasy relationship with science and data, the only two things that should have, in ideal circumstances, driven their response to the pandemic. The Swedish, firm believers in science, seemed to turn their back on it in a strategy that was initially praised, then criticised, then acclaimed again, and finally debunked. For the record, I insisted all along that it was the wrong approach (not out of prescience but the understanding that when it came to pandemics, science could never be wrong). Still, while there were missteps (and there continue to be), and governments could have performed better than they did, and taken smarter decisions, they could just as easily have done worse on both counts.I just hope their experience with the pandemic has made governments realise what really matters (in this case, to repeat myself, science and data).Meanwhile, people adapted — to no jobs or those that paid less than they did before the pandemic; to constantly wearing masks; to social distancing, isolation, and quarantines; to not dining out or travelling; to working from home (or not working from home); to studying from home; and to many other things that would have seemed strange just a year ago.And so, scientists shone, governments faltered to varying degrees, and the rest of us, well, did what we do best — we coped.P.S: The last column I wrote on Covid-19, Dispatch 238, appeared on January 2. My colleague Kunal Pradhan who edited most of the columns, and who had gotten into the practice, once I crossed 100 columns, of telling me which cricketer had scored as much as the day’s column number, and why it mattered, was stumped. As it turns out, a few days later, on January 5, New Zealand’s Kane Williamson made 238, and it turned out to be a record because 238, until then, had been the lowest score never to be made by a batsman (which basically meant all scores between, and including 0 and 237 had been made by at least one batsman). It’s just that we didn’t know it at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispatch-x-a-columnist-looks-back-101614558567411.html
01-03-2021||India||India's 1st Covid fatality: In Kalaburagi, memories of a harrowing time persist||It was a joyous occasion on February 29, 2020, when 76-year-old Mohammed Hussain Siddiq returned from Umrah, a pilgrimage undertaken by Muslims, in Saudi Arabia. Several people thronged to get a glimpse of Siddiq, a Qazi or religious clergyman and well-known personality near Osmania Colony in the Ring Road area of Kalaburagi, about 579km from Bengaluru. Siddiq has nine children, and six of them were present at home surrounded by people from the locality.But the joy quickly turned to anxiety as Siddiq fell ill a few days later.A family doctor treated Siddiq and later recommended that they take him to the hospital where proper treatment can be administered. One of his sons, Faisal Siddiq, took his father to Sunrise Hospital in the same city where they spent 10 agonising hours trying to find out the problem with Siddiq.“First they took the X-ray and said everything was okay. But after the CT Scan, they acted differently and asked us to take my father to Hyderabad (230km away) for treatment,” Faisal, 50, said. Thus began one of the most harrowing ordeals for the family as they went to one hospital after another with a certificate from Sunrise, detailing that Siddiq was indeed Covid-19 positive. Just one day ago, Karnataka had reported its first Covid-19 case in Bengaluru, and there was no clarity on how to deal with a virus the world knew little about, let alone predict it would turn into a global pandemic.Siddiq was admitted to a private hospital in Hyderabad and even given an estimated bill of ₹1 lakh per day for treatment. But half an hour later, the hospital called Faisal to the office and asked him to take his father back to Kalaburagi.On the way back in an ambulance, Siddiq breathed his last, becoming the first fatality of Covid-19 in India, spreading panic among the population and around the home of the clergyman. “If the hospital had sent us to a government hospital, my father would have been alive today,” Faisal said.In Bengaluru, K Sudhakar, then medical education minister, at his daily Covid-19 briefing, gave an inaccurate account of what happened in Kalaburagi. His version that Siddiq was taken from a government hospital was inaccurate as health department officials the previous day had specifically mentioned it was a private facility. Reporters pointed out the inconsistent account, and Sudhakar chided senior health officials that further added to the confusion around the incident and the government’s clear lack of cohesion and comprehension of the developing health crisis.The ordeal for the family continued as local media continued to report on the story, adding to growing fears around the virus. “For about three-four months, people would see us and run away. They thought that I, too, may have contracted it,” Faisal said.One sister, who lives with her husband in another locality, later tested positive, and so did the family doctor, attracting more scrutiny. The religious undertones to the incident added to the misinformation and bigotry on the social media.With an imminent lockdown in sight, news and mind space were occupied with the virus. More so for the Siddiq family, which was not even allowed to properly grieve their loss.Karnataka has since seen nearly 1 million Covid-19 cases in the state, and the health crisis has been turned into another occurrence, despite its potent threat, and vapourised the stigma around it. Every new case became a statistic in the bulletin in the state and country. At least 11 million people in India and 114 million globally have contracted the virus.At least 12,350 people lost their lives in Karnataka alone, just as hundreds of thousands more around the country and planet. In India, 161,000 people have lost their lives. This number stands at 2.5 million globally.But the pandemic has deeply impacted those who lost their families and loved ones to the pandemic. Millions more lost their livelihoods and left a lasting impact that may take years to heal.“We keep away from our relatives who kept away from us due to the incident,” Faisal said.“Bure waqt pe jo saath nahin rehte, unka kya kehna (but what to say about those who don’t stand with you in the bad times). We also stay away from them, gathered our lives and moved on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-1st-covid-fatality-in-kalaburagi-memories-of-a-harrowing-time-persist-101614557928275.html
01-03-2021||India||From 1st Covid-19 patient, a call to dispel stigma||When Rohit Dutta landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on February 25, all he was looking forward to was his 12-year-old son’s birthday party in three days. A textile entrepreneur, Dutta had gone to Italy for a two-week trip with two male relatives, one of countless business trips he undertook over the years.That night, the 45-year-old man felt a fever coming, but went back to sleep. The next morning, he popped a pill and went to the local doctor. He was prescribed medicines for the next three days and his symptoms improved quickly.His course of pills ended on February 28. The same day, he threw a function for his son’s birthday at Hyatt Regency in south Delhi. At night, he felt the fever was back.By then, Dutta had seen news flashes of Covid-19 ravaging northern Italy, where he had gone. He was worried. With his symptoms not subsiding, on February 29, Dutta went to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for a Covid-19 test.On March 2, his results came back positive — making him the first known patient in Delhi and one of only five people in India at the time.“When I had the infection, I did not know much about the disease. Nobody did,” he said.He was treated at Safdarjung hospital, one of the only two hospitals designated for treatment of Covid-19 at the time. He had mild symptoms — just fever and cough — and was given supportive care. “I had thought after a 14-day isolation I would go back to my life as usual, and after the lockdown, everything would go back to normal. I never imagined that so many people would get infected,” said Dutta.His health didn’t deteriorate but he had another big challenge: A constant stream of abuse and stigma directed at his family after his personal details were leaked.From his hospital bed, he saw his phone number, photographs, and even details about his two children put on the public domain. He had to block 1,500 phone numbers to stop anonymous callers abusing him.“I even registered an online police complaint but nothing much happened. In fact, my discharge papers were in the news before my doctors or I got to see it,” he said.A resident of Mayur Vihar, Dutta says Covid-19 changed his life in other, more common ways. He meets only one friend at a time instead of a minimum of five-people get-togethers. “I miss going to the mall. Also, I am a businessman and there are certain things for which I need to meet my clients face-to-face, but travelling has become very difficult now. God willing, this year will see the end of it,” he said.He added: “It is still okay for us, but children are missing out on their childhood.”In the first few months, he felt he was being shunned or judged by the people around him. “There was so much in the news about me – and at that time there was a lot of stigma about Covid-19 – so when people used to talk among themselves, I felt they were talking about me,” he said, before realising it wasn’t so.“Too much information” about the virus also had him worried. “I used to tell anyone who would ask that it was a good thing that I got the infection early on and recovered. However, as I started reading more and more about the infection and found out there was a possibility of long-term lung damage, I was concerned.”It was his doctors who put his mind at ease.“It is like vaccinating a child, we do not really know about all the vaccines but we have faith in our doctors. My doctors have already taken the shot and I have faith in the vaccine,” he said. “I will take it when my turn comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-1st-covid-19-patient-a-call-to-dispel-stigma-101614557054719.html
01-03-2021||India||Crucial lessons to be learnt from Covid-19 outbreak||In a year since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak in India, more than 11 million people have been infected and more than 160,000 have lost their lives. And while India has managed to control its first wave (and so far, only major wave) of infections, how the pandemic unfolded through the year has left behind troves of data on the virus spread in both statistical as well as epidemiological terms.Through the past year, government-assigned as well as independent data scientists across the country embarked on a massive tracking exercise that studied the spread of the virus in the country. Not only has this data given a clear in-depth view of how the virus covered the entire country in a matter of months, but it also showed how the first wave of the outbreak eventually receded.Within that data also lie crucial lessons to be learnt (especially given how cases are again inching up in the past few weeks). It can reveal what signs emerge at the start of a Covid wave so governments and people can brace for a fresh spike.How the pandemic unfoldedWhile the first batch of cases was reported in India on March 2, the first month or so of the spread of the disease in the country mostly consisted of infections being reported in people who travelled abroad, or their families, friends, colleagues and neighbours. The cases were mostly confined to metros that saw a large influx of international travellers, with Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai becoming the early areas of concentration of infections.Since much of the first month of the outbreak, March 2020 -- there were a couple of isolated cases in Kerala in January, but the Covid outbreak in India really began in March -- had no restrictions on movement of people, infections slowly stopped being confined to isolated clusters within cities (like buildings or localities), and a slow but steady trickle of cases started emerging across several states. The national lockdown kicked in only on March 25.Fuelled by cases from the three metros mentioned above, Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu started emerging as India’s first hot-spot states by the start of April. In the first week for April, nearly half of all cases across India were coming from just these three regions – Maharashtra was responsible for 19% of all new infections, Tamil Nadu 15%, and Delhi 12%.These three regions remained the biggest contributors to the national tally through the next two months – May and June. No other state came close to reporting the kind of infection numbers these three were exhibiting at the time. It wasn’t until late July that the outbreak started swelling uncontrollably in other regions of the country. The first state other than the “Big Three” was Andhra Pradesh. This again followed a trajectory much like the ones before it – one or two hot spot regions emerge first, which later lead to a steady stream of infections to other regions. Karnataka (with Bengaluru becoming a hot spot) followed quickly on its heels.It wasn’t until early August that cases swelled in “other” regions. An important point worth noting is that the “other” category in the chart refers to a grouping of 30 states or Union Territories, which really puts into perspective just how big the numbers were from the states that saw the outbreak first— Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and later Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.The regions affected first carried India’s tally in the initial months of the outbreak; “other” states started swelling after August, when the country saw cases that were truly spread across the nation—breaking away from the hot spot-centered spread.This phenomenon is not limited to just India, and is very crucial to understanding how this virus spreads across the world. The trend of a handful of hot spot regions emerging first, then a heavy and steady stream of cases from medium-population regions, was identical in nearly every major country that has seen outbreaks.In the US, New York City (and later NY state) along with California were the first hotbeds of the virus, before it ripped through the Midwest and South. The same trend was visible in Brazil, where the virus first clustered around São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro before it ravaged the rural parts of the country. In the UK, London and was the first outbreak centre before cases emerged throughout the country.On the other end, when cases started receding, this phenomenon worked entirely in reverse. The drop in cases was generally fuelled by hot spot regions first, and then the “other” regions brought their outbreak in control. When the Indian wave peaked mid-September, seven regions – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala – were responsible for 64% of all infections in the country, while the 30 “other” state/UTs were only responsible for 36%. The fall in overall numbers started with the former group seeing a massive drop in infections. On the week India’s wave peaked (September 16, 2020) Maharashtra’s share in the country’s infection was 24%. In the next two months, the state’s contribution to new infections across the country dropped to 9%. Similarly, Tamil Nadu’s share went from 20% in early August to 5% by the end of November. On the other end, the “other” states were responsible for 36% of India’s infections on September 16, and their share rose to 47% by November-end.Learning from the trendThe reason this “hot spot first, then wider spread” trend is crucial is because it can serve as a harbinger for second waves, or warn of wider trends of resurgence. While a lot of has been written about the recent increase in cases in a handful of states (led by Maharashtra) what is alarming is that the trend is following nearly the same pattern as before.Cases swelled in Maharashtra first, which was followed by Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, while Kerala remained a hot spot from the first wave. Now cases are again rising in cities like Delhi -- around 250 a day over the past three days from as low as 130 on the three corresponding days a week ago.At a time when travel restrictions across the country are at the lowest levels since the start of the outbreak, it would not be surprising if the first wave’s “hot spot first, then wider spread” trend starts to resurface. Currently, the country is at the first phase of this trend with a handful of hot spots regions emerging. Unless some drastic measures are taken to control the spread of the virus in these regions immediately, the second phase of this trend that would see a massive increase in cases across the country soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lessons-from-the-coronavirus-outbreak-101614556483978.html
01-03-2021||India||Eatery owner’s son dies after being shot by terrorists in J&K||The son of the owner of popular eatery who was shot by suspected terrorists on February 17 near his shop, succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Srinagar in the wee hours on Sunday.Suspected terrorists had opened fire on Aakash Mehra,25, outside Krishan Dhaba on February 17.“He died early morning, “ SSP Srinagar Haseeb Mughal told HT. Mehra was being treated at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital in Srinagar where he was on ventilator. “He lost his life at around 3 am. He had bullet injuries in his chest,”said medical superintendent of SMHS Hospital, Nazir Choudhary. Police have already arrested three persons suspected to be involved in the attack.IG Kashmir Vijay Kumar on February 19 had said that they have also recovered the bike and pistol used in the attack. He said that the three were “newly recruited” terrorists.Srinagar Mayor Junaid Mattoo said expressed his condolences. “Woke up to extremely distressing news. Young Akash Mehra who was shot at by terrorists at Krishna Dhaba has succumbed to his injuries at SMHS Hospital. I share the pain and grief of his family and stand by them as they mourn this inconsolable loss. May his soul rest in peace, “ he said.Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti also expressed her condolences. “Shocked & saddened to know that Akash Mehra who ran Krishna Dhaba in Srinagar succumbed to his injuries after being shot at by Terrorists. May his soul rest in peace & deepest condolences to the bereaved family, “ she tweeted.Expressing grief over the death, BJP leader Kavinder Gupta on Sunday said, “We heard the sad news about the death of Krishna Dhaba’s owner’s son. This type of targeted attack is proof that there are still ongoing attempts to oust the minorities from the region. We will not tolerate such activities... It is very important to stop such attacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eatery-owner-s-son-dies-after-being-shot-by-terrorists-in-jk-101614555663738.html
01-03-2021||India||How Covid pandemic hit the justice system||The justice system entered the year 2020 in ill-health and chronic co-morbidities of infrastructure both human and physical, inadequate representation, a historical burden of judicial pendency, and prison overcrowding. And while it may take some time to assess the impact of the pandemic on pre-existing deficits, some early projections can be made.For instance, according to National Judicial Data Grid there was a 66% drop in cases filed between April-June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Even if half of these cases are filed now that the courts have begun functioning, in the next few months, the pent up demand added to the already pending 43 million cases will pose a near insurmountable challenge to the courts.The second edition of the India Justice Report, which used 87 metrics across police, prisons, judiciary and legal aid systems, offered a ready reckoner of the justice system as a whole. One of the biggest deficits, the report points out, is the extent of vacancies across all four pillars. In the judiciary, on average, one in three judges in the High Court and one in four among subordinate judges were yet to be hired.Thus, it is critical to address and repair the deficits, whether of human resource, or budget allocation or technology adoption or training capacity — a small sample of the factors we have been measuring in our reports — as we begin to assess the effect of the pandemic.To start with, a vital lesson that we must take on board immediately is to consider the delivery of justice, through courts and legal aid clinics, an essential service. If there was one thing we learnt from 2020 it was the absolute importance of locally available accessible service: whether of food, healthcare or employment. This must be applicable to justice too.While prisons and police services were included by the Union home ministry in the list of services that remained functional during the lockdowns, courts and legal aid services were not. It is time we reflect on how to make our justice system disaster-ready and functional in all situations.To be sure, a great many of the frailties of structure and performance have ailed the justice system for a long time.IJR 2020 reveals that on average, police stations serve much larger areas in rural India as compared to cities. In Andhra Pradesh, for instance, the area coverage of a rural police station was nearly 12 times its urban counterpart (224 sq km to 19 sq km). In Uttar Pradesh, the area served by rural police stations is roughly 16 times that of an urban police station (235 sq km to 16 sq km).Even free legal aid — guaranteed under the Constitution — is unavailable to a great many despite National Legal Services Authority’s mandate that there should be one legal services clinic for a reasonable cluster of villages. The IJR reveals that nationally, there is only one clinic for 42 villages. In states like UP and Odisha, there is just one for over 500 and 300 villages respectively.These frailties are compounded by rigidly hierarchical internal cultures that resist accountability. They remain unrepaired because of inattention to ensure that every worker complies with constitutional imperatives bereft of social prejudice, and is also trained and skilled upregularly to fulfil their mandates. Covid-19 and the lockdown only highlighted this state of unpreparedness.To be sure, despite challenges of money and manpower, there has been improvement across the four pillars over time. Women personnel in the police went up to 10% from 7% in the first IJR; between 2018 and 2020, 28 states/Union Territories have managed to reduce the share of cases pending for more than five years, and nationally, the utilisation of NALSA funds has improved to 94.2% from 70.7% in the first IJR.However, treating all the pillars of social justice as an essential service — which cannot be suspended at any point in time and which every citizen, irrespective of their location, can take for granted — would go a long way in reifying institutional improvement.What would it take for this to happen?For one, policy makers and duty-holders need to coordinate efforts across police prisons judiciary and legal aid to identify urgent repairs than can be put in place without much more strain on resources. Illustratively, ensure diversity – has a first call when recruiting, prioritise resources so that legal services are available at the door step of the remotest hamlets and villages: this could mean increasing the number of police chowkies in rural areas to investing in rapid skilling up of magistrates, constables, panel lawyers, and jailors who are first responders.The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that access to justice is a fundamental right. Its realisation has faltered too long. The delivery of quality justice must now be seen as a priority and become real in the lives of everyone.(Maja Daruwala is the chief editor of the India Justice Report 2020.

01-03-2021||India||Urban areas still more vulnerable to coronavirus but cases now evenly spread||March 2 marks a year since India detected its first Covid-19 case which was transmitted locally, and when the cycle of infections in the country began. While India seems to have so far escaped a second wave of Covid-19 infections, tracking the geography of the pandemic in the country over the last one year makes for an interesting analysis. The pandemic initially started in urban areas, proliferated to rural India once lockdown restrictions were eased, and was eventually distributed across urban and rural regions. To be sure, the impact on rural areas was not as devastating as scientists and health care experts had first feared, and urban areas are still more vulnerable to new infections. Here are three charts which explain this in detail.The pandemic’s urban bias has come down over timeBecause the Covid-19 virus came via international travellers, urban areas were the first ones to get affected in India. A district-wise analysis of Covid-19 cases shows this clearly. For the purpose of this analysis India’s 700-plus districts have been classified into five categories on the basis of rural population share: entirely urban (less than 20% rural population), largely urban (20%-40% urban population), mixed (40%-60% rural population), largely rural (60%-80% rural population) and entirely rural (more than 80% rural population). All of Delhi’s eleven revenue districts have been clubbed as one, as Delhi does not provide district-wise Covid-19 data.To be sure, these districts have different share of India’s population.As per the 2011 census estimates, the population share of entirely urban, largely urban, mixed, largely rural and entirely rural districts was 6%, 8%, 14%, 34% and 39% respectively.A distribution of new Covid-19 cases in these groups shows that the entirely urban districts, even though they had just 6% of India’s population, were the biggest source of new infections. This share was 30% in March 2020 and increased to more than 50% in May 2020. This share has fallen steadily and was just 11.3% in February 2020 (data up to February 24). The entirely urban districts show a similar trajectory when it comes to new deaths due to Covid-19, although this share is slightly higher than that for new infections. To be sure, the share of largely urban districts in these numbers has started increasing in 2021.This does not mean urban population is not vulnerable anymoreThe declining share of urban districts in new cases and deaths should not be inferred as evidence of large-scale immunity in urban areas. This is because a simple share in new cases and deaths does not tell us about the infection and deaths rates in these regions. Adjusting new cases and deaths by population of these districts puts things into perspective. While both these numbers have come down sharply since late 2020, urban districts still have much higher infection and death rates than their rural counterparts, which underlines the importance of maintaining caution. The pandemic has become geographically skewed once againHT’s Covid-19 dashboard has daily district-wise case numbers from March 14, 2020. In the first week, only five districts – Delhi (all revenue districts combined), Hyderabad, Leh, Jaipur and Bhilwara – accounted for half of the new Covid-19 cases (seven-day average) in India.The geographical spread of the pandemic was contained until the lockdown restrictions prevented movements of persons across the country. It started spreading once restrictions were eased, and rose at a sharp pace between July-September 2020. By September 19, 2020, 51 districts accounted for half of new Covid-19 cases in the country.This number started declining since then; displayed a small spike in December last year and has plateaued after falling to just above 10 since January 2021.The geographical concentration of the pandemic becomes even clearer if one looks at it on a map of India. In September 2020, Covid-19 cases were spread across the country.Currently, Kerala and Maharashtra seem to be the major clusters of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/urban-areas-still-more-vulnerable-to-coronavirus-but-cases-now-evenly-spread-101614553700113.html
01-03-2021||India||One year of Covid-19: How India fought the virus||There are several ways to look at India’s Covid-19 year. On the face of it, it’s the story of a country battered by the world’s second-highest number of infections. The country’s 1.3 billion-plus people spent more fatigued weeks in a hard lockdown than most others and, in turn, faced one of the sharpest economic contractions seen anywhere in the world.At least 11 million have contracted the virus, and close to 160,000 died due to it.But, it is also a story of intrigue and, often, surprise. It has one of the lowest deaths rates seen in any large country and, leaving out trends that have become visible only in the latest fortnight, gone through only a single, gigantic wave of infections that appeared to be well-controlled by the country’s precarious health infrastructure.In March of 2020, when the world first caught a glimpse of the devastation that the coronavirus would go on to unleash, experts feared India would suffer heavily as well. Tried-and-tested epidemiological models predicted 97,000-1.3 million infections by mid-May, to perhaps even 300 million infections by the end of the year.But, largely, the worst of the fears did not pan out. During the highest of the infection peaks, hospitals appeared to be on top of the situation – unlike in New York or Milan. The season of festivals, which touches almost every region, religion and custom in the pre-winter months of October-November, led to spikes, but not of the nature seen in other parts of the world. “Reported cases mean very little in India. The estimated number of true infections from models as well as sero surveys is huge and point to about 20-25% of the adult population being infected. That is nearly 170-200 million infections,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, the chair of biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.Even if one takes this into account and looks at fatalities to calculate what is known as the infection fatality rate (IFR), she added, India’s story seems different. “Even if you believe not all deaths were reported, this points to a low IFR compared to the rest of the world,” she added.India’s IFR is 0.1% and this number may be a better measure of an epidemic since deaths are more likely to be recorded than infections, particularly in the case of a disease like Covid-19, which infects many without symptoms. But, Mukherjee added, “41% of India’s population is in the age group 0-18, in which the infection rate is really low -- so the age-adjusted mortality does not look as low as the overall one.”In the week beginning March 2, there were nearly 50 cases. The infected were not only those who had history of recent international travel, but, for the first time, were also people who picked it up locally. The month of March is crucial – not only because this is when the nationwide lockdown would come into force later – but because the most critical first step of a scientific response to an epidemic was missing: Testing.It would not be until March 20 that authorities would allow a person without a travel history to take a Covid-19 test. But people would still be eligible only if they had symptoms, travel history or high-risk contacts – a condition that was relaxed in September.The most effective intervention, then, was a crude one: the hard, 68-day lockdown that began on March 25. It was also unique since India was the only country that shut down while cases were still low, and actually surmounted the peak while reopening.According to Mukherjee, the lockdown did not help stop transmission in the end but it “really helped us scale up health care”. “Testing became accessible and affordable, and isolation beds, ICUs, Covid care centres were set up. That helped reduce mortality. After opening up when cases surged and hospital beds were filling up, we were much more prepared,” she said, while adding that the hard lockdown also helped send a message of seriousness from authorities, “which was not the case all over the world.”SK Sarin, the director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, headed Delhi government’s first committee on Covid-19 control and management. Having been on the frontlines in the fight in the Capital, he identified several things that helped eventually, but the first was to plan for infection surges: “Even in the initial days, we planned for situations in which 1,000 or even 5,000 cases were reported in a day.”Then, he added, protocols were defined to manage the various ways in which the disease manifested. “We also worked on scaling up testing. ILBS had one of the biggest labs at that time with a capacity for conducting 1,000 RT-PCR tests a day. And Delhi was the first to set up the flu clinics in hospitals to check patients coming in for symptoms of Covid-19.”But this was the story of Delhi, the country’s capital. An analysis of infection and fatality trends suggests India’s rural regions reported similar fatality trends as more urbanised regions, where health infrastructure is arguably better.Mukherjee, who was among the dozen-odd researchers from three American universities who collaborated for the Crisis of Virus in India (COV-IND) study group, identifies the trends in rural India as particularly surprising. “I spent quite a bit of time in my parents’ farmhouse. In the villages they do not wear masks, and yet there were no severe cases that they could report. Our fear seemed like an urban myth or fiction to them. What happened there?”The second question of intrigue is the dramatic drop in infections in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in February released the latest nationwide sero survey that showed roughly four in five Indians was still vulnerable to an infection. Mukherjee described the end of the first wave as something that struck her, in addition to big festivals like Diwali and Dussehra not triggering major outbreaks. She notes that, as reflected in the sero surveys, which found higher exposure in cities compared to rural areas, the receding of the pandemic may perhaps be due to separate characteristics in these areas.“I think the antibodies in metros/urban areas are still protecting us from massive surges, but we cannot wait too long. Rural India is a mystery to me. I believe it is a confluence of cross-immunity, genetics, lifestyle, lower obesity and heart disease prevalence and also a more outdoor lifestyle with natural air ventilation that helped villages,” she said, while adding: “I really want to understand why despite tourism and travel by migrant workers, the number of infections remained low in rural areas.”Lalit Kant, the former head of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research saw much progress in how India’s government and citizens have learned to manage the pandemic. “We have come a long way. This time in 2020, we did not know much about the virus or the treatment. There was an acute shortage of masks, PPE kits, sanitisers, and, when cases started rising, hospital beds. Many permutations and combinations of medicines were tried out and it took doctors some time to standardise the treatment, and this was happening across the globe.”But now, he added, “testing has since improved, including the quality of tests available and people’s awareness about the disease and how it spreads has increased, even if precautions are not followed all the time.”As the country turns the page on its first year of Covid-19, it will begin to open up the vaccination drive to its general public.Experts see this as the most crucial objective now. “It has been a year of challenge, but it has also showed the power of science. But, the virus is likely to persist. While there wouldn’t be big outbreaks like we saw last year, summers in India is when there is indoor time (staying indoors increases the risk of transmission) and if we do not take precautions there could be an increase in the number of cases, said Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. “Also, by the time the peak summers come, immunity will decline from last years’ outbreak leaving more people susceptible. Over the next six months we just have to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-of-covid-19-how-india-fought-the-virus-101614553310402.html
01-03-2021||India||Covid-19 in India: Next phase of vaccine drive kick-starts today||The second phase of India’s vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will begin on Monday, with the Union health ministry saying that those eligible for immunisation can register and book appointments from 9am to 3pm on March 1, as the country ramps up its battle against the infectious disease almost a year after the first cluster of cases in Delhi.From Monday, people eligible for the next phase can walk up to a vaccination centre to be registered for a dose. The decision will allow anyone above the age of 60 and those older than 45 but with comorbidities that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 to approach government and private hospitals for shots. While the doses will be administered for free at government facilities, private hospitals can charge up to ₹250 per dose.“A lot of hard work has gone into reaching this phase wherein the government is beginning to vaccinate the general population. The vaccines are absolutely safe to use and are in use not just in India but in other countries as well,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.A statement by the Union health ministry said: “There will be only one live appointment for a beneficiary at any point of time for each dose… Appointments for any date for a COVID Vaccination Center will be closed at 3pm on that day for which the slots were opened.”For example, for March 1, the slots will be open from 9am till 3pm and the appointments can be booked anytime before then, subject to availability. However, on March 1, an appointment can also be booked for any future date for which vaccination slots are available. The registration will take place on the upgraded Co-WIN platform and also on other government-approved mobile-based applications.“The next phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive for the age appropriate population groups will commence from 1st March 2021 (Monday). Registration will open at 9.00am on 1st March 2021 (at www.cowin.gov.in). Citizens will be able to register and book an appointment for vaccination, anytime and anywhere, using the COWIN 2.0 portal or through other IT applications such as Arogya Setu etc,” the official statement said.The immunisation drive across the country was halted for Saturday and Sunday to move to the new Co-WIN platform that will allow the self-registration of recipients.According to the health ministry’s Co-WIN guidelines issued on Sunday, one person will be able to register only three more eligible people using their mobile number. “With one mobile number, a person can register as many as four beneficiaries. However, all those registered on one mobile number will have nothing in common except the mobile number. The id card number for each such beneficiary must be different. A mobile number cannot be used for making more than four registrations. If one out of the four beneficiaries registered in an account is vaccinated, only three registrations are left, and so on,” said the guidelines.An appointment can also be booked for any future date for which vaccination slots are available. A slot for the second dose will also be booked at the same vaccination centre on 29th day of the date of the appointment of the first dose. If a beneficiary cancels the first-dose appointment, then the appointment of both doses will be cancelled, as per the guidelines.The nationwide vaccination drive was launched on January 16, with the government focusing on immunising 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first leg. In the second phase, it plans to vaccinate about 270 million people who are over the age of 60 or are aged at least 45 years and have comorbid conditions.Those with any of the 20 specified comorbidities will have to produce a medical certificate attested by a registered medical practitioner at the time of vaccination at the chosen vaccine centre. The conditions include congenital heart disease that leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension, end-stage kidney disease, or cancers such as lymphoma, leukaemia and myloma, decompensated liver cirrhosis (deterioration of liver function due to scarring), primary immune deficiency conditions, and sickle cell anaemia.“Detailed guidelines have been issued by the government after thorough deliberations by the experts to guide common people through the process. I urge all eligible persons, especially those with comorbidities, to take the shot. It is for their own good as there is still a large section of population susceptible to catching the infection,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.The Capital reported its first case on March 2, when a 45-year-old who travelled from Italy tested positive. “The past one year has been really tough but our scientists and medical fraternity has risen to the occasion and has ensured that we do not lose too many lives to this pandemic. At about 1.4%, India’s death rate has remained lower than the global average throughout,” the Union health minister told HT.The Delhi health department said on Sunday that the next phase of vaccination in the Capital will begin from Monday. The drive will be carried out at 192 hospitals in the national capital, including 136 private hospitals and 56 government hospitals. Vaccination will be done six days a week at these centres.“Appointment for vaccination can be booked online prior registration and appointment based on available slots on COWIN portal,” the health department said. Delhi reported 197 fresh Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative count of cases in Delhi to 639,289.The central government will procure vaccines and supply them free of cost to the states and Union Territories, who in turn will disburse them to government and private vaccination centres. The vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin are currently approved in India – will be available for free at government hospitals and at a capped price of ₹250 per dose at private hospitals. The cost will comprise ₹150 for the vaccine shot and ₹100 as operational charges.The vaccine type available at a vaccination centre, however, will not be displayed to citizens at the time of online registration. “A Covid vaccination centre shall usually have only one type of vaccine throughout the vaccination drive. This is necessary to avoid mixing of vaccine types in 1st and 2nd dose of a beneficiary,” said the government’s guidelines.Experts said it was imperative to open more vaccination centres for the process to pick up pace.“If we need to achieve our target, we need to have vaccination in more and more places; we have to open it up in a manner that those who are willing to take the vaccine are allowed to come rather than calling people and them not turning up,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.“People in the high-risk group residing in regions seeing a spurt in infections should be immunised quickly as it will help in decreasing the mortality and hospitalisations,” he added.Since the drive began last month, over 14 million doses have been administered across the country. But the coverage has been lower than expected, with only 48 people turning up on average for every 100 people expected for each session, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-india-next-phase-of-vaccine-drive-kick-starts-today-101614552866500.html
01-03-2021||India||Elderly make the digital switch during Covid-19 pandemic||It is 11am on Friday and a digital literacy class has just begun on video communication platform Zoom. The learners — senior citizens aged 60 to 80 — are listening to the trainer, rapt; some are fervently jotting down notes. The first topic of the 15-day workshop is how to make a conference call on a smartphone. After 15 minutes of instructions, the participants are asked to make a conference call. Some flounder, but the faces of those who succeed brim with pride and amazement.“I did not know how to use this feature on my phone, though I needed it to connect with my family and friends. It is so easy,” says Om Prakash Goyal, 65, one of the most enthusiastic learners in the class, who took copious notes throughout the lesson. “But my prime objective is to learn how to book a doctors’ appointment, order medicines, and do banking online. The pandemic has made it necessary, ” says Goyal, a retired government engineer, who lives in Paschim Vihar.India has about 104 million people aged above 60 — just a shade below China —according to the 2011 Census. But digital inclusion has been a distant dream for them. The government’s National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) aims to empower at least one person per household. It, however, does not accord any priority to senior citizens. According to a survey by Agewell Foundation, an NGO, in 2018, among senior citizens in Delhi-NCR, around 86% of the 5,000 respondents were found to be digitally illiterate.But the pandemic has led to an exponential demand for digital skills among them, with senior citizens aged 60 to 85, turning to online workshops organised by NGOs, startups, volunteer groups. The lessons in these workshops, include smartphone use, digital payments, e-banking, e-shopping, booking an appointment with doctors online, using cab-hailing apps, and monitoring health through apps.“We get about 100 calls a day compared to 10 before the pandemic for our classes for seniors. Many of them are well-to-do and own expensive smartphones, but are unable to use them. Most say their children do not have time and patience to teach them digital skills,” says Himanshu Rath, founder, Agewell Foundation, which provides free online digital literacy classes for senior citizens. His organization’s digital training calendar is packed for the next few months.Santosh Kaul Ogra, 69, who coordinates with NGOs for digital literacy classes on behalf of many RWAs in Delhi, says that these days he is flooded with demands from senior citizens wanting to attend digital literacy workshops. “Their biggest concern is how to live with dignity during their old age,” says Ogra. “During pandemic they realized that the mobile phone is a powerful device, which they can use for information, entertainment, online transactions and connecting with friends and families.”Kusum Gupta, 77, from Saket, attended a digital literacy class last year. The skills she learnt, she says, are coming quite handy. These days, at 6am, she and her friends attend a yoga class on Zoom. “We are a group of about 20. Before the pandemic, we used to do yoga in the neighbourhood park but now, we do it online. Technology helped me remain connected with friends in these tough times of social distancing,” says Gupta. “My friends say I am quite a tech pro. I watch news, movies, listen to music on YouTube. But technology can help only if you don’t have any hearing or eyesight problems.”Earlier this week, Sushil Bawa, 70, a retired teacher in Rohini, decided to junk her paper diary for a calendar app. She is currently attending a digital literacy workshop. “Now I will use only my phone to get alerts about birthdays, anniversaries of my friends and family.I am also learning how to edit photos, make a photo collage to send personalized wishes to them on special occasions. It keeps me engaged,” says Bawa.Rajkumar Prajapati, 25, a digital trainer at Agewell Foundation, says, “Patience is the key while training elderly as you have to repeat things.” The questions he frequently faces include what is the difference between Chrome and Google; how can one look slimmer in photos, do Google Maps always give the right directions?Shreya Bajaj, 30, who in July launched Easy Hai, an initiative to impart digital skills to the elderly with her sister Surbhi, says demand for her Zoom sessions continues to grow. She charges ₹200 per session and organizes two sessions every day.“So far I have taught digital skills to over 5,000 people. During the lockdown, elderly members in my family struggled with technology. That is how this initiative was born. I have realized that every senior has his or her own digital competency level,” says Bangalore-based Shreya. “Initially, our participants were from Bangalore only; now they are also from Delhi, Chandigarh, Pune, Udaipur, Raipur.”Sonali Sharma, head, advocacy and elderly empowerment, HelpAge India, another NGO, which provides free digital training to seniors all across the country, says that of all the workshops her organization conducts for seniors, the digital training one is the most popular. “Demand for our digital classes is the highest in Hyderabad and Chennai, followed by Delhi. Most of our members are well- educated, middle-class senior citizens, wanting to use technology to live independent lives.”Agrees Saumyajit Roy, co-founder and CEO, Emoha Elder Care, a company that provides elderly care services, “Earlier, seniors who are our members, were quite hesitant about video calls and ordering things online. Now they feel it is better to acquire digital skills for their own safety and security. The pandemic has proved to be a catalyst for digital empowerment of the elderly.”Savita Verma, 64, has taken it upon herself to teach digital skills to her husband. “ I attend the class in the morning and take notes. In the evening, I teach him whatever I learn . I feel empowered and in control of my life, thanks to my newly acquired digital skills. It is really amazing how a smartphone can change your life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elderly-make-the-digital-switch-during-covid-19-pandemic-101614549593861.html
01-03-2021||India||Farmers in a do-or-die battle: Kejriwal at mahapanchayat||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday described farmers as true patriots and alleged that fake cases were being lodged against them in the context of the agitation against the three new agriculture reform laws.Speaking at a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Meerut, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader termed the new laws as a “a death warrant” for farmers. He said the farmers were in a “do or die” battle because they felt the government would hand over their land to corporates and they would become labourers on their own land.He said that all the governments in the past 70 years cheated farmers on their demand for an appropriate price for their crops, adding, “but nothing happens after elections”.He also indicated that farmers had nothing to do with the violence that took place on Republic Day at the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally.“What happened at Red Fort on January 26 was organised by them (he didn’t mention any names)” he said.“People met me thereafter and told (me) protesters were deliberately diverted from the prescribed route and those who hoisted a flag at the Red Fort were their workers. Our farmers can be anything but anti-nationals,” he added.He demanded that fake cases should not be registered against farmers.He also presented a formula for giving a guarantee to purchase 23 crops at minimum support price (MSP).Kejriwal said BJP leaders every day claimed MSP existed and it would remain. “I challenge Yogiji (UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath) to mention to me one mandi (market) in UP where crops were purchased at MSP,” he said.The Delhi chief minister also spoke about the issues of sugarcane payment, escalating electricity bills, rising prices of fuel and fertilizers.He appealed to the gathering to bring a government with clear intentions in the state to solve all their problems.“Bring a government with clear intentions and farmers would receive the payment before reaching their home after supplying sugarcane to mills,” he said as the crowd hailed him with slogans like “Arvind Kejriwal zindabad” and “desh ka neta kaisa ho Arvind Kejriwal jaisa ho”.The Aam Aadmi Party has already announced that it would contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due in February-March next year.He said he was the first person who contacted Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait after he burst into tears because of the “atrocities” on farmers at the Ghazipur border.“I was the first person to contact Rakesh Tikait on the phone and made arrangements for drinking water and toilets for farmers on his appeal,” the AAP leader said.Referring to the Delhi government’s free electricity scheme, he said, “I was also under tremendous pressure and told that power companies were powerful, therefore, we can’t do much for minimising power cuts and providing free electricity. But we did that.”AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, local farmer leaders and the party’s state president Sabhajeet Singh shared the dais with Kejriwal. Sanjay Singh and Sabhajeet Singh had visited many leaders of khaps (clan-based councils) to mobilise support for the mahapanchayat.The stage had photographs of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, one of the tallest farmer leaders of the country, and the late BKU chief Mahendra Singh Tikait.Kejriwal ended his speech with the slogan “Chaudhary Charan Singh Amar Rahe”.He also honoured khap chaudharies (khap leaders) on the stage and sought their blessings.Farmers have been protesting on different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-in-a-do-or-die-battle-kejriwal-at-mahapanchayat-101614546148650.html
01-03-2021||India||Antigua begins process to revoke citizenship of Mehul Choksi||Antigua and Barbuda has initiated the process to cancel fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi’s citizenship granted under the Caribbean nation’s Citizenship by Investment Programme (CIP) in November 2017 but he has challenged the government’s move in court, people familiar with the matter said.News of Antigua’s decision to proceed against Choksi comes even as his partner-in-crime in the ₹13,500-crore fraud case, Nirav Modi, suffered a legal setback after a UK court ordered his extradition last week, people familiar with the matter said.Two officers in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) earlier said that Choksi’s citizenship was cancelled sometime last year and the fugitive businessman is fighting the order to revoke his citizenship in an Antiguan civil court.Vijay Aggarwal, Choksi’s lawyer in India, however, contested this version. “My client Mehul Choksi has clarified that he is very much an Antiguan citizen. His citizenship has not been revoked,” he said.Lionel Hurst, chief of staff to Antigua Prime Minister Gaston Browne, said the process to strip Choksi of his citizenship will take time to be completed.Hurst told news channel India Today that the government attempted to revoke Choksi’s citizenship but he filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Antigua and Barbuda.“This matter will take about seven years to be resolved. With enough money to pursue these legal challenges, 2027 is the earliest for a final resolution," Hurst said. Choksi can move the Court of Appeals and the Privy Council in London if he loses in the high court, he addedCBI and ED officials cited above said that as soon as Choksi exhausts his appeal against revocation of citizenship (Antigua decides on his citizenship), his extradition proceedings will begin as Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne has already assured India of sending him back.According to a June 2019 report by Antigua Observer, Browne, while calling Choksi a “crook”, had said that his citizenship will be revoked as his reputation had tarnished the image of CIP. The CIP, run by CIU (Citizenship by Investment Unit) of Antigua allows a person to get citizenship of the island nation, which comes with visa-free travel to 132 countries, upon investment of $200,000.It also empowers the minister in-charge to revoke citizenship if it is “obtained by false representation, fraud or willful concealment of material facts”.In the absence of an extradition treaty between two countries, India sought Choksi’s extradition in August 2018 on the principle of reciprocity and dual criminality but it is pending due to the legal issues. The principle of dual criminality’ requires that the offence for which the extradition is sought has to be an offence in both the - requesting and requested - countries.The investigators are hopeful that Mehul Choksi’s extradition, once he loses his citizenship revocation appeals, will also come through as the evidence against him very strong, exactly like Nirav Modi as both indulged in the use of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs), dummy companies, destroying of evidence and intimidation of witnesses.Last Thursday, the UK court not only accepted CBI and ED’s evidence against Modi but it praised the nature of documents, audio/video files and testimonies gathered by the investigators.Mehul Choksi siphoned off close to ₹7,080 crore in the ₹13,578 crore PNB fraud before fleeing to Antigua on January 4, 2018, a month before the mega-scam came to notice.In a charge sheet filed last year, the ED claimed Choksi didn’t just cheat Indian banks but customers and lenders in Dubai and the United States as well. His assets worth ₹2,500 crore have already been attached.Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article has been edited for a factual mistake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antigua-revokes-citizenship-of-mehul-choksi-101614540096186.html
01-03-2021||India||New rules make way for self-regulation: I&B ministry secretary||The secretary in the ministry of information and broadcasting, Amit Khare, said on Saturday that the country was for the first time moving from censorship to self-regulation, even as critics have taken on the government for being “authoritarian” with new online media guidelines.“There will be no authoritarian process,” Khare told Hindustan Times. “The regulation system is accountable to the courts. Any misuse of power can be checked.”The new rules that will cover over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Hotstar, social media intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter, and digital news media, were notified by the government on Thursday. The guidelines mandate a three-tier self-regulation system with an authorised official from the I&B ministry at the apex. The official can check non-compliance with the rules and even issue take-down orders under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which so far only applied to social media intermediaries and government agencies.Khare said that the rules represented a paradigm shift in policy. “As of now, any movie that goes to the theatre has to be approved by the certification committee, but for these OTT platforms, no such requirement is there,” he said. “The government has left the decision up to them. They can decide what labels to use. The idea is that the viewer should be aware of what they will be watching.”He stressed that government would in no way alter the content available. “Films only have three categories, while we have provided for five for OTT platforms. The government is willing to consider extending a similar classification for movies released in theatres as well,” Khare said.According to the official, the concept of censorship itself was undergoing a change across the world. “The government does not want to interfere, we just want to ensure that people don’t experience discomfort when it comes to accessing online media,” he said.Khare also highlighted how OTT platforms have democratised entertainment. “These rules were debated for over a year-and-a-half. We have also taken a conscious decision to not set up a web portal where grievances can be filed as we wanted to make sure people didn’t think the government was needlessly interfering,” he said. “The people can directly complain to the platform and if the complaint is not resolved by their standards, it can be escalated to the ministry.”He added that this also provides a safeguard to such OTT platforms as there is an option for civil regulation, and one does not have to tackle FIRs and court cases.OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime have come under fire for airing content that some said “hurt religious sentiments”, with a number of court cases registered. “This provides an alternative remedy that has to be exhausted before they are challenged in court,” Khare said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-rules-make-way-for-self-regulation-i-b-ministry-secretary-101614538136749.html

01-03-2021||NA||Highlights: Representatives of Dalit Panchayats pledge to support farm stir||Farmers’ unions representatives protesting at Delhi’s borders for more than three months have shown no signs of withdrawing their agitation. The protests which have entered its 93rd day on Sunday continue as no new dates for discussions between the government and farmers’ unions have been declared.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union will travel to the southern states of Telangana and Karnataka to garner support for the repeal of the farm laws. Farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 at Delhi’s borders.Follow LIVE updates here:Follow all the updates here:Didn't call for any milk price hike, says Samyukta Kisan MorchaThe Samyukta Kisan Morcha clarified on Sunday that it did not put out any call for boycotting milk sales between March 1-5 by farmers or hiking of the price later on.

I ask centre, why you can't you do the same for farmers. They can do it but they don't want, Kejriwal said in Meerut.Our farmers can be anything but not traitors: Kejriwal"These protesting farmers have faced water cannons. Such atrocities were not meted out during the British rule. And now, false cases are being slapped on protesters.

They have faced sedition charges, it's like they are traitors. One son of the country is defending country's borders, the other is at the border of Delhi," he also said.Centre cheated the farmers: Kejriwal"Before polls, BJP said it will implement Swaminathan report. The BJP won election with huge mandate, but within three years of winning the polls, they filed an affidavit in Supreme Court saying won't be able to pay MSP. This is how they have cheated the farmers," says Arcing Kejriwal attacking the central government.Farm laws are like death warrants for farmers: Kejriwal"The three "farm laws are like death warrants for farmers, it's the mater of life and death for them," says Kejriwal.

That's why they are fighting for their right; it's a do-or-die situation for them," he also said.Every party and government has cheated farmers: KejriwalEvery party and government has cheated these farmers. Farmers have been demanding the right price for his crop for the last 70 years. Every party's manifesto promises to offer right price for the produce, but none of them fulfilled those promises," said Kejriwal.

01-03-2021||Today's||The India-US tech partnership decade||Does today’s geopolitics provide India an opportunity to become a $10- trillion economy by the end of the decade? It would require an acceleration achieved once before, between 2000 and 2010 by China, when its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) went from $1.2 trillion to $6 trillion. It is not that India did badly in that decade, but compared to China, the achievement was modest. India went from being a $468 billion to $1.67 trillion economy, adding $1.1 trillion to its GDP to China’s $5 trillion. What allowed China to take off so dramatically in those 10 years? Deng Xiaoping’s ascent in 1977 set the foundation for a later acceleration. But China’s real takeoff happened after Deng’s death in 1997. One may forget in today’s contentious superpower rhetoric that the United States (US) was an important partner aiding China’s rapid rise. The US facilitated China’s entry into the World Trade Organization and US companies re-shored plants to China and were instrumental in integrating China into global supply chains. China’s manufacturing exports went from $50 billion to $274 billion in 10 years. The Chinese were effective in welcoming US companies but never let their sights stray from the bigger prize in technology. The development of their technology prowess was initially under the radar and complaints about intellectual property theft were soft. The initial rise of China was non-threatening to the US and provided cheaper goods to American consumers. The real tensions emerged in the next decade.Though India was the second-best performer during that decade, its performance paled in comparison to China. The reforms of 1991 opened the economy and reset India’s growth rate. Indian manufacturing became leaner, but India’s success was predicated on services with rapid growth in telecom, financial services and especially in the dramatic rise of information technology (IT) services. The combined revenues of the top five IT services companies went up from $1.3 billion to $28 billion and their market capitalisation went from $23 billion to $151 billion between 2000 and 2010. Today, their combined revenues are $70 billion and combined market capitalisation of $330 billion is 12% of India’s market capitalisation. The current rivalry between the US and China presents India a unique opportunity. This competition will be multi-dimensional. It will involve cooperation in areas such as climate, health, space, and possibly even nuclear weapons. The disagreements in respect to factor movements — trade, capital and labour — will be sharper than before, but unlikely to be disruptive. However, the tensions in respect to technology, communications, data, and the standards around them, will be thorny and difficult to resolve. The underlying values in respect to privacy, rule of law, public good and State power are so fundamentally different that it is hard to see an easy compromise. The possibility of two, if not more, global standards emerging, is real. This superpower tension is the great Indian opportunity. Technology, communications, and data play to our strengths. These are the areas redefining every industry and we have the technology talent; our standards will be closer to the US, and we have continental-size data. US companies want access to India’s data, talent, and consumers. Our market with Aadhaar has 1.2 billion unique identities, 700 million smartphones, 500 million internet users, consuming 13.5 GB per month of data, all rising rapidly.Therefore, India should try and make 2021 the start of the US-India technology partnership decade. This partnership will need to include the following elements.The first is data, including where it is stored, how it is accessed and for what uses? Second, privacy and incendiary speech — this will involve defining privacy and incendiary speech, and agreeing to levels of access of the State to private communications. Third, taxation — this entails a pact on what will govern the taxation of private players, will it be as a per cent of revenues or profits and how will it differ by jurisdiction? Fourth, immigration — what restrictions will be imposed on people movements? Will they be symmetric to capital movements? Fifth, market access — what will be the policies with respect to market access? Will there be an agreement on standards with respect to the big tech companies? Sixth is a cyber coalition — can there be an agreement on no-first-use of State-sponsored cyberattacks on each other? Will mutual assistance and sharing of information be provided on attacks on either? The seventh is sanctions — will the US be willing to commit to no unilateral sanctions in areas of tech, data, and cyber? And finally, standards — will the partnership be able to agree to minimum standards with respect to policies with regard to data, privacy, regulations, fines and prohibitions? To work through these issues, India should consider the creation of a Unique Identification Authority of India-type body, under the Prime Minister’s Office, to work and build a national plan and then ensure its execution. But just resolving these issues will not be enough. The government will need to create enabling conditions for success. At the high end, investments in top academic institutions, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), will need to be turbo-charged much above current levels to spur research in the areas of quantum computing, robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Stanford alone has an endowment of $6 billion. This will need to be accompanied by the creation of technology clusters with good connectivity and living conditions that attract talent. At the lower end, it must ensure that all Indians have a smart phone, are on the internet with good connectivity and increased data consumption. A technology partnership can ignite rapid growth and set India up well for the future. The opportunity is ours to lose.

01-03-2021||Today's||As Myanmar turns violent, India can adopt a two-track approach||The first month of the coup in Myanmar ended in a bloody disaster as security forces executed a violent crackdown on peaceful protesters. On February 28, at least 25 people were killed and many more injured in various towns. This is certain to harden positions on all sides — the anti-coup movement, their external supporters, and the Tatmadaw (military) that is signalling its steely resolve. On February 1, Myanmar’s generals suddenly suspended the country’s experiment with partial democracy, taking full charge of the reins of government and arresting President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. An illegal and unconstitutional action, it put the military in direct confrontation with pro-democracy forces. The peaceful Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), comprising massive protests and processions, gained traction. It reached its zenith on February 22 when, marking “the Five Twos” (22-2-2021), hundreds of thousands of people assembled in Yangon and other towns to demand the restoration of democracy and release of their leaders.The military government, using emergency powers and displaying its expertise to suppress people, used diverse tools — from water cannons and rubber bullets to live ammunition. The number of fatalities, people injured and detained is increasing by the day. Strong statements emanated from deliberations on Myanmar at the United Nations (UN), Human Rights Council and G7, besides a few targeted sanctions. A dramatic moment came at the UN General Assembly’s informal meeting when Kyaw Moe Tun, Myanmar’s pro-democracy ambassador, made an emotional plea to the UN “to take action against the Myanmar military”. Since sacked, he was backed by the UN Secretary-General’s special envoy on Myanmar, who advocated “a clear signal in support of democracy”.What next? Burmese historian Thant Myint-U, noting that he knew all key actors in the present drama, observed: “I can say honestly I don’t know what the coming months will bring.” But his preference was for a radical break from the past dominated by military rule. Will Myanmar free itself from the Tatmadaw’s clutches? Experts appear to be divided. A section thinks that the army’s defeat is possible, even likely, considering the widespread popular support for protests, enthusiasm of the young, and impact of mobile phones, the internet and Facebook. Others maintain that the military is too powerful, intensely motivated and driven by a sense of entitlement and destiny. Besides, Buddhist monks, a vital constituency, are still staying aloof. While a few discontented ethnic groups have joined CDM, they are holding back their armed attacks on Tatmadaw units. Thus, dislodging the military from its overarching political role may be extremely difficult. What should India do? Calm reflection suggests that a distinction needs to be made between action by the Indian government and by non-governmental segments. The government, in principle, supports democracy everywhere, but is also committed to non-interference in the internal affairs of others. It strives to ensure that instability in Myanmar does not trigger support for insurgency in the Northeast. India’s development cooperation projects in Myanmar should not be delayed. Other priorities are to stem China’s growing influence and facilitate conditions congenial for the return of the Rohingyas to the Rakhine State. However, political parties, civil society, media, universities and citizens are free to support the pro-democracy movement. The real challenge, though, is faced by Indian firms that have investments and operations in Myanmar. Reconciliation in Myanmar is a desirable objective. No stakeholder can handle this task better than the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), of which Myanmar is a member. Fortunately, Indonesia has launched a diplomatic initiative. Foreign minister Retno Marsudi met with her Myanmar and Thai counterparts in Bangkok. A special meeting of Asean foreign ministers is planned. New Delhi should consider supporting Indonesia’s efforts. But it will be a long and arduous journey.Rajiv Bhatia is distinguished fellow, Gateway House and former ambassador to MyanmarThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/as-myanmar-turns-violent-india-can-adopt-a-two-track-approach-101614603625885.html
01-03-2021||Today's||The politics of naming and renaming public spaces in India||The renaming of the Motera cricket stadium as the Narendra Modi stadium created a flutter before the India-England Test match. Some saw it a justifiable tribute to the man who is a Gujarati icon, has contributed immensely to Ahmedabad’s infrastructure and also headed the state’s cricket administration. Others saw it as the hubris and vanity of a leader who allowed a stadium to be named after him during his lifetime.Naming and renaming of public spaces are a complicated and political business in most countries, especially so in India. After Independence, we saw a flurry of name changes as India sought to physically erase markers of the colonial legacy. In Delhi, names of landmark roads were changed — Kingsway to Rajpath and Queensway to Janpath, for instance.This was also true in Kolkata, once the second city of the empire, where, over the years, British names were assiduously dispensed with. So Dalhousie Square, named after Governor General Dalhousie, in the heart of the city, was renamed Binoy Badal Dinesh (or BBD) Bagh (or Bag). Numerous other city landmarks were also peremptorily renamed. For instance, the name of Minto Park, named for a former viceroy, was changed to Shaheed Bhagat Singh Udyan. More interestingly, Auckland Square, named after yet another governor-general, was changed to Benjamin Moloise Square after the South African poet.The internationalist tenor, prompted by India’s leadership of newly independent nations, was most pronounced in Delhi where roads were named after now forgotten figures like Benito Juarez. Perhaps the most amusing of the changes was in Kolkata where Harrington Street, where the American consulate is located, was renamed Ho Chi Minh Sarani during the Vietnam War. Some of these names have not stuck, the best example being Rajiv Chowk that replaced Connaught Place.A similar impetus, but driven more by nativism, was responsible for the renaming of Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore and a host of other cities from the mid-1990s. The Shiv Sena’s first stint in power in Maharashtra from 1995 also saw an aggressive championing of Marathi icons, most notably Shivaji. Several Mumbai landmarks, including the Victoria Terminus and Prince of Wales Museum, as well as the airport, were renamed after Shivaji. Since the Modi government came to power in 2014, the renaming impulse has been motivated by the erasure of India’s Islamic heritage and Muslim rule. Perhaps, the prime example is the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj. Others include the renaming of Faizabad district to Ayodhya and Mughalsarai, a major railway junction, to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nagar after the BJP ideologue and leader. There are more on the anvil, most notably the renaming of Ahmedabad as Karnavati.If India has gone through bouts of renaming, the act of naming government buildings, projects and schemes has been queered by the Congress hegemony for much of independent India. While every respectable town has at least one road named after Mahatma Gandhi, the Nehru-Gandhi family has reigned supreme. According to an RTI query in 2013, a staggering 12 central and 52 state schemes, 28 sports tournaments and trophies, 19 stadiums, five airports and ports, 98 educational institutions, 51 awards, 15 fellowships, 15 national sanctuaries and parks, 39 hospitals and medical institutions, 37 other institutions, chairs and festivals and 74 roads, buildings and places were named after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. There are many who insist that the renaming of the Ahmedabad cricket stadium must be seen in the context of pushing back at the Nehru-Gandhi legacy.However, it is more than that. Modi is the first Indian prime minister in office to get a stadium, or any other public place for that matter, named after themselves. If one looks for examples outside India, he is not in great company either.Whatever the rationale for the renaming, it is ironical that most stadiums in India are named after politicians and administrators, and rarely sportspersons. The renaming of the Ahmedabad stadium, the largest cricket stadium in the world, perpetuated that trend.Ronojoy Sen is senior research fellow, ISAS & SASP, National University of SingaporeThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-politics-of-naming-and-renaming-public-spaces-in-india-101614520459026.html
01-03-2021||Today's||When women shape political outcomes||In 1973, a woman, accompanied by her husband, approached Prime Minister (PM) Indira Gandhi, seeking to contest an assembly election. Her confidence impressed the PM and she was given a Congress ticket for an assembly constituency in a backward district of Uttar Pradesh. At that time, the candidate did not know of the difficulties that lay ahead.While on the campaign trail, she had to ensure that family elders were with her in the jeep. She had to return home before dusk due to family compulsions. She pressed on regardless, the only saving grace being that since she was a woman, she could enter any house and reach out to women.On election day, the women voter turnout was considerably more than witnessed in previous assembly elections. The woman candidate did not win but the participation of women ensured that the Congress did not lose its deposit in the constituency for the first time since 1952. This was a small victory of sorts for women.A lot has changed since then. Let us look at the results of the Bihar assembly elections last year. In this politically sensitive state, male turnout was 54.45%, whereas 59.69% of women voted. Though this was about 0.79% less than in the previous election, women played a significant role in determining the political arithmetic and, therefore, government formation.This was, among other reasons, due to the women-oriented schemes implemented by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government since it assumed power in 2014. These include the Ujjwala scheme, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which ensured a toilet in each house, bank accounts and free treatment during pregnancy. PM Narendra Modi’s image of being honest and hard-working contributed to women’s faith in these schemes. Women have proved to be loyal supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s in many elections so far.However, the elections in West Bengal may prove an ordeal for the BJP. There are around 35 million women voters in Bengal who will play a significant role in this election. Chief minister (CM) Mamata Banerjee, who has been in power for the last 10 years, is aware of the power of women voters. The BJP won 18 seats in the 2019 general election. Banerjee gave 40% of the seats to women candidates. But since the Trinamool Congress (TMC) did not do well in that election, she launched a new wing of the party called the Bang Janani Vahini. Now, members of this women’s brigade go door-to-door to tell people about the CM’s policies as well as participate in street rallies.The TMC has nine women Members of Parliament (MPs) in the Lok Sabha. They are given the freedom to express their opinions vocally. The speech of first-time MP Mahua Moitra on the Presidential address during the budget session of Parliament is a good example of this strategy. The TMC gave her precedence over a senior member such as Saugata Roy in such a crucial discussion. Banerjee has also encouraged women at the gram panchayat level. She has strived to strengthen the female vote by providing them maternity child care leave as well as by instituting schemes for them in educational institutions.The TMC has consistently tried to prove that the BJP is anti-women by selectively cherry-picking and publicising alleged misogynistic statements by the BJP leaders. This explains why, while addressing a public meeting recently in Hooghly, the PM said, “Centre has provided water connections to over 3.6 crore households since the launch of the Jal Jiwan Mission, the number in Bengal has only gone up from two lakh to nine lakh. Out of 1-1.75 crore houses (in West Bengal), only nine lakh have a water pipeline. The way state government works, no wonder how many more years it’ll take to deliver water to the poor. This shows that TMC doing injustice to ‘Bengal Ki Beti’. Can they be forgiven?”The BJP’s leaders are trying to prove, buttressed with data, that they have not lagged behind when it comes to development schemes for women. The aim is to convey to the public that women in the state are still insecure despite a woman CM in the saddle. It will be interesting to see what data set or which slogans will convince women voters. But as I see it, the efforts by both parties suggest empowerment of women which should not be looked at only in terms of electoral defeats or victories.It is clear that since reservations given to women in panchayat elections, there has been an increase in political awareness among them. In 2019, Narendra Singh Tomar, then Union minister for rural development and panchayati raj, told the Lok Sabha that there were a total of 4.1 million public representatives in gram panchayats, of which 46% were women. But they still have to make a mark in the higher echelons of political power. Today, we have 78 women MPs, the highest-ever ratio of women in Parliament, but this is not enough.It can only be hoped that the Bengal elections, like Bihar before, will strengthen political empowerment among women voters.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/when-women-shape-political-outcomes-101614520457663.html
01-03-2021||Today's||The difficult path to Indo-Pak peace||The careful formulations in the joint statement of the India-Pakistan director-general of military operations (DGMO) are clearly the product of “diplomatic” negotiations which would have involved the governments and not the two armies alone. Its purpose is, therefore, much more than the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K); it is to renew the bilateral engagement after a hiatus of almost five bitter years.The exact mode adopted by India and Pakistan to conclude the joint statement matters little. In the grand scheme of inter-State relations, officials and even ministers are merely instruments of the final arbiters of a bilateral relationship — in India, an all-powerful prime minister (PM) while, in Pakistan, the army chief along with other senior generals. The fact that this renewal process has begun with a military-to-military statement establishes that the Pakistan army is on board with this process.This is significant as PM Narendra Modi’s first foray at peace-making with Pakistan had been directed at its civilian leadership. That completely miffed the generals. As a retired senior Pakistani general sneered during a track-two interaction, “Modi’s Lahore visit led to a meeting of two kings. It had nothing to do with the two states.” Obviously, he signalled that what mattered, at least for India, was the Pakistani army. And, the army responded to the Lahore initiative with the Pathankot, Uri and the Pulwama terrorist attacks. It should also not be forgotten that 16 years prior to Modi’s Lahore foray, the Pakistan army had responded to Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Lahore peace-making effort with its Kargil misadventure.While the army is a part of this engagement effort and PM Imran Khan, on the ropes politically, will join in, the crucial question is to what extent the Pakistani establishment is willing to turn its back on terror. Despite some judicial action against India-oriented terrorist groups, to get off the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) hook, there is no evidence, as yet, of a fundamental shift in Pakistani thinking on excluding terror from its strategic doctrine.Instead, Pakistan has strenuously sought to paint India as the sponsor of State terrorism, especially since the constitutional changes in J&K of August 2019. Along with this, it has used every forum to paint the Sangh parivar in Nazi colours. It has also called for the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state and a cessation of India’s so-called genocide. Hence, the paramount questions are: What are the concessions that Pakistan will want on J&K to calm jihadist sentiment both in the groups and the Pakistani public and how far can Modi go? This is particularly challenging, especially after his muscular approach since the surgical strikes and more so after the enunciation of the pre-emption doctrine post the Balakot aerial attack.Modi and the Pakistani army would have given at least some thought to these basic issues. Both would have in mind a set of minimum requirements of the other side as well as how steps will be sequenced and rhetoric controlled. How much of this has already been discussed between the interlocutors is not known. What is clear though is that if there was a decision to tone down propaganda, Pakistan has not adhered to it, as is evident from its strident tones in its response to the second anniversary of the Balakot strike and in Imran Khan’s tweets. India marked the anniversary with restraint.In the coming weeks and months, both countries will have to ensure that peace is maintained along the Line Of Control and the IB in J&K. That should not be difficult unless elements in Pakistan cannot resist some measure of infiltration as the snow melts. Should that take place, the Indian Army will have to act to prevent it, even if this has the danger of creating holes in the DGMO’s agreement. As electioneering intensifies for the assembly elections, and if firing incidents occur, Modi may be forced to publicly declare that the army will have a free hand to act. That will not be conducive to this incipient engagement process.Worse will be a major terrorist attack from Pakistan during the next couple of months and even thereafter. Modi will not be able to keep the initiative alive, as he attempted after the Pathankot strike. This will be so even if the Pakistani establishment seeks to assure him that it was a rogue operation and moves to take some kind of action against Pakistani elements. New Delhi may then be compelled to deny that any engagement process was even contemplated and that the DGMO’s agreement was nothing more than military-to-military.There is precious little that Modi can give Pakistan on its “core” issue. He cannot restore J&K’s special status but can restore a truncated statehood. Will this be sufficient for Pakistan to claim victory? As on terror, so on J&K, the onus is on Pakistan to move ahead and also consider anew its own destiny. The generals have shown no capacity for such bold thinking which demands jettisoning “Nazaria-e-Pakistan” rooted in the two-nation theory.The history of India-Pakistan ties is littered with false dawns. Will this be one more?Vivek Katju is a retired diplomat who has extensively dealt with PakistanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-difficult-path-to-indo-pak-peace-101614520456248.html
01-03-2021||Editorials||Boosting cyber capabilities||A suspected Chinese cyber campaign began targeting critical Indian infrastructure assets sometime in the middle of 2020, American cyber intelligence company Recorded Future said. First reported by The New York Times, the company’s analysis identified a sophisticated campaign by actors who used tools and digital infrastructure that has independently been attributed to China-linked cyber offensives. According to the company, the campaign was designed to intrude into the electricity infras-tructure, including the main load dispatch centres that hold up India’s power grid. One of these centres, in Maharashtra, suffered an outage in October 2020, which is being investigated. Government officials suggested a cyberattack , much less one by a nation-State, was not responsible for the outage that cut power to India’s financial capital for up to 12 hours. But they received inputs of a campaign targeting such utilities. This is often the nature of an attack of this kind — it is hard to investigate and harder still to conclusively attribute. And this opaqueness has been leveraged by nations to send adversaries a message. The United States (US), Russia, Israel and China have been behind such attacks in the past. In most, the targets have been critical public utilities and sensitive industries such as financial institutions and government assets. The first known cyberattack on a power grid was, in fact, attributed to Russian actors who took Ukrainian electricity infrastructure offline for one to six hours.Irrespective of whether there is conclusive evid-ence, the threat of Chinese cyber soldiers striking at India is grave. According to the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Centre, as of 2020, China ranks only second to the US in having the skills to pursue cyber objectives. But where it lacks skill, it makes up for intent — earning an overall cyber power index rank of two among 30 countries. India, with low intent as well as capability, ranks 21. Cyber experts have long pointed out this asymmetry in capabilities between India and its adversaries and how engagement in the cyber domain is not limited to rules of real-world conflict. Conventional military defences now may be inadequate in avoiding large disruptive attacks that can force cities offline, grounding industries, hospitals and transport. The report is a reminder for India to expedite defensive as well as offensive capabilities in the cyber domain, where the threat of retaliation is often a more potent deterrent than any other posturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/boosting-cyber-capabilities-101614602302207.html
01-03-2021||Editorials||Housing must be climate-resilient||Delhi recorded its second warmest February since 1901, with a mean maximum temper-ature (MMT) of 27.9 degrees Celsius, eclipsed only by 2006 when MMT was 29.7 degrees, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. This happened because of clear skies, caused by fewer western disturbances. The high temperature also led to a slight spike in the power demand. Even though an isolated weather phenomenon led to the rise in February temperatures, there is no doubt that the climate crisis is leading to a warmer world. This is leading to an increase in the demand for cooling, pushing up consumption from coal-fired electricity plants. Air-conditioners (ACs), which use high global warming-potential refrigerants, are also turning cities into heat islands. To adapt to this reality, India needs to construct buildings that are thermally comfortable; have natural daylight; and proper ventilation. Three principles must be followed — ensuring window shading and ventilation; insulating walls and roofs; and sharing of walls between two buildings. This focus on natural thermal comfort will minimise the use of ACs, and using less/reusing building material will mean less use of natural resources. To kickstart this green housing revolution, states must adopt the Eco-Niwas Samhita Part I, an energy conservation building code for residential buildings, which was launched by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in 2018. This sets standards to limit heat gains (for cooling-dominated climates), limit heat loss (for heating-dominated climates), and ensure natural ventilation and daylight potential. Unfortunately, the codes are voluntary, and many states have not dovetailed them into their by-laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/housing-must-be-climateresilient-101614601882460.html
01-03-2021||Editorials||Reading the numbers right | HT Editorial||India’s third quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) numbers, released on Friday, are interesting for a variety of reasons, not the least being the fact that while the GDP number was marginally lower than estimates, the gross value added (GVA) number was marginally higher. Some experts have explained this as being caused by the payment of past year dues on subsidies (which are among the things subtracted from GDP to arrive at the GVA), and this is a plausible theory. This would also seem to suggest that the recovery is perhaps proceeding along expected lines.But how does this correspond with the estimate that the Indian economy (GDP) will contract by 8% in 2020-21, higher than the previously estimated contraction of 7.7%? Does this mean the recovery is losing some steam? Or does the subsidy factor play out here too? After all, a 8% contraction for the entire year, some number-crunching shows, will mean the economy contracts in the fourth quarter too, which is at odds with just about every other piece of data available. What does one make of really bad news coming from the informal sector? Sure, much of this is anecdotal, but it has always been difficult to measure activity in the informal sector. And finally, while the numbers show a sharp recovery in private consumption in the three months ending December, was this one-off, caused by pent-up demand and festive spending, or can it be sustained? All are valid questions, pointing to the larger debate — the worst is over, but how strong and widespread will the bounce back be?Two data-points shed more light on this (although an outright answer will still take time). The first is the government’s capital expenditure, which has increased significantly (although its operating expenditure has, as expected, shrunk). The second, a more nuanced measure, is the GVA excluding agriculture and government — a measure of private sector activity. This entered positive territory after contracting in both the first and second quarters, although, again, it is a measure of the corporate and formal sector’s recovery, not a general one. On the basis of this, Friday’s data, anecdotal evidence, and high-frequency indicators, while it does seem likely that India’s recovery will be patchy, the overall number for 2020-21 may actually end up being a little better than -8%, or even -7.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/reading-the-numbers-right-hteditorial-101614520397216.html
01-03-2021||Editorials||Covid-19: Open up vaccination for all | HT Editorial||India’s vaccination drive will enter its second phase from Monday, March 1. In the 45 days since it started the drive, India has vaccinated a little over 12 million people. Ever since the drive began, a clear self-congratulatory tone has been evident in the government’s messaging. Sure, it is a matter of pride that both vaccines being used are locally made (albeit, one under licence), but 12 million is a poor number to show for a country that has an extant large, public, universal vaccination campaign. The expansion of the drive, and the involvement of the private sector is a welcome move, and will help, but it is time India started thinking about opening up vaccination for all takers.There is good reason for this. One, a straight mathematical calculation shows that around 40% of Indians are willing to be vaccinated (12 million done of a target of 30 million in the first phase). Even if one were to make this 50% so as to factor in other issues (logistics, availability, the vaccine app crashing, etc), it is still just half the expected number. Two, it could be months before those under the age of 18 are vaccinated (currently, nowhere in the world has a vaccine been approved for those in this age category). That leaves out (by a conservative estimate) at least a third of Indians. Add this to those who do not want to be vaccinated, and it is clear that there is no way India will get even close to the 40-50% needed for herd immunity (and scientifically, a vaccine is the only way to achieve true herd immunity) without opening up vaccination.As this newspaper has repeatedly said: Approve more vaccines; make them available in the open market; and open up vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid19open-up-vaccination-for-all-hteditorial-101614520396150.html
