It had been cancelled within weeks due to the lockdown.Also, the mandi at Sector 29, which was earlier held on Tuesday, will be shifted to Friday.“There had been some delay in restarting the mandi in Sector 50 due to tendering. The matter has been resolved. There is a great demand for mandis in southern sectors, and the space available opposite the BSNL Society and PEPSU Society will be used to set it up on Tuesdays,” said a mandi board official.Meanwhile, the footfall at apni mandis, which were reopened on February 1, continues to be low. After the recent spike in Covid-19 cases, the numbers have dwindled further. “The footfall hasn’t crossed 50% of the pre-lockdown period, even as most of the sellers have returned. Many people are not aware about the days on which the mandis are held, and there is some confusion with the Chandigarh Market Committee as well, as it follows a different schedule,” said mandi supervisor Satbir Singh, who works with the Punjab Mandi Board. Auction recorder Harpreet Singh said the sales are most hit on Sundays due to confusion over the schedule. While Chandigarh Market Committee holds no mandi on Sunday, Punjab Mandi Board holds it in Sector 34.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-sector-50-to-have-apni-mandi-on-tuesdays-101614968760915.html

05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Consumers paying through their nose for water in Chandigarh||After the recent hike in water tariff in Chandigarh, which ranges from 40% to 185%, the city residents, in some consumption slabs, are paying more than 10 times the rates prevalent in the neighbouring districts of Mohali and Panchkula.Sample this: For a Chandigarh resident, with a water consumption of 200 kilolitre per month, the bimonthly bill comes to around ₹10,000. In Panchkula, it is less than ₹1,000, while in Mohali it is less than ₹500. This is the slab in which most residents fall.Meanwhile, a household consuming 50-kl water in Panchkula gets a bill of ₹273, while in Chandigarh, it is ₹1,025.In addition to having the highest water tariff, Chandigarh also has the highest rate of sewerage cess in the tricity. As much as 30% of the water consumption charges are added to the bill as sewerage cess in Chandigarh. In Panchkula, it is 20%, while in Mohali, it is ₹30 per seat.In September last year, the UT administration had notified the new water tariff. In October, the MC General House passed a resolution to roll back the hike. However, the administration did not approve it. The House will again debate the issue in its meeting on March 9.RK Garg, president, Second Innings Association, said: “It is pertinent to highlight here that when the source of supply for water in the tricity is common, then why is the Chandigarh MC charging rates in excess. As per the 1983 agreement on water distribution from Bhakra through Kajauli, it is shared among Mohali, Chandigarh, Chandimandir and Panchkula. As such, higher rates imposed on Chandigarh residents are unjustified.”The water tariff in Panchkula were last revised in January 2018. Earlier, the rates were high, as notified in April 2017, and were lowered after residents protested. In Mohali, from January 1 this year, a uniform rate of ₹1.8 per kl was imposed.Inflated billsFor a Chandigarh household with a consumption of 25 kl per month, the old bimonthly tariff was ₹232, while now it is ₹323, an increase of ₹91 or 40%. Similarly, for a consumer with 50-kl consumption per month, the bill has gone up by 72%, from ₹596 to ₹1,025.For 100-kl consumption, a consumer is getting 140% higher bimonthly water bill, while for 150 kl, it has increased by 165%.For consumption of 200-kl water, the bill has gone up from ₹3,664 to ₹10,073. As this is the slab in which most residents fall, most are paying 175% more than they paid at older rates.Meanwhile, for residents falling in the 300-kl per month slab, the water bill has been inflated by 185%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/consumers-paying-through-their-nose-for-water-in-chandigarh-101614968520624.html

05-03-2021||Noida||Session-3 of phase-3 Covid-19 vaccination: Nearly 9K people vaccinated in GB Nagar||Exceeding expectations, 8,926 people got their Covid-19 vaccination in Gautam Budh Nagar on Friday, the highest on a day in the district.GB Nagar district vaccination officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said 14 government centres administered the vaccine to 4,580 people who were either senior citizens or people over 45 years’ of age with co-morbidities. “The 23 private vaccination centres served 4,346 people,” he said. Until Friday, nearly 37000 doses, including the second dose, had been administered in Gautam Budh Nagar district since the drive started on January 16.Among the recipients were those who got their first vaccination shots, as well as health care workers and front line workers who were scheduled for their second dose.On Thursday, the district had vaccinated 4,000 people, higher than the target of 5,000. Officials suggested that the increase in vaccinations could be because of the government allowing walk-in registrations.Dr Rakesh Gupta, the director of the government institute of medical sciences (GIMS), said that as many as 490 people were inoculated there. “No adverse event following immunization (AEFI), which is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation and reflects consequences for immunisation coverage and disease incidence, was reported among these beneficiaries,” he said. Dr Yatendra Singh, the medical superintendent of community health centre in Bhangel, said that as many as 209 beneficiaries were vaccinated at the hospital on Friday. “Out of them, 150 were the recipients of the second dose of vaccine, while the remaining 50 belonged to the group identified for the third round of vaccination. No AEFI was reported among the beneficiaries,” he said. Among the private hospitals, 310 people were vaccinated at Sharda hospital. Ajit Kumar, the joint registrar of Sharda institute of medical sciences, said that while 80 of them took their second dose of vaccination, the remaining 230 were from the senior citizen and 45-plus co-morbid group. “Out of 230 new beneficiaries, 60% were senior citizens. The remaining 40% beneficiaries were either 45-plus people with co-morbidities or our hospital’s doctors and paramedics – who were not registered in the first list of healthcare workers, due to some technical reasons,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/session3-of-phase-3-covid-19-vaccination-nearly-9k-people-vaccinated-in-gb-nagar-101614967259823.html

Due to this, parts of northern plains including north-west Uttar Pradesh will see rains towards 7 March and Delhi may see clouded sky and thundery development, with possibility of light rains showers. This weather activity will cut down possibilities of sudden rise in mercury to their higher thirties till mid-March,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.A western disturbance is moisture-laden wind that originates from the Mediterranean which are responsible for snow in the northern states.The minimum temperature soared, with IMD recording Noida’s maximum and minimum temperature on Friday at 30.5 degrees Celsius and 16.7 degrees Celsius, against 32.9 degrees Celsius and 13.8 degrees Celsius a day earlier.According to IMD, the upcoming western disturbance will affect the wind speed of the region.“Wind speed increased from 15 kmph on Thursday to upto 25 kmph on Friday leading to better ventilation. Due to the upcoming western disturbance the wind speed is likely to drop on 6 March in the NCR. It will increase further towards 7 March and may reach upto 30 kmph ,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), while the air quality of Noida and Ghaziabad improved to ‘poor’ from ‘very poor’ a day earlier, pollution levels spiked in Greater Noida, bringing it under ‘very poor’ category and the second worse polluted city of the country. The System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR) also said that the air quality is likely to improve. “Surface winds are high and forecasted to further increase for the next 24 hrs. The AQI is forecasted to sharply improve to the Moderate category for tomorrow. AQI is likely to further improve and in the ‘moderate’ to ‘satisfactory’ category for 7 March and marginally deteriorate to ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category on 8 March ,” said the SAFAR statement on Friday.The air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Friday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 250 against 302 a day earlier.The AQI of Greater Noida was 310 – second worse in the country following Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, 298 a day earlier. The air quality index of Ghaziabad was 276 against 332 a day earlier.

05-03-2021||Noida||Dry run for FASTag on Delhi-Meerut Expressway begins; 70,000 vehicle owners to be sent ‘zero deduction’ messages||Ghaziabad: Over the next few days, about 70,000 vehicle owners who use FASTags, chosen randomly, will get text messages informing them of the distance they travelled on phases one and two of the Delhi Meerut Expressway. This is part of a dry run initiated by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Friday, which said that though the trial has been started for linking FASTags to the automatic number plate reader (ANPR), the amount declared in the messages will be zero.The dry run for phase 1– from Akshardham to UP Gate – will be started first, for about four days, while for phase 2 – UP Gate to Dasna – it will be started in another four days, and will be run for about five to six days. Officials said the highways authority will be testing its ANPR systems which will be installed one phases one, two and phase four (Dasna to Meerut), although FASTag trials for phase four will not be started as of now.The phase three of the DME – Dasna to Hapur – has tolls in place at Chhijarsi near Pilkhuwa.“Across phases one, two and four, we will be installing a total of about 100 ANPRs which will be in the form of high-resolution cameras. During the dry run, the readers will try to note the registration number of all four-wheeler or larger vehicles on the expressway. It is estimated that about 60,000 vehicles ply on phase one daily which includes about 40,000 cars, while phase 2 sees about 50,000 vehicles, including about 30,000 cars, daily,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.During the dry run, the ANPRs, installed at every expressway lane, will read the number plates of the vehicles at entry and points.The three phases one, two and four have entry and exit points at Sarai Kale Khan, Akshardham, Ghazipur, Indirapuram, Dundahera, Dasna, Rasoolpur Sikrod, Bhojpur besides Jainuddinpur and main plaza at Kashi in Meerut.On the basis of the distance travelled, the NHAI will charge commuters from their FASTag on a per-kilometre basis. “Owners of vehicles plying on these stretches during the trial run will be sent a message saying, for example, ‘Thank you for using Delhi Meerut Expressway, your transaction has been processed for an amount ₹0.00.’ So, if any vehicle owners receive this message, they need not worry. Receiving the message also means that the vehicle’s FASTag has been successfully aligned with the ANPR. The actual charging of toll will be started after a notification,” Garg said further.“It is likely that people using vehicles regularly may get messages every day during the dry run period. Once the dry run becomes successful, the same ANPRs will also be used for sending fines in case of traffic violations like over speeding and driving in the wrong direction, among others,” Garg added.Phases two and four, the two under-construction phases, have been scheduled to open up on March 31 while their physical progress is estimated at 95% and 98%, respectively. On phase two, the trial will be conducted at six locations in Delhi and 12 locations in Ghaziabad.For private vehicles like cars, the speed limit in Delhi is 80kmph while it is 100kmph on phase two and phase three (Dasna to Hapur), besides 120kmph for the Greenfield expressway under phase four. Officials said the speed limit for commercial vehicles, however, will be reduced by 20kmph under the four respective stretches.Earlier in February, the ministry of road transport and highways decided that all toll plazas on national highways shall be declared as “FASTag lanes of the fee plaza” with effect from midnight of February 15/16.Any vehicle not fitted with FASTag or vehicle without a valid and functional FASTag entering into the FASTag lane of the fee plaza will be charged double the toll at electronic toll plazas, according to National Highway Fee Rules, 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dry-run-for-fastag-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-begins-70-000-vehicle-owners-to-be-sent-zero-deduction-messages-101614967207948.html
05-03-2021||Gurugram||Farmhouse owners get notices for illegal construction on Aravalli land||The Sohna Municipal Council has sent notices to 40 farmhouse owners for allegedly building illegal properties on Aravalli forest land, said officials on Friday.Sandeep Malik, executive officer, Sohna Municipal Council, said the notices were sent as part of compliance of a high court order issued in June 2020.“We had sent notices to over 400 farmhouses in Raisina, which were constructed in illegally, in June 2020, after which the owners approached the high court. The court had asked us to send notices before taking any action, but many people did not turn up. We will be sending notices to 150 such owners once again to know their stance. As of now 40 farm owners have already been issued notices,” said Malik.The property owners have been given seven days to respond to the notices, which will be assessed by a five-member committee. In October 2018, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruled in the case of Soniya Ghosh v/s State of Haryana, “Any construction raised on the forest area or the area covered by the notification dated 07.05.1992, without a permission of the competent authority (after the date of the said notification) has to be treated as illegal and the forest land has to be restored (sic).”After the judgment on June 6, 2020, the Sohna Municipal Corporation served show-cause notices to over 400 farmhouses in Aravalli Retreat, on the grounds that the farmhouses were constructed in violation to the notification issued by ministry of environment, forest and climate change.Following the instructions laid down by the NGT, the deputy commissioner ordered on June 11, 2020, that the land use category of ‘gair mumkin farmhouse’ be struck from revenue records and replaced with the ‘gair mumkin pahad’ — the original nomenclature. This move would have set the precedent for demolition of the properties. The local residents, who had opposed the move, then moved to the high court. Since Tuesday, the council has sent notices to 40 farmhouse owners and after learning their response, the next course of action will be decided by officials, Malik added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmhouse-owners-get-notices-for-illegal-construction-on-aravalli-land-101614967206685.html

Their sale in the past one year has been to the tune of ₹1.5 crore, while other industries have been suffering huge losses due to Covid-19 pandemic.”Rao said they had a wide network and extensive marketing teams to promote their apparels through social media platforms.Police and anti-counterfeiting agency Brand Protectors India allegedly seized 1,000 pieces of shirts, jeans, tags and labels during a raid in a building on Sheetla Mata Road in Sector 12 on Friday afternoon.Both the suspects — the company directors — were arrested for selling counterfeit branded apparel, the police said. The suspects were identified as Lakshmi Jha and Umakant Sharma of U3S traders.The police team has allegedly unearthed a large network of distributorship and online marketing of counterfeit apparel.During a market survey, the anti-counterfeiting agency discovered that an online wholesaler was allegedly engaged in the sale and distribution through all social media platforms of duplicate apparels of popular brands.

05-03-2021||Gurugram||Parents protest against private schools||Over 100 parents from different private schools of the city protested outside a private school in South City 2 on Friday against the practice of charging of fees other than tuition fees by the school authorities. Protesting parents complained that schools were putting pressure on them to pay the fee in addition to tuition fees and feared that students’ access to online classes might be suspended ahead of examinations. Dhruv Bansal, whose daughter studies in Class 1 in a private school, said that the school was seeking fee in addition to the tuition fee. “The school is asking for all fee components except the transportation fee. They are simply adjusting other fee components into the tuition fee and not giving us any concessions even during the pandemic,” said Bansal, adding that school authorities were also reluctant in listening to the parents. “When we approach the school authorities with any issue, they simply ask us to pay the complete fee and do not entertain our queries,” said Bansal. Following the closure of schools in March last year amid the coronavirus outbreak, the directorate of education had issued multiple directives pertaining to fee payment. Private schools were asked to charge fees under applicable heads only after the physical opening of schools, until which the schools were allowed to collect fees only under the tuition head. Later, parents who were affected financially due to the pandemic were also allowed to apply for exemptions. After the schools had challenged the reduction in fee, the Punjab and Haryana high court allowed “reasonable fee collection” by schools, if online classes are held daily. Another parent, who requested not to be named, said that the school had been bombarding parents with messages every month, asking them to pay the full fee. “Besides tuition fee, the school is asking for building and security fund, along with other components. We are being asked to pay for these components at a time when children have been taking online classes and not visiting the school,” said the parent. She said that while the school had not blocked the school identity cards yet. However, the parent community was apprehensive that such steps could be taken once annual examinations start. “School authorities are saying that they are complying with the court orders and not listening to our legitimate demands. They are using pressure tactics to compel parents to pay the fee,” said the parent.District education officer Indu Boken said that the court orders were clear, and the department would comply with them. “The additional charges beyond tuition fee were never waived off. Parents who are facing difficulty in paying the fee due to the pandemic can approach the school on an individual basis and the school will assess if they can be given a concession. However, the court order has also remarked that this provision cannot be misused,” said Boken. Col (retd) KR Pratap Singh, senior vice-president of Haryana Progressive Schools Conference, said that the courts had allowed parents with genuine financial issues to approach schools for relief and such parents had been given relief too. “There is no bar on the collection of all charges by the school as per the court order. The court order dated June 30th said that annual charges can be self-assessed by schools. The issue is that expenditure during the lockdown months didn’t go down. Schools take services from vendors and we need to pay them. Those expenses didn’t go down, but we did roll back certain charges by 10%,” said Singh. Gurugram block education officer Sheel Kumari, who spoke to the protesting parents, said that she had asked parents to approach the respective school managements with proof of financial constraints. “Schools should listen to parents and not suspend classes without a dialogue. Parents should also take up concerns with school management. The department will go by the court order,” said Kumari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/parents-protest-against-private-schools-101614967141255.html
05-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram district to soon launch campaign to improve ground water level||With the aim of improving the groundwater level in the district, a comprehensive campaign for water conservation is likely to be launched in the city by the district administration.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of the district said that the campaign will be run by the team of GuruJal Society in collaboration with the district administration and the department of town and country planning (DTCP).“We are aiming to identify water harvesting structures present in the district and make them functional. I have also instructed the GuruJal team to coordinate with the DTCP and ensure that the water harvesting system in housing societies and high-rise apartments are operational. It is important to make these systems functional so that rooftop spillage does not go waste and the water table is recharged,” said Garg.The administration also aims to clean drains through which rainwater can be harvested naturally to increase the groundwater table.On March 1, the district town planners for planning and enforcement met with members from the GuruJal team. During the meeting, it was decided that a legal framework for the implementation of rainwater harvesting structures in Gurugram will be prepared and a rainwater harvesting enforcement drive will be conducted in the city with an aim to check the functionality and status of the such structures.Osho Kalia, a senior member from GuruJal who participated in the meeting, said, “The objective is to make people aware and awake about water conservation and what necessary actions they can take to do so. For this project, we will be working with all departments concerned on how to take action against those who are not following the norms.”Between 2014 and 2018, the groundwater table in Gurugram district reduced by two-and-a-half metres. In 2014, the district recorded an average groundwater level of 26.3 metres (below the ground). By 2018, this level had dipped to 28.9 metres across four monitoring blocks of Gurugram, Sohna, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar. The latest data obtained from the agricultural department’s groundwater cell revealed that between June 2019 and June 2020, the groundwater table in Gurugram district dropped by 0.27 metres and stood at 29.86 metres.Despite attempts, RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-district-to-soon-launch-campaign-to-improve-ground-water-level-101614967140657.html

Students said that they were not being given the option of choosing the online mode for examination despite it being mandated by Gurugram University. The college later assured the students that online option will be made available to them.Government colleges across the state will be holding semester-end examinations in a combination of offline and online modes this month. Though the exams for first- and second-year undergraduate students affiliated with Gurugram University will start from March 19, exams for third-year students affiliated with Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, have already started on March 3. As per a notification issued by Gurugram University, students can choose between online and offline modes. “The exam notification issued by Gurugram University says that students can choose between online and offline modes. However, the college has not provided the option of choosing the online option due to which a demonstration was held today. Most other colleges in the city have already asked students to make a choice but there has been no such development in our college,” said Nishid Kumar Singh, a first-year-student. He said that following the protest, the college authorities had assured us that the provision of online exams would be provided to us. Ankit Saini, another student, said that college authorities had assured that a link would soon be generated to enable them to opt for online exams. “The issue has been addressed and we have been told that we will get the choice to opt for both modes. While I am okay with both the modes, this will help outstation students who wanted to go for online exams,” said Saini.Virender Singh Antil, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that the provision of online exams was already meant to be provided to students. “We don’t know how this misunderstanding arose. I have been told that some faculty members told students that exams will take place only in an offline mode. However, this is not true. While offline classes have been taking place, the option of online exams mandated by the university will be provided to students,” said Antil. He said that students had been assured that both the options will be provided to them and a form seeking their responses would be floated soon. “Students are satisfied now, and their concerns have been addressed,” said Antil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/college-students-stage-protest-demanding-online-examination-101614967140036.html

The development holds significance for Gurugram residents as the MCG until now has largely not issued any bills related to water supply. While the civic body has the data of only around 88,000 water meters in its records, the city has at least 3,97,000 properties listed in the property records.As per the estimates by MCG officials, this number has increased to 5,00,000 properties presently. The move to hire private contractors will help the civic body to reach out to all the 5,00,000 properties in the city. “In all the authorised and unauthorised colonies, private builder areas and sectors falling within the limits of the MCG, the work of taking water meter readings and preparing bills on the spot according to the readings have been awarded to BCITS Private Limited Company. The work of distributing water bills is being done on the basis of the data of the property owners. For consumers who do not have a water supply meters at their home, the bill will be issued according to the fixed rate,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Singh added that the contract has been awarded to the concessionaire until 2024. As per MCG officials, consumers who are getting water bills based on fixed rates can contact Manish Kumar and Ravindra Kumar, both employees of MCG, for queries, complaints, suggestions, or corrections related to their bill.Consumption of the first 20 kilolitres of water will be charged at ₹8 per kilolitre and for every kilolitre thereafter the consumers will have to shell out ₹10 per kilolitre, under the flat rates.As per MCG officials, bills on flat rates tend to be 20-30% higher than a metered water bill as they rely heavily on assumption. As such, it is difficult to have any accuracy for the same.Consumers who have water supply meters can contact the MCG’s helpline number 1800-180-1817 or the Water Bill Branch for any queries, complaints, suggestions or corrections.Residents can pay water bills at the citizen facilitation centres (CFCs) located in the MCG’s offices at Sector 34, opposite Civil Hospital, and Sector 42. They can also pay bills online by visiting www.mcg.gov.in — which is the official website of the MCG and can use various online modes to make payment.The MCG’s 88,000 metered water connections data has largely been compiled over the last two years. Until, three years ago, water supply in internal sectors was the responsibility of the cash-strapped Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP).Based on the existing data, MCG sanctioned 33,000 water bills to residents in August last year for the first time. However, officials said that they soon realised that the task needed outsourcing.“In two years, we managed to get only records of around 88,000 metered water connections. There are nearly 3,00,000 more residents that needed to be covered. We soon realised that our resources and manpower are too limited for this task. As such, a private contractor was needed to do the job on our behalf,” said an MCG official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-hires-contractor-to-issue-water-bills-all-property-owners-101614967139266.html

The court noted that of the 20 accused persons arrested in the case, 19 have already been released on bail.“Applicant/accused (Sumit) is a student stated to be pursuing two years diploma course from Govt Model ITI, Rohtak, online classes for which has started. On being asked from the prosecutor whether he is seen in any video footage committing violence at the spot, the reply came in negative. Considering the age of the applicant/accused, his clean antecedents and the period of incarceration, I deem it fit to release him on bail,” the judge said.Police had alleged that Sumit was a part of the mob which on January 26, 2021, assaulted police officers near Nangloi Chowk and obstructed them from discharging their duty.Police claimed that the accused was apprehended from the spot while he was running behind 10 other alleged accomplices who were on two tractors and were heading towards Peeragarhi. They further alleged that he was carrying a stick and resorting to violence.The court, however, asserted that the right to protest also means the right to peacefully protest and not to resort to violence of any kind, even on provocation.“The facts portrayed by the prosecution shows that the acts of the protesters/rioters cannot be condoned. However, the guilt or innocence of the applicant (Sumit) is a matter of trial and nothing can be said about it, at this stage,” the judge said in his order passed on March 4.Protesting farmers had clashed with the police on January 26 during a tractor parade to highlight their demand for the repeal of three farm laws promulgated by the Centre. Several police personnel and farmers were injured in violence, in which one protester has also died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-violence-19-year-old-gets-bail-as-he-is-not-seen-in-any-video-footage-resorting-to-violence-101614967081074.html

DDA officials said the response has been good despite the slump in the real estate sector.“The response has been quite good. We have received 22,750 applications for 1,354 flats. The draw of lots will be live-streamed. We have made the entire process online due to the pandemic so that people don’t have to make frequent trips to our office to get work done,” said the official, on condition of anonymity.The DDA has received over 7,000 applications along with payment for its 1,011 HIG and Middle Income Group MIG flats in Dwarka and Jasola. The 254 HIG flats are in Jasola, Vasant Kunj, Rohini and Dwarka. There are 757 two- and three-bedroom MIG flats in Dwarka, Rohini, Vasant Kunj, Janahgirpuri and Madipur.While 215 flats in Jasola have been put on sale for the first time, the remaining were returned by allottees in the previous housing schemes. The cost of HIG flats, which are 87.9 square metres (sqm) to 177.3 sqm in size, varies between ₹69.62 lakh and ₹2.14 crore.Apart from the location of flats, DDA officials said the quality of construction, facilities at the housing complex, two parking slots per flat in HIG category, .,are some of the reasons why people are keen on picking up one of these flats.Despite the slump in the real estate market, DDA officials are optimistic that 254 HIG flats in Jasola will find many takers. “These are spacious flats, located on the Delhi-Noida border and well-connected to the rest of the city via Metro and other public transport systems. There is a dual piping system as the complex has its own sewerage treatment plant. The most important thing is that each flat has two parking slots. The ₹2.1 crore cost is as per the market rate,” said a second senior DDA official, also on condition of anonymity.Spread over 64.04 sqm to 129.98 sqm, the cost of MIG flats varies between ₹40.64 lakh and ₹1.24 crore. Of the 757 flats, 711 are located in Dwarka Sub-City—a planned residential area being developed by the DDA. It is after nearly a decade, a senior DDA official said, that MIG flats in such large numbers have been put on sale in Dwarka.There are 291 flats in the economically weaker section and 52 in the lower income group category in Dwarka and Rohini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/draw-of-lots-for-dda-housing-scheme-2021-on-march-10-101614966902561.html

Police said the woman, who worked as a consultant with a private firm in Gurugram, lived in the house on rent, while the man, a gym trainer, who was into modelling, had come to meet her two days ago. Police have found liquor bottles and some medicines lying beside the bodies and have ruled out any foul play so far.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said the deaths came to fore after neighbours reported a foul smell from the ground floor of the house. The matter was then reported to the police who arrived on the spot and broke open the main entrance door that was locked from inside.“Our team entered the house and found a man and a woman lying dead. It looked like they had been lying there for at least two or three days. Their bodies were moved to a hospital and later sent for a post-mortem examination,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity.The police said during preliminary inquiry it was found that the woman worked in Gurugram and lived on the ground floor on rent. The man had visited her two days ago, the neighbours said. Their families were also informed and they confirmed that man and women were acquainted, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said the bodies had no visible injuries. “While the woman was from Uttarakhand, the man was from Uttar Pradesh. An almost empty liquor bottle, some supplements and wrappers of some tablets were found lying at the spot and have been seized as evidence. The autopsies were conducted and viscera samples preserved for further proceedings. So far, we do not suspect any foul play in the case. We have not found any suicide note and the matter is being probed from all angles,” the DCP said.Police said they will ascertain the nature and type of the tablets found in the room as part of the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/decomposed-bodies-of-man-and-woman-found-at-woman-s-house-in-tilak-nagar-101614966901297.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||HC asks cops to find official who leaked riot accused’s statement to media||The Delhi high court on Friday said that riot accused Asif Iqbal Tanha’s disclosure statement to the police had been “leaked” to the media and directed the police to identify and fix responsibility of all erring officials.Justice Mukta Gupta asked the Delhi Police Commissioner to file an affidavit fixing responsibility of the person instrumental in leaking information to the media.The judge also pulled up the police for the leak of a second supplementary charge sheet filed in the case related to communal violence in north-east Delhi last year even before cognisance was taken by the concerned court“It is a proven allegation (of leak) once it comes in the media. It no longer remains an allegation now. You have to ascertain who has done it,” the court told the counsel for the police.“Please fix the responsibility.. And don’t do the kind of enquiry that you did last time..,” the court added.The court was hearing a plea by Tanha seeking action against alleged misconduct of police officials in leaking his disclosure statement to the media. On the last date of hearing, the court had pulled up the city police for their “half baked” vigilance inquiry in ascertaining the role of the police officials who could have leaked the document to the media.Tanha, a third-year student of BA in Persian language, was arrested in May last year in connection to conspiracy in the north-east Delhi riots cases. He was earlier arrested in connection with violence in the Jamia area during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year.The police had said that Tanha was a member of the Students Islamic Organization and was part of the Jamia Coordination Committee, which spearheaded protests against the new citizenship law.On Friday, advocate Siddharth Aggarwal — appearing for Tanha — told the court that even when this matter is sub judice, yet another charge sheet in the main conspiracy case related to the north-east Delhi riots was leaked to the media even before cognizance was taken in the court.The court then asked the police to find the person who is instrumental in committing the three offences—misuse of official power, criminal breach of trust or theft.“You have to find out the person who is instrumental. Who will do it if you don’t do it? If your officer has leaked it, it’s abuse of power, if for sanction this was entrusted to someone else it’s criminal breach of trust and if the media has taken it away then it’s a theft. So in any case, an offence is made out,” the judge said nudging the police.It cautioned that various courts are repeatedly commenting on the role of media but are still lenient and are not passing orders.Advocate Amit Mahajan, representing the Delhi Police, maintained that the contents of the supplementary charge-sheet were not leaked to the media by police. He said the responsibility cannot be fixed on police as they have not leaked it.The high court said that the earlier order was clear that there would not be any media briefing till charges are framed.The matter would be now heard on March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-asks-cops-to-find-official-who-leaked-riot-accused-s-statement-to-media-101614966900688.html

He urged the media to spread awareness about the importance and efficacy of vaccines.Admitting that Covid-19 cases in Punjab were on the rise, having crossed 1000 after more than a month, Captain said, "It was a matter of concern. Our government was keeping a close watch on the situation."He also blamed the casual and carefree attitude of the people of Punjab for the resurgence in cases.He further appealed to the people to strictly adhere to all Covid-19 safety norms, including wearing masks and social distancing, and not let their guard down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-trashes-allegation-of-rejecting-covaxin-calls-it-bjp-s-propaganda-101614964073999.html

The woman’s mobile phone was also recovered from him.Hailing from Uttarakhand, Das has been living in Ludhiana for the past 30 years and runs his ashram in a room at Phullanwal Enclave.According to police, the woman had approached him through her parents, who were his regular visitors, as she had lost her job during the pandemic and was pinning hopes on him to provide a remedy.“The woman’s parents had filed a complaint after she didn’t return home on February 26. Her mobile phone was also switched off, following which an FIR under Section 346 (wrongful confinement in secret) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against unidentified accused,” said additional commissioner of police (ADCP, City 3) Sameer Verma, while addressing a press conference on Friday.Mobile phone records helped crack caseThe ADCP said the victim’s mobile phone call details helped track down the accused, as he was the last person she had called and the last mobile location was also recorded at his ashram before she went missing. Police suspicions grew stronger after a friend of the woman shared that he had dropped her at the ashram on his motorcycle on February 26.“Initially, Das kept refusing any contact with her, but eventually conceded, and confessed to raping and killing her after she visited him on February 26. He was alone at the ashram, when he raped her. Afraid of being caught, he strangled her to death and waited for four hours till nightfall to dump the body in a field,” said the ADCP.“To avoid any suspicion, he remained at his ashram and continued his usual routine,” he added.The police official said the woman used to be a manager at an automobile agency, but lost her job during the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. As she wanted to continue to support her family financially, she had approached Das for help with securing a job soon.Police have added Section 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the IPC in the FIR. They will produce the accused before a court on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/selfstyled-godman-rapes-murders-22-yr-old-in-ludhiana-dumps-body-in-field-101614964739866.html

Through the sewer line, which will move through Sector 32-A main road, rainwater will be directly discharged into the nullah.After getting approval from the higher authorities, NHAI project director, Chandigarh, Pardeep Atri has asked MC officials to move forward with the tendering process and submit bank account details so that the funds can be transferred.MLA Sanjay Talwar said the main sewer line on Chandigarh Road overflows due to dumping of waste by dyeing, washing and other industrial units in the MC sewer lines. During monsoon, rainwater accumulation is witnessed on Chandigarh Road and adjoining areas for days, troubling the residents and commuters.“To resolve the issue, we had taken up the matter with NHAI last year and field visits were also conducted on Chandigarh Road and areas nearby where rain and sewage accumulate during the rainy season. NHAI chairperson Sukhbir Singh Sandhu has accepted our demands and the project has now been approved. It will be completed within six months,” said Talwar.Residents said it will be a major relief for the area if the MC is able to find a solution to water accumulation on Chandigarh Road during the monsoon season.A resident of Chandigarh Road, Premjit Singh, said, “The residents have been raising hue and cry over the issue for a long time, but the authorities had till now failed to resolve the problem. The accumulated water even enters the houses. If the authorities are able to find a solution to this, then it will be a major relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/waterlogging-in-ludhiana-nhai-approves-storm-sewer-line-project-101614964499619.html

Simadri defeated his nearest rival Niwasi Gouda. After losing the polls, Gouda had lodged a case against Simadri before the court of civil judge (senior division) in Chhatrapur alleging that his opponent did not know how to write or speak in Odia, had two wives and six children.Gouda lawyer, Srikant Mishra, said civil judge senior division Santosh Panigrahi passed the order disqualifying Simadri as he violated several provisions of the Odisha Gram Panchayat Act, 1994. The court relied on the depositions of four witnesses in the case.Also read: 'Ensure disengagement at other friction points on LAC' - India tells China againIronically, the order came on the day of late chief minister Biju Patnaik's birthday which is celebrated as the panchayatiraj divas. Former chief minister Biju Patnaik had introduced 33 per cent reservation for women in panchayatiraj bodies during his tenure.In 1994, his government had brought an amendment to the Odisha Gram Panchayat Act, ensuring that a person can not contest for the post of sarpanch if he/she can't read or write in Odia, has more than two spouses at a time and more than two children.In 2019, a woman in tribal-dominated Kandhamal district had lost her post as the chairperson of panchayat samiti after a court ruled that she was ineligible. Subhranti Pradhan, chairperson of the Daringibadi panchayat samiti in Kandhamal district and wife of sitting BJD MLA was declared ineligible for having two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-sarpanch-disqualified-by-court-for-keeping-2-wives-lack-of-odia-skills-101614963345760.html

Alternatively, they can opt to undergo the molecular test on arrival at the airport, wherein post submitting the test sample they can proceed with their journey and receive their reports in 8 hours. Similarly, domestic passengers arriving at CSMIA from Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa, Gujarat and Kerala can opt to provide a negative test report taken 72 hours prior to travel or undergo the RT-PCR test on arrival at the airport. In lieu of the travel restrictions, passengers can also opt to undertake the test at CSMIA before their departure or at their destination airport.Since the advent of the pandemic, CSMIA had implemented numerous SOPs, including the preventive measures laid down by health and government bodies to safeguard the well-being of the passengers and airport personnel. The airport continually strives to provide the best services and facilities to its passengers to ensure a seamless transit. CSMIA's recent recognition as the Best Airport by Size and Region in the over 40 million passenger category is a further re-affirmation of the initiatives undertaken by the airport during the pandemic for enhancing the experience of its passengers. The RT-PCR test facility at CSMIA for both arriving and departing passengers is a boon for traveller concerns regarding the various quarantine regulations across borders.

The trial court sentenced Khan to five years in the case on April 5, 2018, while acquitting co-accused Saif Ali Khan, Neelam, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Dushyant Singh.Also read: In 7 points, India rebuts US NGO’s ‘partly free’ downgrade in democracy reportThe petitioner had filed an appeal in the district and sessions court (Jodhpur district) against the five-year sentence, after hearing of which Salman Khan's sentence was suspended. Against the acquittal of the co-accused in the case, a witness named Poonamchand filed an appeal in the district court, while the state government filed a leave to appeal against the co-accused in the High Court, which is currently under consideration.Saraswat said that another appeal of the state government is under consideration in the sessions court, which was filed against Salman Khan's acquittal in the Arms Act case. Khan has demanded in the petition that while transferring the three appeals pending in the district and sessions court to the High Court, it should be heard with the leave to appeal by the state government.“All the three appeals arise from a common judgment pending before the sessions court and the state has also preferred Leave to Appeal before the High Court, therefore, ends of justice will be met if these three appeals are heard and decided together by the same court along with Criminal Leave to Appeal. Earlier, in Chinkara poaching cases, the High Court, while exercising power under Section 386 Cr.P.C allowed a similar transfer petition and directed the Criminal Appeal pending in the court of sessions judge, Jodhpur, to be transferred to the High Court,” Saraswat argued."In the meanwhile, the sessions judge, Jodhpur district, is directed not to proceed in Criminal Appeals,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/blackbuck-poaching-case-hc-directs-lower-courts-not-to-proceed-with-3-appeals-101614957108598.html

05-03-2021||Bangalore||Congress protests demanding revoking suspension of its MLA in Karnataka assembly||Protest by opposition Congress legislators demanding revocation of suspension of one of their colleagues from the House for his "indecent" conduct, disrupted proceedings of the Karnataka Assembly on Friday.Congress MLA B K Sangamesh was on Thursday suspended from the Assembly till March 12 for removing his shirt inside the House, during a protest by his party against Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri's decision to hold a special discussion on 'One Nation, One Election' (ONOE).Sticking to their stand, members of the principal opposition party also did not participate in the special discussion on ONOE, terming it "RSS agenda", as they also made it clear that they will not allow a debate on the topic.Disruption by Congress legislators through sloganeering and protest from the well of the House resulted in repeated adjournments, hence throwing the scheduled debate on ONOE out of gear.As the House met for the day Congress members trooped into the well and demanded that the suspension of Sangamesh be revoked.Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah, urging Speaker Kageri to revoke the suspension, said the MLA removed his shirt, angered by false cases of atrocity and attempt to murder booked against him and his family members and his voice not being heard by the Chair,Defending Sangamesh, he further said, the decision to suspend him for a week was not right, and demanded that the Chair using its powers should revoke the suspension.Hitting back, ruling BJP members criticised the Congress and Siddaramaiah for defending indecent conduct.Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai said, despite the Speaker informing Sangamesh that his notice on false cases will be heard, his behaviour of removing the shirt during the opposition's protest on ONOE was uncalled for."To what level are we going? He (Sangamesh) is not apologetic and has criticised the Chair in front of the media. ...if Congress leaders are defending his conduct this shows to what level they have stooped to.The decision to suspend him is right and it should not be revoked," he said.BJP member Araga Jnanendra, hitting out at the Congress and Sangamesh, asked "Do they think this is a cabaret club to remove dress?" Several other BJP MLAs including Basangouda Patil Yatnal said that the decision to suspend Sangamesh was right and urged that it should not be revoked.As the House witnessed chaos with Siddaramaiah and Congress members stating that false cases are being registered against opposition MLA, the Speaker requested them to cooperate and allow discussion."..if you (Congress) don't want to participate in debate on ONOE at least don't curtail the rights of those who want to participate," he said, as he defended the suspension of Sangamesh calling his conduct indecent and disrespectful.Siddaramaiah then said ONOE was an RSS agenda and it cannot be discussed here."We will not allow it..." Following this, the Speaker adjourned the House for some time.Again as the House resumed, even as Congress members continued to protest, the Speaker asked Minister Bommai to speak on ONOE, to which Siddaramaiah said, "we will not allow" and asked his partymen to continue sloganeering.Slogans like "revoke suspension", "speaker RSS puppet", marred Bommai's speech who tried to make a case for ONOE, as he noted that elections were held together till 1967 and held Congress responsible for deviating from it.Amid the din, the Speaker requested opposition members to allow those who want to participate in the debate to exercise their right and told Siddaramaiah and the state Congress chief D K Shivakumar to instruct his party members not to respect democracy.He then adjourned the House till post lunch.When the House resumed post lunch, BJP MLA P Rajeev started speaking on ONOE, but Congress members soon walked into the well of the House and continued with their protest.As his repeated appeal for smooth debate went unheard, Speaker Kageri said he would make all efforts to convince Siddaramaiah and Congress members for discussion on ONOE during the session till March 31 after budget presentation on March 8, and adjourned the House till Monday.The discussion on 'ONOE' was scheduled for March 4 and 5 at the beginning of the budget session, following advice by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting of Speakers of legislative assemblies held in Gujarat, and the Karnataka assembly is said to be the first to initiate a debate on the issue.The Congress on Thursday too had held a protest in the House against the special discussion on ONOE terming it as an RSS agenda, despite which the Speaker made his introductory remarks and Chief Minister B S Yediyiurappa made his statement advocating for synchronising assembly and parliamentary elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-protests-demanding-revoking-suspension-of-its-mla-in-karnataka-assembly-101614951052573.html

05-03-2021||Bhopal||Another irregularity in water resource department in MP after e-tendering scam||After the e-tendering scam, former Madhya Pradesh chief secretary and retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, M Gopal Reddy, is under the scanner again as the state government found an irregularity worth ₹877 crores in the allocation of irrigation projects in the water resource department (WRD).The state government has decided to hand over the probe to the Economic Offence Wing (EOW) on the instructions of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.According to the report by the water resources departmental, Reddy verbally instructed a chief engineer to relax the condition of the tender documents for construction of dams and canals connected with pressurized pump at seven places to make payment of ₹877 to seven private companies in advance without any work being done.Of the seven, three received the payment even before the design of the irrigation projects was approved by the Bureau of Design, said an officer of the department.Also read: As China eyes Taiwan and beyond, Quad's Indo-Pacific agenda takes priorityThe tenders were allocated between August 2018 and February 2019.“After this irregularity came to light in December last year, chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bais issued a notice to the officers of the department and asked why the payment was made in advance and why did a chief engineer relax the condition of the tender documents without informing the state government. The chief secretary also asked to cancel the order of advance payment issued in May 2019,” said an officer of the department, who didn’t wish to be named.“In a reply to notice, then chief engineer Rajeev Suklikar and chief engineer (tender) Shirish Mishra said the department didn’t want to delay the work as a delay can increase the cost of the projects. Suklikar also said that he released the order on the instruction of ACS M Gopal Reddy,” stated a letter of the inquiry report.When the department checked the progress of the projects till December 2020, it was found that even after two years, three renowned companies, which received the payment of ₹494 crores, had not started any work while two companies had undertaken merely 5 and 10 per cent of the work, respectively. The remaining two companies, however, ha completed 50 per cent of the work."After this progress report and reply of the engineers, the department found grave financial irregularities," said SN Mishra, additional chief secretary, WRD.The Chairman and the director of one of the companies, which got the payment but did not start any work, were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate recently in connection to the e-tendering scam.Hyderabad-based Mantena Constructions Private Limited's chairman Srinivas Raju, and Bhopal-based associate Aditya Tripathi were arrested by the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in January for paying a bribe to tamper the tender bid after the due date. The e-tendering scam broke in May 2018 but the first FIR was registered in April 2019 when the Congress came to power in the state.According to the FIR, a middleman hacked and illegally accessed the e-procurement portal and uploaded a changed tender document after the last date of submitting the tender to ensure that some companies would get the work.In the scam, the ED had also raided Reddy's premises in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad. Reddy, after his retirement in September 2020, had moved to Hyderabad. The ED had also called Reddy for registering his statement but he didn’t turn up at the ED office as he was found positive for Covid-19.Despite repeated attempts, Reddy, Rajeev Suklikar and Shirish Mishra couldn’t be contacted. They did not even respond to text messages.Water resource minister, Tulsi Silawat, said, “The irregularities have been found in the departmental inquiry and now the EOW will probe the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/another-irregularity-in-water-resource-department-in-mp-after-e-tendering-scam-101614945921775.html

05-03-2021||Other||Consecutive days of moderate rainfall helped fill up Pune dams last year: IMD||PUNE Even though the heavy rainfall events in Pune city have increased over the past few years, a recent study undertaken by scientists at India Meteorological Department (IMD) Pune has highlighted that consecutive days of moderate rainfall in the city and adjoining areas last year filled the three dams (Panshet, Varasgaon and Khadakwasla) solving the drinking water issue.Monsoon kicked off a little late in July (2020) which prompted local authorities to think about cutting down the water supply and exploring the option of artificial rainfall.The paper was presented by Anchal Khushwaha, junior scientist with the weather forecasting division of IMD, Pune at the annual monsoon workshop organised by Indian Meteorological Society, Pune on ‘Cloud precipitation process.’Along with Khushwaha, Jyoti Sonar, a scientist in the weather forecasting division, was also a part of the paper “Extreme rainfall warnings in monsoon 2020- Steps to liasoning with disaster managers for Maharashtra state’.The paper was guided by Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune.Research at the weather forecasting division aims at various operational aspects to benefit various users.Kashyapi said that the monsoon every year has a unique characteristic. “Consecutive moderate rainfall has an impact on low lying areas and allied aspects. Similarly, last year there was a query from local governing authorities about dam recharge. This was later resolved as the forecast given by IMD was realised,” said Kashyapi.Khushwaha said that last year, during the latter part of June and early July, rainfall was not good enough.“This created a little bit of panic among the local governing bodies like the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)and Central Water Commission, Pune. However, a sequence of consecutive days of mostly moderate rain in isolated areas in and around Pune district from June to September 2020 helped the recharge of Panshet dam,” she said.“We found that during June 3 to June 5, 2020, the mean rainfall for Pune district for three consecutive days was 36.99 millimetre per day which resulted in 23.33 per cent of dam recharge,” said Khushwaha.The study also revealed that between July 23 to July 26, 2020, the mean rainfall for the Pune district for four consecutive days was 17.45 millimetre per day which resulted in 40.42 per cent of dam recharge. Also, from August 5 to August 8, 2020, the mean rainfall for four consecutive days was 20.06 millimetre per day which resulted in 70.75 per cent of dam recharge.Kashyapi said, “A similar trend was observed between August 13 to August 17, 2020, where the mean rainfall for Pune district for five consecutive days was 15.34 millimetre per day which resulted in 100 per cent of dam recharge.”“From September 9 to September 12, 2020, the mean rainfall for Pune district for the period of consecutive four days was 17.57 millimetre per day which maintained the 100 per cent of dam recharge till the end of the season. Because of this good rainfall, ultimately the dam recharge for Pune district was 100 per cent of its capacity,” said Kashyapi.He added that though there was a panic among various stakeholders due to erratic rainfall, the dam was recharged 100 per cent due to light to moderate rain in and around Pune.Last year, as per IMD, Maharashtra received normal rainfall (16 per cent more than normal) while Madhya Maharashtra received excess rainfall (29 per cent more than normal), as well as Pune district, also received excess rainfall (40 per cent more than normal).Increased warnings for heavy rainfall eventsSonar has also worked on another paper which highlights that Madhya Maharashtra last year received 89 warnings for extreme rainfall events between June to September.“My paper ‘Extreme rainfall warnings during Monsoon 2020 by IMD’, explores how many warnings were issued between June 2020 to September 2020 for extreme rainfall events,” she said.“In Maharashtra, a total of 299 warnings were issued. In Madhya Maharashtra, which includes Pune, a total of 89 warnings were issued due to extreme rainfall events,” said Sonar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/consecutive-days-of-moderate-rainfall-helped-fill-up-pune-dams-last-year-imd-101614946016881.html
05-03-2021||Chandigarh||HP’s economy to shrink by 6.2% this fiscal: Economic Survey||Hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, Himachal Pradesh’s economy is likely to contract by 6.2% in the current fiscal, according to the Economic Survey, 2020-21, presented in the assembly by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur. The hill state went into strict lockdown in March last year to curb the spread of coronavirus, shutting down all economic activity. The economy had grown by 8.9% in the previous year. The per capita income at current prices is estimated to drop by 3.7% to ₹1,83,286 as compared to the estimated ₹1,90,407 in 2019-20. The state budget will be presented on Saturday. Dip in agriculture and allied sectors The survey projected that growth in the agriculture and livestock sectors is set to decline by 3.1% due to a decrease of 43% in horticulture production. The share of agriculture and allied sectors is key as they support 60% of the population in the gross value added (GVA) of the state at current prices that has declined from 15.89% in 2015-16 to 13.62% in 2020-21. This is on account of the relatively higher growth performance of non-agricultural sectors due to structural changes taking place in the economy and is in line with national and international trends. The sector registered a positive growth of 18.3% in 2019-20 at constant (2011-12) prices with a GVA of ₹10,583 crore as compared to ₹8,949 crore for 2018-19. 81% contraction in tourism sector One of the hardest hit sectors by the pandemic has been tourism. It saw a contraction of 81.33% in foreign and domestic tourist arrivals in 2020. The trade, hotel and restaurant sector showed a contraction of 9.2% during 2020-21 as against a growth of 4.6% in 2019-20. The transport sector too showed a negative growth of 28% during the current financial year as against 5.6% growth during 2018-19. The survey says that the state government played a proactive role and took many steps to mitigate the Covid-19 effect. Negative growth in industrial sector The manufacturing sector showed a contraction of 14.2% during 2020-21 as against a positive growth rate of 0.3% last year. The mining and quarrying sector showed a negative growth of 18.4%. According to estimates for 2019-20 at constant (2011-12) prices, the GVA of this secondary sector is estimated at ₹53,498 crore against ₹7,53,456 crore in 2018-19. The contribution of the manufacturing sector in GVA is expected to drop by 26.94% in 2020-21. The construction sector growth shrunk by 11.5%. Inflation has been moderate The inflation has been moderate in the state since 2014. During April-December, 2020, the consumer price index combined (CPI-C) was 5.3% as compared to 2.5% for the same period in 2019-20. CPI-Rural and CPI-Urban indices were 4.8% and 7.6%, respectively, against 2% and 4.7% last year. Fiscal development and employment The revenue receipts for 2020-21 are estimated to be 24.56% of the GSDP compared to 19.86% last year. Tax revenue is estimated to be 9.81%. Non-tax revenue shows a marginal increase to 1.54%. Fiscal deficit is estimated to be 4.65%. The survey highlights the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) report for 2018-19. This shows that the LFS rate has increased from 49.1% in 2017-18 to 52.8% in 2018-19. There has been a considerable increase in the female workforce participation rate in the state from 37.9% 2017-18 to 44.6% in 2018-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hps-economy-to-shrink-by-6-2-this-fiscal-economic-survey-101614945117443.html

05-03-2021||Bangalore||Shanvi Srivastava: Kannada audience’s capacity to understand cinema is improving||Shanvi Srivastava has been working non-stop since few months now. She completed the shoot of her two upcoming Kannada films- Thrishulam and Kasthuri Mahal and is shooting for Bang (Kannada) and Mahaveeryam (Malayalam). Having starred in ten Kannada films in her nine-year-long career, she is happy to see the growth in the industry. “The Kannada audience’s capacity to understand cinema, as a whole, has improved. They have become more understanding to different content and genres. Even the kind of content and roles being offered to me are unlike what I used to get. I can see growth in the industry. Now, the question is how accepting will people be towards this varied content,” wonders Srivastava, who was glad that she got the time to focus on her health -mental and physical and “got some clarity about life” in 2020. Born in Varanasi, she grew up in Uttar Pradesh, and later studied in Mumbai. She debuted with Telugu, moved on to Kannada films and now is doing a Malayalam film. Talking about managing languages, she says, “It was tough initially as the languages are different. But over a period of time, I would get so involved and focus on learning that nothing else mattered. My growth as an actor encouraged me and I kept learning with each film. Of course, I get stuck sometimes with tongue twisters and certain words and that frustrates me (laughs). But when I crack it, it is such a joy. Moreover, it is the love of the audience which gives me a kick. It’s addictive (laughs). They are so happy and accepting of the fact that someone from another part of the country is talking so well in their language.”Looking back at her career, she credits three films for her graph and the stature in the industry. “Lovely (Telugu; 2012) opened the gates to the industry for me. Chandralekha (Kannada; 2014) introduced me a different world and I began enjoying acting with that film. Earlier, I played a pretty girl in films. Avane Srimannarayana (Kannada; 2019) was a game-changer for me as I realised my potential and capacity as an actor and was able to push myself. Working with the amazing team, with such talents for one and a half years too was a learning experience,” she says. Srivastava admits she would love to do a Hindi film as its her mother tongue but she is also happy in her space and doesn’t want to rush anything. “I am growing each day and I will get there sometime. I want to focus on the journey, rather than the goal. Today, I am getting scripts that satisfy the actor in me, so I will follow this path for now.”Interact with author on Twitter/@iamkav||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/shanvi-srivastava-kannada-audience-s-capacity-to-understand-cinema-is-improving-101614935276302.html

The situation worsened two months ago, when the employer rejected Singh’s plea to let him go home after the expiry of his visa.

Nearly 14 years ago, a movement sprung out from Nandigram following the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or (CPI(M) government’s decision to build a special economic zone (SEZ) in the area. The move angered the villagers who needed those lands for agriculture.WATCH | CM Mamata Banerjee to contest from Nandigram; says this is a ‘smiley election’In 2007, the district saw several incidents of violence but on March 27 the killing of 14 unarmed villagers in Nandigram in police firing led to harsh criticism of the Left Front government. Banerjee stepped in along with her party and started the Nandigram movement, which eventually led to the fall of the Left Front government. The Nandigram movement became pivotal for the Trinamool Congress as it fought the elections on the plank of giving people back their rights and most importantly their lands. Along with Banerjee, Suvendu Adhikari also led the anti-land acquisition movement in Nandigram and worked to expand the party’s base in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura, which were the earlier strongholds of the CPI(M).Trinamool Congress, banking on what it called its pro-people politics, won the panchayat elections in 2008, Lok Sabha elections in 2009, municipal polls in 2010 and registered a massive victory ousting the Left Front government from power in the 2011 elections.In 2021, the picture has changed drastically as Adhikari is longer with the Trinamool Congress. At a rally in Midnapore in December 2020, the Union minister for home affairs Amit Shah stood alongside a group of Trinamool Congress lawmakers, who defected from the party saying it had shifted away from helping the people. The leaders were led by Adhikari, who claimed that the people of West Bengal will oust the TMC from power, sounding very different from a decade ago when he along with Banerjee celebrated the fall of the Left Front government.Banerjee’s decision to fight from Nandigram can be seen as a move to win back her electorates. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not yet announced its list of candidates for the upcoming polls but Nandigram has once again become a critical point. As the BJP promises to usher ‘ashol poriborton’ (the real change) and a new era of development for West Bengal, the TMC chief has gone back to the drawing board to ensure that her party remains in power.TMC workers are already looking for houses in Nandigram where the West Bengal chief minister will set up her base in the following weeks as the state heads to elections on March 27. Sheikh Sufiyan, a TMC leader from East Midnapore, told HT that party workers have zeroed in on three to four houses where the chief minister will decide the strategy for the polls.Senior leaders of the BJP have said they are confident about a clean sweep from the Nandigram seat in the upcoming assembly election in West Bengal and that its candidate will defeat Banerjee by 50,000 votes.Fear of violence has already cast a shadow on the upcoming polls in the state. Several clashes between the workers of the BJP and the ruling party have led to the loss of lives and injuries over the past couple of years. West Bengal assembly elections will be held across eight phases starting March 27. Elections will be held on April 1, April 6, April 10, April 17, April 22, April 26 and April 29 for the rest of the phases. The votes will be counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/tmc-releases-first-list-of-291-candidates-for-west-bengal-assembly-polls-101614934239385.html

Speaker Rana KP Singh suspended all Akali legislators for the next three days of the session after they created chaos in the Vidhan Sabha that led to two adjournments of the House. Asking the assembly marshals to keep the SAD MLAs out of the House, the Speaker adjourned the assembly for 15 minutes in a bid to restore order. The second adjournment was ordered soon after the chief minister resumed his speech. The SAD members termed the chief minister’s speech a bundle of lies and stormed into the well of the House. The ruling party members were also seen raising slogans against the opposition Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party for joining hands to disrupt the CM’s speech. The Speaker announced the suspension of the SAD MLAs as they started raising anti-government slogans when Capt Amarinder Singh castigated the role of SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal over justifying farm laws when the Centre was preparing to bring the Bills in Parliament. All efforts by the Speaker to calm the Akali members down were in vain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-mlas-suspended-for-budget-session-for-disrupting-punjab-cm-s-speech-101614933836248.html

The court held that as the accused had blatantly violated trademark and copyright provisions, had also resorted to cheating by getting sub-standard goods manufactured and inducing people into buying them by passing them off as that of a reputed company, his custodial interrogation was necessary.A single judge bench of justice Sarang Kotwal while hearing the anticipatory bail application of Piyush Ranipa was informed that the applicant had been booked by Mohol police station at Solapur for offences punishable under various section of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Copyright Act, 1957, and Trade Marks Act, 1999, in December 2020. The complaint was lodged by the zonal manager of the pipe manufacturing company after he intercepted a consignment of pipes and found that the name, trademark and even license number of his company were used to market sub-standard pipes.Also Read | Bombay HC asks authorities to reply to PIL against removal of cash lanes at toll plazasWhen the application came up for hearing, the lawyer of the accused argued that the offences under which he was booked were bailable.The bench sought the help of advocate Aniket Nikam as amicus curiae to ascertain whether the offences under which the accused was booked were bailable or non-bailable offences.After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “In this case whether there is infringement of Copyright Act attracting punishment under section 63 of the Act; is a matter of investigation, but certainly there appears to be infringement of the trademark registered in the name of the informant’s company. Therefore, commission of offence punishable under section 103 of the Trade Marks Act is clearly made out. The accused have falsely applied the informant’s trademark to their own products and have attempted to sell those products...By their act, the public were induced or an attempt was made to induce the public to buy these products under the impression that they were manufactured by the informant’s company.”The court held that custodial interrogation of the accused was required and hence rejected the anticipatory bail application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-says-offences-under-trademark-act-cognisable-101614930955794.html

05-03-2021||Other||Slam dunk: India, the next frontier in global basketball... Key ingredients to improve basketball talent||PUNE By any measure of popularity in the 21st century, the sport of basketball likely ranks among the top three most popular global sports. Followed by an estimated 2.5 billion people, the game has grown by leaps and bounds (pardon the pun), now featuring 107 international players in the NBA, the world’s most competitive basketball league. A large part of this burgeoning growth of the NBA can be attributed to Yao Ming being drafted with the first overall pick by the Houston Rockets. With this pick, the NBA instantly became attractive to the Chinese market as Chinese fans flocked to learn the game of basketball at a higher rate than ever before. Currently, it is believed that 300 million basketball players play the sport recreationally or competitively in China. Being the world’s 2nd largest current population, India is the next country that could see an explosive growth in the popularity and talent level of the sport of basketball. Indeed, with the NBA currently having one of its seven international basketball academies based in New Delhi, steps are already being taken to contribute to the talent level and growth of basketball in the country. Additionally, the NBA launched the first NBA Basketball School in Mumbai in April 2017, to further educate players, parents, coaches and organisations on the process of improvement and development. While these steps have served to increase the popularity of the game even further, there are a few things that could be done to enhance the talent level and spearhead the meteoric rise of the sport to mirror the basketball talent level of China. Likely, the most essential piece of this operation would be to create the infrastructure required to play basketball recreationally around the country. With basketball requiring a hoop, a ball and a concrete or wooden playing surface, the biggest step governing bodies could make would be to increase access to the game to more people. This would mean having more areas throughout the country in various communities with courts and basketballs available for game play. In return, there would be a higher amount of recreational interest in the sport, which would raise the competition level for all basketball players in the country. Currently, the sport is limited in competition due to the lack of easy access to the game for the majority of people. An increased competition level will certainly result in better basketball talent coming out of the country which would have a multiplier effect on the motivation of young players to improve their talent. Currently, India has not experienced its watershed moment of having a player drafted in the first round of the NBA Draft, something that would undoubtedly catapult the popularity of the sport and motivation of Indian basketball players. However, there is a steadier talent pool of Indian players being exposed to play at the highest level of youth competitive basketball. Currently, Princepal Singh is the first Indian player to play competitive basketball beyond the university level in America. Singh is a graduate of the NBA Academy system, and is a talented player who joined the rising stars NBA G-League Ignite Team, which is currently competing in the NBA G-League bubble in Orlando. While he has not seen many minutes yet, his growth and steady progression in learning the nuances of competitive basketball will make him a player that is necessary to keep an eye on for the future. With the original pioneers for Indian basketball players in America being outliers in size such as big men like Satnam Singh, the success of players like Princepal Singh in playing competitive basketball clearly shows that the talent level and popularity of the sport continues to improve in India, setting it up well to be the next country where the sport of basketball takes a meteoric leap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slam-dunk-india-the-next-frontier-in-global-basketball-key-ingredients-to-improve-basketball-talent-101614929755027.html
05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Can’t deny maternity leave to woman if she’s mother through surrogacy: HC||A woman employee cannot be denied maternity leave even if she has become a mother through surrogacy, the Himachal Pradesh high court has held in an order passed on Thursday. A division bench, comprising justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and justice Sandeep Sharma, passed these orders on the petition filed by a woman language teacher working on contract in Kullu district. She became a mother on September 9, 2020, through surrogacy but when she applied for maternity leave, her application was rejected. Hearing her petition, the court observed that it’s no longer res integra (a case without a precedent) that a woman contractual or ad hoc employee is entitled to maternity leave on a par with a regular woman employee on grounds of fair play and social justice and there cannot be any discrimination. The court further observed that once the respondents admit that the minor child is that of the petitioner, then she is entitled to the leave akin to others who are granted leave in terms of the leave rules. ‘Motherhood doesn’t end at birth of child’ “Even in the case of adoption, the adoptive mother does not give birth to the child, yet the necessity of bonding of the mother with the child has been recognised by the central government,” the court said. To distinguish between a mother who begets a child through surrogacy and a natural mother, would result in insulting womanhood and the intention of a woman to bring up a child begotten through surrogacy, the court added. It said that motherhood never ends on the birth of the child and a commissioning mother cannot be refused paid maternity leave. A woman cannot be discriminated against, as far as maternity benefits are concerned, only on the ground that she has obtained the baby through surrogacy. A newborn cannot be left at the mercy of others as it needs rearing and that is the most crucial period during which the child requires care and attention of his mother. Creating bond of affection between mother and childThe Bench also referred to Article 42 of the Constitution, which provides that the state shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief as it was long felt that working women were unable to depute their time towards their children due to exigencies of service. Hence, the concept of grant of childcare leave was introduced to ensure the welfare of the child to enable the mother to avail leave whenever she feels that the child needs the care, said the court. It said that maternity leave is provided for creating a bond of affection between the two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cant-deny-maternity-leave-to-woman-if-she-s-mother-through-surrogacy-hc-101614925915512.html

The petitioner’s lawyer told the division bench of justice S S Shinde and justice Manish Pitale that on February 8, the petitioner was informed that his daughter had lost her balance and fallen from the balcony of a first floor flat. She was rushed to the hospital where she was declared dead on admission.Also Read | Bombay HC asks Amazon to take down film over actor’s defamation caseSoon after her death, news of the woman having been in an illicit relationship with Y surfaced in print and electronic media which was defamatory and derogatory, said the petition. The lawyer submitted that the news was based on 12 audio clips containing an alleged conversation between the deceased and some unknown person. These clips, he said, were circulated by some political parties and the media to defame the deceased and also her family. .The media houses said they would exercise restraint and would not publish any objectionable content and would “scrupulously follow the guidelines” laid down by the division bench of the high court.In the January 18 order that the court referred to, the chief justice had held that the dignity of an individual even after death was protected under Article 21 of the constitution and hence media houses should follow various guidelines for reporting on “sensitive criminal matters, including death by suicide”. The order had also restrained the media from showing photographs of the deceased and reconstructing the incident while investigation was underway. The order had warned of strict action in the form of criminal contempt against errant media houses. While directing the respondents to not “to publish or give any unnecessary publicity to the incident of death of the daughter of the petitioner and further alleged illicit relationship of the daughter with Y,” the court issued notices to the Central and state government, Press Council of India, News Broadcasters Association and the four news channels who were made party in the petition to respond before the next hearing on March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/follow-guidelines-while-reporting-death-of-pune-woman-hc-tells-media-101614924835105.html

The programme will focus on training and capacity-building of young women at all levels from gram panchayat to urban municipal bodies,” Nanda said.While Miranda House will work on the curriculum, She Leads, a week-long virtual leadership training programme designed to support aspiring women political leaders, will work as resource partner of the college and function as co-creators, Nanda said.Also Read | European Union sets itself jobs, training and equality targets for 2030She Leads is a project led by non-governmental organisation Stree Shakti, The Parallel Force with the support of Chevening Alumni Project Fund (CAPF) in collaboration with Indian School of Democracy (ISD). The training for the first cohort of women leaders, being conducted by Stree Shakti currently, will culminate on March 8 at the India International Centre in New Delhi.“We plan to give all the necessary and training to young women interested in joining politics at any stage. Though the programme was conceptualised for in-person classes, we plan to offer it in blended (online as well as in-person) mode so that the colleges adopted by us under the university’s Vidya Vistar scheme can also avail the course,” Nanda said. The college is currently working with experts to finalise the curriculum and will hold a series of meetings beginning Monday to brainstorm on it.Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and Miranda House alumna Brinda Karat, who graduated from the college in 1966, welcomed the move. “As part of the alumnae, I am glad to know that my old college is taking such an initiative. The whole aspect of women’s rights is linked to women’s rights in decision-making bodies. Women in India at different levels have taken important initiatives to show the relevance of women’s participation in political processes and it is good that our students should study the experience of women, particularly in panchayats,” said the leader.Bharatiya Janata Party leader Shazia Ilmi also pointed out that having more women political leaders in decision-making processes would lead to policies which take into account the challenges women face. “When it comes to policy and legislation, women are equal stakeholders. There have to be ways and means to make things easier for more women to join politics. For instance, Twitter and Facebook make it ugly for women and there have to be necessary checks and balances to protect them from specific abuse and trolling,” she said.Ilmi added, “Being in politics is challenging for women, especially for those who don’t have any sort of backing and are here on their own merit. Young women have to be taught to be determined because naysayers will doubt or question them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-miranda-house-to-start-training-course-for-aspiring-women-politicians-101614923515120.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Anurag Kashyap, Taapsee Pannu paid price of speaking against Centre: Saamana||Shiv Sena on Friday criticised the Centre over the income tax raids on filmmaker Anurag Kashyap and actor Taapsee Pannu,saying that they are facing action because they backed farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws passed by the government.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said incidents like these, the arrest of environmental activist Disha Ravi, and the “silent and dirty campaigns” against actor Deepika Padukone, show the country in a bad light.Offices and homes of Kashyap, Pannu, film director Vikas Bahl, distributor Madhu Mantena, and others were raided by the income tax department on Wednesday in Mumbai and Pune. The next day, officials said they found discrepancy and manipulation of income during the searches at various places linked to Pannu, Kashyap and his partners at the now defunct production house, Phantom Films. There was also a huge suppression of income compared to the actual box office collections, they said.ALSO WATCH | Anurag Kashyap, Taapsee Pannu’s properties raided by Income Tax l Who said what“Taapsee Pannu and Anurag Kashyap put forward their opinion frankly. This brings us to the question if the remaining transactions in Bollywood are fair and transparent, and irregularities are only with Taapsee Pannu and Anurag Kashyap... They are among the handful of people who stood by the farmers’ agitation. They are paying the price for it,” the editorial said.Also Read | Raj Thackeray party takes credit of closing Karachi Bakery; not true, say othersQuestioning why only these few people were raided, it said, “Do the crores [of rupees] being circulated in Bollywood come from the Ganges?”It pointed out that the raids came the same day as the Supreme Court ruled, in another case, that criticising the government does not amount to sedition.The editorial alleged that a campaign was launched against actor Deepika Padukone following her visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University campus in January 2020. “Similar things happened after Deepika Padukone visited JNU to meet the students [to express solidarity with them after they were allegedly attacked by a mob]. There was a silent agitation against her, dirty campaigns started against her, her film was targeted.“Who are these people who carry out such acts and to which ideology they belong is a separate issue but our country’s image is definitely not getting better with such acts. Modi government was criticised globally for the manner in which environment activist Disha Ravi was arrested. Such incidents impact the country’s reputation,” it said.BJP was yet to react to Saamana’s editorial at the time of filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anurag-kashyap-taapsee-pannu-paid-for-speaking-against-centre-saamana-101614923035085.html

The two men, Akash Rana and Rahul Rana, who worked for a life insurance company, were returning from a party hosted by their employers at a prominent hotel around 1am, when the accident occurred at a traffic junction between Sector 6 and 7 of Dwarka. “The two cars collided with each other at the traffic junction.

05-03-2021||Lucknow||Early end to UP’s budget session leaves opposition miffed||The Uttar Pradesh legislature was adjourned sine die on Thursday about six days ahead of schedule after both the state assembly and the legislative council gave their nod to the state Budget for 2021-22. The state’s first paperless budget was presented with the largest-ever outlay of ₹550,270.78 crore on February 22. It has new schemes worth ₹27,598.40 crore.On Thursday, the assembly passed five bills, including the Uttar Pradesh Appropriation Bill-2021 that allows the state government to draw ₹5.85 lakh crore from the consolidated fund and a legislation to repeal 61 redundant laws, after protests, slogan-shouting and walkouts by members of the major Opposition parties.While the Opposition expressed unhappiness over the session ending ahead of schedule, parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna cited precedent, asserting that it was not a new tradition. He also referred to the upcoming panchayat elections as well as the World Health Organisation and Niti Aayog’s observations on the fight against Covid-19.Hours after the assembly was adjourned sine die, the Upper House of the bicameral state legislature, too, followed suit on completing the listed business, passing several amendment bills by voice vote.The budget session began on February 18 and was scheduled to end with the passing of the budget on March 10. In its 15-day session, the state assembly held 10 sittings and conducted business for 65 hours and 31 minutes. Soon after the assembly’s sitting began for the day at 11am, Khanna urged speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit that all the items relating to the state budget be taken up and passed on the day.In his attempt to convince the Opposition members, Khanna said, “Five-day debate, admissible on the state budget, will be complete on Thursday. Panchayat elections are underway. Many members have to be in their constituencies to file objections about reservation of constituencies.”Opposition members staged a walkout when listed business was being taken up and alleged that the state government was violating all democratic norms. The second walkout came when the state government moved the Uttar Pradesh Repeal Bill 2021 to do away with 61 laws that have become redundant.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had spoken in the assembly on Wednesday and replied to issues raised by leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, BSP leader Lalji Verma and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’.Chaudhary (SP) said the state government had given the programme of the House till March 10. By bringing down the number of sittings, the state government was violating democratic norms and curtailing the rights of the members, he alleged. Verma quoted chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s statement made in 2017. He said the CM had talked about having more than 90 sittings of the House every year and the state government was backtracking on these words. He said this was for the first time that the question hour was not being held to make way for passage of the budget. The CLP leader said the state government’s move would deprive new members of the experience of cut motions on departmental budgets in the House.Khanna, however, said there was a lot of difference between the words and deeds of the Opposition. He said on March 12, 1991, the then minister for parliamentary affairs had moved a proposal to get the budget passed in one go. In 2009, the House met only for 13 days and a similar motion was moved on February 20, 2009 with the then minister for parliamentary affairs Lalji Verma, quoting the precedence of March 11, 1991 to make his point. Khanna said this was repeated again on March 11, 2006 in the House.The assembly also passed the Uttar Pradesh Fundamental Rule 56 (Amendment and Validation) Bill 2021 to retrospectively validate the retirement of state government employees on the afternoon of the last day of the month in which he/she attains the age of 60 years. The House also gave its nod to the Uttar Pradesh Sheera Niyantran (Sansodhan) Vidheyak 2021 (control of molasses amendment bill 2021) to confer on the state government the powers of determining the rate of administrative charges on transfer, selling and supply of molasses by the sugar factories.It also passed the Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for Physically Handicapped, Dependents of Freedom Fighters and Ex-Servicemen (Amendment) Bill 2021 to give representation to ex-servicemen in subordinate services and provide 5% reservation on Group B posts.Also Read: Man detained for Taj Mahal hoax bomb call, may have mental health illness: CopIn the council, the pre-lunch session witnessed walkouts by the SP, BSP, and Congress members over several issues.

BSP members walked out over the issue of alleged police atrocities.Congress members claimed there were "363 incidents of self-immolation outside UP Vidhan Sabha in the last seven months".

Predicting his party’s victory on 350 seats in the assembly elections, Yadav said no one trusted the EVMs. At a training camp for party workers in Jhansi, Yadav said that even in a country like the United States, the presidential elections were held through ballot papers and the counting lasted for several days.

He alleged that the BJP government forcibly passed the farm laws in the Rajya Sabha despite the fact that it did not have majority there. “BJP wants to kill democracy.

Chaudhary also continued his attack on the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a kisan panchayat in Jahangirabad town of Bulandshahar district.He said BJP leaders should break the shackles of “slavery” and join the four months long farmers’ movement. He then appealed to the gathering to show the BJP leaders the “might” of vote in the forthcoming panchayat elections.He said that the movement's effect was quite visible on BJP's posters, which earlier had photos of party leaders and now carry photos of Chaudhary Charan Singh and farmer leaders.The RLD leader further said that youth were attending farmers’ gatherings in big numbers which indicated their mindset to oust the Modi government from power. He alleged that while ignoring the pain and plights of farmers, the Modi government was intent on benefiting a handful of corporates, and called upon farmers to show their unity to the government trying to “disgrace and defame” the movement.In what appeared to be a rejoinder to PM Modi’s ‘andolanjeevi’ (compulsive protestors) jibe, he said farmers, who provided food to people could never suck blood of others like a 'Parjivi' (parasite).Also Read: Delhi HC directs UP police to give post mortem report of farmerJayant also said that the three contentious farm laws passed by the Parliament would destroy farmers and farming and accused the government of spreading “lies” that they would be advantageous to farmers.He said, "Our battle was to protect farmers and farming while they (the government) were protecting interests of corporate", and added that the movement would continue till the government agreed to repeal the farm laws and legalise the minimum support price regime (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rlds-jayant-chaudhary-asks-bjp-leaders-to-join-farmers-stir-or-lose-polls-101614911807367.html

05-03-2021||Delhi||461 bullets, 4,000 tear gas shells used by cops to quell Delhi riots||Policemen fired at least 461 bullets in the air and used nearly 4,000 tear gas shells to quell the Hindu-Muslim clashes that erupted in parts of northeast Delhi a year ago, according to Delhi police’s report on the riots.The numbers of bullets fired and tear gas shells used were the highest in recent years, several mid-level police officers said. To be sure, while tear gas is commonly used to quell protests, instances of police resorting to aerial firing are not common. “Before the riots, while police may have used hundreds of tear gas shells during violent demonstrations such as the violence outside Jamia Millia Islamia during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests, police in Delhi hardly have to resort to aerial firing. It happens only once in a while and in a few cases,” said an officer who did not wish to be identified.At least 53 persons died while 581 others were injured when riots broke out in northeast Delhi between February 23 and 27 last year. The analysis on the use of force by police also mentions that “police did not use excessive force despite extreme provocation, with the first casualty in the riots being a policeman”.Police have said that while rioters carried pistols and other types of weapons, all their officers fired only aerially and not at any rioter on the road. “...However, if police had resorted to direct fire, to disperse the protestors, the casualties would have been enormous and could have further fuelled the riots. The police used tear gas, lathi charge and aerial firing to control the crowd. The force used was neither excessive nor less but was commensurate to the demands of the situation,” the report reads.Tear gas and lathi charge are the first steps used by police in handling riots.Of the 53 people who died, postmortem reports later revealed that at least 13 of them had died of gunshot wounds. One of the defining images of the riots was that of a northeast Delhi resident, later identified as Shah Rukh Pathan, holding a pistol, also pointing it at a police officer, in the middle of the violence. Police investigations revealed that many rioters bought weapons from parts of western Uttar Pradesh before the riots began. In Shah Rukh’s case, the pistol he used (later recovered) was bought from Munger, Bihar. He bought it from an employee of an illegal gun factory in Munger.According to the police report, the highest number of bullets fired and tear gas shells used were in the first 36 hours of the violence. It mentioned that before 2020, the 1992 riots in northeast Delhi were concentrated in areas under three police stations, while in 2020 the violence was spread across 12 police stations and two police districts: northeast and Shahdara.Police mentioned that most of the casualties last year were reported in the interior areas north of Wazirabad Road, which had no previous history of communal riots. The mobs, according to the report, gathered in large numbers at many places simultaneously and when they were controlled or dispersed from one place, they continued rioting at the other places.“The intensity and scale of violence can be gauged from the fact that 4,458 PCR calls were received on February 24, 2020 and 9,308 calls the following day,” the report said.As an attempt to restore calm during and after the riots, police records show that between February 22 and March 21, 2020, a total of 471 peace committee meetings were held in the area, many of which were chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and police commissioner SN Shrivastava.As part of their investigation, police have till date arrested 1,753 persons, which includes 820 Hindus and 933 Muslims. Of the 1,753 persons, at least 544 alleged rioters who were involved in specific incidents of rioting and arson are currently out on bail.Local politicians Tahir Hussain and Ishrat Jahan, student activists Umar Khalid, Gulfisha Fatima and Sharjeel Imam who are among 21 alleged main conspirators are still behind bars. Police have booked the 21 persons on charges of sedition and under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/461-bullets-4-000-tear-gas-shells-used-by-cops-to-quell-delhi-riots-101614896937298.html

05-03-2021||Delhi||Court warrant against MCD union members||The Delhi high court on Thursday issued bailable warrants against the secretary and president of one of the unions of sanitation workers for evading the proceedings of the court, despite several communications, on a plea filed by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) against the strike of sanitation workers.A bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Rekha Palli also asked the members of the striking union to not put under siege the municipal corporation or throw garbage on the streets. This direction came after the judges were informed by advocate Manu Chaturvedi, standing counsel for the EDMC, that unions have sent a notice for resuming their strike, demanding salaries despite all salaries being cleared till January.The EDMC also sought action against “miscreants” who were “illegally waylaying garbage removal trucks, threatening drivers and dumping garbage openly on the roads and streets”.The court issued bailable warrants of ₹20,000 each against the president and secretary of MCD Swacchta Karamchari Union while noting that they have not joined the proceedings despite several communications to do so.The bench, during the proceedings, told Mukesh Kumar, representing All Municipal Corporations Staff Union, that while the court is passing orders to ensure timely disbursal of salaries, it cannot allow them to take law into their owns hands and spread “anarchy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-warrant-against-mcd-union-members-101614895174458.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||MBA in family business helping people across India, says Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said that his government’s decision of introducing an MBA programme in the family business and entrepreneurship to the state-run Delhi Technical University (DTU) will not only enhance the family businesses in the national capital but also across the country.The Delhi government had launched this course in DTU in 2019. Addressing the gathering on the occasion of the inauguration of an auditorium in DTU’s east campus, Sisodia said, “The introduction of MBA in Family Business and Entrepreneurship at DTU will enhance family businesses of not just Delhi but of the entire nation. Their children need not seek employment in other companies. Rather they can use their learning from the course to better their business and create more job opportunities. It is my dream that this course becomes the best entrepreneurship course in the world and compete with Babson college of the US, which is renowned for its family business and entrepreneurship course.”Sisodia also interacted with students enrolled in the course to know their experiences. Abhishek Mohta, a second-year student, said, “My father has a business of stone crusher manufacturing. In India, we seem to lack succession planning within families, and hence, most children don’t inspire to be a part of family businesses. Being a student of MBA Family business and entrepreneurship really opened up my mind to new ideas, which I incorporated within my family business and saw great success.”Another student Aman Gupta said, “My family has a construction business and two years back, we also opened a restaurant. But with the onset of Covid pandemic, we lost so much of our money the effort that we had put in it. After learning new ideas here, I have been able to revive our restaurant business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mba-in-family-business-helping-people-across-india-says-sisodia-101614894921548.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Local sources behind high pollution in north, east Delhi||Road dust, open garbage burning and high vehicular movement on internal roads were the primary culprits that pushed the air quality in east and north Delhi to be the worst this winter season, residents of the area said.Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Wednesday had released a winter analysis of air quality in Delhi and NCR this winter compared to the previous years. The analysis highlighted that east and north Delhi recorded the worst levels of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), while air quality monitoring stations in west Delhi were relatively cleaner compared to the rest of the city.Residents and business owners in north Delhi’s Jahangirpuri, which recorded the worst air quality in the city with a seasonal average of 256μg/m3, said that road dust was a primary factor in adding to the pollution levels here.Ramesh Thakral, a shop owner near the Jahangirpuri metro station, said that broken roads and constant movement of vehicles has turned the area into a perpetual dust bowl. The situation worsens during winters, he said.“The roads are so riddled with potholes; how will you even ply mechanical sweepers here? Garbage here lies around for days before it is picked up. Since it is not picked up regularly, some residents and shop owners set it on fire at night. If you come here at night you can see smoke billowing from piles of garbage,” Thakral said.Open burning and abandoned old vehicles have also become a prominent source of pollution in east Delhi. Residents complained that despite strict order by government and municipal agencies, garbage and dried leave are often set on fire in areas around Acharya Niketan, Laxmi Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Patparganj and Krishna Nagar. Since these incidents are often reported from residential neighbourhoods that are away from the main roads, these instances seldom come to the notice of authorities, residents said.Sehmat Alam, general secretary of joint residents’ welfare association of Pandav Nagar lane eight, nine and ten, said that local construction work carried out by residents without following the pollution norms is also a problem.“Every year when construction is stopped you can see piles of cement and construction debris lying around on roads, which are then blown around by vehicles moving,” he said.CSE in its analysis said that wide local variations among monitoring locations indicated higher impact of local pollution and micro-climate.“This analysis has helped us understand the regional patterns as well as the local variations. Even though there is considerable regional variation, peak pollution episodes increased and synchronised within the region. The uneven rise across monitoring locations, even contiguous locations, brings out the impact of local pollution,” said Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager in CSE’s urban lab team of the sustainable cities programme.Jai Prakash, north Delhi mayor, said that all efforts of the municipal agencies this winter were focused to control local pollution sources.“We ensured that mechanical sweepers were deployed in all areas under our jurisdiction and a close watch was also kept on controlling garbage burning and dumping cases. We were also deploying water sprinklers to settle local dust,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/local-sources-behind-high-pollution-in-north-east-delhi-101614894680594.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Police claim to foil plot for murder of riots accused in Tihar jail||The Delhi police’s special cell in January had foiled an alleged attempt on the life of two men lodged in Tihar jail for their role in northeast Delhi riots. Police said that the murder plot was hatched by a convict who had also roped in two other lodged in the same prison to eliminate the duo and planned to kill them by administering them mercury through food.No Delhi police officer commented on the incident on record, but senior police officers aware of the development said on condition of anonymity that the two men who were on the target, are lodged in Tihar for their role in the northeast Delhi violence. The convict, Shahid, who had planned the kill, is also serving sentence for his role in a gang rape and murder case of 2015. The man had planned to administer the two men with mercury in their food, they said.The conspiracy came to fore during the first week of January when following a tip off, the attempt to smuggle the mercury inside the jail in a perfume bottle, was foiled by a team of special cell.“Aslam was arrested following information before he could supply the mercury. During questioning, he disclosed the conspiracy to kill the two men by adding mercury in the food,” said a police officer requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-claim-to-foil-plot-for-murder-of-riots-accused-in-tihar-jail-101614894447202.html

His father has been ill and out of work for the past many months.According to the police, the crane was hired by a private contractor to whom the drain construction work near the boy’s house was outsourced by a civic agency.It is learnt that the crane, during its operation, hit the boy, causing him to fall into the drain. According to the police, the crane then went on to dump the dug-up mud on him, completely burying him.Vikram’s father, Madhusudan Das, told a news outlet that the crane operator fled the scene immediately after the accident. “It took us 15 minutes to dig my son out. Had the crane operator been around to help, my son could have been quickly rescued and he would be alive right now,” he said.After being pulled out of the mud, Vikram was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.The police have registered a case of causing death due to negligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/earthmover-accidentally-dumps-soil-kills-14-year-old-boy-in-shahbad-dairy-101614894253407.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Life in an auto-rickshaw||It looks like a pillow, so delicate—as if it were the magic cushion of some fairy tale princess. But of course it is auto-rickshaw driver Krishna Kumar Gupta’s little cushion, the one that he always keeps on his seat.“Few drivers have such a gaddi (cushion),” he admits while gazing upon the little fluffy thing. (Just looking at it gives one the feeling of comfort.) “But every driver should have one,” he continues. Mr Gupta talks about the particular difficulties posed by the nature of his job. “It’s a fact that many auto drivers suffer from bawasir (piles)... this is caused by prolonged sitting... and the driver’s average seat is usually a hard surface.”And that’s why he protects himself by using this cushion, he concludes.The gentleman is waiting for customers this evening in a central Delhi lane. A quick survey of his auto reveals that it’s much better groomed than most. A colourful mask, a spare one, is hanging from a side mirror. A plastic sanitiser bottle is fitted by the steering handle. And the bottom portion of the front view glass is painted in beautiful fonts with the names of Gods, including Lord Krishna. In fact, Mr Gupta hails from the land most identified with Krishna, Mathura.Mr Gupta, 60, has been driving his auto around Delhi for 40 years. “I’ve been in this line for so long that I know a bit about what we drivers most suffer from... many of us are addicted to smoking—but not me! And almost all of us suffer more frequently than other people from jhukham-khasi (running nose and cough) and breathing problem. This is because we are continually exposed to the pollution, I think, absorbing all the bad air of the city from morning to night.”Considering the possibility of quitting this occupation, he observes that “one of the good things of being an auto driver is that all your income is made in hard cash. No borrowing, no lending, no depositing in the bank. You get your money instantly.”Mr Gupta lives with his family in Sangam Vihar. His late father used to run a small grocery shop in Mathura. He feels he ended up being lucky. “My two daughters are married and settled in their homes... my son is in 12th standard. Next year he will try to get a job as a peon in the government.”As for himself, he accepts that ageing auto drivers keep driving into their advanced years “as long as hands and arms and eyes are on our side.” But he’s planning to give this line up in a year.“I have other plans. I want to open a small shop in Delhi, after retiring from auto-giri.” And then he will, at long last, do what his father did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-life-in-an-autorickshaw-101614892325360.html
05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Don’t agree with term ‘love jihad’, says Haryana Dy CM||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said on Thursday that he did not agree with the term “love jihad” used by state home minister Anil Vij with reference to the proposed Freedom of Religion Bill being tabled in the state assembly, where the budget session is scheduled to begin on Friday.Vij has frequently called the proposed legislation as a law against “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing groups alleging a conspiracy by Muslim men to convert Hindu women to Islam by way of marriage.Speaking to NDTV, the deputy chief minister said that his Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, will support the move to enact a law for stopping forced religious conversion. “But if someone is willing to convert on his own, there should not be a bar,’’ he said.Chautala’s disagreement on Vij’s “love jihad” label for the Freedom of Religion Bill came against a backdrop of growing discord between him and the home minister, particularly in the wake of various inquiries initiated in excise-related matters allegedly at Vij’s behest. The excise and taxation portfolio is held by the deputy chief minister.Vij last week said the state government was planning to introduce a bill to curb “love jihad” in the coming assembly session. The proposed legislation is called the Haryana Freedom of Religion Bill.The home minister on November 6 last year told the state assembly that the government was deliberating on enacting a law to check forced religious conversion. Vij had said the state government was also compiling information about instances where forced religious conversion took place to give effect to interfaith weddings.Chief minister ML Khattar had also said the state government had decided that a freedom of religion bill would be passed to stop forced conversion. Khattar had told HT that there were complaints regarding forced conversions and marriages from many districts in the state. “People are free to adopt any religion in an informed manner but using coercion, allurement to force religious conversion, is a matter of concern. Such incidents vitiate the atmosphere of society. We are studying similar laws enacted by other states and will accordingly take a call,” Khattar had said.Similar laws have been enacted by BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to penalise religious conversions by use of threat of force, coercion, marriage or by any other fraudulent means.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-agree-with-term-love-jihad-says-haryana-dy-cm-101614891369645.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Most cities low on economic ability||Which city in India is the best to live in?The Ease of Living Index 2020 report released by the housing and urban affairs ministry on Thursday ranked 111 cities on the basis of a score for ease of living. The 111 cities selected for the analysis were those identified under the Smart Cities Mission, state capitals, and cities with a population of over one million. The report does not include West Bengal as the state decided against participation in the rankings.The cities were ranked on the basis of scores on four pillars with different weights: Quality of Life (35%), Economic Ability (15%), Sustainability (20%), and Citizen Perception (30%). The last, which has a weight of almost one-third in the rankings, is a completely subjective parameter.The four pillars were divided into a total of 14 categories, such as education, health, housing, etc. under the quality of life pillar. Scores on these categories were themselves generated on the basis of a total of 49 indicators, such as household expenditure on education, literacy rate, etc. for the education category.Here are four charts that explain the major findings of the analysis, apart from the rankings.West, South perform better than North, EastThe cities that have scored the best on the ease of living index (EOL) are predominantly from the southern and western regions of the country, while the worst performers are predominantly from the eastern and northern states. This is reflected in the average scores for different regions. The report identifies this disparity as a cause for concern. “Since the turn of the century, the northern and eastern regions have lagged behind the rest of the country in terms of economic growth and development. Despite efforts to correct the imbalance, the gap is only widening,” the report says. According to the report, the top five states by per capita income were 145% richer than the bottom states in 2000s. This gap increased to 289% in 2010-11 and 338% in 2017-18. (See Charts)To be sure, the report makes a distinction between cities of different sizes for a fair comparison. Making such a distinction shows that there was less regional disparity among cities with population less than a million (or less than million cities) than among the million plus cities. This is because a majority of large metropolitan cities are located in the southern and western regions. “Since these cities are leading in urban development, they leave the eastern and northern regions far behind. This is why greater disparity is visible among Million+ cities,” the report says.Economic ability is the worst performing pillarThe average score of the 111 cities is the least on the economic ability pillar. The average score on this pillar is 13.17 compared to 51.38 for quality of life, 53.63 for sustainability, and 76.1 for citizen’s perception. It is also the pillar where the metropolitan cities are much more ahead of the rest of cities. Bengaluru, for instance, has a score of 78.82 on this pillar. This pushes the average or mean score up to 13.17, even as half of the cities have a score below 9.9, the median score. A comparison of mean and median scores shows that the mean is 33% ahead of the median for economic ability, while it is only 0.1% and 0.24% ahead of the median for sustainability and citizen’s perception. For quality of life, the median is 0.84% ahead of the mean.Statistically speaking, mean is a simple average of all scores, while median is the middle value in a distribution. The low difference between mean and median in pillars other than economic ability shows the average on those pillars is less skewed by outliers.What is the reason for a large number of cities scoring low on economic ability? Economic ability was measured under two categories. One category is economic development. The report argues that since the indicators used for this category are based on factories per lakh population and per capita wages, cities whose economic activity is not manufacturing dependent might unfairly perform low. This is the reason why Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu; a known apparel manufacturing cluster scores the highest on this count among cities with a population of less than a million. Bengaluru, known for its IT services, also performs well in this category, which highlights its ability to attract industries along with high-end services. The report says the low scores in the economic opportunities category is a cause for concern. “The goal of financial inclusion has clearly not permeated beyond these major cities..., and can affect the growth of these cities into potential economic hubs, the report says.Citizens in better performing cities have higher expectationsAn interesting aspect of the report is that citizen’s perception of the ease of living does not always match the city’s score on the first three pillars that are outcome based rather than perception based. The cities that performed the best on citizen’s perception, such as Bhubaneswar in Odisha or Davanagere in Karnataka, are not the leaders in the average score of the first three pillars. On the other hand, the cities that performed the best on the average score of the first three pillars -- such as Bengaluru, Pune, and Ahmedabad — do not lead in their citizen’s perception.To be sure, the relation between these two sets of numbers is not exactly inverse. “Nevertheless, it can be definitely deduced that residents in worse performing cities have a lower benchmark of evaluation, whereas residents in better performing cities have a higher benchmark and greater demands from the city. Inversely, it can also be said that a higher benchmark of evaluation by citizens push the city administrations. Cities in North-east India have the strongest feel-good factor to reform their policies and strive for improvement in developmental outcomes,” the report says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/most-cities-low-on-economic-ability-101614888906994.html

Also, evidence related to manipulation and undervaluation of share transactions of the production house among the film directors and shareholders, having tax implication of about ₹350 crore has been found...”The statement added that evidence of cash receipts by the actress amounting to ₹5crore has also been recovered. It also said “non-genuine/bogus exp-enditure to related concerns by the leading producer/director having tax implication of about ₹20 crore has been detected. Similar findings have been made in the case of the leading actress also.”The raids began on Wednesday at several locations in Mumbai and Pune. Kashyap and Pannu were also questioned. On Wednesday, state minister Nawab Malik said the raids were an attempt to muzzle those who speak out against the Narendra Modi government.“At the office premises of the two talent management companies , huge amount of digital data has been seized in the form of emails, WhatsApp chats, hard disk etc. All these are being scrutinised as investigation continues,” the statement said.The two talent management firms referred to are Kwan and Exceed.Kashyap, Pannu and the two firms were not available for an immediate response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rs-650-crore-discrepancy-found-in-accounts-i-t-department-101614888399451.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Power tariff for residential consumers to reduce from April 1||Amid the government’s back and forth on resolving the issue of inflated power bills during lockdown, tariffs for residential consumers across utilities will reduce by 0-2% on an average starting April 1.While tariff for residential consumers of the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST) will remain largely unchanged, for low-end consumers (0-100 and 100-300) of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL), it will reduce by 2%. BEST has around 1 million residential consumers in the island city and MSEDCL supplies power across the state and some parts of Mumbai.Tata Power consumers in the 0-100 unit category will see a 4% reduction. High-end consumers of Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) will see a 1% reduction in rates. Tata Power supplies electricity to 0.7 million residents in the city, while AEML has close to 2.7 million consumers in the city.The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had passed its multi-year tariff order on March 30 last year. Based on the order, tariff will be revised every year starting April 1 till the year 2025. Power consumers in the city and state have been stressed since a year with the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government going back and forth on providing relief to consumers who received inflated bills during the lockdown. While MSEDCL had started disconnecting power supply for those who had not paid their dues, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in the on-going budget declared that there will be no disconnection of electricity supply for farmer and local residents who failed to pay their bills until the issue of non-payment of the outstanding bills is debated in the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-power-tariff-for-residential-consumers-to-reduce-from-april-1-101614887926936.html

05-03-2021||Mumbai||Ease of Living Index: Centre’s report ranks Greater Mumbai at 10||One way to read the Ease of Living Index 2020 (EoLI) in a way that makes the glass seem half full is this: three cities of Maharashtra, Greater Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune form part of the top 10 ranked cities among 111 cities, including Smart Cities and those with a population of more than a million. If you stretch it to the top 20, another four cities from this state enter the list, including Thane and Solapur. Apart from that, many cities in the state such as Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune score high on some of the parameters on which the cities have been ranked. For instance, Pune emerges as a top performer on sustainability; Navi Mumbai scores fairly high on recreation and quality of life; and Thane on mobility.Launched by Union ministry for housing and urban affairs, the EoLI and the accompanying Municipal Performance Index (MPI) examine the quality of citizens’ lives in 111 cities across four main pillars: economic ability, sustainability, citizens’ perceptions and quality of life. Expanded, these pillars cover 14 different categories such as housing, economic opportunities, green spaces, and even city resilience. Now for the glass half-empty approach.The pillars that Greater Mumbai fares worse in than it should are also what makes the city one of the most sought-after metropolises and what Greater Mumbai prides itself on: mobility, which includes public transportation (noteworthy: the suburban train network is often called the city’s “lifeline”) ; and economic ability, which includes both economic opportunities and economic development. It is some consolation – though it shouldn’t be -- that economic ability is the worst performing pillar across all 111 cities, with a wide score range of 0.55 to 78.82 (Bengaluru). Greater Mumbai scores 32.12. Delhi, Pune and Ahmedabad score higher than Greater Mumbai. To be sure, the indicators measuring the level of economic development are based on factories per lakh of population, and per capita wages, which would thus favour industrial hubs focused on manufacturing rather than cities where economic activity is driven by trade and services. That would explain why a majority of the cities attained a low score on this pillar. Besides Bengaluru, Pune, Thane and Navi Mumbai were positive outliers in this category. As far as economic opportunities are concerned, the indicators focused on credit accessibility and skill development. Greater Mumbai is one of the positive outliers in this category. Aaditya Thackeray, state environment minister and guardian minister for Mumbai, said, “Let me go through the report and its basis. We are working on upgrading ease of living. But it’s not a hidden fact that the ease and joy of living in Mumbai is actually the highest, irrespective of this ranking, (else) so many people wouldn’t call it the City of Dreams.” Urban development experts said that Greater Mumbai’s ease of living cannot improve unless larger infrastructural issues that face housing and transportation in the city aren’t tackled first. Madhav Pai, executive director at WRI Ross Center (India) for Sustainable Cities, said, “While we have to look at the indicators, it is very clear that Mumbai is not able to attract talent because housing and commute are major issues. The Metro network will solve at least one of these issues.”Three indicators were used to rank the cities in terms of mobility: availability of public transport, transport-related fatalities, and road infrastructure. In a city of more than 20 million residents, at least 8 million passengers would travel by local train network – that’s 1,774 trains on the Central Railway and 1,367 trains on the Western Railway – everyday, in pre-pandemic times. However, the report lists Chennai as the best performing city in this pillar.Greater Mumbai scores little above 60 -- the national average is 79 out 100 -- in the category of housing and shelter. Metropolitan cities including Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, as well as satellite cities like Thane, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan, Navi Mumbai score better than Greater Mumbai. Pankaj Joshi, principal director, Urban Center, pointed that the report needed to be clearer in terms of the methodology and parameters employed. “Even in 2019, we had stated that the ministry needs to be clear on what are the parameters on the basis of which cities are being ranked and what are the indicators based on which cities can do better? It is also unfair to classify all cities in India as either more than a million or less than a million population. A Delhi cannot be compared to an Indore or a Nanded.” Joshi’s point bears out. In the first EoLI report released in 2018, Greater Mumbai scored a first rank for public open spaces and mixed land use – a fact that took experts by surprise as it did not square with the ground realities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ease-of-living-index-centre-s-report-ranks-greater-mumbai-at-10-101614887686916.html

The trend is worrisome.”“Freedom of speech and expression is an important part of democracy and arrests against this freedom are against the ethos of the democracy,” he said.The jathedar further said, “This is very shameful that cases are being registered against those who speak against the government, under serious charges of sedition and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). This trend is deadly for democracy. Adopting uncivilised and violent means to stop anyone from exercising freedom of speech and expression is inhuman.”He also asked those who like democratic ethos to come forward to save the ethics of democracy. “Keeping silent will lead to suicidal consequences. These consequences will prove to be very dangerous in the coming days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/crackdown-on-dissent-worrisome-dangerous-akal-takht-acting-jathedar-101614887509585.html

According to police, the accused, Rupesh Shyamrao More, 35, had a fight with his wife Vanita, 30, as she refused to give him money for drinks. In a fit of rage, More first slit her throat with a kitchen knife and then hammered her head.“More then called his neighbour Umesh Jadhav and confessed to the murder, following which Jadhav called us,” said senior inspector Rajendra Kamble, Tulinj police station. The accused then fled the spot in his auto. Police later found the auto abandoned a few kilometres away along with the weapons used. As per preliminary investigation, the couple were married for eight years and would often have fights over More’s alcoholism. On Wednesday, the couple had a similar fight as More demanded money for drinking, which Vanita refused. “We have registered case of murder against More. Vanita’s body has been sent for post-mortem and its report is awaited. We are investigating further,” said Kamble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-kills-wife-confesses-to-neighbour-in-nallasopara-near-mumbai-101614887506574.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Ease of Living Index: Greater Mumbai ranks 11 among 49 cities on sustainability||The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs’ (MoHUA) latest Ease of Living Index (ELI) survey ranks Greater Mumbai at 11th place – out of 49 Indian cities with million-plus populations – on sustainability practices. This rank, the report says, indicates a city’s capacity to “build resilience and develop sound infrastructure and services to swiftly tackle emerging environmental issues.” The ELI assigns a normalised score (between 0 to 100) to 111 cities on the basis of four parameters, or “pillars” – sustainability, quality of life, economic ability and citizen perception. The final score for each city is the average across these parameters. Greater Mumbai was assigned a normalised sustainability score of 61.74, higher than the national average of 53.63, but lower than the highest score of 75 awarded to Pune. Other cities with better scores include Visakhapatnam, Pimpri Chinchwad, Ahmedabad, Gwalior, Raipur, Prayagraj, Surat, Navi Mumbai and Indore. These cities, MoHUA’s report suggests, have fared better than Mumbai at providing citizens with green spaces, promoting green buildings and efficient energy consumption, and have better quality of natural resources such as air and water. It also says these cities are better equipped to withstand natural disasters. Sustainability has a weight of 20 percent in the city’s final EoL score, and is evaluated based on four sub-parameters including: environment, green space and buildings, energy consumption and city resilience. However, individual scores for the four sub-categories have only been indicated, and not specified in absolute terms. While Greater Mumbai ranked high on ‘city resilience’, it fared poorly on the other three. For example, the report states, “Findings reveal Pune as the best-performing city in terms of green spaces and buildings. The performance swiftly begins to decline significantly after Karnal (Haryana)... Greater Mumbai, Kochi, Hyderabad, Delhi, Indore, Lucknow, and Thiruvananthapuram do not particularly showcase exceptional performance... It indicates a deficiency that has accumulated in urban cities concerning conscious planning to mitigate the risks associated with climate change and the current ecosystem.” Experts, meanwhile, expressed concern over the methodology. They said it has not been adequately explained in MoHUA’s report. “It’s a bit parochial to compare a large metro city like Mumbai with a much smaller one like Pune on any indicator. The Ease of Living Index does not provide raw survey data, or adequately explain the structure of their survey, which makes it hard to take these numbers at face value,” said Pankaj Joshi, principal director of the Urban Centre Mumbai. He said a more appropriate way to compare sustainability across cities would be through a carbon footprint analysis. “If one can calculate the per capita carbon footprint of two cities, say Mumbai and Pune, then it becomes easier to say which city is more sustainable. It’s a well established method. Comparisons made in the Ease of Living Index are not predicated on such clear baseline indicators. There is value in comparative analysis, but only when the methods are robust and transparent,” he added. Avick Sil, urban studies specialist and director at Enviro Policy Research India, said, “The ease of living, or quality of life, in a particular city needs to be assessed based on the needs of its citizens. In India, development control regulations are not uniform across cities precisely because the requirements are vastly different. For example, some cities may have poor public transport but may be more sustainable due to less population load. You need a methodology that factors in these differences, instead of reducing your assessment to such simple numbers.” Citizens, too, said they were wary of the report’s indications. “It is a bit hard to see Mumbai ranked so high because the situation on the ground is precisely the opposite. We are more sustainable than most cities because we have a good public transport system, but that’s about it. In terms of waste management or water security, for example, the situation is clearly unsustainable. We dump untreated sewage into the ocean and are trying to decentralise waste management 20 years too late,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust. “Given that Mumbai is spending ₹13,000 crore on a coastal road project that will uproot ecosystems and only benefit a sliver of the overall population, I am inclined to say that we are among the least sustainable cities in India,” Goenka added. Moreover, experts also point out that despite the Ease of Living report’s objective – which is “to help cities assess their level of development and identify existing gaps that obstruct their growth” – the report does not actually provide any concrete measures for city administrators based on their ranking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ease-of-living-index-greater-mumbai-ranks-11-among-49-cities-on-sustainability-101614887387162.html

05-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC permits re-release of Telugu film after objectionable part removed by makers||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday permitted over-the-top (OTT) platform Amazon Prime to re-telecast the Telugu film V after the filmmakers informed the court that they had deleted the scene which depicted a photo of Bollywood actor and model. On Tuesday, the court had directed Amazon Prime to stop telecasting the film within 24 hours of the order and only start the telecast after the objectionable scene was deleted and the court approved the same. The court also directed the filmmakers to file affidavits in response to the application filed by the actor seeking imposition of costs on the filmmakers for using her photograph without her permission. The next hearing is scheduled on March 25. A single-judge bench of justice GS Patel was hearing the interim application in the defamation suit filed by the actor against Venkateswara Creations Pvt Ltd and the producers of the film had sought imposition of costs for using her photograph, which was part of her 2017 portfolio, in the film to depict a commercial sex worker without her permission. The film was released in September 2020 and was available on Amazon Prime. On March 2, the court had directed the filmmakers to delete the objectionable scene and asked Amazon to stop telecasting the film within 24 hours of the order being passed and telecast it only after getting permission from the court. On Thursday, after the filmmakers informed the HC that they had deleted the actor’s image, Amazon Prime sought permission to re-release the film, which the court allowed. The filmmakers, however, submitted that the agency which had provided them the photograph of the actor should be held responsible as they had assured that it could be used legitimately. Justice Patel granted liberty to the actor to take action as per law against the agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-permits-re-release-of-telugu-film-after-objectionable-part-removed-by-makers-101614887266596.html

The four had allegedly prepared a power of attorney in 2006 in the name of a woman who died in 1999. The court issued the directions while hearing the petition of the four seeking to quash the first information report (FIR) against them as the power of attorney was not used anywhere to misappropriate the property owned by the deceased woman’s husband who died in 2000. The petitioners submitted that as no inquiry had been done by the police and no charge sheet was filed for three years, the FIR should be quashed.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by Maruti Upare, Taramati Kolate, Ravindra Upare and Jayram Bhandari, was informed by advocate Vishal Saxena that the FIR had been registered at the behest of Shantaram Upare, brother of Maruti Upare. Saxena told the court that the power of attorney executed in the name of Shobha Ganpat Upare in 2006 was actually executed by Kolate, the second wife of Ganpat Upare. While Shobha died in 1999, Ganpat passed away in 2000. Additional public prosecutor AS Pai, on instructions from investigating officer sub inspector Yogesh Patil of Borivli police station, told the court the probe was almost complete and the investigating officer was in process of filing the charge sheet.After hearing the submissions the court observed, “We direct the deputy commissioner of police to cause inquiry into the matter and file his personal affidavit within two weeks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-zone-11-dcp-to-probe-delay-in-investigation-into-2018-case-101614887266092.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Centre not utilising vaccine doses adequately: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday questioned the Centre over the rationale behind restricting Covid-19 vaccines only to people above 60 years of age or above 45 with serious co-morbidities, and observed that the government wasn’t adequately utilising doses made available by manufactures.It also asked the Centre why it was donating or selling Covid-19 vaccines to foreign countries at a time when the drive to inoculate Indian citizens was not optimised.“We are not utilising Covid-19 vaccines fully. We are either donating it to foreign countries or selling it to them, and are not vaccinating our own people. There has to be that sense of responsibility and urgency,” the bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, who was representing the Union government.The court also directed the Centre to file an affidavit giving the rationale behind restricting people by creating age categories for who can be vaccinated, and the rationale behind defining co-morbidites that make people above 45 eligible.At the same time, the bench asked the two firms that make the vaccines administered in India — Serum Institute of India, which makes Covishield, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin — to put on record their maximum manufacturing capacities.The two companies, represented by their counsel, told the court that they had excess vaccines available for supply, but could only make them available based on permissions by the Union government.The bench then told the firms to furnish details such as their daily, weekly and monthly manufacturing capacity; how much of the current capacity was going unutilized; and if the capacity could be scaled up further.The bench was hearing a suo motu (on its own) case on the premise that judges, court staff and lawyers should be considered as frontline workers, and hence, should be vaccinated on priority.The hearing comes at a time when experts have been calling for teachers to also be included as frontline workers irrespective of their age since schools have reopened in several states, and are on the verge of reopening for all classes in several others.So far, India has provided over 46.1 million vaccine doses to several countries around the world, both as grants and commercial supplies.“There is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in the country; in fact, the supply chain is phenomenal. What the focus will be on is optimum utilisation of the current vaccination capacity, and gradually scaling up to vaccinate the target population,” siad Dr NK Arora, member, National Task Force on Covid.On Wednesday, when it first took up the matter, the bench said there were chances of infections rising once physical hearings resume in the Capital on March 15, and sought the presence of counsel for the Centre and the vaccine manufacturers.During Thursday’s hearings, apart from asking for affidavits from the Centre and the two firms, the court also directed the Delhi government to carry out inspection of medical facilities in courts, and to create infrastructure for vaccination of people connected with the judicial processes, including advocates.The Centre said in its response that lawyers were indeed frontline workers, and the issue of vaccinating them will be discussed with the concerned ministry.The matter will be now heard on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-not-utilising-vaccine-doses-adequately-delhi-hc-101614886691391.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Ease of Living Index: Despite edge, Greater Mumbai gets middling score||The country’s financial capital has ranked eighth in terms of economic ability in the Ease of Living Index released by the Central government’s ministry of housing and urban affairs. According to the report, which was released on Thursday, seven cities, including two from Maharashtra, have higher levels of economic development and opportunities than Mumbai. The parameter on economic ability looks at the level of economic development in a city, the economic opportunities it offers and the inequalities encountered by citizens in terms of economic development. The parameter has a weightage of 15% in the overall ranking, in which Mumbai has ranked 10th. According to the Ease of Living Index, the country’s “economic ability is the worst performing amongst all the pillars, with an aggregate score of 13.17”. In terms of economic ability, among cities with populations of over a million, Mumbai has scored 32.12 on a scale of 100, falling behind cities like Pune (ranked 3) and Thane (ranked 5), which have scored 48.8 and 40.52 respectively. Topping the list is Bengaluru with a score of 78.82, followed by Delhi (50.73), Pune (48.88), and Ahmedabad (48.19). The Ease of Living Index also observed that urban growth lags in cities as the centres of economic activities have been limited to industrial hubs “that have traditionally developed as pivots of finance and services”. While Mumbai’s score is above the national average score of 13.17, the country’s financial capital being ranked eighth comes as a surprise and may be an indication of problem areas in terms of its urban infrastructure. Dhaval Desai, vice president, Observer Research Foundation, said, “It is a surprise to know Mumbai has been ranked so low in terms of economic ability. However, this report is a mirror to Mumbai, that it is failing to attract young talent owing to the poor quality of life and unaffordable housing.” Experts pointed to housing, high cost of living and traffic congestion as some of the factors that may have contributed to Mumbai’s low ranking. Madhav Pai, executive director, World Resources Institute (WRI), India Ross Centre, said, “While we have to look at the indicators, it is very clear that Mumbai is not able to attract talent because housing and commute are major issues. While the Metro network will solve one of these issues, housing is something that needs to be looked at seriously.” Among the factors worth noting is the wide range of economic activity in Mumbai, with industries from various formal and informal sectors — ranging from manufacturing to services — having thrived in the city. Pankaj Joshi, executive director, Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI), pointed out that it isn’t clear exactly how the Ease of Living Index has computed its scores. “If we look at per capita tax collection itself, Mumbai will have an edge over other cities. The ministry needs to be more transparent on the basis of these rankings,” said Joshi. Aaditya Thackeray, state environment minister and guardian minister for Mumbai suburbs, told HT in a text message, “We are working on upgrading ease of living.” He also said that he believed “ease and joy of living in Mumbai is actually the highest, irrespective of the norms for this ranking”. While the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has previously said it is working towards increasing job opportunities in the city and the metropolitan areas with growth hubs and increased connectivity, metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said he did not wish to comment on the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ease-of-living-index-despite-edge-greater-mumbai-gets-middling-score-101614886906950.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Ease of Living Index: Access to public transport hikes Greater Mumbai’s rank||When it comes to availability of public transport, transport-related infrastructure, and road infrastructure, Greater Mumbai scores a little over 40, taking it above the national average of 28.05 in the Ease of Living Index 2020 brought out by the Centre. The parameter of mobility was measured across three indicators: availability of public transport, transport-related fatalities and road. According to the report, 60% of the cities in the index scored below the national average. The high scores in terms of road infrastructure have positively enhanced the scores of these top-performers in the Mobility category ... including Greater Mumbai,” the report stated. At present, Mumbai has a total road network 2,050 kilometres. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) total budget outlay for the roads, traffic, bridges and coastal road department in 2021 is ₹6,519.70 crores. In 2020, revised estimates show the outlay to be ₹4,361.28 crores. BMC is converting 160 kilometres of roads to concrete roads in 2021 as they are more durable. This will require further road work and traffic diversions in the city in the coming months. Vivek Pai of Mumbai Mobility Forum pointed out that ongoing work on roads hampers commuter experience, adding to congestion and lowers the overall quality of life. “There is constant infrastructure work going on in the city. But this is an indicator that we are upgrading our infrastructure,” said municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. Among the factors that helped raise Mumbai’s mobility score was ease of access to public transport, Pai said. “Mumbai has good access to transport. The city always has some form of safe transport available 24x7.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ease-of-living-index-access-to-public-transport-hikes-greater-mumbai-s-rank-101614886666687.html

05-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 8,998 fresh Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra on Thursday reported 8,998 new infections, taking the tally to 2,188,183, while the toll touched 52,340 after 60 new deaths. Mumbai’s saw 1,104 infections pushing its tally to 329,846. More than ten days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke about the potential lockdown if people showed lacklustre approach towards Covid-19 protocol, state officials said on Thursday that lockdown was not on the cards anytime soon. Highly placed officials in the chief minister’s office said the government wants people to follow the SOP and guidelines very strictly. “In districts like Amravati, whole families are getting infected, indicating the high infection rate. The district administrations have been directed to ensure the protocol is strictly followed so that a lockdown was averted. Even after warning to take a call on lockdown in eight days, the CM has delayed it, as the government is still closely monitoring the growth, infection and positivity rate,” said an official from Mantralaya. The state reported a significant jump in the turnout for vaccination as 75,452 beneficiaries were inoculated at 1,047 centres on Friday. 6,709 beneficiaries with comorbidities in the age group of 45-60 were vaccinated taking their cumulative number to 16,675 in four days after inoculation for the third phase of the vaccination began on March 1. A total of 38,765 elderly people above 60 years were inoculated, taking the total number of inoculated elderly to 106,431. At least 736,232 health care workers and 412,420 front line workers have been vaccinated so far in Maharashtra. After Mumbai, other key cities Pune and Nagpur continued logging high number of cases at 933 and 904, respectively. Pimpri-Chinchwad and Amravati reported 492 and 389 cases, respectively. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region clocked 2,103 cases as infection graph in Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli moved northward on Friday. Of the 60 deaths reported on Friday, highest 11 were from Amravati district (including 4 in Amravati city), followed by 5 each in Mumbai and KDMC, 4 each in Pune city and Yavatmal. State’s case fatality rate stands at 2.39%. The state’s recovery rate has dropped to 93.66% as the number of active patients jumped to 85,144 from about 43,000 three weeks ago. With 17,522, Pune has highest number of active cases, followed by Thane (9,142) and Mumbai (9,041).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-8-998-fresh-covid-19-cases-101614886546004.html
05-03-2021||Chandigarh||ED arrests key accused in Nature Heights Infra scam||JALANDHAR The enforcement directorate (ED) teams from its zonal office, Jalandhar, arrested Rajiv Rattan Dhingra, one of the key accused in the alleged multi-crore Nature Heights Infra scam spread across Punjab, on Wednesday late evening from Abohar. The ED produced the accused before a Mohali court and was sent to judicial custody at Patiala jail. Dhingra’s is the first arrest in the case while ED is also making efforts to arrest the main accused Neeraj Thatai alias Neeraj Arora, his wife Doll Thatai, and another director of company Amit Kukkar, who were allegedly backed by a powerful politician. The special PMLA court judge, Harinder Kaur Sidhu, on February 1 had issued non-bailable warrants against Dhingra and others on the basis of the charge-sheet filed by the ED in the October 2020 against 20 individuals and firms. The ED sources said during the probe, several illegal properties of the firms involved in the scam were found to be registered in the name of Dhingra. In June 2020, the ED has attached properties worth ₹24 crore belonging to a real estate firm for allegedly duping hundreds of investors of crores of rupees in various parts of Punjab. The firm, Nature Heights Infra Ltd, was being run by Abohar-based Thatai couple and another director of company Amit Kukkar. Neeraj and Kukkar figure as accused in 31 FIRs filed by the investors in various police stations of the state and were declared proclaimed offenders in 2017. In June 2019, ED had attached properties worth of ₹22.24 crore of Nature Heights, which was confirmed by the adjudicating authority in New Delhi. MG Gold Realtors Private Ltd, a sister concern of Nature Heights, was also involved in the fraud. The ED had started probing the case in 2017. During the course of the probe, it received 491 more complaints from investors and 497 complaints from various consumer courts of the state. Investigations revealed that Neeraj, in a pre-determined way, tried to launder investors’ money for personal benefits, ED officials said. ED investigations so far have revealed that the firm’s promoters had duped investors to the tune of ₹50 crore on the pretext of allotting properties at different locations in Punjab. So far, firm’s properties worth ₹46.5 crore have been attached. “Investigations are on to trace the remaining amount of proceeds of crime which may lead to attachment of more properties of Nature Heights Infra Ltd,” ED officials said. An investor said the company had circulated brochures inviting investments in colonies to be developed in Chandigarh, Talwara, Anandpur Sahib, Gobindgarh, Mohali, Zirakpur, Ferozepur and other locations in Punjab. The company allegedly collected crores of rupees from customers before shutting down all branch offices across the state and the promoters vanished in thin air. Investors neither got possession of properties nor their money was returned, officials said. “The firm used to offer cheaper plots at prime locations. Later, it surfaced that most of the colonies awaited approvals from the departments concerned. The company neither allotted plots nor returned the money. Even, the cheques issued by the company were dishonored,” said another investor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-arrests-key-accused-in-nature-heights-infra-scam-101614886427203.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Harassment at Maharashtra hostel: Claims found to be untrue, says home minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said the investigation into the incident, wherein women were allegedly forced to strip and dance by policemen at a government-run hostel in Jalgaon, found the claims to be untrue. The six-member women committee of senior officials found the allegations baseless and in its report said the policemen did not even enter the hostel. According to Deshmukh, the content of a video of a cultural programme organised by residents of Ashadeep Hostel was twisted out of context in a complaint by a woman, who is mentally challenged. Ashadeep is run by the state women and child development department, for destitute, mentally challenged women and survivors of sexual abuse.It was earlier reported that some women from the hostel complained that people from outside and policemen were allowed to enter the facility on the pretext of a probe and some women were forced to strip and dance. The incident allegedly took place on February 2. The issue was raised by the BJP MLA from Chikhali, Buldhana, Shweta Mahale in the state Assembly on Wednesday and she demanded action. She said a video of the incident had also surfaced.“A six-member committee of senior women officers, comprising a psychiatrist, police officer and others, were formed. They visited the hostel, spoke to other residents of the hostel, took their statements, checked the register and found the allegations unfounded. No policemen entered the hostel premises as they don’t have permission to do so because it is a women’s hostel,” Deshmukh told the state Assembly on Thursday. He said that the members of the hostel organised a cultural programme on February 20. While performing a garba, one of the women started feeling uncomfortable and she removed her frock. It was also found that the complainant is not mentally stable, according to her husband who had earlier requested that she be hospitalised for treatment, Deshmukh told the lower House.After demands were made by the legislators, the home minister also assured action against the journalist who reported the incident without verifying the facts. “We will investigate the person who wrote the story and will take action against him,” he said.Congress legislator Nana Patole and women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur demanded action. “This has not only defamed that particular institution, but also women residents. They will have to face the social stigma and thus those responsible should face action,” the women and child development minister said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar asked people to be careful before raising any such matter in future. “The incident has defamed only the government but also the women residents of the hostel, district and the state. We have no objection over raising any such issues, but we need to be careful and verify the facts before raising them in public,” he urged.The opposition, however, is not satisfied with the probe. BJP legislator and spokesperson Atul Bhatkhalkar said the state is facing a black rule. “How come the probe is completed in just a day? Was the probe video recorded? The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government termed the complainant as mentally unstable. This is nothing but a black rule,” Bhatkhalkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/harassment-at-maharashtra-hostel-claims-found-to-be-untrue-says-home-minister-101614886425888.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Clean up marshal arrested for kidnapping, extortion||The Mumbai crime branch has arrested a cleanup marshal employed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for allegedly posing as a policeman and kidnapping a man who was caught spitting in public. Under the pretext of taking him to the police station, the accused marshal allegedly took him to an isolated spot, threatened him and extorted ₹5,000 from him.Police said the incident took place on February 22, when the accused Amit Tawde, 29, a cleanup marshal with the G-South ward, caught Zubair Kayyum Khan, 22, spitting in public. Tawde told Khan that he would be penalised for spitting in public and asked him to sit on his two-wheeler to take him to the police station.After riding for some time, Tawde stopped the bike and started threatening Khan, pushed him and demanded ₹10,000 to release him. Khan paid him ₹5,000 and set himself free.On Tuesday, Khan lodged a police complaint and also submitted to the police a video he had captured of Tawde’s bike registration number.Crime branch unit-9 carried a parallel probe and nabbed Tawde on Wednesday. He was handed over to Mahim police station for further action.“The identity card of cleanup marshal found in his possession is genuine. He has been arrested on charges of impersonation, kidnapping and extortion,” said Vilas Shinde, senior inspector of Mahim police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiclean-up-marshal-arrested-for-kidnapping-extortion-101614885946387.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Centre’s duties, taxes more than cost of fuel, says Ajit Pawar||The Centre’s duties and taxes on a litre of petrol are more than the original cost of the fuel, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state’s finance minister said in the legislative Council on Thursday. The minister said while the crude oil price and other processing charges bring the cost to ₹32.82 per litre, the Centre’s duties add another ₹32.90 litre. Pawar said the prices of cooking gas, too, have increased over the past few months and the Centre must immediately take steps to lower the prices and provide relief from inflation. “The original cost of petrol, after its processing cost, is ₹32.82, and on that ₹32.90 has been levied as [various] tax [and duties] by the Centre. These taxes are more than the original price. The state government, too, has put tax on petrol. Since our government came to power, we have not thought about increasing the tax; the ones that the previous government had levied have been kept,” he said. “As of February 28, the petrol price was ₹97.57 in Mumbai. The state’s VAT [Value Added Tax] was ₹28.17 and Centre’s was ₹32.90. On per litre of diesel, state’s VAT was ₹19.57 and Centre’s taxes were ₹31.80. Due to these taxes and duties, the prices have gone up,” Pawar said. The deputy CM said the Centre must immediately provide relief on inflation, especially in the backdrop of pandemic. “In times of Covid, it has become difficult for people to survive. If prices increase in such a manner, where should people look for help?” Explaining further, Pawar said, “When Dr Manmohan Singh was the prime minister, the crude oil prices were US$ 106.85 per barrel and petrol was priced at ₹70. Today, the per-barrel rate of crude oil is US$63 and petrol prices are almost ₹100 [per litre]. Some time ago, the prices of [crude oil] had dipped to US$ 1, but then too the prices of petrol and diesel were not reduced.” Responding to opposition Bharatiya Janata Party’s claim that the Centre gives back 41% of the duties it collects, Pawar said, “On petrol, the Centre has put duties worth ₹32.90, but the 41% component is from the ₹1.40, and the remaining money goes to the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtracentres-duties-taxes-more-than-cost-of-fuel-says-ajit-pawar-101614885826417.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Muslim ministers should resign over Maharashtra CM’s remarks: Abu Asim Azmi||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said his party was proud to have been associated with the demolition of the Babri masjid, trouble was witnessed within Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi. Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi demanded that Muslim ministers belonging to Congress should resign immediately, while Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam asked if the chief minister’s remarks were part of the common minimum program, the basis of the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Thackeray in his reply to the governor’s address on Wednesday had said that while everyone else ran away after the demolition of Babri Masjid, his father and Shiv Sena founder late Balasaheb Thackeray owned up to it. “He had said that if the Shiv Saniks have demolished the structure, he was proud of them,” Thackeray said.Azmi, who had supported the MVA government when it was formed in November 2019, raised strong objection to the speech. “Thackeray’s statement and political speech in the Assembly are highly objectionable. He should not forget that the government was duty-bound to follow the CMP on which the government was formed,” he said in the Assembly on Thursday.Nirupam slammed the leaders from ruling parties for keeping mum over the statement. “While Thackeray made the remarks, the Congress, NCP ministers and MLAs sitting next to him kept enjoying it. Which common minimum program is this,” he tweeted in Hindi.Congress and NCP ministers chose to not react to it. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said that he would not comment on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/muslim-ministers-should-resign-over-maharashtra-cm-s-remarks-abu-asim-azmi-101614885586613.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||BJP cautions MVA government over President rule in Maharashtra||The Maharashtra government is planning to hold the election for the post of Speaker, which fell vacant following Nana Patole’s resignation last month, early next week, amid the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party’s threat that President’s rule may be imposed over the delay.Insiders said that the ruling three parties in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — have informally agreed to hold the election by Tuesday, a day after the budget is presented in the state legislature.The position of speaker fell vacant on February 4, as Patole resigned to take up the new responsibility as the state Congress president.BJP legislator and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the post was never left vacant for so long in the past. The delay would be a mistake and may lead to the imposition of President’s rule in Maharashtra, he cautioned. “According to the Maharashtra legislative assembly rules, the Speaker’s position should not be left vacant and the election for the same should be held as early as possible. In the past 50 years, the post was not left vacant for more than seven days. But this time it is vacant for a month,” Mungantiwar said. “I request the state government to hold the election or we are staring at a situation like February 17, 1980, when the then Indira Gandhi government dismissed Sharad Pawar-led Maharashtra government for not following constitutional provisions. You (MVA government) cannot violate constitutional provisions. Do not cry, if President’s rule is imposed,” he warned.In response, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the Speaker’s position was vacant in the BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh for a year. “From March 24, 2020 to February 22, 2021, the post was vacant in Madhya Pradesh and the deputy speaker was holding its charge. So what is objectionable in Maharashtra,” Pawar asked.“We have decided to hold the election for the Speaker’s post by Tuesday. With 154 seats, the MVA government is in a strong position and there is no reason to worry. A perception is being created that the government is afraid of holding the election, which is not true. However, the Congress is yet to decide the name of its candidate,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.State Congress chief Nana Patole said that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government in the Centre has started making attempts to impose President’s rule over vague reasons. “Mungantiwar is going in the direction chosen by the Modi government,” Patole told reporters on the Vidhan Bhavan premises.Earlier, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had directed the Maharashtra legislature to hold elections for the post of Speaker in the first week of the budget session. Coalition leaders were wary of holding the election immediately as it needs to be held through a secret ballot. MVA leaders were wary that the BJP may encourage cross-voting to defeat their nominee, which would mean the collapse of the Thackeray government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-cautions-mva-government-over-president-rule-in-maharashtra-101614885226468.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor accepts forest minister Sanjay Rathod’s resignation||Amid pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Maharashtra government sent the resignation of forest minister Sanjay Rathod to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The government accepted the resignation of the minister, whose name surfaced in the death of a woman in Pune on February 7, within hours. A statement from Raj Bhavan said Koshyari has accepted the resignation sent to him at 4pm and has given permission to hand over the charge of Rathod’s department to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “The resignation has been accepted by the governor. On request by the chief minister, he has been allowed to keep the additional charge of forest department with him,” the statement from Raj Bhavan stated. Leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and other BJP leaders Ashish Shelar, Sanjay Kute have been repeatedly criticising the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, questioning why the resignation, which was submitted on Sunday, has been kept with Thackeray. The BJP has been alleging the audio clips that went viral on social media clearly prove the involvement of the minister. Kute had said resignation was just a farce and the Thackeray government was shielding its minister. According to the officials from the chief minister’s office, Thackeray is expected to keep the department with him until the next reshuffle of the state cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-accepts-forest-minister-sanjay-rathod-s-resignation-101614885046240.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: JEE Mains aspirants object to answer key released by NTA||Two days after the National Testing Agency (NTA) released the answer key to the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains exam held in February this year, students have objected to several questions and answers.“While the exam was easy for most candidates this year, many students have objected to the responses as mentioned by NTA in their answer key. Students have already started registering their challenges on the NTA website,” said Nandkumar Jadhav, a tutor at a city-based coaching institute that prepares students for competitive exams. A student can challenge a question or its response through the NTA website by paying ₹200 per objection or challenge that they raise. “In most cases, the responses in the mathematics section are wrong and we are sure the NTA will accept our challenges,” said Anupam Gupta, a candidate who appeared for the JEE Mains exam on February 26.Earlier this year, the Union government decided to conduct JEE Mains in four cycles between February and May. The decision was taken to ensure that students don’t miss out on the entrance exam if the date clashed with other competitive exams. With the window for challenging questions or responses closed now, students are expecting the NTA to release the results anytime soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-jee-mains-aspirants-object-to-answer-key-released-by-nta-101614884866235.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Taxi meters in Mumbai not recalibrated yet, association has another demand||Four days after the implementation of the new taxi tariff, the process to recalibrate meters is yet to begin. The recalibration of a few autorickshaws started on Wednesday. Increased fares of autorickshaw and taxis were implemented from Monday in the city. The fare hike was announced by Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab on February 22. One of the reasons for the delay in the process of recalibration is the demand by the Autorickshaw Taxi Meter Association for increasing the charges for recalibration of meters. The association met transport department officials on Thursday, however, they failed to arrive at a consensus. “Due to coronavirus, every business is suffering. We have asked the transport department to increase the prices of the calibration as it is difficult for us to manage. The fare hike has happened after 2015 and has to be completed in two months. This means we can only earn for the next two months. The transport department does not appear to listen to us,’’ said Gafoor Nerekar, Mumbai chairperson, Maharashtra Autorickshaw Taxi Meter Repairing Association. Further, many autorickshaw and taxi drivers have also not yet started using tariff cards. Taxi unions have stated that the recalibration of meters is likely to take time and drivers are not aware of it.“There are many drivers who are not aware of the increased fare. The recalibration of meters is only likely to start by March 20,” said AL Quadros, leader, Mumbai Taximen’s Union.Regional Transport Office (RTO) officials have stated that the recalibration process has started, but no vehicle has come for a road test. “Vehicle recalibration has started. The vehicles are likely to come for road testing from Friday,” said an RTO official. The Maharashtra government has given time till May 30 to recalibrate taxi and autorickshaw meters in the city. There are nearly two lakh autorickshaws and 40,000 taxis operating in the city. The minimum autorickshaw fare (for 1.5 km) is now ₹21 as opposed to ₹18 and the minimum black and yellow taxi fare is now ₹25 as opposed to ₹22. The per km rate for taxis has increased to ₹16.93 from ₹14.84. The minimum autorickshaw fare during the night is now ₹27 and the minimum taxi fare is now ₹32. Thereafter, its per-kilometre rate has increased to ₹14.20 from the earlier ₹12.19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/taxi-meters-in-mumbai-not-recalibrated-yet-association-has-another-demand-101614884686157.html

The eight sites were earmarked following a joint survey by MC and GMADA a few months back.The Act is aimed at registering and rehabilitating street vendors and also saving them from exploitation at the hands of enforcement officers. It also calls for proper rationing of urban streets and spaces.A senior GMADA official said the chief administrator will accord the final approval by Friday, following which they will hand over the eight sites to MC by March 8.“Once we get the space, we will begin the process of developing them and allotting sites to vendors, which will take around two months,” said MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg.In the absence of implementation of the Act, illegal vendors have been thriving at several main markets of the city, especially in Phases 7, 3B1, 3B2, 9, 10 and 11.“For years, we have been urging the authorities to take action against illegal vendors, but to no avail. The parking lots are left with no space due to encroachments by them,” said Jatinder Pal Singh, president, Phase 3B2 Market Welfare Association.Identification process started in 2015 At least 993 vendors were identified in an MC survey that was initiated in 2015. A private firm hired by MC to carry out the survey had initially shortlisted at least 2,295 vendors, but the MC House found anomalies in the survey and ordered a fresh one. In 2017, the civic body had concluded there were 993 moving and stationary vendors.In January last year, MC had decided to implement the Act first in Phase 7, where as many as 139 vendors are registered. The MC commissioner had even asked the agency that conducted the survey to mark vending space in the parking areas, but the plan had fallen flat following objections by the market welfare association and area councillor.Thereon, MC issued identity cards to 200 of the 993 vendors, but they were never given designated spaces to carry out their trade.Approved sitesSector 54, near Bassi TheatreSector 55, near Phase-1 barrierSector 56, UT-Mohali borderSector 68, near Temple of KnowledgeSector 77, near waterworksSector 77, near Akal Ashram ColonySector 78, near fire stationSector 79, near Housefed flats||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/street-vendors-act-5-years-on-gmada-approves-eight-vending-sites-in-mohali-101614884626326.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: MUHS releases SOPs for final-year MBBS exams||Days after several final year students approached the state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh and Aaditya Thackeray, state minister of tourism and environment, requesting that their upcoming exams either be postponed or conducted online, the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) released circular stating rules of conduct for examinations starting Monday. Through the circular, the university has clarified that exams will be conducted offline as per schedule, and keeping social distancing and routine health checks in place for the safety of staff and students.“In a meeting of the exam committee conducted on March 3, a host of rules and regulations have been formulated to bring clarity for the upcoming exams,” said a circular released by MUHS on March 4. It further lists 15 pointers that need to be followed during the exams.Answering concerns of several final year students who have reportedly tested positive for Covid-19 days before their exam, the MUHS has clarified that only such students will be allowed to apply for re-examination. “Such students will have to make an application through their dean or principal of the concerned college with an attested copy of the Covid-19 test report. In case of anyone remaining absent on any other grounds will not be considered by the authorities,” said the circular.Earlier this week, students had written to MUHS as well as the state government hoping for a change in exam schedule or mode of examinations, especially due to rising Covid-19 cases in the state. While the MUHS has previously released circulars postponing all final year medical and dental examination from January to February and now March due to the same reason, it refused to postpone exams any further.This decision has left students dejected. “Some of us have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 and the least we expected was for the authorities to consider our health and safety as well. Since we are now left with no choice, we will have to appear for the exams as per schedule,” said a final year MBBS student, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-muhs-releases-sops-for-final-year-mbbs-exams-101614884566257.html
05-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mercury at 38.1 degrees Celsius, warmest day of season||The city witnessed its warmest day of the season so far on Thursday. The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Santacruz weather station recorded a maximum temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius at the automatic weather station in Santacruz, up from 37.3 degrees Celsius a day prior. Thursday’s reading was 5 degrees Celsius above normal and surpassed last year’s maximum reading of 37.5 degrees Celsius (on March 17).Officials once again attributed the spike in Mercury to dry, warm winds blowing at a low altitude over the city - at about 900 metres above mean sea level - coming from an anticyclonic circulation over central India. “Persistent influence of these winds over the last two days has caused the temperature to rise,” said Shubhangi Bhute, a scientist at IMD, adding that a heatwave may be announced if temperatures remain 5 degrees above normal for a second day. The minimum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 20.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which was at normal, and only slightly higher than the previous day’s reading of 20.4 degrees Celsius.In Colaba, on the other hand, the maximum temperature was recorded at 33.8 degrees Celsius (down from 34.5 degrees a day prior), while the minimum temperature was recorded at 23 degrees Celsius (up from 22.3 degrees Celsius a day prior).As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Santacruz, Friday and Saturday may see higher daytime temperatures, touching as much as 39 degrees Celsius. The minimum reading is predicted to remain at least 21 degrees Celsius over the week. Mainly clear skies will prevail.Meanwhile, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), air quality on Thursday settled just short of the very poor category, with the air quality index (AQI) at 293, up from 208 the day prior. The forecasted AQI for Friday is 259.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mercury-at-38-1-degrees-celsius-warmest-day-of-season-101614884326672.html

05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh house grab case: DSP Ram Gopal’s role under scanner, brother held||Making the third arrest into the Sector-37 house grab case, police on Thursday nabbed Satpal Dagar, the younger brother of Chandigarh deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ram Gopal.The arrest comes two days after journalist Sanjeev Mahajan and realtor Manish Gupta were apprehended for forcibly grabbing the house, owned by 48-year-old Rahul Mehta, the only surviving heir of his family. DSP Ram Gopal is also under the scanner as the FIR details that a meeting regarding the deal of the house was held at his office and he helped manage documents for it. Satpal will be produced before the court on Friday, when accused Sanjeev and Manish will also be produced after expiry of their previous police remand. Police had booked nine men on charges of kidnapping and torturing Rahul in April 2017 to secure the general power of attorney (GPA) of his 338 square yards house and selling it to Manish’s brother Saurabh Gupta for ₹2.9 crore in March 2019. Besides Satpal, Sanjeev and Saurabh, others named in the FIR are businessman Khalendra Singh Kadyan and liquor contractor Arvind Singla, to whom the GPA was transferred; slain bouncer Surjit Singh; Ashok Arora; Shekhar and Daljit Singh, who purportedly acted as witnesses in the sale of the house. Satpal initially purchased the property After joining investigation, Arvind Singla told the police that he was first offered to purchase the Sector-37 property in April 2017, but he had turned down the deal.Later, he was informed that Sanjeev had sold the property for ₹2.5 crore to Satpal, brother of a DSP. Arvind, then, along with Ashok Arora, who was a witness in the GPA, had met DSP Ram Gopal at his office and discussed about the house deal. Thereafter, Arvind, Ashok and Satpal met at his office in Sector 40, where he offered to become a 50% shareholder in the deal, but Satpal allowed him only 33%. After this deal was finalised, Arvind issued a cheque for ₹5 lakh in the favour of house owner Rahul and gave it to Satpal. On April 26, 2017, he also transferred ₹11 lakh to the account of Khalendra through an online payment, on the directions of Satpal. On April 27, 2017, Ashok and Satpal called him to the deputy commissioner’s office in Sector 17 to get the GPA registered. There, Sanjeev and Khalendra were also present and introduced him to a man, claiming he was Rahul, the house owner. The GPA was executed in the favour of Arvind and Khalendra, following which Satpal provided Sanjeev a cheque for ₹67 lakh in favour of Rahul. According to Arvind, he approached Sanjeev, Ashok, Satpal and Khalendra to get the registry of house, but they did not respond, prompting him to seek refund of his money with interest. He also arranged a meeting of Ashok and Satpal with his realtor friend, Manish Gupta, who later met Sanjeev and finalised the deal of the house. Hereon, the accused managed the required documents through DSP Gopal to get the sale deed of Rahul’s house executed in favour of Manish’s brother Saurabh Gupta, and the GPA in the name of Arvind and Khalendra was cancelled.Journo’s financial trail Digging into journalist Sanjeev Mahajan’s financial trail, police have traced a hotel, a house in Sector 37 and a flat owned by him or his family members. The police investigation also found out that despite having an annual income of less than ₹10 lakh, he had paid off a car loan of ₹25 lakh in five months. “His investments, expansion of business interests, and moveable and immoveable properties are much more than his known sources of income. We are tracing how he arranged money for all this,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. Police also conducted searches at the house of Manish in Sector 38.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-house-grab-case-dsp-ram-gopal-s-role-under-scanner-brother-held-101614883485500.html
05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh slips to 29th rank in Ease of Living Index||From the fifth most livable city in 2018, Chandigarh is now not even in the top 20 in the country.According to the ranking of 111 cities on the Ease of Living Index 2020, released by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on Thursday, Chandigarh is placed at a lowly 29th position out of 49 cities with million plus population.The index is an assessment tool that evaluates the quality of life and the impact of various initiatives for urban development.In the inaugural 2018 report, Chandigarh was fifth when all 111 cities were part of a composite ranking. For the 2020 rankings, the cities have been divided into two categories: those with population more than a million and those with less than a million. If the score of all these cities were to be considered, Chandigarh would have ranked 45th out of 111 cities.Bengaluru emerged as the top performer in the million+ category, followed by Pune, Ahmedabad, and Chennai. In the less-than-million category, Shimla is ranked the highest, followed by Bhubaneshwar, Silvassa, and Kakinada.Notably, Chandigarh scored marginally more than in the previous rankings. In 2018, it scored 53.16 out of 100, which has gone up to 54.4 in 2020.Poor economic ability drags city downOf the four parameters of the index, the city has performed the worst under economic ability, scoring just 9.9 marks out of 100, with a rank of 34 among 49 cities. It got only 7 marks for the level of economic development and 12.99 for economic opportunities – the two sub-categories of this parameter. Not surprisingly, in the latest ease of doing business report too, the city was ranked at the bottom. Bengaluru, the topper in this parameter too, has a score of 78.82.In citizen perception (residents’ view on the services provided by the administration), Chandigarh has scored 72.8 and a rank of 35. Bengaluru has scored 78 with a rank of 20.Consolation: City’s education best in India Chandigarh’s overall quality of life, third parameter under the index, has been ranked 20th with a score of 54.42. In terms of quality of life, the best city is Chennai with a score of 60.33.However, in education, a sub-category, the city tops the country with a score of 83.27. It is followed by Indore, Bengaluru and Amritsar.In the fourth parameter – sustainability, which includes sub-categories of environment, green space and buildings, energy consumption and city resilience – Chandigarh’s score is a modest 60 with rank of 12. In city resilience, it scored 100 marks, while in green space and buildings, it scored the lowest 24.Nothing to cheer about in municipal performance tooIn the newly launched Municipal Performance Index 2020, too, the city has fared poorly. It is 23rd among 51 cities with million plus population included in the list. Indore tops the index.This index was launched as an accompaniment to the ease of living. It seeks to examine local government practice in municipalities across areas of services, finance, policy, technology and governance.The Chandigarh MC, which has for long struggled with its finances and will start the coming fiscal with a deficit of more than ₹700 crore, has been ranked 37th when it comes to the finance parameter. In planning, it is ranked a lowly 43.‘Matter of serious introspection’“It is a matter of serious introspection for the UT administration, municipal corporation and Chandigarh Smart City Limited. Of special concern is the poor ranking of 32 in citizen feedback. This shows residents don’t see in positive light the services provided by the administration,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations.Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said: “We have been consistently saying that the city’s governance is on a downward spiral. The BJP has miserably failed to deliver on multiple fronts: jobs, health and infrastructure development. It has only burdened people with taxes.” “We will analyse the report and see what lessons can be learnt, so that the city can improve its performance,” said Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “We will examine the rankings and try to improve on different parameters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-slips-to-29th-rank-in-ease-of-living-index-101614882766948.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||NDMC best civic body among municipalities serving less than a million population||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has ranked as the best among 111 municipal corporations catering to areas with less than one million population in the Municipal Performance Index released by the Union housing and urban affairs minister on Thursday. The North and East corporations ranked 48th and 42nd, while the South corporation got 28th position.While the NDMC was assessed in the category of less than one million population with 60 corporations, the South, East and North corporations were part of the million-plus population category with 48 other corporations.The municipal corporations were assessed on five parameters such as governance (20% weightage), services (30%), technology (15%), finance (20%) and planning (15%). The municipal corporations have been divided into two categories based on the population: corporations with a million-plus population and corporations with less than a million populations.The Municipal Performance Index is an outcome of the Ease of Living Index 2020, which was also released by the housing ministry on Thursday, as it assesses the inputs or enabling factors while EoLI emphasises on outcomes of developments.While the NDMC stood first among 60 cities in the overall ranking, it was at the fifth position in the services category. Education, health, sanitation, permits and registrations and civic infrastructure were the key categories under the services parameter. Bilaspur topped the category followed by Tirupati, Gandhi Nagar and Vellore.NDMC, which is one of the smart cities in the country, stood at 6th position in the technology category that was assessed on the parameter of digital governance, digital access and literary.Among the small municipal bodies, besides NDMC the other 9 top performers are Tirupati, Gandhinagar, Karnal, Salem, Tiruppur, Bilaspur, Udaipur, Jhansi and Tirunelveli.NDMC chairman Dharmendra said, “In the field of services and governance, NDMC has taken several IT-based initiatives through technology intervention for strengthening of e-Governance and m-Governance to improve efficiency and effectiveness in providing civic services in an equitable, non-discretionary and transparent manner.”The North and East corporations, both ruled by the BJP for the past 14 years, were ranked below Ghaziabad (20th rank), Meerut (29th rank) and Faridabad (40th rank) municipal corporations.North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash admitted that there is a need to do a lot of work. “The assessment gives us an idea of where we stand. There is a need to do a lot of work. Our biggest problem is finances; we are working towards improving it. In this current financial year, we have tried to improve our revenue collection from house tax,” said Jai Prakash.Among the three corporations, the South civic body fared well on parameters such as services, technology, municipal planning, finances and governance.The North and East corporations have been facing a huge financial crunch. The financial situation of North corporation, officials say, is better than East corporation. But the east corporation’s performance is better than the North and South in some categories.For instance, in the municipal governance category, East is ranked at 30th position while North corporation and South corporation at 48th and 44th positions respectively. Likewise, in the technology category also the East (43th rank) has fared better than the South and North corporations which stood at 45th and 47th position.Nirmal Jain, mayor of East Corporation said, “We have been trying to do our best in the limited resources available with us. It is not just financial issues, a big problem before us is the area under our jurisdiction. We largely have slums and unauthorised colonies. We have been making efforts to take services on the digital platform, but it will take some time for it to happen.”In terms of delivering services, South corporation was among the top five civic bodies at the fourth position.Rajat Kathuria, director and chief executive, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), “The New Delhi Municipal Council is one of the richest municipal corporations. It is easier to provide essential services for the NDMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ndmc-best-civic-body-among-municipalities-serving-less-than-a-million-population-101614882466402.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||More diversions at Ashram for underpass construction||The Public Works Department (PWD) has asked the Delhi Traffic Police to increase diversions around the Ashram intersection from Friday onwards so that they can hasten work on a 750-metre underpass connecting Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and CSIR Apartments on the Mathura Road.Hindustan Times had on Tuesday reported how the simultaneous construction work at and around the Ashram intersection, from where every day over 3.5 lakhs vehicle pass during peak traffic hours, is likely to cause a traffic nightmare for commuters.The Public Works Department (PWD) last month started work on extending the Ashram flyover on Ring Road, even as work on a 750-metre Ashram underpass is going on after already missing its deadline. These two projects running simultaneously has made one of the Capital’s most crucial intersections — one that connects south and central Delhi, and virtually serves as the connection for two NCR cities Noida and Faridabad — a nightmare for commuters.Delhi traffic police on Thursday said that in order to speed up work on Ashram underpass, the PWD had requested them for closure of way for vehicles going straight towards Lajpat Nagar on the Ring Road and those taking a right turn from below the flyover to go towards Nizamuddin. The movement of vehicles on the Ashram flyover will not be impacted while this diversion plan is in place, the traffic police clarified.“Due to the ongoing construction work of an underpass on Mathura Road at the Ashram crossing, the flow of traffic remains heavy, especially in the peak traffic hours. As a result, road users have been facing hardships while travelling through this stretch,” a statement issued by the traffic police on Thursday read.It added, “To speed up the project work, the construction agency (PWD) has increased its resources and is now closing the straight and right turn passage for traffic coming from Sarai Kale Khan and Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway under the Ashram flyover.”The traffic police said that starting Friday, commuters will have to make a mandatory left turn onto the Mathura Road and take a U-turn from the New Friends Colony traffic signal to come back to the Ashram intersection in order to go towards Lajpat Nagar on the Ring Road or towards Nizamuddin on the Mathura Road.“There is no diversion for straight moving traffic on the Ashram flyover on both carriageways. General public is hereby advised to plan their travel accordingly,” the traffic police said.Traffic police had started diverting traffic on a trial basis on Wednesday and Thursday for a few hours during non-rush hours of morning and evening to assess the impact of the new route on vehicular traffic. This was also done as an assessment to finalise the new traffic diversion plan for the extension of the Ashram flyover, police confirmed.The Delhi traffic police are also working on a diversion plan for the extension of the Ashram flyover. The PWD has already placed barricades on the Kilokri side and on the Maharani Bagh side of the Ring Road, which has further thinned down space for traffic movement. Senior traffic officials said that the final traffic diversion plan for the upcoming project is likely to be finalised in two weeks.“We had raised this concern with the PWD that simultaneous digging around the Ashram intersection will lead to a major traffic chaos. If this is the last leg of construction of the underpass then once the intersection is cleared, we can work on the diversion plan for the Ring Road,” a senior traffic official said.Traffic police and PWD officials confirmed that the construction agency had sent a request to divert traffic on the Ring Road in January this year, to initiate work for the extension of the Ashram flyover.In their permission request the PWD had stated that the construction work of the underpass at the intersection was in its final leg, and before any major digging work begins on the Ring Road, the barricades placed on the Mathura Road will be cleared and this can act as a diversion for traffic. The current deadline for the completion of the underpass is April 31.Ashram intersection is one of the busiest intersections of the city, from where every day over 3.5 lakh vehicles pass during peak traffic hours.Experts said that the PWD is “biting more than it can chew” and this will ultimately result in long and mismanaged traffic on the stretch. The impact of this is also likely to spillover to adjoining roads, including Sarai Kale Khan, Noida Link Road, Meerut Expressway, and the Ring Road.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said that things were bad even when the Ring Road was acting as an alternative route to Mathura Road, where digging work has been going on since December last year. Now, he said, the intersection will get harder to negotiate.“The Mathura Road and Ring Road are crossing each other on the intersection, and if simultaneous work is initiated, then there would be no clear route for traffic to move,” he said. “Even if the initiation of the flyover extension has to be postponed a little, the way to go is to wrap up work on one road first and then move on to the other. This will make traffic management easier for the agencies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/diversions-around-ashram-to-increase-as-pwd-pushes-to-finish-underpass-construction-101614882465854.html

05-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi scores high on education, housing||Delhi ranked 13th among 49 cities with million-plus population in the Ease of Living Index 2020 (EoLI 2020) released by the Union housing and urban affair ministry on Thursday. Parameters such as housing, economic opportunities have helped the national capital improve its overall score — Delhi ranked 65th among 111 cities in the first Ease of Living Index in 2018 --- but it was still far behind Bengaluru, Chennai and Navi Mumbai.While Delhi performed well in education, housing and shelter and economic ability categories, it stood at 44th position of the 49 cities surveyed in the citizens perception category. The overall ranking of the capital in this category among 111 cities was 95.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasising the ease of living, along with the ease of doing business, as a key policy priority, the rankings of cities have assumed significance in shaping government policies and determining expenditure priorities. A total of 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020.The well-being of citizens living in 111 cities was assessed on four main parameters: quality of life (35% weightage), economic ability (15%), sustainability (20%) and citizens perception survey (30%). The ministry assessed these parameters based on 49 indicators in 14 categories such as education, health, safety, level of economic development, economic opportunities, housing, mobility, etc. The 111 cities were divided in two broad categories: those with a population of million-plus, in which there were 49 cities, and cities with less than a million population, in which 62 cities were bracketed.A senior housing and urban affairs ministry official said that they assessed the services provided by local bodies and how it impacted the quality of life of people living the cities and also people’s perception about it.Delhi was ranked 35th among the 49 cities in the quality of life parameter which was assessed based on the education, health, housing, waste management, mobility, safety and security, and recreation. While Chennai topped the list, cities such as Ghaziabad, Pune, Bengaluru were ahead of Delhi. The Capital’s quality of life score is 51.22, slightly below the national average of 51.38.Delhi secured the second position under the economic ability parameter followed by Pune and Ahmedabad. Bengaluru topped the list under this parameter in the category of million-plus population cities. The parameter was assessed on two categories: economic opportunities and level of economic development. “Delhi is the only positive outlier in this category with a perfect score, followed by Bengaluru and Hyderabad,” according to the report.Rajat Kathuria, director and chief executive, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), said, “It is not surprising that Delhi is one of the top cities under economic abilities category. There are a lot of employment opportunities in the national capital. A lot of people come here from different parts of the country in search of jobs.”The city has also performed well in the housing and shelter category. Delhi, along with Thiruvananthapuram, Puducherry and Bhopal has emerged as perfect positive outliers in the housing category. According to the report, all households in these cities have electrical connections, and all identified beneficiaries are covered under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).However, Delhi performed badly on parameters of safety and security, mobility, stormwater drainage, green spaces, etc.According to the report, Delhi, Faridabad, Indore, Gwalior, Ranchi are among 13 million-plus cities which have performed below the national average in the safety and security category. Among the 49 cities, Delhi was ranked at 40th position in terms of safety and security.In the mobility category, too, Delhi is among the cities such as Bengaluru, Pune, Navi Mumbai, Ahmedabad where the availability of public transport per lakh population was not up to the mark. Delhi ranked 28th in the list. According to the report, “Firstly, the public transport system is not efficient enough to support the population of respective cities; and secondly, these cities may be ‘automobile-dependent’ for increased mobility fostered by rapid economic growth that encourages private vehicle ownership.”Kathuria said while Delhi attracts a lot of people due to better economic opportunities, it also adds to the pressure on the city’s resources. “A lot of people which come to the city due to the economic opportunities. This also puts a lot of the city’s infrastructure, as the population is increasing. The city is always playing catch-up in providing essential services. In transport, for instance, the public transport infrastructure has not kept pace with the increase in population. Metro has provided some relief, but it is not enough. There is a need to now plan the cities in such a way that people live closer to workplaces and can use public transport for commuting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ease-of-living-report-city-of-opportunities-delhi-scores-poorly-on-safety-and-public-transport-101614882407932.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||AAP says people have rejected BJP for failure to govern the MCDs||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday trained guns at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleging that the party has failed in governing the three municipal corporations (MCD) of the city and that is why people had not let them win on even a single seat in the recently concluded municipal bypolls in five wards.The BJP, however, hit back saying that the AAP should focus on “analysing” why they are losing their Muslim voter base, citing example of Chauhan Banger ward, which the Congress won by a huge margin.The AAP on Wednesday had won four out of the five wards in the municipal bypolls in Delhi. The Congress won one seat and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is the ruling party in the three municipal corporations for 14 years now, drew a blank.The AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, “People of Delhi are angry due to BJP’s dirty politics in the MCDs. They have failed in governance. So, people did not let them win a single seat in the bypolls. People have understood that the BJP is continuously ranting about shortage of funds and blaming the AAP as part of their strategy to hide their failures. Even their traditional voter base of traders, especially in wards such as Shalimar Bagh, have voted for the AAP.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “For us the loss in Shalimar Bagh seat was a setback, but we will make a comeback in the 2022 municipal polls. The AAP, on the other hand, should rather focus on analysing why they are losing their traditional Muslim voter base. Losing the Chauhan Banger seat to the Congress was shameful for them. Muslims have rejected them.”Out of the five seats that went to the bypolls on February 28, the AAP retained three seats, which it won in the 2017 municipal polls, while gaining one more from the BJP. They, however, lost the Chauhan Banger seat to the Congress. Essentially, the AAP was in power in four out of these five seats and they continue to be in power in four – only with change in one seat.The bypoll results have come as a huge setback for the BJP, as the party lost all the seats with margins varying from 2,700 to 7,000 votes, indicating people’s dissatisfaction with the performance of the party in the civic bodies.Delhi goes to the municipal polls in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-says-people-have-rejected-bjp-for-failure-to-govern-the-mcds-101614882406659.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||School files complaint against parent for ‘forging’ Covid-19 report||A school in north Delhi on Thursday filed a police complaint against the parent of a student for “forging” Covid test report and showing their child to have tested positive after attending in-person classes earlier this week.The parent of the student, however, have strongly denied the allegations levied by the school.“The school did not follow social distancing guidelines and is now shifting the blame on us. We will produce all documents. My child is sick and in quarantine now. We have been following all Covid norms,” said the parent.Parent groups had claimed that the class 11 student had contracted the infection due to negligence of officials at Queen Mary’s School in Tis Hazari – an allegation denied by the school.On Monday, a group of parents also protested at the school demanding that the in-house examinations scheduled to begin on Tuesday be conducted digitally instead of offline mode. Following the agitation, the school management announced closure of the school for next six days.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse confirmed that the police station had received a complaint. “We have received a complaint from the school,” he said.Parents have been protesting outside different schools throughout the week after reports surfaced of school-going children testing positive for Covid-19 in Delhi and nearby areas. The major demands of protesting parents include conducting online internal exams for class 9 and 11 students, instead of in-person tests.“The school is reopening on Monday and the decision on whether exams will be conducted on online or offline mode will be taken later,” an administrative official at Queen Mary’s School said, requesting anonymity. Despite calls and messages, principal Ritu Solomon did not comment on the matter.On Thursday, the Queen Mary’s School, which is a government-aided institution, also wrote to the district deputy director of education (DDE) on the matter. “Instead of informing the school authorities, she [the parent] circulated the medical report on the parents’ WhatsApp group with an intention of instigating them and claimed that her child had contracted the virus due to negligence of school authorities thus misled the parent community,” the school principal Ritu P Solomon wrote in a letter to DDE North.Officials at the directorate said they had not received the letter by Thursday and were not in a position to comment.“School department verified the said Covid-19 test report from the said hospital and on verification it was found that the said report is forged and fabricated,” Solomon wrote in the letter, adding that school authorities have made a police complaint in Subzi Mandi.On Tuesday, Venkateshwar International School in Dwarka – where a student had allegedly tested positive for Covid-19 – allowed students to appear for their exams in online mode, if they wished to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/school-files-complaint-against-parent-for-forging-covid-19-report-101614882405359.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Green score in Delhi hit by persistent poor AQI||Consistent poor air quality and high levels of microscopic particulate matter pollutants have got Delhi 42nd rank in the environment category among 49 cities with a million or more population in a survey by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for the Ease of Living report that was released on Thursday.Environment was one of the metrics under the Sustainability Pillar on which Delhi scored 56.02, slightly above the national average of 53.63, securing the 28th rank. According to the report, for ranking the cities on environment indicators such as water quality, total tree cover, hazardous waste generation and air quality index (measuring SO2, NO2, and PM10) were considered.Despite steps by local and central agencies, Delhi’s city’s air quality takes an annual plunge every winter, with the air quality hitting ‘emergency’ levels on the AQI scale, especially between December and January. The cold conditions and low wind speed often contribute to worsening the pollution levels. A CSE analysis released on Wednesday showed that in 2020 even though the severity and duration of smog episodes were lower, the seasonal average levels of PM 2.5 was higher.“Infrastructural capacity, economic opportunities and welfare services are already under tremendous pressure with rapid expansion of urban spaces. Yet, looming threats arising due to climate change have the potential to cause irreversible damage to the world as we know it. For India, the impact may be even higher,” the report read.Pune, with a score of 75.74 topped the list of cities in the Sustainability category, followed by Visakhapatnam, which scored 65.18 and Pimpri Chinchwad, whose score was 65.09.Environmental experts said that the city still needs to do a lot of work in the fields of water and waste management and providing a green urban infrastructure to its citizens.The Institute for Management Development (IMD), in collaboration with Singapore University for Technology and Design (SUTD), had released the 2020 Smart City Index last year, which showed that Delhi’s global rankings had dropped from 68 in 2019, to 86 last year.“Cities in India (New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru) suffer significant drops this year. This can be attributed to the detrimental effect that the pandemic has had where the technological advancement was not up to date,” the report said.It added that apart from the problem of air pollution, Delhi needed to tackle the issues of “basic amenities”, such as the provision of clean water to all.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that Delhi was particularly lagging in its efforts towards solid waste management.“Work has been done in the field of pollution control and we are seeing that every year, Delhi is managing to bring down its pollution curve but a major area where work is lagging is solid waste management, there are still areas where door-to-door waste collection is not happening. Recycling is not the focus and dumping at landfills is continuing; all these areas factor in to make a city more sustainable,” Roychowdhury said.The report said that cities such as Delhi, Greater Mumbai, Kochi, Hyderabad, Indore, Trivandrum and Lucknow showed poor performance in developing green spaces and buildings.Green spaces and buildings include indicators of availability of green spaces, whether the city incentivises green buildings, and the presence of green buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ease-of-living-report-delhi-ranks-poorly-in-sustainability-and-environment-categories-101614882405983.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi is second among 5 worst cities in terms of public transport availability||When it comes to public transport and mobility, Delhi has fared poorly on Ease of Living Index, 2020, the rankings of which were released by Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on Thursday. In fact, the lack of adequate public transport options put Delhi second on a list of five worst performing cities.To rank cities on mobility, one of the primary criteria for ascertaining the quality of life, three crucial indicators were assessed —availability of public transport, transport-related fatalities and road infrastructure.The findings of the report show that Delhi was among cities that had a low availability of public transport modes per lakh population. Featuring second on a list of five worst performing cities, Delhi’s figures for the ‘availability of public transport’ was 1,688.50 per lakh population (PLP). Ahmedabad, according to the rankings, fared the worst with only 638.63 transportation modes per lakh population.The national capital was followed by Navi Mumbai with 2,037.81 PLP, Pune with 2,585.54 PLP, and finally Bengaluru, which had 4,409.62 PLP.The best performing city in this category was Chennai with a public transport availability rate of 92,017.96 per lakh population, followed by Visakhapatnam with 21,212.92 per lakh populationOn the worst performing cities, the report said, “Firstly, the public transport system is not efficient enough to support the population of respective cites. Secondly, these cities may be ”automobile dependent” for increased mobility fostered by rapid economic growth that encourages private vehicle ownership.”This worrying trend was also highlighted in a study released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in December last year, which showed that the ridership in public transport modes such as buses and the Delhi Metro was witnessing a decline, while the use of private vehicles was seeing a spike.The CSE analysis also warned of commuters shifting to private vehicles after Covid-19, which could undo years of work in the city to promote public transport, and as a result increase snarls on the road.According to latest government data, Delhi has around 11 million registered private vehicles, while Delhi has a fleet of around 6,000 public buses. This is nowhere near enough to cater to the 20 million-plus population, say transport experts. The capital city needs around 11,000 buses to bridge the gap between passenger requirement and availability.Amit Bhatt, director of integrated urban transport at World Resources Institute (India), said a major area where the city is lagging is the integration of its bus fleet with its extensive Metro system.“There were proposals for increasing the bus fleet of Delhi but probably because of the pandemic, these are yet to be reach the roads. Inadequate availability of buses is a problem being faced by all cities. We had conducted a study, which had showed that India needs around 2.5 lakh buses. In Delhi, along with a shortage of buses, the problem is also that the bus routes are not integrated with the Metro. If that had been done, it could have provided seamless transit options to commuters,” he said.The report said over 60% of the cities participating in this index, including the national capital, have scored below the national average of 28.05. Chennai emerged the only positive outlier with a score of 79.80, followed by, after a significant gap, Thane (48.40), Bengaluru (48.40), Bhopal (48.01), and Guwahati (47.73).However, the report also highlighted that transport-related fatalities were much lower in Delhi.“The incidents of transport-related fatalities were much lower in cities such as Amritsar (4.84), Ahmedabad (5.92), Surat (6.47) Pune (7.12), Bengaluru (7.32), Delhi (12.43) and Hyderabad (12.98) per lakh population,” the report read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-is-second-among-five-worst-cities-in-terms-of-public-transport-availability-101614882346387.html
05-03-2021||Delhi||Share evidence with dead farmer’s kin: HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday directed the city police to share the video of the post mortem and the inquest report with the family of a 25-year-old farmer, who had died after his tractor allegedly overturned during the tractor rally on Republic Day.Justice Yogesh Khanna was informed by advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal) representing the police, that he does not have any objections in sharing the videography of the post-mortem examination and the inquest report.An inquest report is made primarily to look into the causes of unnatural death.Mehra also agreed to show the CCTV footage of 12 cameras that they had seized in connection to the incident to the deceased’s family or counsel, but said he would not share a copy of the footage with them.The judge asked the police and the counsel for the dead farmer’s family to mutually decide on the time and place when they can see the CCTV footage.Advocate Vrinda Grover, who had filed the plea on behalf of the grandfather of the deceased, Navreet Singh, then sought the video of the post mortem exam and inquest report.As Mehra stated that they have no objection in giving those to the petitioner, the high court said, “Let the needful be done.”The court was hearing a plea claiming that the victim Navreet had suffered gunshot injuries to his head. His post mortem was conducted at Rampur district hospital in Uttar Pradesh.Both the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Police, in a previous hearing on February 26, told the court that the victim did not suffer any gunshot wounds.During the hearing, the judge also asked Uttar Pradesh Police to provide original X-ray plate and video of the post-mortem exam of the farmer to the court. It said that both the documents would be given to the investigating officer on March 5, who shall keep it in safe custody.Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Mehra, representing Delhi Police, told the court that even though they have requested the Uttar Pradesh Police to give the original X-ray plate and post-mortem exam video, the officials of Rampur police and hospital refused to do it until ordered by the court.Advocate Garima Prashad, representing the Uttar Pradesh Police and the CMO of the hospital, said they do not have X-ray report and they only have the X-ray plate and the post-mortem report which they are willing to hand over to the Delhi Police on the date and time fixed by the court.She said the original post mortem and inquest reports have already been handed over to the Delhi Police.Grover also said once the original X-ray plate is received from the Uttar Pradesh Police, the court can ask AIIMS or any other forensic department to prepare a report out of the X-ray plate for their perusal.Delhi Police had earlier said that according to the post-mortem report, the young farmer died due to a head injury sustained in the accident .It had said that the protesters instead of taking Navreet to the hospital immediately, kept his body on the road for five hours and then spread rumours that he was killed in police firing.The Uttar Pradesh police, in its status report, had stated that no FIR has been registered by it in connection with the death as claimed by the petitioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-tells-police-to-share-post-mortem-video-inquest-report-with-family-of-farmer-killed-on-jan-26-101614882345856.html

Officials said the currency was concealed in sweet boxes and the women were apprehended during the security checks.Officials from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) on Thursday identified the women as Mahmooda Sediqi and Estorai Qayomi, both from Afghanistan. The crime came to light around 1.30pm when a CISF personnel deployed at the security hold area of Terminal 3 spotted a suspicious image of a hand baggage belonging to a woman travelling to Kabul by a Kam Airlines flight.“Her bag was selected for manual screening and during checking, $40,000 in four bundles were found neatly concealed inside soan papdi (sweet) boxes. Another pouch recovered from the same woman had $6,500 concealed in it,” the CISF said in a statement issued on Thursday.The woman was later identified as Mahmooda Sediqi. CISF said, “Later, on checking CCTV footage, another Afghani woman passenger, later identified as Estorai Qayomi, also bound for Kabul by the same flight, was intercepted near the boarding gate area. She was also asked to cooperate for a detailed baggage check during which $30,000 were recovered from her. Since both the women could not produce any valid document to carry such a huge amount of foreign currency, the matter was reported to the customs. Both women along with the recovered $76,500 were handed over to custom officials for further probe,” the statement said.A senior customs officer from Delhi airport said the two women were arrested and the recovered cash was seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-afghani-women-held-with-76-500-at-delhi-airport-101614882345279.html
05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Shimla ranks first in ease of living index||Shimla, the erstwhile summer capital of India, has ranked first among 62 cities with a population under a million in the 2020 Ease of Living Index.The report that was released by Union minister of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri stated that Shimla had scored an aggregate 60.9 points in four broad verticals to emerge at the top of the leaderboard.As many as 111 cities participated in the survey. Cities were slotted into two categories — those with a population of more than a million and those with a population under it.Shimla had ranked 92nd in the 2018 Ease of Living Index. However, the cities had not been categorised on basis of population in the last report.The index evaluated the wellbeing of the citizens in the surveyed cities according to different parameters comprising four pillars — quality of life, economic ability, sustainability and citizen’s perception survey— that were split into 14 categories and 49 indicators.Also dubbed as ‘Queen of Hills’, Shimla scored 53.05 points in quality of life; 23.39 in economic ability; 69.16 in sustainability; and 83.30 in citizens’ perception survey.Shimla is a safe city, say MC commissioner Shimla municipal corporation commissioner Ashish Kohli said the hill-town was better than the other capital cities when it came to safety and security.“The crime rate in Shimla is considerably low as compared to other capital cities or big towns. Shimla scored over 80 points in safety and security,” he said, adding that the city had also done well in housing and shelter. “Under the Rajiv Gandhi Aawas Yojana, 112 houses were proposed to be built, of which 96 have already been constructed and 16 are under construction,” he said.Shimla also won accolades for water management. In 2018, the city had experienced an acute water crisis that had left residents reeling. Most of the city had received water only once in eight days. There were long queues at public taps, and many residents waited for hours for water tankers. Now, Shimla draws 51 minimal liquid discharge (mld) of water per day. During the crisis, the water supply had dipped to an all-time low of 18 mld.“After the Shimla Jal Pradhan Nigam plugged all leakages, the price of water has also come down from ₹117/kiloliter to ₹90/kiloliter,” Kohli said.Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said that Shimla’s top ranking in the ease of living index was a manifestation of the development made by the state government in different fields. “The state has made unprecedented progress in the fields of education, health and road construction while there has been a decrease in crime in the state,” he said.“We are glad that Shimla has topped the ease of living index survey. We at the municipal corporation and local bodies have tried to implement the schemes of the Government of India. The credit goes to local representatives, the state government and authorities. We will strive to ensure that all stakeholders are benefitted,” said municipal corporation councillor Kimi Sood.Dharamshala ranks 37th Meanwhile, Dharamshala, the only other town in Himachal to be evaluated, has ranked 37th in the list.Dharamshala scored 51.51 points overall. It scored 53.58 points in quality of life; 60.77 in sustainability; and 67.40 in citizens perception survey. However, its score in economic ability merely 2.55. The hill-town had ranked 56th in the 2018 index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-ranks-first-in-ease-of-living-index-101614864583665.html

05-03-2021||World||Huge number of young migrants arriving at US border poses challenge for Biden||Thousands of minors without papers are arriving at the US border with Mexico, presenting President Joe Biden with a potentially major crisis in one of America's most politically sensitive regions.Biden took office promising an immigration policy more humane than that of Donald Trump, but some migrant advocacy groups say the new Democratic president's decisions are luring undocumented travelers in what amounts to a beacon effect.In line with a pandemic-rooted policy adopted by Trump, who cracked down on immigration both legal and illegal as part of his "America first" doctrine, the Biden administration is deporting most of the undocumented people who arrive at the southern border. The majority of them come from Central America fleeing violence and poverty.But unlike Trump, Biden has opted against expelling minors who show up unaccompanied and are filling shelters set up to hold them, with limited capacity because of the coronavirus crisis.'Old patterns'Activists say a crisis is in the making.Accepting kids without their parents, they say, can incite families to separate and result in widespread detention of children and young people."A lot of our border policies put parents in the position where their only choice is to send their child up alone through immigration, because it's the way that the child can be the safest," said Allegra Love, an attorney with the Santa Fe Dreamers Project, which provides free legal services to migrants.Most of the minors who arrive unaccompanied, some as young as six, must spend 10 days in quarantine and after two negative Covid-19 tests are sent to holding facilities spread around the country while authorities try to find some relative of theirs in the United States.Critics of this policy say what ends up happening is the minors' stay in such facilities, where serious abuses have been reported in the past, can drag on for months."There's a lot of pressure for these families to self separate," said Joshua Rubin, an activist with Witness at the Border.He said US immigration authorities are "falling into old patterns because you know they feel pressured."The way they're handling it, they are causing somewhat of a crisis," said Rubin.These minors can end up suffering and being traumatized, he said.For the Biden administration, "it's an unenviable position to be in. They're getting criticism from all different political perspectives," said Jennifer Podkul, a lawyer with Kids in Need of Defense, which has worked at the US-Mexico border."It's very hard and they have to start from scratch. Trump totally decimated the US protection system," said Podkul.'Horrible experiences'Minors traveling alone from Central America are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and forced labor because of abusive people they meet along the way, said Belinda Bradford, assistant director of Good Neighbor Settlement House, a shelter that helps families in Brownsville, Texas, across the border from Matamoros, Mexico.The Biden administration recently reopened a temporary shelter in Carrizo Springs, Texas, that can hold some 700 adolescent migrants. And there have been reports it is planning to reopen an even bigger one in Homestead, Florida -- prompting protests at the site."Our hope and expectation is that won't stay open very long, that we will be able to provide for every kid that comes across the border to safely be housed in a facility that is licensed," Biden told the Spanish language broadcaster Univision last week of the Texas facility.The number of undocumented migrants arriving at the border started falling in mid-2019, when Trump approved measures to prevent them from entering the United States to request asylum.But the number has been on the rise again since April. US officials say this is due in part to hopes stirred among migrants by some of Biden's campaign promises, including a plan to create a path to citizenship for the 11 million people living in the US without papers.Activists explain that Trump's tough deportation policies led to a build-up of migrants massed at the US border -- which also partly explains the current surge.In January more than 5,800 unaccompanied minors were stopped by US border agents.The figure does not yet surpass the numbers recorded under Barack Obama or Trump. In May 2019, a record 11,000 entered the US. But this could change."I don't think that (the arrival of migrants) will ever end for the United States, you know. For centuries, the United States has been a land of opportunity, a land for new beginnings," said Bradford, of the Texas shelter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-number-of-young-migrants-arriving-at-us-border-poses-challenge-for-biden-101614965319748.html

Nigeria is also expecting at least 40 million doses from the African Union as well as 100,000 donated doses of India's Covishield vaccine.'The vaccine is safe'Applause greeted the first vaccinations in Kenya on Friday after it received its first million doses this week via Covax."I am feeling great," said Patrick Amoth, director general at the ministry of health, after getting his shot. "The vaccine is safe."Kenya, which is keen to revive its tourism-dependent economy, East Africa's largest, plans to vaccinate 1.25 million people by June and another 9.6 million in the next phase, with more vaccines expected within weeks."This may mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic," said Susan Mochache, a senior official at the health ministry.Neighbouring Uganda took delivery on Friday of its first batch of 864,000 AstraZeneca doses via COVAX and aims to begin inoculations on March 10.As of Thursday, Africa as a whole had reported nearly 4 million infections and 104,000 deaths - still a relatively small toll compared to other continents, with higher national death counts in the United States, India, Brazil, Russia and Britain.South Africa has recorded by far the most Covid-19 infections and deaths on the African continent, with 1.5 million cases and more than 50,000 fatalities to date.On Friday, a senior health official said South Africa was negotiating with an African Union (AU) platform to buy vaccines for at least 10 million of its people.The country was provisionally allocated 12 million doses developed by AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson in an AU vaccine plan, but it was unclear how many vaccines it would seek to buy after it halted plans to use the AstraZeneca shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covax-vaccinations-bring-relief-to-africans-suffering-from-covid19-101614964732450.html

She said Twitter would be testing and iterating possible paid-for features over time.Twitter is working on “Undo Send” timer for tweets pic.twitter.com/nS0kuijPK0Twitter has said it is working on paid subscription models, which would reduce its dependence on ad revenue, including a "super follow" feature to let users charge their followers for access to exclusive content which will launch this year.CEO Jack Dorsey has previously said the site would likely never have an "edit button," a feature users have long sought.But Twitter has been introducing more prompts as users send tweets such as asking them if they want to read an article before sharing it, and experimenting with allowing people to revise a tweet reply before it is published if it uses harmful language.The company reportedly included a possible "undo send" feature in a user survey last year asking which features people would like to have available through a subscription model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-explores-undo-send-feature-for-paying-users-101614964566147.html
05-03-2021||World||Turkey: Sudden weather change likely cause of chopper crash||A sudden, mid-flight change of weather conditions is thought to be the cause a helicopter crash which killed 11 military personnel in eastern Turkey, the Defense Ministry said Friday, citing a preliminary inspection of the crash site.The Cougar army helicopter went down on a snow-covered area close to the village of Cekmece, in the predominantly Kurdish-populated Bitlis province on Thursday. The victims included Lt. Gen. Osman Erbas, an army corps commander.Two military personnel survived the crash with injuries.The Defense Ministry statement said an initial inspection of the wreckage showed no evidence of an explosion or fire. There was also no meteorological warning prior to the flight, it added.“In the light of the initial information, it is considered that the accident occurred due to adverse weather conditions that occurred as a result of a sudden change in weather conditions in the region,” the statement read.The ministry added that a more detailed technical inspection would determine the definitive cause.The location of the crash is in an area where Turkish troops have been combating militants of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which is considered to be a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people since 1984.In 1997, PKK militants attacked a Turkish Cougar helicopter in northern Iraq, killing 11 Turkish soldiers.More recently, 13 military personnel were killed in 2017, when a Cougar helicopter crashed into power lines shortly after take-off from a base near Turkey’s border with Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-sudden-weather-change-likely-cause-of-chopper-crash-101614964199252.html
05-03-2021||World||UN report shows close to 931 million tonnes of food were wasted globally in 2019||An estimated 931 million tonnes of food were wasted globally in 2019, enough to circle the Earth seven times, according to a UN report which said that household food waste in India is about 68.7 million tonnes a year.The Food Waste Index Report 2021, from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and partner organisation WRAP, said that around 931 million tonnes of food waste was generated in 2019, sixty-one per cent of which came from households, 26 per cent from food service and 13 per cent from retail.“This suggests that 17 per cent of total global food production may be wasted,” it said.“The weight roughly equals that of 23 million fully loaded 40-tonne trucks — bumper-to-bumper, enough to circle the Earth seven times,” the UN agency said.In India, the household food waste estimate is 50 kg per capita per year, or 68,760,163 tonnes a year.The household food waste estimate in the US is 59 kg per capita per year, or 19,359,951 tonnes a year, while for China these estimates are 64 kg per capita per year or 91,646,213 tonnes a year.The report looks at food waste that occurs in retail outlets, restaurants and homes – counting both food and inedible parts like bones and shells and presents the most comprehensive food waste data collection, analysis and modelling to date.It finds that in nearly every country that has measured food waste, it was substantial, regardless of income level.It shows that most of this waste comes from households, which discard 11 per cent of the total food available at the consumption stage of the supply chain.Food services and retail outlets waste 5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.On a global per capita-level, 121 kgs of consumer level food is wasted each year, with 74 kgs of this happening in households, the UNEP said in a statement.“If we want to get serious about tackling climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, businesses, governments and citizens around the world have to do their part to reduce food waste,” Executive Director of the UNEP Inger Andersen said.The report said that food waste has substantial environmental, social and economic impacts. At a time when climate action is still lagging, 8-10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food that is not consumed, when losses before consumer level are taken into account.“Reducing food waste would cut greenhouse gas emissions, slow the destruction of nature through land conversion and pollution, enhance the availability of food and thus reduce hunger and save money at a time of global recession,” Andersen said.The report noted that with 690 million people affected by hunger in 2019, an estimate that is expected to rise sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and three billion people unable to afford a healthy diet, consumers need help to reduce food waste at home.It said countries can raise climate ambition by including food waste in Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, while strengthening food security and cutting costs to households.This makes food waste prevention also a primary area for inclusion in COVID-19 recovery strategies.“For a long time, it was assumed that food waste in the home was a significant problem only in developed countries,” said Marcus Gover, CEO of WRAP.“With the publication of the Food Waste Index report, we see that things are not so clear cut. With only nine years to go, we will not achieve SDG 12 Target 3 if we do not significantly increase investment in tackling food waste in the home globally. This must be a priority for governments, international organisations, businesses and philanthropic foundations,” Gover said.Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3 aims at halving per-capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reducing food losses along production and supply chains. One of the two indicators for the target is the Food Waste Index.Andersen said that there is growing evidence of success in reducing food waste – though not at the scale needed to achieve the target.“Much more can be done. We need, for example, to address the role of consumer behaviour, in all cultural contexts, in achieving the target. Let us all shop carefully, cook creatively and make wasting food anywhere socially unacceptable while we strive to provide healthy, sustainable diets to all,” Andersen added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-report-shows-close-to-931-million-tonnes-of-food-were-wasted-globally-in-2019-101614963348818.html

Health authorities are trying to stop the spread of the variant, known as P1, because of concerns that it may respond less well to current vaccines.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that the emergence of a vaccine-resistant variant could derail the planned timings for reopening parts of the economy that have been under lockdown for over two months. Non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality are due to open again in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-uk-person-with-covid-variant-found-after-5-day-hunt-101614964043761.html

Qamar Javed Bajwa on Thursday met Prime Minister Khan as part of the interactions between the civilian and military leadership on national issues. ISI Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed was also present during the meeting, the Dawn newspaper reported.An official source said the meeting was held to review the “internal and external situation”. However, no statement was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which usually issues press releases on such meetings, the report noted.According to the report, people were quick to link the meeting to the latest political developments in the country following the Senate elections.Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) candidate and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani defeated ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on Wednesday, in a major blow to Khan, who had personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.The defeat of the finance minister in the elections to the upper house prompted calls for resignation of Khan by the Opposition leaders.Khan hit back by announcing to seek a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on Saturday. Shaikh was defeated by a margin of 5 votes.Criticising the meeting between Khan, the Army chief and the ISI chief, Maryam Nawaz, Vice President of the main Oppostion party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz said the military leadership "should not have been seen" with Prime Minister Khan after the developments in the Senate polls.She said that the Prime Minister had called and met the heads of institutions in the lawns of PM House "on the day he suffered a humiliating defeat (and) his members expressed a lack of confidence in him and voted against him"."Is he not dragging the institutions into politics?" she was quoted as saying in the report.She said that the meeting at this juncture does not send out good visuals.“Institutions” should end backing of Prime Minister Khan, if they have not done so far and should restrict themselves to the constitutional and lawful role, she said.Addressing the military leadership, she said, "you should not have been seen sitting with Imran Khan at any cost a day after he suffered a battering (and) faced the people's and public representatives' wrath, when he (Imran) was busy in machinations and rigging."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-senate-poll-defeat-isi-pak-army-chiefs-meet-imran-khan-101614963620616.html
05-03-2021||World||PDM to boycott Pak PM Imran Khan's vote of confidence on Saturday||In a relief for Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the eve of a vote of confidence on his government, the Opposition alliance on Friday announced that they will boycott the floor test, claiming that their candidate's victory in the Senate election was itself a "no-confidence motion" against the premier.Pakistan Democratic Movement chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said no Opposition member will attend the National Assembly session scheduled for Saturday, in which Prime Minister Khan will seek a vote of confidence.The announcement from the chief of the PDM, a 10-party Opposition alliance, comes after Khan delivered an address to the nation, explaining why he was seeking a vote of confidence in the wake of the Senate elections in which the opposition managed to stage an upset.PDM candidate and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani defeated ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on Wednesday, in a major blow to Khan, who had personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.Rehman said Gilani's "victory was itself a no-confidence motion against Khan".He claimed that President Arif Alvi in his notification to summon Saturday's session had essentially stated that Prime Minister Khan had "lost the trust of the majority" and he, therefore, needed to seek a vote of confidence."So when the president talks about losing trust to call the session of the National Assembly, then this further strengthens the stance of the Opposition," he was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.Prime Minister Khan has convened a meeting of his allies on Friday to firm up his strategy, a day ahead of seeking a vote of confidence from the National Assembly following a key defeat in this week's closely-contested Senate elections.Khan needs the support of 171 lawmakers in the National Assembly, currently having 341 members out of total 342, as one seat is vacant.Khan's PTI has 157 lawmakers. The Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has 83 member and the Pakistan Peoples Party has 55 lawmakers. PTI leaders have said they are confident that Khan will overcome the floor test.Minister for Science Fawad Chaudhry said that Khan will easily win the confidence vote as PTI's woman candidate for Senate, Fouzia Arshad, got 174 votes on Wednesday and won in the house where Shaikh got 164 votes and was defeated."The requisite support is available and Khan will easily win,” he said.Meanwhile, Pakistan's election commission on Friday expressed shock and disappointment over Prime Minister Khan's allegations against it, asserting that the Senate elections were held as per the Constitution and it has "never come under any sort of pressure and God willing, will not in future as well."The strong comments were made by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in a statement following a crucial meeting of its members to review Prime Minister Khan's statements against it on Thursday in an address to the nation.The meeting was summoned by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja.Prime Minister Khan lashed out at the election commission which he said failed to stop corruption in Wednesday's closely-contested Senate elections."You (ECP) discredited democracy…you damaged the morality of the nation by doing nothing to stop vote-buying," he alleged. In its response, the ECP said, "this is the beauty of democracy and independent elections and the secret ballot which the entire nation witnessed, which was according to the Constitution."Rejecting Khan's allegations, the commission said it has "never come under any sort of pressure and God willing, will not in future as well"."We cannot ignore the law and the Constitution to please anyone," said the ECP in its statement.Urging its critics to bring forward evidence of the ECP's wrongdoing, it asked them to not indulge in mud slinging on national institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pdm-to-boycott-pak-pm-imran-khan-s-vote-of-confidence-on-saturday-101614961996917.html
05-03-2021||World||As UK awaits Harry, Meghan's take on royal split, author says ‘no winners in it’||The timing couldn’t be worse for Harry and Meghan.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will finally get the chance to tell the story behind their departure from royal duties directly to the public on Sunday, when their two-hour interview with Oprah Winfrey is broadcast.But back home in Britain, events have conspired to overshadow the tale of a prince and his American bride. On top of the pandemic and record economic slump, Prince Philip, Harry’s 99-year-old grandfather, has been hospitalized for almost three weeks and is now recovering from a heart procedure.“Harry and Meghan are hugely popular,’’ Pauline Maclaran, a professor of marketing and author of “Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture,” told The Associated Press. “But I think that some people who might otherwise have supported them will find this just a little bit distasteful, that they’re drawing all this attention to themselves … just at this time when Prince Philip appears to be quite seriously ill.”Though it is the choice of CBS when to air its pre-recorded interview, critics are already lining up to deride it as a brand-building exercise by the pair, who left Britain saying they wanted to live a normal life but have been accused of continuing to use their royal status to open doors and make money.The sit-down with America’s queen of celebrity interviews is a chance for the couple to explain what led them to quit royal life, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. A book about their departure, “Finding Freedom,” also alleges that senior royals had little respect for Meghan, a biracial former actor, and that courtiers treated her badly.Pre-released clips have already shown Harry talking about his fears that history would repeat itself after his mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash while pursued by paparazzi. In another clip from the interview, Winfrey asks Meghan how she feels about the palace “hearing you speak your truth today?”“I don’t know how they could expect that, after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there was an active role that the firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us,” the duchess replies.“The firm” is a nickname for the royal family, sometimes used with affection and sometimes with a note of criticism.Ahead of the broadcast, relations with the palace are increasingly strained. First there was Queen Elizabeth II’s decision to strip Harry and Meghan of the handful of royal patronages they had retained in the one-year trial period following their departure last year. The couple responded with a terse statement promising to live a life of service — a move many in the U.K. saw as disrespectful to the queen, as she usually has the final word. Then on Wednesday, the palace said it was launching a human resources investigation after a newspaper reported that a former aide had accused Meghan of bullying staff in 2018.One of the authors of “Finding Freedom,’’ Omid Scobie, compared the recent commentary about Harry and Meghan in the British media to the Salem Witch Trials, while noting Americans have had more sympathy for them. His tweet linked to a discussion on the U.S. television program “The View,’’ including comments from Meghan McCain, a conservative columnist and daughter of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain.“I think we can’t ignore the elephant of the room that there’s probably a racial angle to this,’’ McCain said. “There’s a lot of racism directed at this woman, in a lot of different ways she threatens a lot of people in the patriarchy. ... It just looks like they are bullying her in the press.’’It was all supposed to be so different.At the time Harry started dating Meghan, the British public seemed smitten with the beautiful young woman who starred for seven seasons on the U.S. television drama “Suits.” When they married in 2018, newspapers were filled with optimistic stories about how the energetic couple would help make the monarchy relevant for a new, multicultural Britain.But less than two years later they decamped to North America. After a brief stay in Canada, the couple settled in Meghan’s home state of California, buying a house in the exclusive Santa Barbara County enclave of Montecito that reportedly cost more than $14 million. Among their neighbors: Oprah Winfrey.Then came deals with Netflix and Spotifiy, reportedly worth millions. The commercial deals and headline-grabbing amounts are uncomfortable for the royal family, which has devoted itself to public service as a justification for its wealth and privilege. The queen, among the richest people in Britain, has spent her life supporting charities, cutting ribbons at hospitals and traveling the world to represent her country.“The main thing that the royal family is so good at is serving the nation, serving the nation and the Commonwealth, basically serving us rather than serving themselves,’’ royal historian Hugo Vickers told ITV News. “And I’m sorry, if you’re sitting in an $11 million mansion in California and making fantastic deals, that is trading in on your royal heritage. And it’s all wrong, frankly.”Others are concerned that the interview will include damaging revelations about the royal family.The royals rarely grant interviews, and when they do the questions are usually narrowly focused on specific issues. For instance, Harry and his brother, William, have tried to remove the stigma from mental health problems by talking about their own struggles after the death of their mother.More free-ranging interviews have often gone badly. Interviews with Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry and William’s parents, around the time of their divorce led to embarrassing revelations about infidelity.More damaging for the palace was the interview Prince Andrew, Harry’s uncle, did with the BBC in 2019. Andrew tried to address rumors about his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but he was forced to give up royal duties after failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims.“I think it’s a bigger danger than the Prince Andrew car-crash interview,’’ Maclaran said of the Oprah interview, “because I think that Meghan is going to get a lot of sympathy, particularly from American audiences, about her position being untenable.”Regardless of what’s actually said, the interview is a threat to the stature of the monarchy because it further blurs the line between celebrity and royalty — tarnishing the royal mystique, Maclaran said.Late night chat show host James Corden underscored the threat to the royal brand during a tongue-in-cheek segment with Harry broadcast last week in which Corden suggested the prince and his wife might move into the mansion that provided the backdrop for the 1990s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”“If it was good enough for the Fresh Prince, it’s good enough for a real prince,” Corden said.The line put Harry, whose father and brother will be king one day, on the same footing as a TV character who fled west Philadelphia for a posh life in Southern California.Royal watchers wonder what could possibly be next.“It’s just such a mess,” said Penny Junor, who has written several books about the royals, including a biography of Harry. “I don’t think there are going to be any winners in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-uk-awaits-harry-meghan-s-take-on-royal-split-author-says-no-winners-in-it-101614962393480.html

It did not elaborate on what those comments were.Konkord said in December that Prigozhin had filed lawsuits against Navalny and his allies worth a total of 77 million roubles, the Interfax news agency reported.The Kremlin's critics have cast those lawsuits as well as the jailing of Navalny and prosecution of some of his allies as part of a coordinated campaign to cripple their activities. Russian authorities deny those charges.Navalny surfaced in a jail in Russia's Vladimir region to the east of Moscow, his allies said this week.Prigozhin has been accused by the United States of election meddling and has been sanctioned by the US and European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-orders-navalny-to-pay-damages-in-lawsuit-filed-by-kremlin-ally-101614961774372.html
05-03-2021||World||Donald Trump State Department aide charged with assault at US Capitol||A former State Department aide in President Donald Trump's administration has been charged with participating in the deadly siege at the Capitol and assaulting officers who were trying to guard the building, court papers show.It’s the first known case to be brought against a Trump appointee in the Jan. 6 insurrection, which led to Trump's historic second impeachment.Federico Klein, who also worked for Trump's 2016 campaign, was seen wearing a “Make America Great Again" hat amid the throng of people in a tunnel trying to force their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6, the papers say. Klein pushed his way toward the doors, where, authorities say, “he physically and verbally engaged" with officers trying to keep the mob back.Klein was seen on camera violently shoving a riot shield into an officer and inciting the crowd as it tried to storm past the police line, shouting, “We need fresh people, we need fresh people,” according to the charging documents.As the mob struggled with police in the tunnel, Klein pushed the riot shield, which had been stolen from an officer, in between the Capitol doors, preventing police from closing them, authorities say. Eventually, an officer used chemical spray, forcing Klein to move somewhere else, officials say.Klein was arrested Thursday in Virginia and faces charges including obstructing Congress and assaulting officers using a dangerous weapon.He was in custody on Friday and couldn’t be reached for comment. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney who could comment on his behalf. A Trump spokesman said he had no comment.At least five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died as a result of the violence, and two other officers killed themselves after. More than 300 people have been charged with federal crimes.Klein became a staff assistant in the State Department shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, according to a financial disclosure report. He held a top secret security clearance that was renewed in 2019, according to the court papers. He resigned from his position on Jan. 19, the day before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, authorities said.One of Klein's State Department coworkers helped authorities identify him, officials said.A Department of State diplomatic security special agent interviewed by an FBI agent said that Klein worked in the Office of Brazilian and Southern Cone Affairs, according to the court papers. The Department of State official identified Klein in photos and video shown by the FBI, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-state-department-aide-charged-with-assault-at-us-capitol-101614961480260.html

05-03-2021||World||Gender inequality has cost world USD 70 trillion since 1990, finds report||With many reports confirming women and other socially-disadvantaged sections have suffered the most during the pandemic, economists at BofA Securities have tabulated the cost of lack of gender diversity and inclusion, saying it will take 257 years to close the gap at the current rate, and not doing this has cost the world a whopping USD 70 trillion since 1990.The report also notes that full gender equality globally can increase the world GDP by up to USD 28 trillion by 2025 and the loss of human capital wealth due to gender inequality alone is estimated at USD 160.2 trillion.“Not closing the gender inequality gap and a lack of diversity and inclusion has an economic price tag. Not doing the right thing on this count has cost us USD 70 trillion since 1990…It will take us 257 years to close the gender economic gap at today's rate,” says the report, adding the pandemic alone, when women suffered the most, has cost women USD 1 trillion in income.Noting that gender and racial biases lead to persistent labour market disparities and limit the economy, it says closing the gender and race gaps in education and employment would have generated USD 2.6 trillion more in economic output in 2019 and the cumulative gains from 1990 would have been USD 70 trillion at the 2019 dollar rate.Closing racial earnings gap resulting from disparities in health, education, incarceration and employment opportunities would boost trend growth by 0.5 per cent per year through 2050, says the report.Reeling out numbers, the report says in 2020, there were no Black senior executives in any of the FTSE 100 companies. For the first time in six years in 2020 there were no black chairs, chief executives or finance chiefs in the FTSE 100 companies and just one company in the S&P 500 is run by a Black female CEO today, and only eight companies have at least 50 per cent female management teams.As much as 75 per cent of Nasdaq companies do not have at least one woman and one under-represented minority or LGBT member on the board, it says, adding continued racial inequality could cost the US economy USD1-1.5 trillion in lost consumption and investment over the next decade. The LGBTQ community is equivalent to the fourth largest economy in the world at USD 3.9 trillion.All in all, S&P 500 companies with above-median gender diversity on their boards see 15 per cent higher return on equity, and for companies with ethnic and racially diversified workforce this is 8 per cent higher. And the pandemic has only deepened the gender inequality crisis.As much as 96 million people will slide into extreme poverty in 2021, of which 47 million are women. Women's jobs were 19 per cent more at risk and women took up an even greater share of childcare and unpaid labour during the pandemic.Even before the pandemic, the gender gap was worsening and at the current rate of inclusion, it will take 257 years to reach economic equality, warns the report.As much as 90 per cent of children with disabilities in emerging markets countries do not attend school, says the report.Stating that gender diversity and inclusion are leading the way to tackling the social issues of our times, the report says from the MeToo movement to BlackLivesMatter, the awareness of injustices faced by under-represented and marginalised groups is at an all-time high, and especially during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gender-inequality-has-cost-world-usd-70-trillion-since-1990-finds-report-101614959591976.html
05-03-2021||World||Scientists add new coronavirus variant to UK watchlist after 16 cases. What do we know so far||Scientists have identified 16 cases of another new coronavirus variant in the UK as mutations of Sars-CoV-2 continue to pose a greater threat to containment measures for the infection. Public Health England (PHE) has designated the new strain of lineage B.1.1.318 as a variant under investigation (VUI).The health agency of the UK government on Thursday announced that cases of this new variant were first identified on February 15 through “genomic horizon scanning”. It further stated that all individuals who tested positive and their contacts have been traced and advised to isolate.Coronavirus variants are raised for formal investigation if they are considered to have concerning epidemiological, immunological or pathogenic properties. The new variant, which is understood to have originated in the UK, has been designated as VUI with a year, month, and number.The variant VUI-202102/04 contains the E484K mutation, which has also been found in two existing VUIs detected in the country. However, this new variant does not feature the N501Y mutation which is present in all variants of concern (VOCs). It may be designated as VOC after a risk assessment with the relevant expert committee. Currently, Britain is tracking a total of 4 VUIs and 4 VOCs.The coronavirus variant B.1.1.7 is currently the dominant variant in the UK and was suspected behind the renewed surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the country. According to PHE, at least 108,337 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant has been detected in the country so far. Some experts have predicted that B.1.1.7 is likely to drive a new wave of transmission in spring.The scientists have also identified six cases of a new P.1 variant, first detected in Brazil, in the UK. A new modelling study has suggested that the VOC may be up to 2.2 times more transmissible and cause re-infection in people already recovered from Covid-19.Researchers at the University of São Paulo, in collaboration with Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, used statistical analysis of genome sequencing data to arrive at a conclusion that a second wave of infection in Brazil’s Manaus, a city thought to have a high level of existing immunity from the first wave, was associated with the emergence of the new P.1 variant. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and is available as a preprint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-add-another-new-coronavirus-variant-to-uk-watchlist-after-16-cases-101614958848355.html
05-03-2021||World||ByteDance developing Clubhouse-like app for China amid copycat rush: Report||TikTok owner ByteDance is working on a Clubhouse-like app for China, sources familiar with the matter said, as the global success of the US-based audio chat service inspires a rush of copycats in the country.At least a dozen similar apps have been launched in the past month, with momentum picking up after Clubhouse was blocked in China in early February. Clubhouse had seen a surge in users who participated in discussions on sensitive topics such as Xinjiang detention camps and Hong Kong independence.New offerings include Xiaomi Corp's reworking of its Mi Talk app into an invitation-only audio service targeted at professionals last week. More are currently under development, industry executives say.ByteDance's plans are still in the early stages, said two sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.Discussions about TikTok and ByteDance on Clubhouse had prompted interest in the genre from ByteDance executives including CEO Zhang Yiming, said one of the sources.ByteDance declined to comment.The success of Clubhouse, which can host up to 8,000 people per chat room and has seen a discussion between Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev boost user numbers, has rammed home the potential of audio chat services.But similar apps in China are expected to take on Chinese characteristics that will accommodate censorship and government oversight.One such example is Nasdaq-listed Lizhi Inc's Zhiya app which was launched in 2018 and whose users usually talk about video games or sing songs.The app requires real name registration, a trait Lizhi CEO Marco Lai says is key in China. Audio livestreaming companies in China employ staff to listen to conversations in every room and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to weed out "inappropriate" content, such as pornography or politically sensitive issues, he said.A Lizhi spokeswoman said Zhiya uses humans as well as AI tools to regulate public conversations on the platform.The app was briefly taken down by Chinese regulators in 2019, but reinstated after Lizhi made rectifications.Lizhi's Lai said that outside of politics there was plenty of room for audio chat apps in China."Adults in China do not like to express their views in public, we have been taught to keep a low profile since we were young," he said. "A good approach in China, though, is entertainment, you invite everybody to have fun."Some new entrants to the market have had hiccups.Inke Ltd, best known for its livestreaming platform, launched a similar app, Duihuaba, this month that recruited venture capitalists, fashion critics and other celebrities to host conversations.However, it abruptly pulled the app two weeks after its debut, saying that it needed further improvements without elaborating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bytedance-developing-clubhouse-like-app-for-china-amid-copycat-rush-report-101614959946098.html
05-03-2021||World||China to build important 'passageway' to South Asia through Tibet: Report||China has included building of an important “passageway” connecting Tibet with South Asia in the 14th Five Year plan which is due to commence from this year, the official media reported on Friday.China will support Tibet in building the passageway to South Asia, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the 14th Plan document which was submitted to the National People’s Congress, (NPC), China’s Parliament.The annual session of the NPC began here on Friday.“China's Tibet Autonomous Region will be supported to build an important passageway opening to South Asia,” state-run Xinhua news agency reported briefly.The draft outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and the long-range objectives through the year 2035, which were cleared by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) have been submitted to the NPC for formal approval.Though the Xinhua report has not mentioned, China has been planning for a long time to build the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network through Tibet and Nepal.It was regarded as a part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation between China and Nepal.Nepal under the present government of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has moved closer to China, firming up especially the trans-Himalayan connectivity network.In 2019, China and Nepal signed a protocol to operationalise their 2016 Transit Transport Treaty which provided access for the landlocked Himalayan country to use Chinese ports for its foreign trade, reducing the dependence on Indian ports.Besides the road network, the two countries are considering the extension of the rail network from Tibet to Nepal.Last year, state-run China Daily here reported that preparatory work is underway for a cross-border railway connecting Tibet and Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.Meanwhile, work will start on the China-Nepal Friendship Industrial Park in Jhapa, eastern Nepal, early next year. The park is the first of its kind launched with Chinese investment.These two projects form part of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-build-important-passageway-to-south-asia-through-tibet-report-101614957484929.html
05-03-2021||World||Donald Trump sued by House impeachment manager over incitement of Capitol riot||A Congressman who helped lead the second impeachment of Donald Trump filed a lawsuit alleging the former president incited a mob that took over the US Capitol and disrupted the certification of the 2020 election.Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, filed the suit in federal court Friday. It’s the latest sign of legal peril for Trump over his role in the January 6 riot, even after he won acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial last month. Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, filed a similar suit Feb. 16 claiming the riot was the culmination of a months-long campaign by the former president to discredit the election results.Swalwell, who was one of the House impeachment managers, alleges Trump conspired with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama to incite the riot and violate the civil rights of the members of Congress who gathered to certify the election results. Giuliani and Brooks, both Republicans, appeared alongside Trump at the rally that preceded the Capitol assault.“Trump lied to his followers, telling them that the certification of Joe Biden’s election was a ‘coup’ and that their country was being stolen from them,” Swalwell said in the lawsuit. “Many participants in the attack have since revealed that they were acting on what they believed to be former President Trump’s orders in service of their country.”The suit seeks unspecified damages and raises the prospect of a lengthy discovery process that could uncover new evidence of Trump’s role in the riot, including private communications between him and Giuliani.Legal experts expect a wave of private lawsuits in the coming weeks targeting Trump and others over the violence that erupted at the Capitol. But any suit against Trump will have to overcome a legal hurdle: The president is likely to claim that his speech on January 6 fell within his presidential duties, shielding him from litigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-sued-by-house-impeachment-manager-over-incitement-of-capitol-riot-101614957385666.html
05-03-2021||World||Japan extends Covid-19 emergency in Tokyo, PM Suga apologises||Japan extended a state of emergency in the Tokyo area by two weeks on Friday to try to combat Covid-19, prompting a "heartfelt apology" by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The state of emergency had been set to end on March 7. But 4-1/2 months before Tokyo is due to host the Olympic Games, Suga said there was a need for caution because of the threat from new coronavirus variants and the possibility of cases rising again."I am deeply sorry at not being able to lift the state of emergency by the previously-promised March 7. I offer my heartfelt apology," Suga told a news conference.Under the state of emergency in Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures, the government has requested restaurants and bars close by 8 p.m. and stop serving alcohol an hour earlier.People are also asked to stay home after 8 p.m. unless they have essential reasons to go out.Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama prefectures, which make up 30% of Japan's population, sought the extension because the number of new coronavirus cases had not fallen enough.Suga said conditions had improved but there were still problems such as pressure on the medical system in the Tokyo area and cases could still rebound. Variant strains of the virus have been found in 19 of Japan's 47 prefectures, he said."In order to protect your lives and livelihood, and to take back a secure and lively life, I ask for your cooperation from the bottom of my heart," Suga said.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told a videoconference of governors of the affected area that the extension was essential."We can't have things rebound now, this is a really important time, and I think we all understand this," she said. "We'll keep in close contact with each other and beat the virus."BUSINESSES WORRIEDSuga said he would offer as much support for businesses as possible, but restaurants and related businesses fear continued suffering.Akira Koganezawa, vice president of the association for 55 restaurants that serve monjayaki, a pan-fried batter dish popular in the Tokyo area, said it was "a matter of life or death for us.""Without enough subsidies, some restaurants would go out of business," he said.Foreign athletes have been barred from entering Japan to train before the Olympics during the state of emergency. It was not immediately clear if the ban will remain in place during the extension for the Tokyo region while the order has already been lifted for the rest of the country.The curbs are narrower in scope than those imposed under an emergency last year, when schools and non-essential businesses were mostly shuttered.New case numbers are still a fraction of their peak in early January, when the state of emergency took effect. Tokyo reported 301 cases on Friday, compared with a record high 2,520 on Jan. 7Nationwide, Japan has recorded about 438,000 cases and 8,185 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-extends-covid-19-emergency-in-tokyo-pm-suga-apologises-101614955959849.html
05-03-2021||World||Crocodile hunt: Search on for unknown number of escaped reptiles in South Africa||Police and conservation officers were searching Friday for an unknown number of young crocodiles that escaped earlier in the week from a large breeding farm in South Africa.The crocodiles are suspected to have entered the nearby Breede River after escaping Wednesday morning near the town of Bonnievale in Western Cape province, about 180 kilometers (111 miles) east of Cape Town.So far, 27 of the reptiles have been recaptured and another seven had to be euthanized, Cape Nature conservation spokeswoman Petro van Rhyn said. Another six were spotted but evaded capture.The commercial breeding farm contains about 5,000 crocodiles, van Rhyn said, and a big part of the problem is that recovery teams aren’t certain how many escaped. They are waiting for the owner of the farm to give them an accurate count.“Is it 100, or is it 1,000?” van Rhyn said. “We don't know.”The crocodiles are thought to be between 1.2 and 1.5 meters long, according to Cape Nature.Conservation officers have been using cages with food bait inside to try and capture the crocodiles, but that hasn't proved to be very successful because the river is full of fish, van Rhyn said.Police and Cape Nature officers are concentrating on an area as far as five kilometers (three miles) upstream and five kilometers downstream of the escape point but don't believe the crocodiles will have moved very far.Van Rhyn said residents of the area should be watchful but shouldn't panic. Crocodiles are nocturnal and generally shy, she said, it's highly unlikely to see one on the streets of Bonnievale.She said it was not a good idea to go swimming in the river there, though.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crocodile-hunt-search-on-for-unknown-number-of-escaped-reptiles-in-south-africa-101614953952591.html
05-03-2021||World||World's worst Covid crisis is unfolding in Brazil, where no fix seems to work||More than a year after a spiked virus launched a murderous campaign across the globe, most countries have put the worst behind them, aided by aggressive government policies and vaccines.Not Brazil.The continent-sized nation of 212 million is facing more Covid deaths and cases than ever, its hospitals overflowing, its policy in disarray, its vaccine supply severely limited. In addition to a president who scoffs at the disease, rejects masks and leaves each state on its own, the country plays host to a variant that’s more contagious and possibly deadlier.Nothing better illustrates the bizarrely fractured nature of Brazil’s Covid policies — and how they’ve sowed confusion and anger and suffering — than three cities along a 140-mile roadway in the state of Sao Paulo, where three distinct approaches to the pandemic coexist. In one, practically anything goes; in another, it’s full lockdown; and in a third, mass vaccination is underway. Each is a mess, overrun by rampant illness and mired in a deep economic funk that shows no signs of ending anytime soon.“What we’re living through now is much worse than what we had before,” said Denise Garrett, an infectious disease expert and vice president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington. “I see a huge storm forming in Brazil.”Sao Paulo, the country’s financial hub and center of wealth, is where the virus first made landfall one year ago in Brazil, transported unwittingly by returning skiers and holiday-makers from Spain, Italy and the US From them, it spread to household help and employees.Araraquara sits almost in the middle of the state, a four-hour drive from the capital, and has long basked in its access to wealth. Its 240,000 residents make three times the nation’s minimum wage.These days, work is scarce. In fact, everything is scarce. Araraquara has been hermetically sealed — even supermarkets and gas stations are shut — for the past week or two to push back against a viral attack like no other.In the first two months of 2021, more people have died of the virus in the city than in all of 2020. Most Covid tests are coming back not only positive but positive for the highly contagious Brazil variant that emerged in the Amazonian city of Manaus. The strain, which preliminary studies suggest is at least twice as transmissible, showed up in more than 80% of samples collected at a clinic in the city from mid-January to mid-February.So Mayor Edinho Silva has imposed a lockdown of unprecedented severity.“I opted for a lockdown like what they had in China,” he said. While effects will take time to show up in the numbers, it was the only way to keep the situation from getting even worse. “If we don’t close, we’ll have people dying without having the right to fight for their lives.”Eighty miles away, the city of Bauru, with 380,000 residents, is facing a similarly devastating rate of infection. Its ICU beds are, like those of its neighbors, 100% occupied. The patients, once elderly, are now in their 20s and 30s and arriving even sicker than previously.And yet, Bauru is not shutting down. Not by a long shot. Mayor Suellen Rosim has been following the lead of President Jair Bolsonaro, even joining street protests against the state’s governor for ordering lockdowns.“People are taking risks, but not because they’re irresponsible,” said the city’s health secretary, Orlando Dias. “They just can’t take it anymore.” He denies the pandemic is at its worst moment, and says a municipality that has 70% of its gross domestic product tied to commerce can’t just halt activities because the governor ordered it to.So Fernando Christian’s small clothing shop in the city is not only open, clients are trying on clothes. City Hall knows about it, he says. What he and other vendors fear is state inspection. When state representatives come, stores rush to close.Eighty miles in the other direction from Araraquara, Serrana has risen to virus fame in a very different way. The small town of 46,000, where the virus has been twice as deadly as in its neighbors, was chosen for a study researchers say is the first of its kind in the world: mass vaccination.Henrique and Viviane Ferreira were happily standing in line to become part of the very small group of 30- and 40-year-olds in Brazil to get the vaccine. Elsewhere in the country, shots are available only to health-care professionals and those 75 or older, plus priority groups including the indigenous population. The plan in Serrana is to vaccinate 30,000 people, essentially everyone in the city over 18.The plan, which was kept secret for months, caused a stir when it was announced in February. More than 90% of the residents signed up. Outsiders tried to buy or rent properties, but a census avoided what mayor Léo Capitelli called “an opportunistic mass migration.”The results of the experiment, which are expected in May, could give a glimpse into what life for Brazilians may be like once vaccinations gain scale. Health experts like Isabella Ballalai, the vice president of the Brazilian society of immunization, had hoped that would come sooner. Brazil’s centralized vaccination program, she says, used to set the country apart even from rich nations, ensuring fast and equal access.“We could be vaccinating so much more,” she said. “It’s really sad to see the situation where we’ve arrived at.”The three cities exemplify the wildly diverse experience that has been Covid in Brazil. Restrictions have varied from city to city and are often eased, only to be reimposed weeks later — a mishmash of policies that have little to no enforcement, lowering their efficacy and prolonging the situation. Politicians setting the rules have been caught evading their own orders and often publicly bicker over who’s to blame for the crisis.The glimmer of hope offered by vaccination remains elusive. The country has only a few doses at hand, not enough to cover even the priority groups. Jonas Donizette, a former mayor who heads a grouping of 400 municipal chiefs, blames the federal government for not acquiring vaccines. Cities, he says, are going off on their own to try and buy them, something that has never happened before.And then there’s the economy. The government’s cash handouts, which helped tie over 66 million Brazilians last year and even reduced poverty levels, ran out in December. While lawmakers debated a new round of aid, which was approved just this week, data from retail sales have tumbled, showing the effect of phasing out the so-called coronavouchers.Christian, the clothing shop owner in Bauru, is among the millions who lost jobs during the pandemic’s first wave. After being fired from a sports apparel shop, he opened a food truck with his father-in-law, only to have to sell off the van, along with everything else, as the crisis worsened.Today he earns about half of what he did before the virus hit. Even with his wife bringing in money from baking cakes and selling used clothes, it’s not unusual for their refrigerator to be empty, especially now that government aid has run out. It’s a day-to-day worry: “If there’s a lockdown, I’ll earn nothing,” he says.The Ferreiras, in Serrana, have seen business slow down, too — especially in their part-time work as wedding photographers. The mass vaccination has yet to materialize into a rebound, though the knowledge that they and their families are safer eases part of the blow.The sense of policy drift and rising deaths — Brazil has lost more than 260,000 to the virus, second only to the US — is producing political anxiety.This week, state governors criticized the federal government for spreading false information and “prioritizing conflict, creating images of good-versus-evil and undermining cooperation.” States from Sao Paulo to Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul have tightened restrictions in the past few days to try to halt contagion.State health secretaries issued a statement calling on the government to recognize the seriousness of the pandemic, which is causing the collapse of several public and private health-care systems. It lamented the lack of a national, coherent policy and asked for more stringent rules for non-essential businesses, including forbidding sports and religious activities and all in-person classes and closing bars and beaches. It also called for authorities to consider shutting airports and suspending interstate travel, as well as imposing a national curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. during the week and all day on weekends.While some at the health ministry are open to discussing nationwide measures with governors, the concern is that Bolsonaro himself will bar any such initiative, a person familiar with the matter said.'We're going to continue to see a high number of infections and deaths for at least three months, because there's nothing to stop it from happening,' said Antonio Carlos Bandeira, a director at Brazil's infectious disease society. 'It's not lockdowns being done in one place or the other that will avoid it. You would have had to have coordinated this long ago.'This week, as Brazil reported back-to-back record deaths from the virus, Bolsonaro welcomed allies for a lunch in Brasilia. The largely maskless group feasted on typical dishes, including beans with sausage and collard greens, plus a whole roast pig. The following day, the president raged against governors for creating panic in the population.'You didn't stay home, you didn't cower,' Bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters on Thursday. 'We have to face our fears. No more fussiness, no more whining. Are people going to cry forever?'||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-worst-covid-crisis-is-unfolding-in-brazil-where-no-fix-seems-to-work-101614952708138.html
05-03-2021||World||Swiss mull 'burqa ban' in vote centering on security, rights||At a time when seemingly everyone in Europe is wearing masks to battle Covid-19, the Swiss go to the polls Sunday to vote on a long-laid proposal to ban face-coverings, both the niqabs and burqas worn by a few Muslim women in the country and the ski masks and bandannas used by protesters.The issue strikes at the intersection of religious freedom, security, the economy and women’s rights.Critics say the proposal “Yes to a ban on covering the face” is an ironic throwback to a time not long ago when violent extremism was a greater concern than global pandemic, and say it would unfairly stigmatize Muslims who wear full face-covering burqas or niqabs, which have open slits for the eyes, in Switzerland.Proponents, including populist, right-wing movements behind the idea, say it’s needed to combat what they consider a sign of the oppression of women and to uphold a basic principle that faces should be shown in a free society like that of the rich Alpine democracy.The issue is one of three measures on national ballots in the vote culminating Sunday — most voters in Switzerland cast ballots by mail – as part of the latest installment of regular Swiss referendums that give voters a direct say in policymaking.Other proposals would create an “e-ID” to improve security of online transactions — an idea that has run afoul of privacy advocates — and a free-trade deal with Indonesia, which is opposed by environmentalists who have concerns about palm oil plantations on the archipelago in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.The face-covering measure has come to be known colloquially as the “burqa ban." It would put Switzerland in line with countries like Belgium and France that have already enacted similar measures. Two Swiss regions also already have such bans.One campaign poster presented by the Swiss People’s Party — a populist, right-wing party that is the leading faction in parliament and has strongly backed the measure — features a caricatured image of the scowling eyes of a woman in a burqa above the words: “Stop Islamic Radicalism.”A coalition of left-leaning parties have put up signs that read: “Absurd. Useless. Islamophobic.”Support appears to have been eroding, but the vote is expected to be tight. An initial poll for public broadcaster SSR by the gfs.bern agency in January found more than half of voters backed the proposal, but a second poll published on Feb. 24 showed the figures had dipped to under half. Some remain undecided.The Swiss government opposes the measure, arguing that it could crimp economic development: Most Muslim women who wear such veils in Switzerland are visitors from well-heeled Persian Gulf states, who are often drawn to bucolic Swiss lakeside cities. The justice minister insists existing laws work just fine.The measure would make it punishable by fines to cover the face in public in places like restaurants, sports stadiums, public transport or simply walking in the street — though exceptions are made for religious, security and health reasons, as well as for the Swiss traditional Carnival celebrations.A counter-proposal would require people to show their faces if requested to do so by authorities.It’s another indication how Switzerland is grappling with security issues and cultures and people from abroad. In the past, Swiss voters have approved a ban on the construction of minarets in the Alpine country whose flag carries the cross.Andreas Tunger-Zanetti, a researcher who heads the Center for Religious Studies at the University of Lucerne, estimates at most a few dozen Muslim women wear full-face coverings in the country of 8.5 million people, and says the issue is really about Switzerland's take on religion and ability to “cope with diversity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-mull-burqa-ban-in-vote-centering-on-security-rights-101614952072704.html
05-03-2021||World||Italy is first to block Covid-19 vaccine export. All you need to know about AstraZeneca supply row||Italy has decided to block thousands of doses of the vaccine developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Australia. The country is not only the first country in Europe to do so but also the first in the world that has refused the export of Covid-19 vaccines to another nation. The refusal was possible because of the vaccine export control measure taken by the European Union earlier this year.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Worried about the Covid vaccine supply, the 27-nation bloc had taken vaccine export control measures that drove criticism from the World Health Organization (WHO). The global health body has been programming the COVAX initiative for the equitable access of vaccines to all. Italy has reported more than 2.9 million coronavirus cases and 99,000 deaths, as per Johns Hopkins University's tracker.Here is what has happened:1. Italy has decided to block the 250,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses to Australia. This is the first refusal to vaccine export after the EU introduced the vaccination supply measures overseas on January 29. France has also come forward in support of the decision.2. Due to the delivery shortfall the EU has brought in export control measures that authorises its members to deny vaccine exports.3. The refusal to Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine export comes after the Anglo-Swedish company said it will only be able to supply 40 million doses of the vaccine in contrast to the 90-100 million doses marked in the contract. The vaccine delays from the company have prompted such measures.4. In August 2020, the EU had signed a deal with Oxford-AstraZeneca for the supply of 400 million Covid-19 vaccines but earlier this year, the company reported production delays in its plant in Netherlands and Belgium. Pfizer vaccine supplies have also declined due to production issues.5. EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides had even demanded the company to meet the promised vaccine supply through the UK factories.Also Read | As China eyes Taiwan and beyond, Quad's Indo-Pacific agenda takes priority6. Australia on the other hand while asking the European Commission to review the refusal of vaccine export has said that it understands Italy's approach. "In Italy, people are dying at the rate of 300 a day. And so I can certainly understand the high level of anxiety that would exist in Italy and in many countries across Europe," Reuters quoted Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as saying.6. AstraZeneca’s chief executive officer Pascal Soriot said that the contract mentions 'our best efforts' on the allegations made by the EU that it is backtracking from its deal. He had also indicated that Europe might have signed the vaccine supply deal a little late in comparison to the UK. "Europe at the time wanted to be supplied more or less at the same time as the UK, even though the contract was signed three months later," Bloomberg quoted Soriot as saying.7. The EU vaccine row comes as the bloc is under pressure to do better in inoculating since the European nations were hit hard by the coronavirus disease. While the vaccination drive in Europe had begun in December last year, the pace of the inoculation is very slow in comparison to its old member Britain and other developed countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-is-first-to-block-covid-19-vaccine-export-all-you-need-to-know-about-astrazeneca-supply-row-101614946940759.html

05-03-2021||World||Indian American Naureen Hassan named first VP, COO of Federal Reserve Bank of New York||Indian American Naureen Hassan has been named as the first vice president and chief operating officer (COO) of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “Naureen’s leadership background, deep commitment to fostering diverse teams, and extensive technology and financial experience will be critical to her role as a Bank leader,” John C Williams, president and CEO of the New York Fed, said in a statement.Hassan, a 25-year veteran of the financial services industry, has served in various capacities with expertise in strategy, digital transformation, and cybersecurity. The appointment, effective March 15, was approved by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.Most recently, Hassan, whose parents are immigrants from Kerala, was the chief digital officer of wealth management at Morgan Stanley and a member of the wealth management operating committee at the investment bank. Previously, she was the executive vice president of investor services, segments and platforms at Charles Schwab Corporation. She holds a Masters of Business Administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.“I am confident that Naureen will be an inspiring and innovative leader, and look forward to working with her to move our organization forward in line with our values,” Williams added.The growing role of Indian Americans in the various sectors was well reflected in US President Joe Biden’s remark during a congratulatory call with Nasa’s aerospace engineer Swati Mohan on Thursday. The Mars 2020 guidance, navigation and control operations lead was responsible for the descent and landing phase of the Perseverance rover through the thin Martian atmosphere, described by Nasa scientists as “seven minutes of terror”.Referring to the achievement of Mohan, US vice president Kamala Harris, and the director of the White House speechwriting team, Vinay Reddy, Biden said that Indian Americans are “taking over the country.” “This is an incredible honour. And it’s amazing. Indian(s) - of descent - Americans are taking over the country. You, my vice president, my speechwriter, Vinay. I tell you what,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-naureen-hassan-named-first-vp-coo-of-new-york-fed-101614949269620.html
05-03-2021||World||Debate to begin in US Senate on Prez Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill||A sharply divided US Senate will begin a contentious debate on Friday on a $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill that is President Joe Biden's first major legislative initiative, with Democrats pressing ahead without any Republican support.The Senate voted on Thursday to take up the bill in a party-line 51-50 vote, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. But Republicans delayed the start of the debate by forcing the hours-long reading of the full text of the 628-page measure.The Senate is expected to debate the bill three hours on Friday before considering a multitude of amendments, which could require a marathon voting session, before taking a vote on final passage in a process that could extend into the weekend. Republicans are expected to use procedural maneuvers to slow the process.If the Senate approves the bill, it will have to be sent back to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives for final passage. Democrats hope Biden can sign the bill into law before March 14, when some of the current benefits run out.With no votes to spare, Senate Democrats have tweaked the measure to ensure all 50 of their members would support it. Those changes would steer more aid to smaller U.S. states and add money for infrastructure projects, among other adjustments.But efforts by some senators to alter temporary federal unemployment benefits failed. The Senate bill keeps the House plan for $400 per-week payments through Aug. 29. It was unclear whether any senators would try to change that figure, possibly to $300, during the amendment process in coming days."The time is now to move forward with big, bold, strong relief for the American people," said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has promised to keep the Senate at work until the bill is passed.Republicans, who broadly backed Covid-19 relief spending early in the pandemic, have criticized the bill's price tag.The relief legislation includes funding for vaccines and medical supplies, extends jobless assistance and provides a new round of emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments. Opinion polls indicate broad public support.Senate Democrats on Wednesday tightened criteria for stimulus checks so fewer high-income households would qualify.The compromise means that 9 million fewer households would receive a stimulus payment than in the last tranche of payouts in 2020. It also lowers the cost of the legislation by $12 billion, according to Senate Democrats. On Thursday, they said they had increased minimum payments to states with smaller rural populations to match the $1.25 billion minimum contained in last year's CARES Act. The bill passed by the House set the floor at $500 million.The pandemic has killed nearly 520,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work, although infection rates have eased in recent weeks as more people are vaccinated.'BIG, BLOATED, WASTEFUL'The Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Thune, said larger states like California, New York and Illinois still got the lion's share in the "big, bloated, wasteful bill.""You've got taxpayers in places like South Dakota and North Carolina and Georgia and other places around the country that essentially are writing checks to states which really aren't needed," Thune told PBS.Democrats also included $10 billion for infrastructure, $8.5 billion for health providers and expanded healthcare subsidies for those who lose their jobs.In the Senate, bills usually require the support of 60 senators. But the coronavirus relief bill is being advanced under a legislative maneuver known as reconciliation that allows passage with a simple majority vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/debate-to-begin-in-us-senate-on-prez-biden-s-1-9-trillion-covid-19-relief-bill-101614943486681.html

"I want everybody to be vaccinated."Two other male doctors and one female nurse were also inoculated in white tents draped in green, the colours of the national flag, while cameras rolled and officials clapped and cheered.Nigeria, with 157,671 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,951 deaths, has not been as hard hit by the pandemic as initially feared, but is aiming to vaccinate 40% of its people this year, and a further 30% in 2022.It took delivery of 3.92 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on Tuesday through the COVAX scheme. Nigeria expects to receive 84 million doses of the vaccine from COVAX this year.The scheme for poor and middle-income countries is co-led by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, and the World Health Organization, with UNICEF as an implementing partner.'Light at the end of the tunnel'Nigeria also expects at least 40 million doses from the African Union and 100,000 donated doses of India's Covishield vaccine.President Muhammadu Buhari and other "strategic leaders" will be vaccinated on Saturday in an effort to increase public confidence in the shots.Nigeria's 36 states, including Lagos, the commercial capital and epicentre of the pandemic in the country, will receive shots in coming weeks. Seroprevalence studies suggest 23% of Lagos state inhabitants may have had Covid-19 in October.Frontline healthcare workers and employees in key sectors, including oil and gas, will be among those getting the first shots, followed by adults with pre-existing conditions. All those over 18, excluding pregnant women, can then be vaccinated."Vaccines provide light at the end of the tunnel but we must get to the end of the tunnel," said Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director General of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, adding that surveillance, testing and treatment would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctor-gets-nigeria-s-first-covid-19-vaccine-amid-cheers-and-hope-101614948772158.html

Multiple news reports also talked about the bizarre-looking image shared by David Morris. Morris, while speaking to the broadcaster, said that he was “stunned” to see the image of a ship floating in the air.A BBC meteorologist, David Braine, explained the phenomenon and said that “a super mirage” has caused the ship to appear as floating in the air, because of “special atmospheric conditions that bend light.” “Superior mirages occur because of the weather condition known as a temperature inversion, where cold air lies close to the sea with warmer air above it. Since cold air is denser than warm air, it bends light towards the eyes of someone standing on the ground or on the coast, changing how a distant object appears,” Braine was quoted as saying by the BBC.Also read | As China eyes Taiwan and beyond, Quad's Indo-Pacific agenda takes priority“Superior mirages can produce a few different types of images - here a distant ship appears to float high above its actual position, but sometimes an object below the horizon can become visible,” he added. Braine also noted that such illusions appear “very rarely” in the United Kingdom during winter, but are common in the Arctic.A similar image was shared by a Facebook user named Colin McCallum, who also photographed what appeared to be a floating ship, near Banff, Aberdeenshire in Scotland. However, it turned out to be an optical illusion too.“When I first saw the boat, I had to do a double-take because I genuinely thought it was floating. Upon further inspection, however, I noticed that it was in fact just a remarkable optical illusion,” McCallum said while speaking to the British news outlet Daily Mail in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floating-ship-clicked-off-english-coast-expert-calls-it-rare-phenomenon-101614947329933.html
05-03-2021||World||Four Hong Kong activists released on bail after prosecutors withdraw appeal||Four Hong Kong democracy activists were released from custody on Friday after prosecutors withdrew an appeal against a court decision to grant them bail in a controversial national security case following marathon hearings this week.The four are part of a group of 47 activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in a case that has triggered global concern that Beijing is using the security law to crush dissent and wipe out meaningful opposition in the former British colony.The case is the most sweeping use yet of the law, which imposes punishments of up to life in prison for serious charges, including subversion.The 47 activists, aged 23 to 64, are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll last July that authorities said was part of a "vicious plot" to "overthrow" the government.The vote was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a Legislative Council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.Beijing is planning a major overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system and Legislative Council elections will likely be deferred again, to September 2022.Late on Thursday, following four consecutive days of hearings that went on late into the night and saw some of the defendants falling ill and taken to hospital, judge Victor So denied bail to 32 of the defendants.The other 15 were granted bail under strict conditions, but still kept in custody after government prosecutors appealed against the decision.On Friday, appeals for Clarisse Yeung, Lawrence Lau, Hendrick Lui and Mike Lam were withdrawn.They were then granted bail ranging from HK$80,000 ($10,300) to HK$1 million, provided that they surrender all travel documents, abide by a curfew, do not use speech and action that could possibly endanger national security, or organise or take part in elections or contact foreign officials.The other 11 will appear in three batches in court on Saturday for the prosecutors' appeal to be heard.For the others - including prominent activists Owen Chow, Lester Shum, Wu Chi-wai, Eddie Chu, Alvin Yeung, Claudia Mo, Gwyneth Ho and Prince Wong - the case was adjourned until May 31. Some are appealing against the decision.In contrast with the global financial hub's common law traditions, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies interference.While critics say the security law has been used to curb freedoms, Beijing and Hong Kong officials say it was vital to end the 2019 violence - political action they say was partly manipulated by foreign governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-hong-kong-activists-released-on-bail-after-prosecutors-withdraw-appeal-101614945782585.html
05-03-2021||World||Germany compensates utilities $2.9 Billion for nuclear exit||Germany agreed to compensate Vatenfall, RWE, EnBw and E.ON 2.4 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for losses suffered following the country’s decision to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima Dai-Ichi meltdowns.The deal ends the decade-long battle between the government and Germany’s biggest energy companies. It comes in an election year when the green credentials of Europe’s largest economy will be a key topic among voters. Abandoning nuclear power will eliminate one of Germany’s top sources of emissions-free electricity that is available around the clock.Friday’s settlement underscores the long-lasting economic impacts of the Fukushima accident even outside of Japan. Just months before the 2011 disaster, Germany’s government had agreed to extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear plants. But the government abruptly reversed course after the accident and decided to end nuclear power generation by the end of 2022 at the latest.“This led to years of legal disputes, including before the Federal Constitutional Court and an international court of arbitration, which can now be settled,” read a government statement on Friday.Vattenfall will receive 1.43 billion euros, while RWE will get 880 million euros to compensate for residual electricity that the utilities won’t be able to generate. EnBW will receive 80 million euros and E.ON 42.5 million euros to compensate for investments.As part of the overall agreement, the companies withdrew all pending legal proceedings and waived any legal claims contesting the deal.“We welcome the agreement we are seeking, which will now put an end to many years of costly and time-consuming disputes over the German nuclear phase-out,” read a Vattenfall statement.The Swedish company won a top court ruling in November, arguing Germany failed to implement a 2016 decision that gave utilities the right to seek compensation following the country’s decision to close nuclear power plants.“It is an important step toward creating legal certainty for all parties involved,” read an RWE statement, adding that the deal strengthens confidence in Germany so that it can attract “the considerable investments that must now be made in the restructuring of the energy system.”Japan will commemorate the Fukushima Dai-Ichi disaster next week. More than 160,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding the nuclear plant after a magnitude 9 earthquake, the biggest ever recorded to hit Japan, caused a massive tsunami that overwhelmed the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-compensates-utilities-2-9-billion-for-nuclear-exit-101614945975193.html
05-03-2021||World||Afghan suspected of stabbing 7 held in custody in Sweden||A 22-year-old Afghan man who is suspected of having stabbed seven men in a town in southern Sweden, leaving three of them in critical condition, was remanded in pretrial custody for at least two weeks on Friday.The Eksjo District Court added that there was a flight risk, Swedish broadcaster SVT said. The suspect, who was not identified under Swedish rules and who faces seven counts of attempted murder, denied any wrongdoing.“I have done nothing. I was at home," the suspected shouted at the beginning of the custody hearing and banged his fist on the table, Swedish media reported.The man, who has Afghan citizenship, was described by Swedish media as an asylum-seeker whose residence permit had expired last year. Local news reports also have said the man had a history of mental health issues. He is known to police for petty crimes.On Friday, he entered the court room limping after having being shot in the leg by police Wednesday, some 20 minutes after the first calls of an ongoing incident in the small town of Vetlanda, 190 kilometers (118 miles) southeast of Goteborg, Sweden’s second-largest city. Officers who arrested him found a knife in his possession.Police say there are five crime scenes in the town of 13,000. It appeared that the seven male victims were picked at random. All are stable, according to hospital officials.At first, police floated the idea that the preliminary investigation could be considered terror-related, but later changed it to attempted murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-suspected-of-stabbing-7-held-in-custody-in-sweden-101614941199961.html
05-03-2021||World||France backs Italy’s call to stop exports of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines||France came out in support of Italy’s decision to halt a shipment of AstraZeneca Plc’s coronavirus shots to Australia as tensions escalate over global supplies of the vaccines.“Of course I understand Italy,” French Health Minister Olivier Veran said during an interview with RMC radio. “We could do the same thing.”The backing from a major European Union country comes after Australia called on the European Commission to take a look at Italy’s actions. The EU has struggled to distribute shots to its population, and sparred with the Anglo-Swedish drug company over production delays.“Australia has raised the issue with the European Commission through multiple channels,” Greg Hunt, Australia’s health minister, told reporters. “We have asked the European Commission to review this decision.”Italy informed the commission that it would withhold the vaccine shipment, using a new rule that obliges member states to inform the EU executive when it decides to stop doses being exported outside of the bloc. The commission didn’t oppose Italy’s decision, an EU official said. The company declined to comment.The EU’s top trade official, Valdis Dombrovskis, spoke with his Australian counterpart on Friday, according to EU officials familiar with the discussion. They asked not to be identified because the talks were private.Tougher ApproachThe Italian foreign ministry said the decision involving 250,700 doses was a consequence of continued vaccine scarcity in Europe and Italy, and took into account AstraZeneca supply delays. It also said Australia was considered a “non-vulnerable” country.During an EU summit last week, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called for a tougher approach against companies that don’t respect their delivery commitments.The impact is likely to be largely symbolic given that the number of the vaccines blocked is relatively small compared to the company’s expected deliveries in the EU and elsewhere. But the move highlights Draghi’s intention to be tougher on pharmaceutical companies that don’t respect their commitments to the EU, and could encourage retaliatory protectionist measures by other governments.In January, the commission introduced legislation that allows curbs on exports of coronavirus vaccines if drugmakers fail to meet delivery targets within the bloc. The rules came into force after AstraZeneca had informed the EU that it was unable to meet its commitments under an advance purchase agreement.Damaging ProtectionismItaly is the first country so far to block the export of vaccines outside the EU, while over 170 requests have so far been authorized, according to a separate EU diplomat.The decision could reignite concerns echoed by many including the World Health Organization that the EU is engaging in damaging protectionism, at a time when countries around the world race to immunize their populations amid growing concerns over fast-spreading coronavirus variants.Asked by a reporter in Sydney on Friday whether he blamed Italian authorities for the block, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: “They’re certainly responsible for exercising the veto right they had through the EU process about those supplies coming to Australia.”“It’s important contracts are honored,” Morrison said.The export controls may also prove to be a growing headache for drugmakers with so many manufacturing sites in the EU. Most companies at the forefront of the vaccine effort have production capacity in the bloc that is used to serve countries beyond it, or must be sent outside for completion before returning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-backs-italy-s-call-to-stop-exports-of-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccines-101614942221906.html
05-03-2021||World||Pak election commission meets to discuss Imran Khan's allegations||Pakistan's election commission has convened a crucial meeting on Friday after Prime Minister Imran Khan accused it of discrediting democracy and damaging the morality of the nation, according to media reports.Prime Minister Khan, in a televised address to the country on Thursday, lashed out at the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) which he said failed to stop corruption in Wednesday's closely-contested Senate elections."You (ECP) discredited democracy…you damaged the morality of the nation by doing nothing to stop vote-buying," he alleged."You allowed corruption to occur at the top, and this happened right before you, and you knew it would happen. I kept saying that markets have opened and there is an auction going on. And when the Supreme Court gave you a chance, what reason was there to not bar code a mere 1,500 ballots?" Khan said.Khan's criticism of the ECP came after Opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) candidate and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani defeated ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on Wednesday, in a major blow to the Prime Minister who personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague.According to a report in the Geo TV, ECP convened the meeting to review the statements of Prime Minister Khan, who had levelled serious allegations on its role during the Senate polls. All members of the ECP will attend the meeting.Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja summoned the meeting after the ECP members asked him for the same to discuss the highly objectionable comments made by Prime Minister Khan, the Dawn newspaper reported.“The government should amend the Constitution, if it wants open voting for Senate elections, but should not expect from the Comm­ission to do the job of legislature,” a senior official of the ECP was quoted as saying in the report.Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the Senate elections would be held through a secret ballot, amid a raging controversy among the government and Opposition parties about allowing an open vote to avoid corruption.According to the official, the ECP is bound to follow the law which provides for a secret ballot and any hasty attempt to make the votes traceable would have been a violation of the Constitution, the report said.The official said that the prime minister instead of taking note of the uncalled for remarks made by members of his Cabinet chose to join the blame game, it said.Under mounting pressure from the Opposition to resign, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that he will seek a vote of confidence on Saturday, in a bid to restore the legitimacy of his government after an embarrassing defeat of the finance minister in the hotly-contested Senate elections.He also accused the grand Opposition alliance for "making a mockery of democracy" and said that he will never let the corrupt politicians off the hook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-election-commission-meets-to-discuss-imran-khan-s-allegations-101614942633543.html
05-03-2021||World||China to cut carbon emissions per economic unit of output by 18% in five years||China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, announced generally moderate new energy and climate targets on Friday that give little sign that it will step up its pace in combatting climate change.On a smoggy day in Beijing, Premier Li Keqiang said the country will reduce carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 18% over the next five years. He was speaking at the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, China's ceremonial legislature, that began Friday.The meeting is China's highest-profile political event of the year, where the ruling Communist Party unveils new policies and legislation.The 18% target is the same as in the previous five-year economic plan. The country uses carbon emissions per unit of economic output, or carbon intensity, instead of absolute emission reduction targets.“We were very keen to see what the 14th five-year plan would say about how to actually get there, or maybe even more ambitious targets,” said Dimitri de Boer, chief representative of ClientEarth, an environmental law charity. “What we’ve seen of the actual plan is that there is a target on reducing carbon intensity by 2025 but we can’t tell what exactly that means in total emissions.”In September, President Xi Jinping announced that China would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, and a peak in emissions by 2030. The carbon neutrality announcement led many to expect there would be sharper targets.Government planners offered a few more specifics in a summary of the new five-year plan. It sets a target for non-fossil energy to account for 20% of total energy consumption by 2025, which will require further investment in solar and wind energy. It did not mention any ban on new coal projects, which experts say would be a significant step.China obtains 60% of its power from coal and is the world’s biggest source of climate-changing industrial pollution. As a result, its carbon intensity is higher than any other country.Climate change experts say the new plan does not include indicators previously given by the government, such as a 5-year GDP target, which would set more concrete limits since carbon intensity is calculated using GDP.Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki, said the lack of such concrete numbers could be good because it could offer the government more flexibility in pursuing green policies.Many are waiting to see whether the government will unveil more detailed regulations on carbon-intense industries such as steel and cement manufacturing later this year.Although the new target continues the same pace as the previous five-year plan, experts say achieving it will be harder given earlier gains.The country achieved a 18.6% reduction in the last five-year period.“It should be more challenging than in the last five years because you are doing better … the marginal cost will be higher," said Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China, a charity dedicated to sustainable economic development.Whether China will pick up its pace remains to be seen.“This is very gradual progress at best,” said Myllyvirta. “It’s much more of continuing business as usual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-cut-carbon-emissions-per-economic-unit-of-output-by-18-in-five-years-101614943310859.html
05-03-2021||World||Africa welcomes Covax doses but warns against 'selfishness'||Urgent calls for Covid-19 vaccine fairness rang through African countries on Friday as more welcomed or rolled out doses from the global COVAX initiative, with officials acutely aware their continent needs much more.“Rich countries should not be so selfish,” Pontiano Kaleebu, head of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, said as his country prepared to receive its first doses. “It’s a concern, and everyone is talking about it.”The East African nation of 45 million people was seeing the arrival of under 1 million vaccine doses — 864,000. It’s the first batch of a total of 18 million COVAX doses for Uganda, but when all will arrive is not known.That number is “not going to do much,” said Monica Musenero, an epidemiologist and presidential adviser, though she added that “we can advocate for more vaccines, but we should also appreciate what we’ve got.”She urged Africa’s 54 countries to devote more resources, however limited, to secure more doses: “As a bloc we should organize ourselves ... instead of sitting there to cry.”The foundation of Nobel Peace Prize winner and former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu and his wife, Leah, on Friday issued a statement saying that “more must be done, immediately, to ensure lower-income countries have faster access to Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostic tools and treatments.” It noted that a small number of rich countries hold the majority of vaccine doses.“This is not a time for selfishness,” the statement said, and it noted growing calls for a waiver of intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines to allow for faster, wider production — a proposal opposed by the European Union and countries including the United States, Britain and Canada.While the COVAX initiative was created to ensure that low- and middle-income countries receive Covid-19 vaccines, it has faced delays and limited supply.Even as the World Health Organization’s Africa chief, Matshidiso Moeti, on Thursday noted that almost 10 million COVAX doses had been delivered to 11 African countries, she could not resist adding, “finally.”She added, “we expect about half of African countries will receive COVAX deliveries in the coming week and that most countries will have vaccination programs under way by end of March.”The goal is that countries will be able to vaccinate 20% of their population with the COVAX doses by the end of this year — far from the goal of 60% or more to achieve so-called “herd immunity” when enough people are protected through infection or vaccination to make it difficult for a virus to continue to spread.“You expect that at this point we should be getting the initial 9 million doses from COVAX” instead of less than 1 million, said Misaki Wayengera, head of a technical committee advising Uganda’s response. He worries that delays in vaccine procurement mean several months could pass before some people receive the second required shot.Uganda aims to vaccinate 20% of its population with doses from COVAX, with 40% vaccinated via government and private-sector funding.The COVAX delays have pushed other African countries to seek more doses elsewhere, including via bilateral deals that can be unfavorable.Uganda has announced plans to buy 18 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India, but the country faces cash shortages.And it is not clear how much the doses will cost. Some critics have been appalled by lower-income countries paying more per Covid-19 vaccine dose than rich ones.One WHO official in Africa, Richard Mihigo, on Thursday discouraged African countries from bilateral deals because of the risk of paying a high price. The African Union instead is pursuing bulk deals for the continent, but that also has faced delays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-welcomes-covax-doses-but-warns-against-selfishness-101614943010223.html

All you need to know||YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki said former US president Donald Trump’s channel on the online video-sharing platform will be restored only when the risk of violence decreases. Trump was banned from multiple online platforms, including YouTube, in the aftermath of the Capitol riots on January 6 as he continued amplifying the claims of widespread electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election.Speaking to Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, Wojcicki said that several videos uploaded on YouTube by Donald Trump’s channel were in violation of the company’s incitement-to-violence policy. “As a result, we removed those videos very quickly. And when we see a violation of our policy, we suspend the channel for seven days. So that is standard procedure about how our strike system works. And again, it works that way for everyone,” she told Frederick Kempe, president and CEO of Atlantic Council.The top executive of Alphabet Inc’s unit further stated that YouTube will restore Trump’s channel after the company sees reduced law enforcement in all state capitols in the US. Notably, security around the US Capitol has been tightened after intelligence found a possible plot of an attack on the complex by a militia group. Citing the company’s policy, Wojcicki said that Trump’s YouTube channel will remain subject to a “three-strikes” system.Read | Threats to lawmakers spur request for more National Guard helpWhat is the ‘three-strikes’ system?If the content of someone’s channel violates the Community Guidelines, YouTube removes the content and issues a strike to the channel. The channel’s owner gets a notification on their mobile phone, computer and channel settings, along with the reason for the removal and what could be done next. After getting the first strike, the user cannot upload videos, live streams, or stories on the channel for at least a week. In case the user gets a second strike within the same 90-day period as the first strike, the individual cannot upload content for another two weeks.“If there are no further issues, full privileges will be restored automatically after the 2-week period, but each strike will not expire until 90 days from the time it was issued,” reads the Community Guidelines on strike system.A third strike in the same 90-day period will lead to the permanent removal of that channel from YouTube. According to the company, each strike doesn’t expire until 90 days from the time it was issued and mere deletion of the content doesn’t mean the removal of a strike. Wojcicki stressed that the three-strikes system applies to everyone and no one has the privilege of exception.“We have had that system since the very beginning of YouTube. And those three strikes, they apply to everybody. So there are no exceptions. Politicians aren’t excepted. Famous people aren’t excepted. CEOs aren’t excepted. Everybody follows the same rules,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-youtube-three-strikes-system-trump-channel-will-remain-subject-to-101614940700074.html
05-03-2021||World||Pope Francis lands in Iraq on first-ever papal visit to rally Christians||Pope Francis arrived in Iraq on Friday to urge the country’s dwindling number of Christians to stay put and help rebuild the country after years of war and persecution, brushing aside the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns to make his first-ever papal visit.Iraqis were keen to welcome him and the global attention his visit will bring, with banners and posters hanging high in central Baghdad, and billboards depicting Francis with the slogan “We are all Brothers” decorating the main thoroughfare. In central Tahrir square, a mock tree was erected emblazoned with the Vatican emblem, while Iraqi and Vatican flags lined empty streets.Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said Iraqis were eager to welcome Francis’ “message of peace and tolerance” and described the visit as a historic meeting between the “minaret and the bells.” Among the highlights of the three-day visit is Francis' private meeting Saturday with the country's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a revered figure in Iraq and beyond.Francis' plane touched down at Baghdad's airport just before 2 p.m. local time (1100 GMT).The government is eager to show off the relative security it has achieved after years of wars and militant attacks that nevertheless continue even today. Francis and the Vatican delegation are relying on Iraqi security forces to protect them, including with the expected first use of an armored car for the popemobile-loving pontiff.Tahsin al-Khafaji, spokesman for Iraq's joint operations, said security forces had been increased.“This visit is really important to us and provides a good perspective of Iraq because the whole world will be watching,” he said. The high stakes will give Iraqi forces “motivation to achieve this visit with safety and peace.”Francis is breaking his year-long Covid-19 lockdown to refocus the world’s attention on a largely neglected people whose northern Christian communities, which date from the time of Christ, were largely emptied during the violent Islamic State reign from 2014-2017.For the pope, who has often traveled to places where Christians are a persecuted minority, Iraq's beleaguered Christians are the epitome of the “martyred church" that he has admired ever since he was a young Jesuit seeking to be a missionary in Asia.In Iraq, Francis is seeking to not only honor its martyrs but deliver a message of reconciliation and fraternity. The few Christians who remain in Iraq harbor a lingering mistrust of their Muslim neighbors and face structural discrimination long predating both IS and the 2003 US-led invasion that plunged the country into chaos.“The Pope’s visit is to support the Christians in Iraq to stay, and to say that they are not forgotten,” the Chaldean patriarch, Cardinal Luis Sako, told reporters in Baghdad this week. The aim of Francis’ visit, he said, is to encourage them to “hold onto hope.”The visit comes as Iraq is seeing a new spike in coronavirus infections, with most new cases traced to the highly contagious variant first identified in Britain. The 84-year-old pope, the Vatican delegation and travelling media have been vaccinated; most Iraqis have not.Ahead of the pope’s arrival Friday, dozens of men, women and children gathered in a Baghdad church, many not wearing masks or observing social distancing, before boarding buses to the airport to welcome the pontiff.The Vatican and Iraqi authorities have downplayed the threat of the virus and insisted that social distancing, crowd control and other health care measures will be enforced. The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, said this week the important thing is for Iraqis to know that the pope came to Iraq as an “act of love.”“I come among you as a pilgrim of peace, to repeat ‘you are all brothers,’” Francis said in a video-message to the Iraqi people on the eve of his visit. “I come as a pilgrim of peace in search of fraternity, animated by the desire to pray together and walk together, also with brothers and sisters of other religious traditions.”Christians once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq but their numbers began dwindling after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. They fell further when IS militants in 2014 swept through traditionally Christian towns across the Nineveh plains. Their extremist brand of Islam forced residents to flee to the neighboring Kurdish region or further afield.Few have returned, and those who have found their homes and churches destroyed.Returnees have had to contend with more struggles. Many cannot find work and blame discriminatory practices in the public sector, Iraq's largest employer. Since 2003, public jobs have been mostly controlled by majority Shiite political elites, leaving Christians feeling marginalized.While hard numbers are hard to come by, there were an estimated 1.4 million Christians in Iraq in 2003. Today the number is believed to be around 250,000.During his visit, Francis will pray in the Baghdad church that was the site of one of the worst massacres of Christians, the 2010 attack by Islamic militants that left 58 people dead. He will honor the dead in a Mosul square surrounded by shells of destroyed churches and meet with the small Christian community that returned to Qaraqosh. He will bless their church, which was used as a firing range by IS.The Vatican and the pope have frequently insisted on the need to preserve Iraq’s ancient Christian communities and create the security, economic and social conditions for those who have left to return. But that hasn’t necessarily translated into reality.“I am the only priest in Mosul. Every Sunday I hold mass at 9 a.m., and only around 70 people attend," said the Rev. Raed Adil Kelo, parish priest of the Church of the Annunciation in the onetime de-facto IS capital.Before 2003, the Christian population was 50,000, he said. It had dwindled to 2,000 before IS overran northern Iraq.He doesn't expect more to return, but he said Francis' visit would have immeasurable importance for those who stayed.“This visit will bring peace to Iraq” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-lands-in-iraq-on-first-ever-papal-visit-to-rally-christians-101614942295967.html
05-03-2021||World||China plans expansion in Arctic region with push for building 'Polar Silk Road'||As the ice-covered parts of the Arctic Ocean melt due to climate change, China has flagged its interest to take part in building "Polar Silk Road", raising prospects for the emergence of a new sea route.China will participate in the pragmatic cooperation on the Arctic and the building of a "Polar Silk Road," the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the draft outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and the long-range objectives to the year 2035.Both the plans were submitted to China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s Parliament which began its annual session here on Friday.Connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) will cut across the centre of the Arctic Ocean, passing close to the North Pole.While it could significantly reduce distances for global trade, it remains frozen over for most of the year, making it much harder to traverse than the two Arctic shipping routes currently available – the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted a research paper earlier."To the best of our knowledge, China is the only country to have led official expeditions of all three Arctic shipping passages, including the TSR,” the research team, led by Dr Mia Bennett from the University of Hong Kong, wrote in the paper.China has made clear its intention to expand in the Arctic region and published a white paper on this in early 2018 calling for its transformation into a “Polar Silk Road” and highlighting its plans to integrate with its multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).China unveiled the BRI in 2013 with an aim to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes.India has been severely critical of the BRI, the pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping, as the USD 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of the BRI, passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plans-expansion-in-arctic-region-with-push-for-building-polar-silk-road-101614940526593.html
05-03-2021||World||US, UK weigh Russia sanctions over use of chemical weapons, possibly target debt||The US and UK are weighing additional penalties against Russia over the use of chemical weapons, with options ranging from sanctions against oligarchs to the extreme step of targeting the nation’s sovereign debt, according to people familiar with the matter.British officials plan to push for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to continue to pressure Russia to provide answers over its use of banned substances, and will raise potential measures with key European allies, including France and Germany, in the coming weeks, according to one of the people.The Biden administration announced its first sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, punishing the Kremlin for the poisoning and jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The penalties mirrored those imposed by the European Union and the U.K., mainly targeting senior Russian law enforcement officials and others allied with President Vladimir Putin.Russian bonds snapped a four-day rally, lifting the yield 11 basis points to 6.68% as of 12:21 p.m. in Moscow. Buoyed by climbing oil prices, the ruble was 0.3% stronger at 74.46 per dollar after slipping 1% on Thursday.The U.S. is expected to closely adhere to a 1991 chemical weapons law and follow-up with a second, more extensive round of sanctions unless Russia meets certain conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. Those include assurances it will refrain from the use of such weapons and allow inspections of suspected chemical weapons sites.The penalties were the latest sign of deepening tensions between Washington and Moscow, and the relationship could deteriorate further if Russia retaliates or the U.S. escalates its sanctions.All of the people spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of the matter. Communications aides at the White House National Security Council and the U.K. Foreign Office had no immediate comment Thursday.British officials are in discussions with U.S. counterparts about new measures. One trigger for additional steps would be if Russia continues to stonewall an investigation into Navalny’s poisoning, one person said.U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday urged Russia to adhere to its obligations under international law.“These attacks are unacceptable. We urge Russia to investigate, adhere to its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention,” Raab tweeted.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a similar message Thursday.The U.S. could increase pressure on Russia with sanctions on oligarchs with powers under the Magnitsky Act, which authorizes the president to sanction individuals for human rights violations or corruption, the people said.But if Russia is again found to commit a major transgression of the international ban on chemical weapons, President Joe Biden would consider imposing sanctions on the nation’s sovereign debt if it could be done in cooperation with Europe, two of the people said.The Treasury Department under former Secretary Steven Mnuchin in 2018 warned of global financial market turmoil if Russia’s sovereign debt market were sanctioned, saying it could destabilize markets because of how deeply tied the Russian market is to global indexes.But others say that Russia has moved away from buying U.S.-denominated debt toward the euro, meaning that negative spillovers could be smaller than previously anticipated. That view is shared by Daleep Singh, a former Obama-era Treasury official, who is now a deputy on Biden’s National Security Council.In 2019, as a witness during a congressional hearing on Russia, Singh supported restricting purchases of Russian sovereign debt to protect U.S. national security interests. At the time, he said that damage to global markets resulting from prohibiting purchases of Russian debt would not be as significant because global investors have reduced their overall exposure to the nation since the Obama administration started sanctioning Russia in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-weigh-russia-sanctions-over-use-of-chemical-weapons-possibly-target-debt-101614938906418.html
05-03-2021||World||World no closer to answer on Covid-19 origins despite WHO probe: Expert||Despite a high-profile visit to China by a team of international experts in January, the world is no closer to knowing the origins of Covid-19, according to one of the authors of an open letter calling for a new investigation into the pandemic."At this point we are no further advanced than we were a year ago," said Nikolai Petrovsky, an expert in vaccines at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and one of 26 global experts who signed the open letter, published on Thursday.In January, a team of scientists picked by the World Health Organization (WHO) visited hospitals and research institutes in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was identified, in search of clues about the origins of Covid-19.But the mission has come under fire, with critics accusing the WHO of relying too much on politically compromised Chinese fieldwork and data.Team members also said China was reluctant to share vital data that could show Covid-19 was circulating months earlier than first recognised.The open letter said the WHO mission "did not have the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation" into all theories about the origins of Covid-19."All possibilities remain on the table and I have yet to see a single piece of independent scientific data that rules out any of them," said Petrovsky.At a press briefing to mark the end of the WHO visit to Wuhan, mission head Peter Ben Embarek appeared to rule out the possibility that the virus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.But Petrovsky said it "doesn't make any sense" to rule any possibility out, and said the aim of the open letter was "to get an acknowledgement globally that no one has yet identified the source of the virus and we need to keep searching.""We need an open mind and if we close down some avenues because they are considered too sensitive, that is not how science operates," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-no-closer-to-answer-on-covid-19-origins-despite-who-probe-expert-101614937107235.html

He said Pakistan was relying on international donors and friendly countries like China.The NHS secretary informed the PAC that Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm had committed to providing one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, saying that 0.5 million doses had been handed over to Pakistan, out of which around 275,000 doses had been administered to health professionals dealing with Covid-19 patients.He said the second phase would cover the health officials working in other hospitals and health facilities, adding that the people aged 65 years and above could also register themselves for vaccination.He said Pakistan has planned to vaccinate 70 million people this year.According to the NHS secretary, Pakistan will also get 16 million free doses of India-made Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine through Gavi that would give cover to 20 per cent of the population of Pakistan.The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) is a public-private global health partnership with the goal of increasing access to immunisation in poor countries.In response to a question by PAC Chairman Rana Tanveer Hussain, the NHS secretary said Pakistan would get the first batch of AstraZeneca vaccine made by Serum Institute of India by the middle of March and the rest was expected to arrive in the country by June.According to him, vaccination to the aged people was due to start by March 5; however, the consignment was delayed.He said that another Chinese company had conducted the phase-three trial of Cansino vaccine in Pakistan, adding that total 18,000 people were inoculated and the vaccine’s efficacy stood at 85 per cent.According to the NHS secretary, the ministry had conducted a survey in June 2020 to ascertain the figures of those who have developed antibodies against coronavirus. He said the survey disclosed that around 15 per cent of the population has developed antibodies and that they did not need to be immunised.The PAC chairman pointed out that some people had some reservations over side effects of the vaccine and suggested that the top leadership of the country should get inoculated first to remove doubts in the general public’s mind.In response to a question by Hina Rabbani Khar, the NHS secretary said that despite the government's offer to the private sector to buy the vaccine, no serious buyers had so far come forward.According to him, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan has so far received applications only from three companies for the import of vaccines, but their applications have been rejected because they did not give any detail and specification of the vaccines they intended to import.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases in the country has gone up by around 30 per cent since the announcement of relaxation in restrictions, the report said.The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), a representative body of health professionals, has urged the government to immediately impose the restrictions to avoid chances of a third wave of the virus.The Nat­ional Command and Ope­ration Centre (NCOC) data showed that there were 1,176 cases on February 27 and 1,163 on March 1, but the number suddenly surged to 1,388 on March 2 and reached 1,519 on Thursday.Pakistan reported 52 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours as the number of positive cases surged to 587,014. The nationwide tally of fatalities jumped to 13,128 on Friday.According to the latest figures by the National Command and Operation Center (NCOC), 1,579 persons tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-government-not-planning-to-buy-covid-19-vaccines-to-rely-on-herd-immunity-donated-jabs-says-official-101614935759751.html

Although the country’s economic growth was below its recent annual target, a focus on heavy industry and property construction drove the increase in emissions. Output from the industry and construction sector increased by 2.8%, steel by 7% and cement and coal mining by 2.5% and 1.4% last year, the report said.While the emissions growth was below the 3.3% average rate in the past decade, it raises concern about the nation’s ability to meet its 2060 carbon neutrality pledge, Rhodium said.“If 2020 is any indication, it will require a significant departure from the status quo for China to shift away from its current fossil-heavy growth path,” the report said. “There will be increasing scrutiny on China’s plans for the coming decade to ensure that emissions peak as soon as possible.”The world’s biggest emitter began its week-long National People’s Congress on Friday, announcing major green targets for its 14th Five Year Plan covering the period 2021 to 2025. In the plan, the first strategic blueprint since last September when Xi Jinping announced the net-zero emission goal, China outlined modest short-term climate goals. The country plans to reduce carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 18% by 2025, the same level it targeted in the previous five-year plan. And a new target to reduce energy use per unit of GDP by 13.5% is lower than the 15% goal in its 13th Five Year Plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-emissions-grew-1-7-in-2020-only-major-economy-to-see-increase-in-pandemic-year-report-101614935312967.html

05-03-2021||World||Pope Francis departs Rome for risky, historic Iraq tour||Pope Francis left Rome on Friday to start a four-day trip to Iraq, his most risky foreign trip since his election in 2012 and the first visit by a pontiff to the country.An Alitalia airplane carrying the 84-year-old pope, his entourage, a security detail, and about 75 journalists, left Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport for the 4-1/2-hour flight to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.Iraq is deploying thousands of additional security personnel to protect Francis during the visit, which comes after a spate of rocket and suicide bomb attacks raised fears for his safety.The flags of Iraq and the Vatican City fluttered outside Baghdad airport in anticipation of his arrival.Francis's whirlwind tour will cover four cities in the north and south of the country, taking him by plane, helicopter and possibly armoured car to areas that most foreign dignitaries are unable to reach, let alone in such a short space of time.He will say Mass at a Baghdad church, meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric in the southern city of Najaf and travel north to Mosul, where the army had to empty the streets for security reasons last year for a visit by Iraq's prime minister.Mosul is a former Islamic State stronghold, and churches and other buildings there still bear the strains of conflict.Since the defeat of the Islamic State militants in 2017, Iraq has seen a greater degree of security, though violence persists, often in the form of rocket attacks by Iran-aligned militias on US targets, and US military action in response.On Wednesday morning, 10 rockets landed on an airbase that hosts U.S., coalition and Iraqi forces. Hours after that attack, the pope reaffirmed he would be going to Iraq.Islamic State also remains a threat. In January, a suicide attack claimed by the Sunni militant group killed 32 people in Baghdad's deadliest such attack for years.VIOLENCE AND HOPEFrancis will meet clergy at a Baghdad church where Islamist gunmen killed more than 50 worshippers in 2010. Violence against minority groups in Iraq, especially when a third of the country was being run by Islamic State, has reduced its ancient Christian community to a fifth of its once 1.5 million people.The pontiff will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham, who is revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews, and meet Iraq's revered top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, 90-year-old Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.The meeting with Sistani, who wields great influence over Iraqi politics and its Shi'ite majority, will be the first by a pope.Some Shi'ite militant groups have opposed the pope's visit, framing it as Western interference in Iraq's affairs. But many Iraqis hope that it can help foster a fresh view of Iraq."It might not change much on the ground, but at least if the pope visits, people will see our country in a different light, not just bombs and war," said Ali Hassan, a 30-year-old Baghdad resident picking up relatives at the airport.The trip is the pope's 33rd outside Italy. He is due to return to Rome on Monday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-departs-rome-for-risky-historic-iraq-tour-101614933948046.html
05-03-2021||World||Situation on ground in Myanmar 'troubling': White House||The White House has said that the situation on the ground in Myanmar is "troubling" and the Biden administration has been working closely with its partners in the region.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Thursday that the Biden administration has taken sanction steps to send a clear message that the coup in Myanmar is unacceptable.“The situation on the ground in Burma is troubling,” she said.The Biden administration has been working closely with its partners in the region, Psaki said.At a separate news conference, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the US is deeply saddened by reports that security forces in Myanmar killed as many as 24 people on March 3.“We strongly condemn the use of violence by Burmese (Myanmarese) security forces against the Burmese people, including peaceful protesters, journalists and civil society. We continue to urge the Burmese military to exercise maximum restraint,” he said.“This latest escalation in violence demonstrates the fact of the junta's complete disregard for their own people, for the people of Burma. It is unacceptable, and the world will continue to respond. The United States will continue to respond; we'll continue to respond in tandem with our partners and allies around the world,” Price said.Tens of thousands of people in Myanmar have courageously taken to the streets peacefully to show the strength of their will and the power of their collective voice, he said.The United States has sought, again with its partners and allies, to amplify the power of their collective voice, Price said.“We call on the military to act peacefully and with respect for human rights, including the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. These are two universal rights that are as applicable in Burma as they are anywhere else,” he said.The United States will continue to work with the international community to take meaningful action against those responsible. There will be additional action on the part of the US, he said.“We support freedom of peaceful assembly, including to protest peacefully in support of the restoration of the democratically elected government,” Price said.Deeply concerned about the increasing attacks on and arrests of journalists, the spokesperson said, calling on the military to immediately release these individuals and to cease their intimidation and harassment of the media and others who are unjustly detained for doing nothing more than their job, for doing nothing more than exercising their universal rights.Responding to a question, Price said that the US has urged China to play a constructive role, to use their influence with the military in Myanmar to bring this coup to an end.The US, he said, has taken a number of actions against the military junta, against the military leaders and military entities responsible for the coup and for related violence, including visa restrictions and asset blocking sanctions.“We will continue and expand our efforts to promote accountability for the military’s actions, including the detention of these journalists and the heinous violence that we've seen in Burma in recent days,” Price added.Myanmar's military last month took control of the country for one year and detained top political figures, including Aung San Suu Kyi.The military accused Suu Kyi's government of not investigating allegations of voter fraud in recent elections. Suu Kyi's party swept that election while the military-backed party performed poorly. The poll officials have rejected the allegations.Many people have been reported killed after security personnel fired at protesters during demonstrations across the country against the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-on-ground-in-myanmar-troubling-white-house-101614933737648.html

Together we can shape a bright future of rejuvenation for our great nation."Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council responded by urging China to begin "benign" interactions with it to gradually resolve disagreements through communication, adding they would continue to defend Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy and freedom."Healthy and orderly exchanges are better than enforced pressure on Taiwan," it said.Most Taiwanese people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, and have also strongly supported anti-government protests in Chinese-run Hong Kong.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected by a landslide last year on a promise of defending the island's democracy and standing up to China.China believes Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for the Chinese government which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Beijing's control.Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-deter-taiwan-independence-seek-peaceful-ties-and-reunification-101614930619694.html

The monitor then combined the two lists to bring out a list of the 10 richest persons.The top 10 wealthiest NPC and CPPCC delegates are worth $391 billion in total, and their wealth grew at an average of 68% in the last one year.They have made their wealth from wide-ranging sources, including internet services, agriculture, green energy, property, consumer electronics, media and automobile, the Hurun report said.Ma Huateng, 50, of Tencent Holdings - owner of WeChat among the company’s massive internet services business - is the richest entrepreneur attending this year’s Two Sessions in Beijing.A member of the NPC, Ma’s personal wealth is $74bn, and year-on-year, it increased by over 94%, the tracker said.Also on the list are Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, NetEase’s Ding Lei, Baidu’s Li Yanhong, and Geely automobile’s Li Shufu.Separately, the top 10 richest NPC delegates are worth $261bn, and they saw their wealth increase at an average of 94% in the last year. The monitor said the top 10 richest CPPCC delegates are worth $273bn, and their wealth grew at an average of 56%.Combining the two figures puts the worth of the 20 richest entrepreneurs attending the Two Sessions, as the twin summits are called, at a staggering $534bn.“From the Hurun Global Rich List 2021 released last week, we can see how China’s entrepreneurs are booming. Today, there are officially 1,058 billionaires living in China, up by 259, significantly ahead of the 696 in the US,” Hurun Report’s chairperson and chief researcher Rupert Hoogewerf said.Beijing is officially the billionaire capital of the world for the sixth year running with 145 billionaires living in the city, while Shanghai overtook New York to second place with 113 billionaires, Hoogewerf said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-top-20-businessmen-cum-lawmakers-are-worth-a-staggering-534-billion-101614930775615.html

It was the third large quake recorded north of New Zealand in a matter of hours. The country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanic and seismic activity that rings the Pacific Ocean.People near the coast in northern areas of the North Island were ordered to move immediately to the nearest high ground or as far inland as possible, as strong currents and unpredictable surges near the shore were expected for several hours.A magnitude 7.1 quake off New Zealand’s east coast was widely felt around the North Island overnight. It was followed by a magnitude 7.4 near the Kermadecs that triggered a tsunami warning. That was later canceled, but the third, larger quake prompted a new warning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-says-tsunami-threat-has-eased-allows-thousands-to-return-home-101614930351306.html

Our people’s forces, with complete competence and fine conduct, safeguarded China’s national security and participated in epidemic control,” Li said in his work report.He also asserted that “absolute leadership” over the two million-strong PLA, the largest in the world, will be vested with the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and its “core leader” and President Xi Jinping who heads the all-powerful Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high command of the PLA.“This year, we will thoroughly implement Xi Jinping’s thinking on strengthening the armed forces and the military strategy for the new era, ensure the Party’s absolute leadership over the people’s armed forces, and strictly implement the system of ultimate responsibility resting with the chairman of the Central Military Commission.“We will, bearing in mind the goals set for the centenary of the People’s Liberation Army, continue to enhance the political loyalty of the armed forces, strengthen them through reform, science and technology and the training of capable personnel, and run them in accordance with the law,” he said.Li said to boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations, and enhance the military’s strategic capacity to protect the sovereignty, security and development interests of the country.“We will improve the layout of defence-related science, technology and industry, and enhance the defence mobilisation system.“We in government at all levels should vigorously support the development of national defence and the armed forces, and conduct extensive activities to promote mutual support between the civilians and the military, so as to forge an ever-closer bond between the people and the military in the new era,” the premier said.The increase of the defence budget, amid massive expansion of the military hardware, including building of more aircraft carriers in addition to the two newly-built ones, also comes amidst the increasing tensions between China and the US over Taiwan and the South China Sea (SCS) besides growing discord between the two over Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.Last year, a key conclave of the CPC had finalised plans to build a fully modern military on par with the United States by 2027, which is also the centenary year of the PLA.The PLA this year has also announced a 40 per cent increase in salaries to attract more talent.China is the second biggest spender of defence after the US.Defending the increase in defence budget, Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the NPC, told the media here that China's efforts to strengthen the national defence do not target or threaten any country.Whether a country poses a threat to others depends on what kind of defence policy it pursues, he said, adding that China is committed to the path of peaceful development and adheres to a defence policy that is defensive in nature.As the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, China's planned defence spending per capita in 2021 will be less than 1,000 yuan (USD 154), the Xinhua report said.China applies strict mechanisms of fiscal allocation and budget management on its defence expenditure, which is mainly assigned to personnel, training and sustainment, and equipment, it said.China has voluntarily downsized its armed forces by over four million troops since 1978, according to a white paper released in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hikes-defence-budget-to-209-bn-40-increase-in-army-renumeration-to-attract-more-talent-101614928177400.html

The election commission said the vote was fair, but the military has used media to make its case and justify the takeover.MRTV pages were banned by Facebook in February, while it had previously barred Myawaddy in 2018 when it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now the military ruler - and more than a dozen other senior officers and organisations on the platform.Facebook has now banned all pages linked to Myanmar’s army - and was itself banned by the junta in February.Other social media platforms are also grappling with how to moderate military content and a proliferation of hate speech and misinformation in Myanmar.Reuters reported on Thursday that Myanmar soldiers and police were using TikTok to deliver death threats to protesters.Researchers have said that after the Facebook ban the military was trying to build its presence on other platforms.YouTube had faced criticism from researchers and civil society groups for a comparatively hands-off approach during Myanmar's Nov. 8 vote.A Reuters review found dozens of channels hosted on YouTube that had promoted election misinformation while posing either as news outlets or political programmes.Google said in December it had terminated 34 YouTube channels following investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-removes-five-myanmar-television-channels-amid-unrest-101614927765495.html

The country's National Medical Products Administration announced that a special approval procedure was used for the products which "provide more options for Covid-19 treatment."In a statement, the agency said that the products originate from ancient Chinese prescriptions and come in granular form. They were first developed by the TCM remedies and later subjected to screening by many academics and experts on the front line.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe three products are -- lung-clearing and detoxing granules, dampness-resolving and detoxing granules, and lung-diffusing and detoxing granules. This approval comes even as the safety of TCMs is still debated in China.

The Kermadec islands region which is around 1,000km from New Zealand was hit by an 8.1 magnitude earthquake.Here is what had happened:> As per the US Geological Survey, the 8.1 magnitude earthquake near the Kermadec Islands, New Zealand was the result of reverse faulting in the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone. The location, depth and style of the faulting indicated its occurrence on or near the west-dipping subducting plate interface between the Pacific and Australia plates.> About 107 minutes prior to the 8.1-quake, a 7.4 magnitude quake had hit 50km west. The proximity and the timing of the 7.4 magnitude earthquake have indicated to be the foreshock of the largest earthquake. The US Geological Survey also said that in terms of seismic moment, the 8.1 magnitude earthquake was 11 times larger than the foreshocks.> A 7.3 oblique reverse faulting earthquake had also hit the country 6 hours prior to the 8.1-quake and 900km south to it. However, as per the US Geological Survey, the changes induced by this quake does not signify any relation with the 7.4-foreshocks or 8.1-earthquake.> The Pacific and Australian plates interaction is behind this one of the most seismically active tectonic atmospheres in the world.> As per the US Geological Survey, over 215 earthquakes greater than the magnitude of 6 have taken place within the 250km radius of the 8.1-quake that hit the Pacific region on Friday.Also Read | Indian-Americans ‘taking over’ US, says Biden on call with Nasa’s Swati Mohan> The Friday quake is considered to be the largest of the century as the previous earthquake with a magnitude of 8 had hit the area in January 1976, which occurred more than 10km to the north. The quake caused no casualties and no damage.> The National Emergency Management Agency had alerted the citizens to get out of their homes and reach a higher surface as a Tsunami warning was sounded.> Emergency Management minister Kiri Allan had asked the residents to evacuate and warned them that the danger can prevail throughout the afternoon.> The National Emergency Management Agency of New Zealand on March 5, 3:43pm (local time) cancelled the national advisory that was issued following the earthquake. It said that as per the GNS Science, the beach and marine threats have now passed for all areas based on ocean observation.> However, the agency has also said that strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges will continue for up to another 24 hours and people should remain vigilant. It asked people to take precautions with respect to beach and ocean activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-earthquakes-and-a-tsunami-warning-here-s-what-happened-in-new-zealand-101614926801070.html
05-03-2021||World||Xi Jinping goes mask-free at NPC, raising questions over vaccination status||It’s become a standard photo op of the pandemic: leaders rolling up their sleeves for Covid-19 shots to trumpet the advent of vaccines. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first, Joe Biden did it on live television, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s inoculation is being credited with reviving a lackluster rollout.But despite being one of the first countries in the world to authorize vaccines for use, China has said nothing about the vaccination status of its top leaders, who all -- including President Xi Jinping -- appeared without face masks in Beijing Friday, mingling with thousands of delegates from across China at the country’s biggest political gathering of the year.While officials seated in the rows behind them were all masked, Xi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang moved around the Great Hall of the People, where the National People’s Congress is opened every year, mask-free. The exception seemed to apply only to members of the Politburo and a handful of other top Communist Party leaders. Xi also went without a mask at last year’s NPC, seen as a statement on China’s virus success with the Wuhan outbreak largely quelled.Does Xi’s confidence come from China having all but eliminated Covid-19, or has he received one of the four shots now authorized for general use? Most of the delegates in the Great Hall were probably vaccinated, with state media reporting this week that more than 5,000 of those flocking to Beijing for the so-called twin sessions had been inoculated against the coronavirus.The mystery around Xi and other top leaders’ vaccination status comes as China struggles to ramp up its inoculation drive. The country pushed back by two months a plan to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in February, as concerns about supply and hesitancy around the efficacy and safety of locally-produced shots complicated efforts.While its outbreak is under control, China is way behind the US on vaccinating, according to Bloomberg’s global vaccine tracker. At the current pace it will be more than nine years before 75% of its vast population is immunized, versus six months for the US Government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said this week China plans to vaccinate 40% of its 1.4 billion citizens by the end of June, a mammoth undertaking given it’s only now at 3.5%.Even if they had been vaccinated, a political leader appearing in public without a mask in other parts of the world right now would likely trigger a public outcry. At Biden’s inauguration in January, the incoming president and other senior attendees, including the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court and former presidents, all wore masks through hours of festivities. Biden was vaccinated with the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shot on Dec. 21.US Vice President Kamala Harris, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Indonesia’s leader, Joko Widodo -- who received a Chinese vaccine by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. -- all got shots for the cameras as a way of encouraging people to get vaccinated. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam got the Sinovac shot at a public event in late February.In January, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had taken the vaccine, a revelation that had yet to be confirmed by authorities in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-goes-mask-free-at-npc-raising-questions-over-vaccination-status-101614926453419.html
05-03-2021||World||China to grow at more than 6% in 2021; defence outlay $200bn for the first time||China has set its annual economic growth rate for 2021 at above 6%, Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday, as the world’s second largest economy, battered last year by the Covid-19 pandemic, shows signs of rapid recovery.Last year, for the first time in decades, China didn’t forecast its gross domestic product (GDP) growth because of local and global economic uncertainties triggered by the pandemic.“As a general target, China’s growth rate has been set at over 6% for this year,” Li said in his 2021 work report, which he read out at the inaugural session of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.“In setting this target, we have taken into account the recovery of economic activity,” Li said.China’s GDP expanded 2.3% last year, the only major economy to see growth.Separately, China’s annual defence budget will maintain single-digit growth for a sixth consecutive year by increasing 6.8% in 2021, according to the draft budget report.For the first time, China’s official defence budget has crossed the $200 billion mark.“This year’s planned defence spending will be about 1.35 trillion yuan ($209 billion),” news agency Xinhua reported, adding that China’s defence budget is about one quarter of the US, which is $740.5 billion for the 2021 fiscal year.Last month, India increased its defence spending by about 1%; military spending increased to ₹3.47 trillion ($47.4 billion), up from ₹3.43 trillion in the previous financial year.India’s expenditure on defence remains less than a fourth of China’s as the two countries cautiously emerge from a nine-month-long military standoff in eastern Ladakh.Delivering the work report, Li said this year the government would strengthen the armed forces “through reform, science and technology and the training of capable personnel”.Premier Li said the government would “thoroughly implement Xi Jinping’s thinking on strengthening the armed forces and the military strategy for the new era, (and) ensure the party’s absolute leadership over the people’s armed forces.”“We will boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations, and enhance the military’s strategic capacity to protect the sovereignty, security and development interests of our country,” Li was quoted as saying in a translation of his remarks.“We will improve the layout of the defence-related science, technology and industry, and enhance the defence mobilisation system,” he said.He added that the country has drawn up the draft ‘Outline for the 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025) for Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035’.Li was quoted as saying by the state media that China had accomplished the major goals and tasks of the 13th financial year and made a giant stride towards the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.The country’s GDP increased from less than 70 trillion yuan ($10.8 trillion) to over 100 trillion yuan.“Its entire rural poor population, 55.75 million in number, was lifted out of extreme poverty. Over 60 million urban jobs were added, and the world’s largest social security system was established,” said Li.On self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims is a breakaway region, Li said Beijing remains committed “to promoting the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait and China’s reunification”.“We will remain highly vigilant against and resolutely deter any separatist activity seeking Taiwan independence,” Li said. “We will promote exchanges, cooperation and integrated development across the Taiwan Strait. Together, we can shape a bright future of rejuvenation for our great nation.”On Hong Kong, he said China will “resolutely guard against and deter” interference by external forces in the special administrative region’s affairs.He also said that China will ensure the implementation of law and enforcement mechanisms for Hong Kong to safeguard national security, while reaffirming China’s commitment to continue to “fully and faithfully” implement the “one country-two systems” mechanism.China will improve the systems and mechanisms related to implementing the constitution and the basic law in its special administrative regions, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-grow-at-more-than-6-in-2021-defence-outlay-200bn-for-the-first-time-101614921654807.html

Here is all you need to know about the wastage:• It is far more than previously suspected and environmentally, socially and economically costly.• If all the wasted food were packed into 40-ton container trucks parked end-to-end, they would circle the Earth seven times.• UN estimates nearly 700 million people go to bed hungry every night.• Up to now, food waste was seen as a rich world problem. • But the UN Environment Programme’s Sustainable Food Systems Programme’s report showed household food waste is a global problem.• Of the 121 kilos of consumer-level food thrown away each year for every person on the planet, more than half -- 74 kilos -- is disposed of by households.• The report covers three-quarters of humanity and 54 countries -- poor, middle-income and rich -- with good enough data to ensure robust findings.• It is also the first to focus exclusively on what happens to food at the consumer level, rather than food lost during production, storage, or distribution.• The resulting Food Waste Index is designed to help countries take the measure of the problem within their borders, which could also help curb global warming.Also Read | Vice President calls for national campaign to promote healthy lifestyle• If food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet.• Even as efforts to avoid food waste are scaled up, there remains the problem of what to do with whatever unused or unusable biowaste is left over.• The one place it should not go is landfills where it emits the powerful greenhouse gas methane and serves no productive purpose.• There are many alternatives to burying biowaste, including donating food that is still edible, processing it for animal feed, composting, and biogas production.• One technology already operating on an industrial scale in South Africa and elsewhere is the use of black soldier fly larvae to produce protein-rich animal feed.• Rich countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark have acted successfully on food waste.• Britain saw a 31% drop in household food waste over 12 years, excluding inedible matter.• Food waste issues will be addressed at the first-ever UN World Food Systems Summit in September or October.• The summit will provide an opportunity to launch new actions to tackle food waste globally.• One of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/17-of-total-food-available-globally-wasted-in-2019-here-s-what-the-un-said-101614920874897.html
05-03-2021||World||EU, Italy stop AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine exports to Australia||A shipment of more than a quarter million AstraZeneca vaccines destined for Australia has been blocked from leaving the European Union, in the first use of an export control system instituted by the bloc to make sure big pharma companies would respect their contracts.The move, affecting only a small number of vaccines, underscores a growing frustration within the 27-nation bloc about the slow rollout of its vaccine drive and the shortfall of promised vaccine deliveries, especially by Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca.The ban came at the behest of Italy, and the EU did not raise objections to the tougher line Rome has adopted in dealing with vaccine shortages in the bloc since a new government led by Mario Draghi came into power Feb 13.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday it had anticipated veto problems could arise in shipments from Europe, adding that Australia's inoculation schedule would continue as planned.“They are in an unbridled crisis situation. That is not the situation in Australia,” Morrison said. “But, nevertheless, we have been able to secure our supplies, and additional supplies for importation, both with Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which means we can continue the rollout of our program.”He said most significantly, Australia was also producing vaccines domestically, giving it sovereignty over its vaccination program.Italy's objections centered both on the general shortage of supplies in the EU and on “the delays in the supply of vaccines by AstraZeneca to the EU and Italy," a Foreign Ministry statement said.It said it also intervened because of the size of the shipment, more than 250,700 doses, that would go to Australia, which it did not consider a vulnerable nation.Italy said it had informed the company on Tuesday. AstraZeneca refused to comment. The Financial Times first reported on the issue late Thursday.Faced with shortages of doses during the early stages of the vaccine campaign that started in late December, the EU issued an export control system for Covid-19 vaccines in late January, forcing companies to respect their contractual obligations to the bloc before commercial exports can be approved.The EU has been specifically angry with AstraZeneca because it is delivering far fewer doses to the bloc than it had promised. Of the initial order for 80 million doses to the EU in the first quarter, the company will be struggling to deliver just half that quantity.There were rumors that the company was siphoning off from EU production plants to other nations, but CEO Pascal Soriot insisted that any shortfall was to be blamed on technical production issues only.The EU has vaccinated only 8% percent of its population compared to over 30%, for example, in the United Kingdom. Australia is still very much at the start of its vaccination drive.With such an action, the EU is caught in a bind. On the one hand, it is under intense pressure to ramp up the production of vaccines in the bloc while on the other hand it wants to remain an attractive hub for pharmaceutical giants and a fair trading partner to third countries.The EU thought it had made perfect preparations for the rollout of vaccinations, heavily funding research and production capacity over the past year. With its 450 million people, the EU has signed deals for six different vaccines. In total, it has ordered up to 400 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and sealed agreements with other companies for more than 2 billion shots.It says that despite the current difficulties it is still convinced it can vaccinate 70% of the adult population by the end of summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-italy-stop-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-exports-to-australia-101614919314615.html
05-03-2021||World||Indian-Americans ‘taking over’ US, says Biden on call with Nasa’s Swati Mohan||Indian-Americans are “taking over the country”, US President Joe Biden said lightheartedly during a congratulatory call with Nasa’s aerospace engineer Swati Mohan on Thursday.The Indian-American was the guidance and controls operations lead for the 2020 Mars mission and her voice was heard around the world from mission control at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California in the final minutes as the Perseverance rover landed on Mars on February 18.“Are you kidding me? What an honour this is,” Biden said when Mohan thanked him for the call.The US president added, “This is an incredible honour. And it’s amazing. Indian(s) - of descent - Americans are taking over the country. You, my vice-president, my speechwriter, Vinay. I tell you what.”Biden was referring to Nasa’s Mohan, US vice-president Kamala Harris and the director of the White House speechwriting team, Vinay Reddy, who has been with the American president for years now.Biden might have mentioned the names of a few more Indian-descent members of his administration - actually more than two dozen. Some of them are: Vivek Murthy, the nominee for surgeon general, a position popularly called America’s doctor; Neera Tanden, the nominee for budget chief, a cabinet post, before she pulled out; and Kiran Ahuja, the head of the civil service.Biden then invited Mohan to speak, promising to “be quiet” himself.“So, my path actually started way back when I was a child, watching my first episode of Star Trek,” Mohan said. “In addition to those fantastical scenes of space, what really captured my attention was this really close-knit team who was working together, manipulating this technological marvel with the sole purpose of exploring space and understanding new things and seeking new life.“You know, Perseverance is my first mission at JPL where I’ve gotten to work from the very beginning of formulation, all the way through operations, and it made me feel like I was part of that crew. Being able to work with this incredibly diverse, talented team that has become like a family, spending years creating our own technological marvel has been a privilege.“You know, those last days and weeks leading up to landing-day, it was pretty smooth, but we were all still really nervous and, frankly, terrified until we got through those final seven minutes. To be able to call ‘touchdown’ safely, to see those first images come back from Mars, to see the place where we have never been able to go to on Mars before and go there - reach there for the express purpose of seeking out new life just made it feel like I was living in a dream.“Now that the tremendous relief has passed for the team of being able to be there safely, all that’s left is the excitement and the thrill of all the scientific discoveries that are yet to come and what Perseverance can actually find - and hopefully find those signs of past life on Mars.”“Touchdown confirmed,” Mohan had said over the public announcement system on February 18 that was heard on live telecast around the world, as mission control JPL erupted in applause, with the personnel leaping to their feet.She had gone on to say, “Perseverance safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life.”With those words, Mohan became an overnight sensation.Mohan moved to the US with her parents when she was just one, and grew up in the Northern Virginia/ Washington, DC metro area. She graduated from Cornell University in mechanical and aerospace engineering and did her masters and PhD at MIT in aeronautics and astronautics.Biden said on the Nasa call, “What you did, you restored a dose of confidence in the American people. They were beginning to wonder about us. They were beginning to wonder, are we still the country we always believed we were? You guys did it.”Biden turned his attention to Mohan, without mentioning her, underscoring his focus on diversity. “One of the reasons why we’re such an incredible country is we’re such a diverse country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamericans-taking-over-us-says-biden-on-call-with-nasa-s-swati-mohan-101614919434491.html
05-03-2021||World||Threats to lawmakers spur request for more National Guard help||The head of U.S. Capitol Police on Thursday asked the Defense Department to extend the National Guard presence at the U.S. Capitol, according to a statement from the police force.About 5,000 National Guard troops still on deployment in Washington since the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol were set to return home by March 12. The Capitol Police cited a spike in threats against lawmakers during the first two months of this year in the request for continued support from the Guard.The Capitol Police statement said only that acting Chief Yogananda Pittman asked for the extension without giving a specific timeframe.A new emergency declaration would allow Guard personnel to remain at the Capitol for another two months, according to a person familiar with the request, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. The exact strength or footprint of the Guard during that time could change, but some presence will likely stay in place to allow for a quick response if needed, the person said.Tensions were heightened this week amid warnings of another planned attack on the Capitol Thursday by a right-wing militia group, which did not come to fruition. Nevertheless, the House canceled plans for votes and other events late Wednesday as a result of the threat, which was cited in alerts by the FBI, Homeland Security and Capitol Police. The Senate remained in session.Law enforcement officials from various federal agencies say there are continuing security threats to the Capitol building and lawmakers. In addition to the National Guard forces still deployed at the Capitol, a barrier of fencing and razor wire was established around the complex after a mob of former President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the building on Jan. 6.Robert Salesses, an acting assistant defense secretary, told two Senate committees on Wednesday that military officials do not yet know how long National Guard troops will stay at the Capitol. He said a meeting is planned next week on the subject.During a press conference on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said deployment decisions are up to security officials.But Pelosi added that there is now a draft report of an initial security review headed by retired Lieutenant General Russel Honoré of the Capitol Complex security in the wake of the January assault.Senator Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Rules Committee, said he has talked to Honoré about the recommendations for security at the Capitol, which he understands could include leaving National Guard at the Capitol “quite a bit longer” than two months.Blunt said an extended troop presence could relieve the Capitol Police “from some of their duties that have been overtime and all-time for longer than they should have been.”The Missouri Republican said Guard troops were assigned after Sept. 11, 2001 for what he believes was two years, and they functioned as military police who worked alongside Capitol Police.Blunt also said former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller and former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy should appear before the Rules Committee to explain what he described as “disturbing” testimony from other security officials about delays for National Guard reinforcements to be authorized on Jan. 6 as the attack was underway.“I think they owe it to themselves, frankly, to be here to explain what is wrong with that timeline, and if not, what they were thinking that would have possibly justified the slow action that they took,” he said.Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said it’s “outrageous“ to keep National Guard troops at the Capitol for so long.“It’s outrageous because that’s not their function,” he said. “That’s not what they’re supposed to be. That’s not their mission. We have Capitol Police -- that is their mission.”Rules Committee Chair Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said the National Guard support should stay at the Capitol as warranted by security needs, but “probably at a smaller number.““You want to listen to the law enforcement intelligence about what is safe,“ Klobuchar said.National Guard spokeswoman Darla Torres said there hasn’t been any decision on extension requests. She said that approval would come from the secretary of Defense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threats-to-lawmakers-spur-request-for-more-national-guard-help-101614905955299.html
05-03-2021||World||Capitol riot: Trump can return to YouTube after 'risk of violence' falls||Former US president Donald Trump will be allowed back on YouTube but only when the threat of his inciting violence abates, the head of the popular online video sharing platform said Thursday.YouTube in late January suspended Trump's channel, joining other social media platforms in banning his accounts following the deadly January 6 Capitol riot."We will lift the suspension of the Donald Trump channel when we determine that the risk of violence has decreased," YouTube chief Susan Wojcicki said during a streamed Atlantic Council interview."Given just the warnings by the Capitol Police yesterday about a potential attack today, I think it is pretty clear that that elevated violence risk still remains."Wojcicki said that when the Trump channel is reinstated, it will remain subject to the same "three strike" system as everyone else at YouTube.Uploading videos that break YouTube rules such as those against inciting violence or falsely attacking election integrity would earn the channel more strikes and suspensions.Channels that get three strikes within a 90-day period are removed from YouTube, Wojcicki noted."This was the first strike," she said of the Trump channel."We have applied strikes to over world leaders; (Jair) Bolsonaro in Brazil for Covid-19 misinformation, channels taken down now in Myanmar."Factors considered when assessing when it is safe to allow Trump back on YouTube will include online rhetoric along with concerns expressed by police departments and government agencies regarding risks of politically fueled violence, according to Wojcicki.She felt it important to hold world leaders to the same standards as everyone else on YouTube, reasoning that it is "a very dangerous path to say some people have a free pass" when it comes to breaking content rules.The Google-owned firm has faced criticism over its slow response following the violence in Washington, as well as the proliferation of conspiracy theories on the platform.Trump has been banned from other online platforms including Twitter and Facebook. An independent board created by Facebook is reviewing the decision by the leading social network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-riot-trump-can-return-to-youtube-after-risk-of-violence-falls-101614905723436.html
05-03-2021||World||Dallas police officer charged with arranging 2 killings||A Dallas police officer was arrested Thursday on two counts of capital murder, more than a year and a half after a man told investigators that he kidnapped and killed two people at the officer's instruction in 2017, authorities said.Bryan Riser, a 13-year veteran of the force, was arrested Thursday morning and taken to the Dallas County Jail for processing, according to a statement from the police department. Riser was not listed in online jail records Thursday evening and a lawyer for him couldn't immediately be identified.Riser was arrested in the unconnected killings of Liza Saenz, 31, and Albert Douglas, 61, after a man came forward in August 2019 and told police he had kidnapped and killed them at Riser's direction, police Chief Eddie Garcia said during a news conference. He said investigators don't know the motives for the killings, but that they were not related to Riser's police work.Garcia did not explain why Riser was arrested nearly 20 months after the witness came forward, and police declined to answer subsequent questions about the timing. Riser joined the department in 2008, and Garcia acknowledged that he had been patrolling Dallas while under investigation for the killings.The chief stressed that his homicide division and the FBI were still investigating the killings and said the department was reviewing Riser's arrests.Saenz’s body was pulled from the Trinity River in southwest Dallas on March 10, 2017, with several bullet wounds, the chief said. Douglas was reported missing that year and his body hasn’t been found.Three men were charged with capital murder in the slaying of Saenz: Kevin Kidd, Emmanuel Kilpatrick and Jermon Simmons. Kilpatrick is currently serving life in prison in the killings of a father and son. Kidd and Simmons remain in Dallas County jail on capital murder charges in the deaths of Saenz and the father and son. Simmons is also charged in another death as well.One of the men charged with Saenz’s killing told police that he and Riser were involved in burglaries when they were young, according to an affidavit for Riser’s arrest. It does not identify the man by name.More recently, Riser and the man allegedly hatched a plan to rob drug stash houses, but they didn't follow through with it. Instead, according to the affidavit, the man told investigators that Riser offered to pay him a total of $9,500 to kidnap and kill Douglas and later SaenzBoth were shot and their bodies were dumped in the river, the court states.The affidavit states that Riser told the hired killer Saenz was an “informant.” The document does not elaborate, and police declined to answer questions about whether Saenz had some connection to the department.The murder charges are not the officer's first alleged crimes. In May 2017, Riser faced a domestic violence charge for allegedly assaulting and injuring an ex-girlfriend. It wasn't immediately clear how that case was resolved. Police said Riser “received summary discipline for an incident.”Riser has been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation. Garcia said “we’re going to expedite our process” toward his firing.“We will not allow anyone to tarnish this badge," the chief said.A spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney said her office didn’t have information on the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dallas-police-officer-charged-with-arranging-two-killings-101614905344707.html
05-03-2021||World||WHO investigators plan to scrap interim report of Covid-19 origin probe: Report||A World Health Organization team investigating the origins of Covid-19 is planning to scrap an interim report on its recent mission to China amid mounting tensions between Beijing and Washington over the investigation and an appeal from one international group of scientists for a new probe, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.In Geneva, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email reply: "The full report is expected in coming weeks".No further information was immediately available about the reasons for the delay in publishing the findings of the WHO-led mission to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first human cases of Covid-19 were detected in late 2019. China refused to give raw data on early Covid-19 cases to a WHO-led team probing the origins of the pandemic, Dominic Dwyer, one of the team's investigators said last month, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the outbreak began.The probe had been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.The team, which arrived in China in January and spent four weeks looking into the origins of the outbreak, was limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and prevented from contact with community members, due to health restrictions. The first two weeks were spent in hotel quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-investigators-plan-to-scrap-interim-report-of-covid-19-origin-probe-report-101614905216015.html
05-03-2021||World||Florida governor under scrutiny after Covid-19 vaccine favoritism charges grow||Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state health officials came under deeper scrutiny amid revelations that seniors in a wealthy enclave in Key Largo received hundreds of life-saving vaccinations as early as mid -January, giving ammunition to critics who say the Republican governor is favoring wealthy constituents over ordinary Floridians.The revelations were the latest example of wealthy Floridians getting earlier access to coronavirus vaccines, even as the state has lagged in efforts to get poorer residents vaccinated.DeSantis pushed back Thursday, saying a local hospital — not the state — was behind the vaccinations of more than 1,200 residents of the exclusive Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Florida, and that the state “wasn't involved in it in any shape or form.”Despite the governor's denials of quid pro quos, the charges of favoritism were amplified by the wads of money pouring into the governor's campaign coffers from wealthy benefactors with ties to communities awarded vaccination sites — like the one in Key Largo. One resident of Ocean Reef, Republican former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, last week gave the Florida governor's campaign committee $250,000.Revelations about Ocean Reef residents getting vaccinated were first reported by the Miami Herald.The inequitable distribution of the Covid-19 vaccines is becoming a public relations challenge for the governor. Of the 3.2 million people who have received one or two doses of the vaccines, less than 6% have been Black — about a third of their share of the state's population.Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried joined Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist in calling for federal officials to probe the DeSantis administration’s vaccine distribution programs.“If this isn’t public corruption, I don’t know what is,” Fried said Thursday at a press conference in the Florida Capitol, calling on the FBI's public corruption to launch an investigation.“Give campaign contributions big dollars, get special access to vaccines -- ahead of seniors, ahead of our teachers, ahead of our farmworkers and so many of our residents here in our state of Florida who are scared and who are wanting these vaccines.”Citing reporting from the Herald, Fried noted that DeSantis in February had his biggest fundraising haul since 2018, when he was running for governor.Last week, Crist, a former Florida governor, asked the U.S. Department of Justice to look into possible favoritism in the state's distribution of the vaccines, asserting that DeSantis were benefiting "political allies and donors, over the needs of higher-risk communities and existing county waitlists.”Both Crist and Fried are considering campaigns to oppose DeSantis in next year's gubernatorial election.Other Florida Democrats, including the top Democrat in the state Senate, Gary Farmer, joined in the call for a federal investigation."The exchange of hard-to-get vaccines for political contributions is nothing short of criminal," Farmer said in a letter dashed off to acting U.S. Attorney General Monty Wilkinson.During a Thursday news conference, DeSantis expressed no misgivings about the early vaccinations at the exclusive Key Largo community.“If you are 65 and up, I am not worried about your income bracket," he said. “I am worried about your age bracket because it’s the age, not the income, that shows the risk.”The Republican Party of Florida came to the governor’s defense, calling the controversy “another bogus conspiracy theory.”“It doesn’t matter what party you belong to, whether you are rich or poor, if you qualify for the vaccine, you can get a vaccine. All you need is an arm,” said Helen Aguirre Ferre, the state party’s executive director.The Ocean Reef Club, a senior community in Key Largo, had more than 1,200 homeowners vaccinated through their second dose by late January, according to a message to community members by the management obtained by the Miami Herald.Those vaccinations came at a time when “the majority of the state has not received an allocation of first doses,” the management noted.Officials from Monroe County, home to Key Largo, said the affluent club’s medical center received the vaccines through the Baptist Health hospital as part of the governor’s program to vaccinate communities with a populations of people 65 and older. County spokeswoman Kristen Livengood said the allocations were coordinated through Baptist and the state of Florida.In recent weeks, other reports have surfaced of wealthy retirement communities getting exclusive access to vaccine doses through pop-up vaccine sites. Democrats have criticized him for choosing those places, but the governor’s office has noted that more than half of them have been in Democratic stronghold counties of Broward and Palm Beach. Supporters of DeSantis say he has also coordinated clinics with faith-based groups in underserved areas.Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat and the state's director of the Division of Emergency Management, said the administration is working “diligently” to increase vaccine access in underserved communities.“Any other narrative is intentionally misleading and wrong,” he said in a statement Thursday.After Publix was made the sole distributor of vaccines in Palm Beach County in late January, the mayors of predominately Black farming communities in the area urged the governor to reconsider, and the state set up a vaccine station shortly after.While critics point to disparities in vaccine distributions as a call for more outreach into underserved areas of the state, including in communities of color and impoverished neighborhoods, DeSantis noted that "demand was relatively tepid in FEMA sites in Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. The governor said the four sites had the capacity to administer 12,000 doses but only vaccinated 6,500 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-governor-under-scrutiny-after-covid-19-vaccine-favoritism-charges-grow-101614904208014.html
05-03-2021||World||House OKs George Floyd Act as Democrats avoid 'defund' clash||House Democrats passed the most ambitious effort in decades to overhaul policing nationwide, avoiding a potential clash with moderates in their own party who were wary of reigniting the “defund the police” debate they say hurt them during last fall's election.Approved 220-212 late Wednesday, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is named for the man whose killing by police in Minnesota last Memorial Day sparked demonstrations nationwide. It would ban chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement while creating national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability, and was first approved last summer only to stall in the then-Republican controlled Senate. The bill is supported by President Joe Biden.“My city is not an outlier, but rather an example of the inequalities our country has struggled with for centuries,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who represents the Minneapolis area near where Floyd died.Floyd’s family watched the emotional debate from a nearby House office building and said “defunding the police” is not what the legislation is about.“We just want to be treated equal. We just want to deescalate situations,” said Brandon Williams, Floyd’s nephew. “We want to feel safe when we encounter law enforcement. We’re not asking for anything extra. We’re not asking for anything that we don’t feel is right.”Democrats hustled to pass the bill a second time, hoping to combat police brutality and institutional racism after the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans following interactions with law enforcement — images of which were sometimes jarringly captured on video.But the debate over legislation turned into a political liability for Democrats as Republicans seized on calls by some activists and progressives to “defund the police” to argue that supporters were intent on slashing police force budgets.Though this bill doesn't do that, moderate Democrats said the charge helped drive Democratic defeats in swing districts around the country last November.“No one ran on ‘defund the police,’ but all you have to do is make that a political weapon,” said Teas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar.Republicans quickly revived the “defund the police” criticisms before the vote. “Our law enforcement officers need more funding not less,” Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis.Still, even the House’s more centrist lawmakers, some representing more conservative districts, ultimately backed the bill.“Black Americans have endured generations of systemic racism and discrimination for too long, and this has been painfully evident in their treatment by law enforcement,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash, who chairs the moderate New Democrat Coalition.That endorsement came despite the bill’s prohibitions on so-called qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement from certain lawsuits and is one of the main provisions that will likely need to be negotiated in any compromise with the Senate. Another possible point of contention is provisions easing standards for prosecution of law enforcement officers accused of wrongdoing.Police unions and other law enforcement groups have argued that, without legal protections, fear of lawsuits will stop people from becoming police officers — even though the measure permits suits only against law enforcement agencies, rather than all public employees.California Rep. Karen Bass, who authored the bill, understands the challenge some House members face in supporting it.“My colleagues, several of them, I do not make light of the difficulty they had getting reelected because of the lie around defunding the police,” Bass said.She called provisions limiting qualified immunity as well as those changing standards for prosecution “the only measures that hold police accountable — that will actually decrease the number of times we have to see people killed on videotape.”Civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci released a statement on behalf of the Floyd family saying the House was “responding to the mandate issued by thousands of Americans who took to the streets last summer to raise their voices for change.”“This represents a major step forward to reform the relationship between police officers and communities of color and impose accountability on law enforcement officers whose conscious decisions preserve the life or cause the death of Americans, including so many people of color,” Crump and Romanucci said. “Now we urge the Senate to follow suit.”That may be a taller order. Even though Democrats now control both chambers of Congress, it seems unlikely the bill could pass the Senate without substantial changes to win GOP support.Bass acknowledged the challenges Democrats faced last November — and may likely see again — when former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign and other leading Republicans crowded the airwaves with images of cities around the country burning. But she said those attacks, like much of the opposition to the bill, are built on racism, promoting fears about how “the scary Black people are going to attack you if you try to rein in the police.”“That's as old as apple pie in our history,” she said. “So do you not act because of that?”Still, Bass conceded that changes are likely to come if the measure is to win the minimum 60 votes it will need to advance in the Senate, which is now split 50-50. She said she'd been in contact with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, and was confident he would help deliver some GOP support.Scott said this week that the legislation's sticking points were qualified immunity and prosecutorial standards and that in both areas, “We have to protect individual officers.”“That's a red line for me,” Scott said, adding, “Hopefully we'll come up with something that actually works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-oks-george-floyd-act-as-democrats-avoid-defund-clash-101614903378581.html

Shaikh was trounced by former premier Yousaf Raza Gilani, the joint opposition candidate, after lawmakers from Khan’s Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf party broke ranks in the secret ballot.In a televised address to the nation ahead of the vote of confidence in the National Assembly or lower house of parliament on Saturday, Khan appeared to indicate there was a possibility he could lose the crucial vote. He said a loss of power wouldn’t make any difference to his efforts to rid the country of corruption.“These people thought they could hang the sword of no-confidence over me, and because the chair is very important to me, I’d... end all corruption cases against them,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. “I’m seeking a confidence motion [on Saturday]. I’ll go to the [National] Assembly and say, you decide. This will be an open vote and I’m asking all members to exercise their democratic right, and you can say you are not with Imran Khan. I will respect that... and if you win, I’ll sit in the opposition.”After creating an upset in the Senate elections, Pakistan’s opposition parties have retained majority in the upper house of parliament and are now looking to bag the posts of chairman and deputy chairman, for which secret balloting will be held on March 12.The opposition currently has 53 seats in the 100-member Senate, while Khan’s ruling alliance has 47 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ready-to-sit-in-oppn-pak-pm-before-key-vote-101614885818762.html

The rights office had verified 30 of the 38 deaths reported by other UN entities on Wednesday, saying the killings by security forces had taken place in Yangon, Mandalay, Sagaing, Magway and Mon. Since the coup, more than 1,700 people have been “arbitrarily arrested and detained in relation to their participation in protests or engagement in political activity,” the statement said.At least 700 people were detained on Wednesday alone, with many of them reportedly swept up as forces conducted door-to-door searches.Also, the European Union has suspended its support for development projects in Myanmar to avoid providing financial assistance to the military after it seized power last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-tells-military-stop-murdering-protesters-101614885230969.html

The report portrayed an “increasingly assertive” China and “destabilising” Russia as main adversaries confronting the US, but it clearly held the former as the more consequential of the two. China is “the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system”, it said.The US pivot to Asia — in response to and as an acknowledgement of China as a growing threat — started under Barack Obama, and then gathered steam on Donald Trump’s watch with the renaming of the US military’s Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command.It has been taken to a different level by the Biden administration, accorded the same significance as Europe, which has dominated US diplomatic and military thinking and spending for more than a century now, starting with World War I.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a speech hours before the report was released, “The interim guidance lays out the global landscape as the Biden administration sees it, explains the priorities of our foreign policy — and specifically how we will renew America’s strength to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of our time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-pledges-deeper-ties-in-indo-pacific-in-national-security-plan-101614884924197.html

The regulator said the review is based on results from research in adults, which suggests the vaccine may help protect against the coronavirus.Despite scepticism about Russia’s vaccine, according to a study published last month in Lancet, Sputnik V is 91% effective and appears to prevent inoculated individuals from becoming severely ill with Covid-19.The number of new coronavirus cases has risen in Europe after six weeks of decline, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.“Last week, new cases in Europe rose 9% to just above one million. This brought a promising six-week decline in new cases to an end, with more than half of our region seeing increasing numbers of new infections,” WHO Europe’s regional director Hans Kluge told reporters.“We are seeing a resurgence in central and Eastern Europe. New cases are also on the rise in several western European countries where rates were already high,” he said.The European Commission and Italy have blocked a shipment of AstraZeneca’s vaccine destined for Australia after the drug manufacturer failed to meet its EU contract commitments. Sources said AstraZeneca had requested permission from the Italian government to export 250,000 doses from its Anagni plant.

The IISC team, lead by Utpal Tatu, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry, found 27 mutations in three isolates of SARS-CoV-2 with over 11 mutations per sample, while the national average is 8.4 and the global average is 7.3, the study, as reported by news agency PTI, revealed.To understand the spread and evolutionary history of the virus, the team constructed a global phylogenetic tree, or a tree of relatedness, of viral isolates using the sequence data. In this analysis, it has been found that the Bengaluru isolates are most closely related to the one from Bangladesh.Mutations of a virus are not surprising as it denotes just a change in a nucleic acid base or amino acid molecule. Mutations are not variants; they accumulate and eventually generate variants. A study by Hyderabad's CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has said around 7,684 mutations of SARS-CoV-2 are there in India. The research team has also detected 13 different proteins most of them previously unidentified from clinical samples. "One such protein called Orf9b, which suppresses the hosts' immune response, had been predicted, but the IISc team provided the first evidence of its expression", a statement issued by the research team said.The study has been published in the Journal of Proteome Research.The study was primarily aimed at understanding how the virus is changing and is not about the recent spike in the number of cases in Bengaluru or across thee country. Mutations of a virus do take place and the Centre has dismissed any links between new mutations recently found in Maharashtra and the resurgence of cases in the state.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-virus-mutating-faster-in-bengaluru-reveals-iisc-study-101614931909558.html

The development comes ahead of next month’s assembly elections.The accused Suresh has claimed that former principal secretary of the CM M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was the main link between politicians, consulate officials and the smuggling syndicate. She further said that since she knew Arabic she was often called to translate their conversations in every meeting, the customs added.“The respondent (Swapan Suresh) had clearly stated about the improper and illegal activities of the CM, three minister and the Speaker. She has also further stated about the involvement and kickbacks received by high-profile persons from various deals,” said the affidavit submitted by the Customs and Preventive Commissioner Sumit Kumar in the high court.The CPI(M) has planned marches to the customs office in main cities on Saturday against what it called “selective and deliberate attempt of central agencies to portray the state government in a bad light”. “Nobody can browbeat us citing the statement of an accused. I was questioned several times by different agencies and they failed to produce any evidence against me. These wild charges will also meet the same fate,” said state higher education minister KT Jaleel, one of the three ministers reportedly mentioned by Swapna Suresh.The copy of the affidavit was later leaked out to the media. “The role of former principal secretary (M Sivasankar) in acting as the kink between the high-profile politicians of Kerala and UAE consulate officials as well as some others in co-ordinating illegal financial dealings under the cover of various activities and projects of the state government was also revealed by her,” the affidavit claimed.Opposition Congress and the BJP sought the immediate resignation of the chief minister. “He has no right to continue in power for a minute. He has brought shame to the state,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.“The CM and his ministers’ involvement is clear now. Vijayan can’t cling on to power now,” said BJP president K Surendran.When contacted a government spokesman said he will make a detailed statement in the evening after going through the affidavit. But he said selective leaking of documents was a deliberate attempt to portray the government in bad light during the poll time.Suresh is presently lodged in district women jail in Thiruvananthapuram. She had earlier approached the court to provide personal security to her in jail and family members outside.The sensational gold smuggling case came to light last July after customs seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Later the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and at least four other central agencies are part of the probe now. The NIA and other agencies had arrested 30 persons in connection with the case including the CM’s former principal secretary, M Sivasankar, and questioned a minister and many others. The central agencies had filed cases for dollar smuggling and other crimes related to the main offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pinarayi-vijayan-3-ministers-involved-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-court-told-101614932095057.html

The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, issued a notice to the Central government and the Ministry of Defence (MoD), seeking their replies to the petition by Kamla Bhattacharjee. The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked Kamla Bhattacharjee’s counsel to bring similar cases of missing soldiers on record to enable the apex court to seek information about them as well. Also Read | ‘Can’t mandate perverse equality’: SC on plea over commission for womenCaptain Sanjit Bhattacharjee went to patrol with his platoon on the night of April 19-20, 1997. The next day, 15 of the platoon members returned without the Captain and Lance Naik Ram Bahadur Thapa. They have not retuned since. Captain Sanjit Bhattacharjee’s father died in November 2020. His mother, aged 81, has now approached the top court after having waited for her son for around 24 years. Her petition has sought directions to the government and the MoD to trace her son and apprise the family of his whereabouts. In 2005, the MoD declared Captain Sanjit Bhattacharjee dead but in 2010, the President’s Secretariat wrote to Kamla Bhattacharjee, informing her that her son’s name had been added to an existing missing POWs (prisoners of war) list, known as “Missing 54”. A total of 83 defence personnel, including prisoners of war (PoW), were said to be lodged in Pakistan jails.

05-03-2021||India||Sansad TV: Cost-cutting, content rejig behind merger of RS, LS TV||Indian Parliament this week decided to merge the separate channels dedicated to its two Houses, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and launch Sansad TV under one administration. Sansad TV is expected to be launched in two weeks even as the status quo will be maintained, for now, an official aware of the matter said. The proceedings of the second phase of the Budget Session from March 8 are expected to be telecast on Lok Sabha TV (LSTV) as well as Rajya Sabha TV (RSTV).The merger was approved a year after a former Prasar Bharati chairman A Surya Prakash-led panel formed in 2019 to assess ways to rationalise the two channels submitted its report to the presiding officers of the two Houses. The panel has suggested cost-cutting, streamlining of the management of the two channels and content rejig to make it more attractive for viewers and advertisers.Also Read | Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha channels merged to create new platform, Sansad TVPeople aware of the matter said the panel has recommended two channels, Sansad 1 and Sansad 2, to broadcast programmes in English, Hindi, and regional languages. There is no clarity on whether both channels will be launched. According to a person familiar with the matter, RSTV was launched initially with a budget of ₹100 crore. “Rajya Sabha TV had 500 posts, while Lok Sabha TV had 134 employees... these may be scaled down to 250,” the person said. “The recruitment process is also likely to start all over again, with current employees also having to be vetted.”The two channels got advertisements primarily from the public sector and the government. The person said the LSTV turned profitable for some time, but RSTV continued incurring losses. LSTV is based in Parliament and RSTV operates from New Delhi’s Talkatora Stadium. “The rent for the [RSTV] space is around ₹30 crore,” the person said. “It was only after Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu intervened that the rent was scaled down a little.”People familiar with the matter said there is also little clarity on how the integration will proceed as the salary structures of the two channels are different. Another issue is who the Sansad TV CEO will report to, the Lok Sabha speaker or vice-chairman of the Rajya Sabha. RSTV was completely independent while the Lok Sabha secretariat controlled the LSTV. This will also have to be addressed, the people added.Congress leader Manish Tewari, who is also a former information and broadcasting minister, said he has not looked at the mechanics of the move. “From what I am given to understand, they want to brand LSTV as a Hindi channel and RSTV as the English Channel. They will continue to perform their parliamentary functions. If there is going to be synergy in sharing of resources, equipment, and have one person looking after it, it is not a bad idea.”Former RSTV editor-in-chief Gurdeep Sappal said the channel was consciously designed differently at variance with LSTV. “We developed it as an effective public broadcaster, not limiting it to just parliamentary proceedings and members of parliament,” Sappal said. He said the channel’s Content Advisory Committee, comprising leaders from major parties in Rajya Sabha, brainstormed the content. “That is the reason that there was a general consensus on the approach and content delivery and its neutrality could be ensured,” said Sappal. “I do not know the philosophy of the new avatar of the channel and whether it has been discussed in the Content Advisory Committee. I sincerely hope that the character and neutrality of the channel will be maintained and all parties in both the Houses will have a say in shaping up the new format.”Somnath Chatterjee, the then speaker of Lok Sabha, came up with the idea of a dedicated channel for parliamentary coverage in 2005 when Doordarshan chose to telecast a cricket match instead of the House proceedings. “Doordarshan...had its commercial reasons for deciding that the cricket match should be aired,” said former Lok Sabha TV editor-in-chief Ashish Joshi.Lok Sabha TV began its 24-hour transmission on July 24, 2006, with the commencement of the eighth session (Monsoon) of the 14th Lok Sabha. Rajya Sabha TV was launched in 2011.The parliamentary proceedings were first televised when Doordarshan aired the President’s address on December 20, 1989. “In 1991, during the Tenth Lok Sabha, telecast/tele-filming of Question Hour began that was followed by the live telecast of Railway Budget and General Budget during 1992. Since April 1994, the entire proceedings of the Lok Sabha were tele-filmed for archival purpose,” according to a government note on Lok Sabha TV.In July 1994, a transmitter was installed in Parliament for the live telecast of Lok Sabha proceedings from the following month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sansad-tv-cost-cutting-content-rejig-behind-merger-of-rs-ls-tv-101614926875374.html
05-03-2021||India||SSR death: NCB files over 12,000-page charge sheet, names Rhea Chakraborty||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which has been probing a drug-related angle in the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, filed a lengthy chargesheet on Friday in front of a special NDPS court. The chargesheet names 33 accused, including Rhea Chakraborty, and contains the statement of 200 witnesses. The hard copy contains over 12,000 pages and the digital format is around 50,000 pages.The chargesheet has gone beyond Sushant Singh Rajput's death and traced the trail of narcotics — its sourcing and then distribution — in Mumbai.Going by the first arrest the agency made in September, NCB had six months' time to file the chargesheet. The case was registered in August after the Enforcement Directorate shared private WhatsApp chats allegedly on sourcing drugs between actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakraborty and some of Sushant Singh Rajput's staff. All of them were accused by the agency of procuring and supplying drugs for the late actor. While Rhea, Showik and Sushant Singh Rajput's staff — Samuel Miranda, Deepesh Sawant — are all out on bail, the agency arrested over 30 people in connection with this and several are in custody at present.In its six-month-long probe, the agency conducted raids in several locations of Maharashtra and claimed to have busted some rackets actively operating in the city and allegedly inside Bollywood.The agency recorded statements of actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet, Shraddha Kapoor, Arjun Rampal among others.All these statements and other findings by the agency have been submitted to the court which will now be verified and then the accused will be asked to appear in the court.Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested in this case in January. In February, NCB arrested film director Rishikesh Pawar who was a friend of Sushant Singh Rajput. Kshitij Ravi Prasad, who was previously associated with Dharma Production's digital arm, is also one of the accused in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ssr-death-ncb-files-12-000-page-charge-sheet-in-drug-angle-case-101614926071783.html

05-03-2021||India||Poonawalla warns of delays as US prioritizes Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine||The head of the world’s biggest vaccine maker and the World Health Organization’s chief scientist said manufacturers of coronavirus shots face a global shortage of the raw materials needed to churn out the inoculations.Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive officer of the Serum Institute of India Ltd. -- which is licensed to produce hundreds of millions of Covid-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Novavax Inc. -- told a World Bank panel on Thursday that a U.S. law blocking the export of certain key items, including bags and filters, will likely cause serious bottlenecks. Soumya Swaminathan from the WHO added that there were shortfalls of vials, glass, plastic and stoppers required by those companies.“The Novavax vaccine, which we’re a major manufacturer for, needs these items from the U.S.,” Poonawalla said. “If we’re talking about building capacity all over the world, the sharing of these critical raw materials is going to become a critical limiting factor -- nobody has been able to address this so far.”Those supply disruption concerns have arisen after the Biden administration announced plans to use the Defense Production Act to boost supplies needed to make Pfizer Inc.’s vaccines. Last year, Pfizer scaled back its production targets after the U.S. drugmaker ran into difficulties securing all the materials it needs to produce the vaccines at a large scale, a reminder that the world is depending on mass manufacturing at an unprecedented speed and scale to end the pandemic.“This is one thing that would need some discussion with the Biden administration to explain to them there’s enough to go around,” Poonawalla said. “We’re talking about having free global access to vaccines but if we can’t get the raw materials out of the U.S. -- that’s going to be a serious limiting factor.”Even under ideal conditions, getting injections into the arms of 7.8 billion people would test the delicate choreography of the world’s supply chains in ways unseen in peacetime. That’s because producing a vaccine relies on a complex global value chain of raw materials and components.“There is a shortage of materials, of products that you need for the manufacturing of vaccines,” said Swaminathan. “This is where again you need global agreement and coordination not to do export bans.”She said the WHO’s vaccine partners, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations and the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network, will hold meetings on Monday and Tuesday next week to discuss those issues.Despite Poonawalla’s warnings, he said that Serum had in the past two months distributed 90 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine to 51 countries after it was granted emergency authorization by Indian regulators in early January -- a record pace for the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poonawalla-warns-of-delays-as-us-prioritizes-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-101614922980119.html
05-03-2021||India||NCB to file chargesheet in drug case related to SSR death today||The Narcotics Control Bureau, which has been probing the drug-related angle in the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, will file its chargesheet in Special NDPS court on Friday, news agency ANI reported. Sushant Singh Rajput's friend Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik are among the accused in the case. The actor was found dead on June 14 at his residence.The NCB had registered a case in August linked with Sushant Singh Rajput's death after the Enforcement Directorate disclosed alleged chats between Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik and Sushant Singh's former manager and staff. Since August, the agency conducted several raids and arrested over 30 people in connection with the case.The first arrest, in this case, was made in September and, counting since then, the agency had six months to file the chargesheet. Rhea, Showik, Sushant Singh Rajput's staff Miranda, Deepesh Sawant were booked for allegedly procuring drugs for the deceased actor. All of them are now out on bail.Several entertainment personalities, including Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet, Shraddha Kapoor, Arjun Rampal, were interrogated during the probe and their statements were recorded. However, a Supreme Court ruling of last October made it clear that confessional statements made before an investigating officer of an agency like NCB will not be considered as evidence to convict an accused.The probe created a stir in Bollywood as Maharashrta ministers said this was an attempt to defame Bollywood. Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested in this case in January.In its latest action, in this case, NCB on February 5 arrested film director Rishikesh Pawar who was a friend of Sushant Singh Rajput. Another big arrest was Kshitij Ravi Prasad, who was previously associated with Dharma Production's digital arm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-to-file-chargesheet-in-drug-case-related-to-ssr-death-today-101614922347563.html
05-03-2021||India||Leaders of Quad countries set to hold first summit this month||The leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad are set to hold their first summit in a virtual format this month, with the US administration taking the initiative to set up the meeting, people familiar with developments said on Friday.Confirmation about the meeting came from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who told a news conference he had discussed the matter with US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in recent conversations.“So, I am looking forward to that first gathering of the Quad leaders. It will be the first ever such gathering,” he said in response to a question from a reporter on whether he had received an invitation for the meeting.Also Read | Indian-Americans ‘taking over’ US, says Biden on call with Nasa’s Swati MohanThe people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the virtual summit is expected to be held on March 12.There was no official word from the Indian side on the development.The US had also taken the lead in organising the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the Quad on February 18, against the backdrop of continuing concerns over China’s actions across the region. That meeting had reiterated the group’s commitment to a rules-based world order underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.Morrison told the news conference that the Quad Summit was one of the first things he and Biden had discussed when they spoke on phone on February 3. The Quad, he added, was central to ongoing arrangements between Australia and the US.“The Quad is very central to the US and our thinking about the region and looking at the Indo-Pacific also through the prism of our Asean partners and their vision of the Indo-Pacific,” he said.Biden and US secretary of state Antony Blinken had made clear that their re-engagement in multilateral organisations is “key to building stability and peace in the Indo-Pacific”, Morrison said. “We share that view, we encourage that view, and we strongly welcome that view,” he added.Morrison said the four Quad leaders are looking forward to the first virtual summit and follow-up face-to-face meetings.“This will become a feature of Indo-Pacific engagement but it’s not going to be a big bureaucracy with a big secretariat and those sort of things. It will be four leaders, four countries working together constructively for the peace, prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific, which is good for everyone in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.“It’s particularly good for our Asean friends [and] those throughout the southwest Pacific to ensure that they can continue with their own sovereignty and their own certainty for their own futures,” he added.The move to hold the first Quad Summit fits in with the Biden administration’s position that China is its biggest security challenge and competitor on the global stage.While the former Trump administration had talked of formalising and expanding the Quad, questions have been raised on whether the Biden administration will adopt a more cautious approach to the group as a counter-balance to China.Chinese officials have likened the Quad to a “mini NATO” and said its activities are aimed at targeting third parties, a charge rejected by the four members of the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-of-quad-countries-set-to-hold-first-summit-this-month-101614921714664.html

The decision was taken by the Ministry of Railways "in the interest of the safety of passengers''. Amid the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the fair hike aims to achieve its target of reducing the number of people at stations. The decision would help ensure social distancing and Covid-appropriate behaviour.2. A notification in this regard was issued by the ministry, in which it said that regulation and controlling of the crowd at stations is the responsibility of the Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs).3. "Deterring more persons to visit the station, the platform ticket charges are increased from time to time after assessing the ground situation. The power to change charges of platform tickets has been delegated to DRMs due to field management requirements," the notification read.4. The ministry said that there was nothing new about the measure as it is in practice for many years and is used occasionally as a short-term crowd control measure. In February too, the ministry had hiked the ticket fares of short-distance passenger trains to discourage people from unnecessary travel.5.

"Is it a coincidence that each and every stakeholder of Phantom n Kwan has been accused by multiple women of rape, molestation n harassment?" the actor tweeted on Friday.Phantom was dissolved in 2018 after co-founder Vikas Bahl was accused of sexual harassment. Exceed's co-founder Afsar Zaidi and Kwan founder Anirban Blah were accused of similar charges in 2018.Quoting an article on the initial findings of the I-T teams, which claimed that mobile phone data of Anurag and Taapsee have been deleted, Kangana said data can be retrieved. "But these are small players. One can only imagine how deep-rooted is terrorism in the film industry," the actor said adding that the government should set a good example for everyone.Is it a coincidence that each and every stake holder of Phantom n Kwan has been accused by multiple woman of rape, molestation n harassment. If you don’t respect women,your very moral fibre is wrong, you are a born criminal ,industry killed #MeToo but look one can’t escape karma."Money laundering numbers and involvement of stakeholders can be shocking. I had my suspicions when I saw them provoke migrant labourers with some high budget anti-India animation advertisements," the actor wrote.After two-day searches at various properties linked with the production company in Mumbai and Pune, the I-T department on Thursday said it detected financial irregularities of over ₹650 crore. In its findings, however, the names of the Bollywood personalities were not mentioned.“Evidence of huge suppression of income by the leading film production house compared to the actual box office collections has been unearthed," the statement from CBDT, the administrative body of the IT Department, said adding that the officials of the company have not been able to explain the discrepancy.It also recovered evidence of cash receipts amounting to ₹5 crore by "the leading actress", the statement said, without naming Taapsee Pannu."Non-genuine or bogus expenditure" to related concerns by the leading producers and directors having tax implication of about ₹20 crore has been detected, the statement said. A total of seven bank lockers were found and placed under restraint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-it-some-coincidence-kangana-s-reaction-to-i-t-raid-on-anurag-taapsee-101614919607741.html
05-03-2021||India||MP exam’s 10 toppers from same college, made same mistakes; CM orders probe||Madhya chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday ordered an inquiry into an alleged irregularity in the recruitment examination of farmers’ welfare and agriculture department.The top ten candidates, who appeared in the exam conducted for appointing agriculture officers by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) (popularly known as Vyapam) on February 10 and 11, committed the same mistakes and scored similar marks in different sections of the question paper, apart from several other suspicions raising coincidences, as seen in the answer sheet provided by MPPEB.Other candidates, who appeared in the exam, raised an alarm after they found that all these ten candidates belonged to the Chambal division, had the same caste, graduated from the same college and had similar academic records.According to an official, the chief minister asked the chairman of MPPEB and principal secretary of the agriculture department to probe the matter and submit a report in this regard.The examination was held for 823 posts in the agriculture department and the answer sheets were released on February 17 with the list of probable selected candidates. It was then that suspicion was raised over the authenticity of the exam in the backdrop of the infamous rigging of the entrance examination to medical colleges in 2013-14, popularly known as the Vyapam scam.Not only were the toppers from one region and caste, but they also had poor academic background but ended up scoring the highest marks in the recruitment exam, which doesn’t have any provision of an interview to qualify.A candidate Radhe Jat from Bhopal said, “The top ten scorers completed their Bachelor of Science (Agriculture) degrees from a government agriculture college in Gwalior. Almost all the candidates completed their four-year degrees in five or more years.”“The suspicion increased when the MPPEB released the answer sheets on February 17 with wrong answers to three questions. The top scorers also wrote the same wrong answers in their answer sheets. We don’t know whether it is a coincidence or a conspiracy, but how is it possible that they all gave wrong answers, especially to basic questions studied in class 11,” said another candidate Sachit Anand from Satna.Also Read: Indore ranks ninth in Centre's Ease of Living Index 2020, gets CM's praisesOne of the top scorers, who scored full marks in the maths section, had failed in the statistics exam at least four times and completed his degree in eight years, he added.The candidates also raised questions on the company which was outsourced by MPPEB to conduct the exam.“MPPEB allowed a blacklisted company NSEIT to conduct the exam.

But in less than nine years, the mine has nearly exhausted its reserves according to documents uploaded on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website.The production capacity of the mine was enhanced from 10 MTPA to 15 MTPA as per directions of the Ministry of Coal and as per a revised environmental clearance dated August 10 2018, states a letter from M/ s Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RVUNL), which owns the mine, to the environment ministry requesting an amendment to the forest clearance.Also Read | Scientists warn of rebound after record 7% fall in global emissionsThe letter dated September 9, 2020, seen by HT, says the mine is presently producing coal at the rate of 15 MTPA. “Considering the annual mine production of 15 MTPA from 2018-19 onwards, reserves within the phase 1 boundary would now exhaust by mid of 2021-22,” it said. The environment ministry, in a letter dated December 4, 2020, has sought the Chhattisgarh government’s opinion on whether an additional forest land of 269.845 hectares can be allotted to RRVUNL to mine during phase 1 of their project.The move is facing widespread opposition by environmentalists because PEKB is located in Hasdeo Arand region, one of the largest contiguous stretches of very dense forests in central India spanning 170,000 hectares which has 22 coal blocks underneath. PEKB was a “no-go” area for mining as per a draft report of the environment ministry and the forest advisory committee forest diversion for the project in 2011. However, the project was reconsidered after then environment minister Jairam Ramesh observed that the coal blocks are clearly in the “fringe” and actually not in the biodiversity rich Hasedo Arand forest region and are separated by a well-defined high hilly ridge.A revised proposal was considered envisaging sequential mining in two phases, each phase lasting 15 years, the first covering 762 hectares and the second 1,136 hectares, with reclamation of the mined out area to commence from the third year onwards.“There is a reason why mining activity is proposed in a phased manner. There are direct consequences of various mining operations, including excavation, blasting and the movement of mined ore. The environment clearance for the project is based on an impact assessment that justifies the phased nature of these impacts, many of which are still pending detailed scrutiny,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research.“Unfortunately, the environment ministry defied its own precautions while allowing the additional extraction capacity in 2018. This created a fait accompli situation allowing the company to be able to advance its timeline for phase 2 of mining activity, which will now require additional land and will impact existing forest rights,” she added.The forest clearance granted to PEKB in March 2012 had specified that during phase 2, mining permission for the remaining 1,136 hectares will be linked to the reforestation and biodiversity management in phase 1. The project proponent will submit the application for permission for mining in phase 2 along with a compliance report of phase 1.“We had written to the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee and the expert appraisal committees that increasing the production capacity of the mine would naturally lead to a change in forest clearance conditions. The mining plan was changed even without considering the forest clearance conditions making it a fait accompli situation. They have exhausted the mine in the period of only eight years and are now expanding to a larger forest area seven years before its scheduled time. This has become a mockery of the NGT judgement of 2014 which had ordered a detailed biodiversity, wildlife and carrying capacity study for the area which have not yet been done,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, an advocate who had petitioned NGT against environment ministry’s decision to grant forest clearance for the mine.“If the mine is exhausted, for further expansion the project proponent has to approach us. I have to check what the state government’s opinion is on this matter,” said a senior official from the forest conservation division of MoEFCC.The mine is owned by Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUNL) while coal mine developer-cum-operator (MDO) operations have been awarded to Adani Enterprises. Adani Enterprises did not respond to HT’s queries on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reserves-exhausted-early-chhattisgarh-coal-mine-seeks-larger-forest-area-101614919495021.html

You (the man) should pay for his education, at least till he gets his first formal degree from a college,” the bench told the man while modifying an order of the family court.The family court, in its order dated September 2017, had directed the man to pay ₹20,000 per month towards the maintenance of his son from his first marriage till he turned 18. The couple was married in 1999, the boy was born in March 2004.Also Read | ‘Can’t mandate perverse equality’: SC on plea over commission for womenThe man, an employee in Karnataka government’s health department, separated from his first wife after their divorce in June 2005, following which the family court in Karnataka’s Bagalkot fixed the maintenance for the child at ₹20,000 per month. The man appealed in the high court, which upheld the maintenance order in December 2019.The man moved the apex court, contending his net take home salary was a little over ₹21,000 and since he had married again and had two children, paying ₹20,000 to his son from the first marriage will leave him with virtually nothing to maintain his new family.Advocate Chinmay Deshpande, appearing for the man, further pointed out that the couple had separated because the woman was in an adulterous relationship. But the bench was quick to shoot down this submission: “You cannot punish the child for this. What does the child have to do all this? And when you married again, you must have known you already have a child that you need to support.”Representing the child and his mother, advocate Gaurav Agrawal said that it would be more appropriate if the father were directed to pay a lesser sum every month, but not only till the son turned 18; instead, till he completed his graduation.The bench called this suggestion “fair”, noting such an order would ensure the necessary financial support for the son to enable him complete his first degree course. It, therefore, reduced the monthly maintenance for the child to ₹10,000 every month, starting March 1, 2021, while further directing the father to enhance the monthly allowance by ₹1,000 at the start of every subsequent financial year.The court ordered that this amount shall be paid for a period of six years or until the child completed his degree course. It also held that ₹6.64 lakh, which has already been paid by the father, shall be treated as full and final settlement of allowance till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-maintenance-till-son-gets-a-degree-not-just-till-he-s-18-supreme-court-101614914873518.html

05-03-2021||India||Verifying reports of 3 Myanmarese cops crossing over to India, says Mizoram||A team of officials from Mizoram is in the process of verifying reports of three persons crossing over from Myanmar into the state, amid continuing protests and unrest in the neighbouring country following the coup on February 1, said officials.The men claiming to be policemen, entered Serchhip district bordering Myanmar on Wednesday, said Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana. This is the first time such an incident has been reported since anti-coup protests began in the country.“These men claim they are policemen. We have sent officials to verify their claims. They are yet to submit a report. It is very likely that the information is true,” Lalchamliana said.“This is the first such incident of Myanmar nationals entering Mizoram after last month’s coup. Though there are reports of an impending influx of nationals from the country, through the other districts in Mizoram bordering Myanmar, nothing of that sort has happened yet,” he added.A Reuters report quoting unnamed officials stated that at least 19 Myanmarese policemen have crossed over to the Indian side through border areas in Serchip and Champhai districts. HT can’t independently verify that claim.Authorities in Mizoram have been bracing for a possible influx of refugees from Myanmar since last month’s coup and the growing civil disobedience against it. The state shares a 510 km border with the neighbouring nation.In an order issued on Tuesday, the Champhai administration asked people in the district, especially those residing in border areas, to immediately notify any information about Myanmarese nationals entering India seeking shelter.“If somebody crosses over without the notice of the district administration or village councils in border areas, those persons have to be caught and the local authorities alerted. They have to record entries of people who are not Indian nationals,” Maria CT Zuali, deputy commissioner, Champhai, said over phone.Once village councils submit reports of any such entry of Myanmar nationals in their areas, the district administration would take action against them in consultation with the Centre.“We will try and find out if at all the lives of those entering India are threatened in Myanmar. We can decide on these people based on what the Centre says. If permission is not granted to take them in as refugees, they would be deported,” Zuali said.Also Read: With wish to donate organs, Kyal Sin, 19, dies fighting military rule in MyanmarThe DC stated that till date, no Myanmarese nationals have entered the district following the military coup. But there have been some reports of people seeking refugee status.“We have heard some such reports from a few village councils. We will have a meeting on Thursday on how to treat these illegal migrants. We have to strictly scrutinize each such person and the reason for them trying to enter India. We don’t want any militants trying to sneak in,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-verifying-reports-of-3-myanmarese-nationals-crossing-over-to-india-101614908180354.html

05-03-2021||India||'Gujarat leg of bullet train may open before Maharashtra first if...': Official||The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) on Thursday said the Gujarat leg of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train may open first if it could not acquire land in Maharashtra in the next three months.NHSRCL MD Achal Khare also said at a virtual press meet that the deadline of 2023 for completing the project was not feasible, and civil works on Gujarat side were expected to be completed by 2024.The NHSRCL has acquired 95 per cent of the land for the 352-km stretch of the project in Gujarat, but has been able to acquire only 23 per cent of land for the 156-km stretch in Maharashtra."Of the 352-km stretch, we have acquired 95 per cent of land thanks to the cooperation of people as well as the Gujarat government," Khare said, adding that the remaining five per cent will be acquired by mid-June."The NHSRCL has been able to acquire 23 per cent land so far in Maharashtra. If we are able to acquire about 70 per cent to 80 per cent land in the next three months, we can start the entire project together," he said.If not, the NHSRCL will have to consider opening the Gujarat leg of the bullet train in the first phase and the Maharashtra leg in the second phase, he said."There are many issues over land acquisition in Maharashtra. We are in talks with our Japanese counterparts to open the Gujarat phase of the project first," Khare said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government in Maharashtra had said after coming to power that it will review the necessity of the project.For the Gujarat leg of the project, contracts worth ₹32,500 crore have been awarded for the construction of 325 km stretch and five stations, Khare said.The bullet train will have eight stations in Gujarat and four in Maharashtra."Tenders for Sabarmati and Ahmedabad stations and 18 km stretch in that city will be released on March 25, while those for Vadodara station and 7 to 8 km stretch in that city will be released in June," Khare said.The original deadline of completing the project in 2023 is not feasible as a year was lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic and land acquisition issues in Maharashtra, he said."We expect to complete the civil works on the Gujarat side in four years, by 2024," he said.The NHSRCL will need 24 sets of rolling stock for high-speed trains, of which 18 will be imported from Japan, while six will be manufactured in India."Japan has agreed to allow manufacture of six sets of rolling stocks in India. The manufacturer in Japan will tie up with an Indian company and make them here under the `Make in India' initiative. Talks are underway," Khare said.The NHSRCL MD also informed that alignment at Vadodara station has been changed due to various constraints. The new alignment will save roughly ₹2,000 crore, he said.The foundation of the project was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his then Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in September 2017. It is expected to cut the travel time between Ahmedabad and Mumbai from the current six hours to less than three hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-leg-of-bullet-train-may-open-first-if-official-101614908147058.html

The family had approached Delhi High Court and raised several questions on the death and sought a post mortem video and X-ray report of the deceased.The plea alleged that the cause of death was by bullet injury but, according to the Delhi Police, Navreet Singh died in the accident after the tractor he was driving overturned after ramming into a barricade near ITO in Delhi.Lawyer for petitioner Advocate Vrinda Grover submitted that various medical/forensic experts who have reviewed the description of injuries in the post mortem report have independently made statements reported by various media houses, opining that the injuries are consistent with firearm/gunshot wounds and that the said injuries could not have resulted from the tractor overturning, as has been repeatedly asserted and announced by the Delhi police including senior officers, the Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police.The plea moved by the grandfather of the deceased has stated that he has sufficient reason to mistrust and not accept the hasty, unverified and self-serving conclusion of the Delhi Police, which has publicly and without any investigation stated that the death of his grandson was a motor vehicle accident.According to the Delhi Police, Navreet Singh died in the accident after the tractor he was driving overturned after ramming into a barricade near ITO.Delhi Police and UP Police told the Delhi High Court that the cause of death of Navreet Singh, a farmer who died on January 26, is shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem head injury and not due to any gunshot injury.Delhi Police had released CCTV footage showing the farmer's tractor overturning after ramming into barricades at ITO.Protesters broke barricades to enter New Delhi and clashed with police in several parts of the national capital during the January 26 'tractor rally' protest organised by farmers.The protestors also had entered the iconic Mughal era monument Red Fort and unfurled their flags from its ramparts.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-directs-up-police-to-give-post-mortem-report-of-farmer-who-died-during-tractor-rally-101614903306041.html
05-03-2021||India||Cyber policy to factor in threat from state actors||Cyber operations by state actors and the abuse of social media for “narrative warfare” are some of the particular threats likely to be recognised by the government in the National Cyber Security Strategy, 2021 (NCSS 2021), a policy paper that could also make it mandatory for any business or government department with a significant IT interface to set up a cyber safety cell.These will be part of a long-awaited overhaul in how India sees and approaches dangers in the digital domain. India’s current posture stems from the National Cyber Security Policy of 2013, which officials and experts say has become outdated in the face of a threat landscape that affects national security, governance and critical infrastructure, communications, and business more deeply than ever.“It is an all-encompassing document,” said a key official who worked on the paper, asking not to be named. “It addresses all our shortcomings, how to look at infrastructure development and updates the last policy which was relevant at that point of time.’’The 50-odd pages document, anchored by the national security adviser’s office, is now awaiting the approval from the Prime Minister’s office before it is released. Hindustan Times has spoken to several key officials who worked on the paper and shared contours of what the strategy will include.Over the last couple of years, India has faced several high-profile cyber attacks, including those purportedly originating in North Korea that targeted the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) in 2019. Earlier this week, security consultants reported finding a China-backed operation to target India’s electricity grid.HT reported last month several instances in which government domain email addresses were used to launch cyber attacks and the discovery of critical vulnerabilities in several government servers, which could have given attackers access deep into sensitive networks and underscores the need for the country’s digital infrastructure to be made more secure.The government has not commented on the role of any nation-state in any of the incidents cited above.NCSS 2021 is likely to continue with the stance on not attributing threats from a particular country. “We have not named any country,” said an official quoted above. “However, we do recognise that there are both state and non-state actors that are looking to target us in the cybersphere and along with them you have state-backed actors, hacktivists and cyber mercenaries.”The threat landscape, this official added, “has really exploded” with attacks that have now “grown in scope and state sophistication”. “They have all come into play and they are targeting our infrastructure.”The paper has been prepared after consultations hosted by the Cyber Security Coordinator’s office. While it does not go into solutions, it outlines the government’s threat perception in the domain. India’s approach is expected to be along the lines of the strategy documents released by countries such as the US and the UK.The UK, for instance, recognises state-sponsored threats as “a small number of hostile foreign threat actors [that] have developed and deployed offensive cyber capabilities, including destructive ones”. The UK’s strategy document adds: “These capabilities threaten the security of the UK’s critical national infrastructure and industrial control systems. Some states may use these capabilities in contravention of international law in the belief that they can do so with relative impunity.”NCSS 2021 will also recognise the threat of “narrative wars” on social media services, the official quoted above said. Fake news, manipulation, fraud, misinformation and disinformation will be identified as major threats. “A great number of our population use social media so we need to be aware of the different kinds of threats that lurk there,” said the official.One of the other key aspects of the policy will be a proposal to create cells for cyber security in all institutions, public and private, which will involve dedicated budgeting of funds for such resources. “If you use information technology, then you will have to create a cell with experts in your office that will not just protect you but also protect everyone you are dealing with,” said the official. This will need a new regulatory framework, and the authors see it as a possible area of opportunity for employment and skill development.“As a business is connected in the interconnected world, the cyber attacker may attack you and then spread their attack from there to other places. They will have to invest in IT infrastructure and security,” the official added.Experts said India needs to focus on several aspects relating to cybersecurity. “Networks need more robust cyber physical infrastructures and for that more allocation has to happen for critical information infrastructures,” said Subimal Bhattacharjee, an independent adviser on cyber security policy issues.“Likewise, incident reporting and response ecosystem needs more focused attention and so budgets for CERT-IN (the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) and NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre) has to be increased so that they add more resources and capabilities.”A second expert said the focus on information security in the context of social media was surprising. “The narrative warfare finding mention in the policy is surprising. I am not sure of the efficacy of mixing this with cybersecurity as it makes implementation problematic,” said Gunjan Chawla, who works with technology and national security at the National Law University, Delhi.“We hope that with this policy being developed, a lot of our security concerns will be addressed,” said a second official working on the policy, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyber-policy-to-factor-in-threat-from-state-actors-101614897658901.html
05-03-2021||India||Covid-19: Phase 2 of vaccination drive stuck in first gear||Rajasthan is the runaway leader in the first three days of the second phase of India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive, having given doses to 5,187 per million residents, although an HT analysis of data from the first three days of the expanded drive indicates a slow start across the country.Till Wednesday night, India vaccinated a total of 949,147 people, or 712 per million in Phase 2, which covers the most vulnerable sections of the general public. The government hopes that drafting more private hospitals to administer vaccines and keeping facilities open 24x7 will help increase the numbers. The government has previously said its ultimate target in this phase is 5 million shots a day.Delhi, which gave shots to 1,679 people per million population in the second phase till Wednesday night, was in the second spot, while Odisha (1,283 doses per million) was third.To be sure, the per-million metric provides an easy comparison, although a more accurate denominator is the number of people over the age of 60 and over 45 with co-morbidities – a number that wasn’t immediately available for all states and Union territories. In all, the second phase of the drive is expected to cover 270 million people.HT collated and analysed data for India’s 20 most populated states. In the national capital, 33,259 people lined up to receive jabs in first three days of Phase 2 – an average of a little over 11,000 shots a day. In contrast, the three days before the start of the second phase, when only health care workers and front-line workers were getting jabs, the city averaged 19,176 shots a day. On average, 316,382 people have received shots every day across the country under Phase 2 — this has less than halved (653,565 doses administered per day) from the three days before the opening up of the drive.In Bihar, the fewest people showed up to get shots in the first three days of Phase 2 — only 43 doses were administered per million residents in the state. Uttar Pradesh, with 60 shots per million, and Jharkhand (144 shots per million) accompanied it as the three worst-performing states. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh’s numbers were also skewed by their huge populations and the significant proportion of their population under the age of 18 (they are both among India’s youngest states).The numbers account for those vaccinated in the Phase 2 of the vaccination drive, which includes persons above 60 years of age and those who are 45 years or more and suffering from certain medical conditions. Overall, 949,147 people received shots in this category across India till Wednesday evening. On the other hand, 13 times as many (13.5 million people, or 10,118 per million population) people have received at least one shot under the first phase of the drive, which started on January 16.Experts say there is a need to speed up the drive at least six to 10 times if the country plans to achieve its target of immunising 300 million people most at risk of exposure or death by August.“So far we have immunised only 1% of our population, while Israel has immunised 85% and the US 23%. At the current pace, we will not be able to achieve the target even by the end of the year. We have to speed up the vaccination drive at least six to 10 times,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, who headed the Delhi government’s first committee on managing Covid-19 infections.The first phase of the drive, which is still on, included health care and front-line workers. Of these, 6.8 million health care workers were administered at least one dose of the vaccine, while 2.8 million received both doses till Wednesday. Overall, a total of 16.3 million doses of vaccines have been administered across the country as of Wednesday – the 47th day of India’s vaccination campaign.The Union government, which was releasing daily vaccination bulletins that listed the break-up of state-wise figures for the first phase of the inoculation drive, has not done so in the first three days of Phase 2. In the absence of official data at the national level, HT’s vaccination data was collated numbers from respective state governments.With the threat of mutant variants of Sars-CoV-2 and some parts of the country witnessing an uptick in cases, director of Centre of Cellular and Molecular Biology Dr Rakesh Mishra agreed that the drive needs to pick pace. “The vaccination drive needs to be sped up to reach as many as possible as more and more vaccines become available,” he said.“I think, if we need to achieve our target we need to have vaccination in more places, we have to open it up in a manner that those who are willing to take the vaccine are allowed to come rather than calling people and them not turning up,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He said that people in the high risk group residing in regions seeing a spurt in infections should be immunised quickly “as it will help in decreasing the mortality and hospitalisations.”An editorial in HT recently called for more vaccines to be approved, that their sales in the open market be allowed, and that the drive be opened to anyone wanting to be vaccinated.Dr Sarin said it’s also important to make sure everyone living in regions such as Maharashtra seeing a surge in cases should be immunised on priority basis.There were teething troubles reported on the first day of the drive’s Phase 2. These issues appeared to be largely sorted by the second and third day, with very few problems reported.“In the beginning there could have been issues as we are trying to vaccinate one-sixth of humanity, but it will all get streamlined as days progress. In fact, most issues faced on day one have already been sorted,” said RS Sharma, chairman empowered group on Covid vaccinations.What is left is effective messaging to be able to overcome vaccine hesitancy among masses, say experts.“In urban centres the turnout of individuals needing vaccination is usually not a problem; it is the semi-urban and rural areas that require more focus,” said Dr MC Misra, former AIIMS director.Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India, added: “As more people get vaccinated, it builds confidence among those sitting on the fence. In a month or so it will be clear whether India will meet the target or not.”The Centre is looking at expanding coverage in coming weeks. “We currently have the capacity to vaccinate at least double of what we are doing now per day, and in coming weeks we will be scaling up. We are aiming at vaccinating 5 million individuals on a daily basis,” said Dr NK Arora, member, National Task Force on Covid-related matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phase-2-of-vaccination-drive-stuck-in-first-gear-101614897301702.html
05-03-2021||India||OTT regulations a necessity as some even show porn, says SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said regulations of over the top (OTT) service providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have become a necessity since some of them even show pornography in the absence of a proper oversight, comments that come shortly after the government put in place a three-tier regulatory mechanism for such companies, and also mandated certification of their content.The court, hearing a pre-arrest bail plea by Amazon Prime’s content chief Aparna Purohit used the words “screening” and “regulation” with reference to the content.The top court expressed its concerns over lack of “screening” before shows and movies were aired on OTT platforms while hearing Purohit’s plea in connection with the ongoing investigation in Uttar Pradesh against the web series Tandav.“Traditional film viewing has now become obsolete. People watching movies and shows on the internet has become very common. Our query is whether these views should be screened,”asked the SC bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy while taking up Purohit’s anticipatory bail plea.The Uttar Pradesh Police filed an FIR against the top Amazon Prime executive (and others associated with the show) for alleged derogatory depiction of Hindu deities and promoting religious enmity through the series. The scenes that caused offence have since been deleted, and the makers as well as the OTT company have apologised.Representing Purohit in the apex court, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi and Sidharth Luthra, said that rules have recently been notified by the central government, prescribing a structure to be set up for regulation of OTT platforms. They added that most of the OTT platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, were paid platforms and it could safely be presumed that adults, who paid for their subscriptions, were the ones able to watch shows and movies.“The facts of this case are shocking. Look at the FIR, please. She is an employee of Amazon but the company has not been made an accused. Actors, producer, scriptwriter are the accused along with her but the company has not been made an accused anywhere. There are cases filed across the country by some publicity seekers,” complained Rohatgi.Luthra emphasised that Amazon Prime Video had not only removed the contentious scenes but has issued formal apologies, the most recent one on Tuesday in which it said the video streaming platform “again deeply regrets that viewers considered certain scenes to be objectionable in the recently launched fictional series Tandav.”But the bench was emphatic that before it examined Purohit’s bail plea, it would want to take a look at the regulations, which were notified by the central government on February 25.The court then asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, to submit the regulations before it on Friday when the hearing resumes. “...We are of the view that some screening should take place. In fact, some platforms even show pornography. There has to be some regulations,” commented the bench.Mehta submitted that some of the web series used “filthy language and lots of abuses” while Rohatgi tried to argue that these regulations would not be relevant for deciding Purohit’s bail plea since the FIR against her was filed in January, before the new rules had come into force.The bench, however, said it would examine the rules before taking a call on the bail plea.Purohit moved the top court after the Allahabad high court on February 25 declined to give her protection from arrest while noting that “such people make the revered figures of the religion of majority community source of earning money in a most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of the country.”Earlier, on January 27, the top court refused to quash the seven first information reports (FIRs) registered against the actors, makers and Purohit for allegedly offending religious feelings, while declining their plea for interim protection from arrest.It rejected the pleas by Bollywood actor Zeeshan Ayyub, Purohit, Tandav director Ali Abbas Zafar, its producer Himanshu Kishan Mehra and writer Gaurav Solanki, directing them to go to five different high courts where the FIRs and criminal complaints were pending.FIRs and criminal complaints were registered in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Maharashtra, Delhi and ChandigarhOn February 25, the Centre notified rules that will govern online content.The rules envisage a three-tier regulatory framework, which will apply to social media, digital media, and OTT companies: self-regulation; a body like the Press Council of India headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court; and, at the apex, an oversight body of the government, with an inter-ministerial committee to ensure adherence to the norms. Besides, OTT platforms will also have to self-classify the content into five age-based categories: U (Universal), U/A 7 years, U/A 13 years, U/A 16 years, and A (Adult), in addition to providing a mechanism of parental lock in their services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ott-regulations-a-necessity-as-some-even-show-porn-says-sc-101614892661756.html
05-03-2021||India||‘Can’t mandate perverse equality’: SC on plea over commission for women||The Supreme Court on Thursday questioned the Army for denying permanent commission to women short service commission (SSC) officers by requiring them to have the same medical standards at the age of 45 years as their male counterparts, who became entitled at a younger age.Calling for a “change in mindsets”, the top court had last year directed that women officers of the Indian Army, serving under SSC, be considered for grant of Permanent Commission, irrespective of tenure of service, and also for command posts in non-combat areas since “an absolute bar on women seeking criteria or command appointments would not comport with the guarantee of equality under Article 14”.Referring to a petition filed by nearly 60 women officers, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said: “You cannot mandate perverse equality by asking women officers at the age of 45 years to fulfil conditions that applied to male officers at the age of 25 years.”The medical fitness team of the Army tested close to 615 women SSC officers entitled for permanent commission, following the apex court judgment, on five counts: psychiatry, height, appendage (bone structure), physical and eye and ear.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, who appeared for the petitioners, said some women were eliminated on the basis of their poor annual confidential reports (ACR). For permanent commission, this report is assessed between the 5th to 10th year of service.The petitioners also told the court that the Section Board of the Army appeared to have turned into a “Rejection Board” as only 277 out of 615 women Army officers made it to the final list. “For service performance, you (Army) say we will look at your performance between 5th to 10th year but for medical criteria, you will require to be as medically fit as a male officer when he was appointed,” the bench said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain said he will reply to these arguments on Tuesday when the matter will be next heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-mandate-perverse-equality-sc-on-plea-over-commission-for-women-101614891847571.html
05-03-2021||India||N-E cities have the strongest feel-good factor||One of the most intriguing data points in the 2020 Ease of Living (EOL) Index is the gap between perceived and actual ease of living in India’s cities.The EOL report has calculated its overall scores on the basis of four parameters: quality of life, economic ability, sustainability and citizen perception. The last parameter, which has a weight of 30% in the overall rankings, was based on a Citizen Perception Survey (CPS), which asked citizens to “evaluate the role of administration through performance in public service delivery, providing insights directly from the citizens”.CPS plays a huge role in boosting overall EOL scores. The all-India EOL index is 53.51, but it drops to 30.69 once the CPS scores are deducted.Is there a pattern to CPS scores being high or low in the country? An HT analysis of the statistics given in the report shows those cities in North-Eastern India -- except Guwahati, they all have a population of less than a million -- have the biggest positive bias, with CPS scores being higher than actual performance indicators.Cities in southern and western India, which perform the best on the more tangible indicators, have the lowest positive bias in their overall scores on account of CPS. The CPS bias is also higher in smaller cities than larger ones.The EOL report has given both overall and CPS excluded scores for all the 111 cities which are part of the survey. A good way to measure the positive bias in overall ranking due to CPS scores is to look at the percentage difference between overall and CPS excluded EOL scores for a city. The higher this number, the bigger will be the positive bias brought about the CPS numbers.A region-wise analysis shows that this number is highest for cities in the North-East (47.3%) and the lowest for cities in the West (40.8%). The positive bias is also stronger when it comes to cities with less than a million people (43.79%), when compared to those with a population of more than a million (41.52%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ne-cities-have-the-strongest-feel-good-factor-101614890463734.html
05-03-2021||India||Ease of Living Index: Economic might led Bengaluru to top rank||The economic might of India’s flourishing technology capital propelled Namma Bengaluru to the top spot in the centre’s Ease of Living (EoL) report 2020 with 66.70 points. The ranking was based on its performance across 14 categories (and 49 indicators). Pune came in second, according to the report released on Thursday.Bengaluru, India’s technology capital, is an economic powerhouse on account of the presence of some of the world’s largest corporations. It is the country’s largest software exporter and also home to some of the biggest public and private sector companies that have helped create a thriving ecosystem, providing employment and growth.The EoL index evaluates the performance of its cities across four pillars—the quality of life, economic ability, sustainability and citizen perception.“With a score of 78.82, Bengaluru’s performance (economic ability) surpasses the rest (of the other urban centres) by a long distance and raises the average score for the pillar to 13.17. Bengaluru’s high score can be particularly ascribed to its performance in the category, Level of Economic Development, wherein it has achieved a score of 99.50 and raised the average category score to 18.03,” said the report, released on Thursday by Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s Union Minister for Housing & Urban Affairs, civil aviation and Commerce & Industry (MoS).However, the residents of India’s IT capital have been cautious in validating the rankings as Bengaluru is placed 18th among large cities (and 42nd overall) in the citizens' perception survey (CPS) on what appears to be a reflection on the poor quality of infrastructure, sanitation, little or no waste management, unplanned expansion and an ineffective municipal administration among other issues that plague a city that enjoys a global reputation for its prowess in technology.“Bengaluru has emerged as the most livable city in India in the Ease of Living Survey conducted by @MoHUA_India. The Bengaluru model of development of citizen-centric initiatives and delivery of services have ensured the top ranking of #Bengaluru,” Karnataka chief minister B.S.Yediyurappa posted on Twitter.Bengaluru, classified and categorised among other urban centres with a population higher than a million people (49 of the 111 surveyed), has been ranked 12th in quality of life and 13th in sustainability, according to the report. The municipal administration or BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the city’s civic body) in this case has been ranked 31st.“There are 100 indicators in the case of municipal performance index. We will go through the ranking and score. Wherever we have scored badly, we will take measures to improve and in the next year our performance will be much better,” said N.Manjunath Prasad, the BBMP commissioner.“To change citizens’ perceptions, we have to engage stakeholders in consultations and constant dialogues. Wherever the citizens feel that we require improvement, it is time to improve it to their satisfaction and we will work in that direction,” he added.India has one of the highest urbanisation rates globally and Indian cities attract millions of white and blue-collar migrant workers from across the country and beyond, seeking better employment opportunities, access to healthcare and education among other requirements including a certain degree of aspirational value.India’s urban population is estimated to become 40% of the country’s population by 2030 and 50% by 2050, according to the report.“The rise in the concentration of urban population vastly outpaces the capacity of local city administration catering to the needs of the people,” the report added.The rise in urban population has led to an increase in the level of economic development but further shrunk economic opportunities that amassed the poorest average score of 8.30 across categories. City resilience, that measures the implementation of disaster reduction strategies, amassed the highest average score of 91.59.The better social and economic indicators of the southern states reflected in the overall rankings with Chennai, Coimbatore, Visakhapatnam, Madurai, Hyderabad and Vijayawada ranked 4, 7, 15, 22, 24 and 44 respectively.Karnataka also has five cities--Davangere, Mangaluru, Tumakuru, Shivamogga and Belagavi--ranked 9, 20, 23, 26 and 47 respectively in the overall||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economic-might-led-bengaluru-to-top-101614889985968.html

Elections in the state are to be held on April 6.K Surendran, the state BJP president who made the original announcement claimed he was quoted out of context. He said that in the course of the press conference on Thursday he only said Sreedharan was competent enough to be the state’s chief minister. “I was quoted out of context. Such announcements will be made by the parliamentary board of the party.”But party insiders said he was forced to withdraw his comments after the central leadership expressed serious reservations about them.And minister of state for external affairs, V Muraleedharan who earlier lauded the decision in a tweet also backtracked and claimed his tweet was based on media reports. “BJP will fight the poll with E Sreedharan as its chief ministerial candidate. We will defeat both CPI(M) and INC to provide corruption free, development oriented governance for the people of Kerala,” he said.“I cross-checked with party president who said he has not made any such announcement. My initial comment was based on reports appeared in media,” he added.Sreedharan (88), former head of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), joined the party formally on Feb 25. He will be fielded from a seat either in Kochi or Thrissur, though he earlier said he preferred his district, Palakkad.Reacting to Surendran’s original comment about being the chief ministerial candidate, Sreedharan said he would take on any work entrusted by the party.Political analysts believe Sreedharan’s entry will give a boost to the BJP in Kerala, where it is a distant third behind the Congress-led UDF and the CPI-M led LDF.“No doubt, his entry will be an image booster for the party but it remains to be seen how this will be translated into votes,” said political analyst Sunnykutty Abraham. The votes will be counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-names-metro-man-as-its-kerala-cm-face-then-retracts-101614888058212.html

It is seen that about 60% of the reported fire points have only been responded to. It is imperative that all the fire points in the field are attended on priority basis and the forest fire should be extinguished immediately before it spreads to adjoining forest areas. All out efforts should be made for prevention of forest fires through effective foot patrolling, surveillance and sensitization of Vana Suraksha Samiti members and forest dwellers,” the state forest department said in a letter to all divisional forest officers on Thursday.The fire in Similipal biosphere reserve came at a time when Odisha topped the list of forest fire incidents with 8688 fire spots since February 25 as per the Forest Survey of India’s fire alerts system based on SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership). Telangana came a distant second with 1769 fires in the same time. Odisha also saw 11,708 forests fires since November 1 last year, the highest among all the states.In Dhenkanal district, few elephants were reported to be trapped inside a forest as a fire broke out in a part of the Hindol forest range on Thursday. As the scared elephants started trumpeting in fear, people in nearby villages rushed out of their homes fearing an attack.Regional chief conservator of forests of Baripada circle, M Yogajayananda said despite 428 incidents of fire in the reserve since February first week, the situation is under control. “The chief wildlife warden had visited the core area of the Similipal tiger reserve and found no casualties of any wild animals. The fires were reported only in areas on the fringe of the reserve. These are not continuous fires that we see in places like US or Australia, but sporadic fires that are caused due to anthropogenic factors. Today we got reports of 26 active fires and we are in the process of controlling the fire” he said.The biosphere reserve spread over an area of 5569 sq km contributes 38% of the total protected area network in Odisha. It is also one of the oldest tiger reserves in the country having the largest zone of Sal trees.However, conservationists working in Similipal that are among the few included by the UNESCO in its list of critical biosphere reserves of the world alleged that several orchids and medicinal plants may have been burnt by the fire.“It would take some time before the losses can be counted. It's too early for anyone to say that there have been no losses,” alleged conservationist Vanoomitra Acharya in Baripada.The forest department meanwhile has asked all DFOs to submit a daily report on the number of fire points in their respective divisions.“The Range officers have to ensure that all the fire point incidences should be attended within one hour of reporting and the Range Officer should submit a certificate on a daily basis to the DFO that all the fire points reported have been attended within one hour of reporting failing which the DFO should intimate the same to the PCCF. 3. The DFOs should ensure that the fire points responded / attended must be uploaded in the OFMS portal on a daily basis,” the department instructed all DFOs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/similipal-blaze-contained-odisha-asks-for-rapid-response-to-forest-fires-101614884539578.html

The PM will chair the valedictory session on Saturday. National security adviser Ajit Doval will also be present.The conference was traditionally held in Delhi. But it has been organised outside the national capital after 2014. In the past, it has been held on India’s solitary aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Indian Military Academy, Dehradun and Air Force Station, Jodhpur.“There have been several major developments in the Higher Defence Organisation since (the last edition of the conference in 2018) including appointment of first ever chief of defence staff and setting up of the DMA, and several important and multifarious issues affecting modernisation and transformation of the armed forces are currently under active consideration/ implementation,” the statement added.The conference is being held at a time when Indian and China are negotiating disengagement in eastern Ladakh and the military is putting finishing touches to its theaterisation plan. It also comes on the back of Indian and Pakistani militaries last week announcing that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the Line of Control from the midnight of February 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-military-meet-in-new-avatar-to-be-multi-layered-and-informal-101614882098573.html

It was found that the animal had entered the field in search of food but got trapped in the live electric wire set up by Singh to protect his crop from wild animals and died due to electrocution.“It has surfaced from evidence that the innocent female matured jumbo lost its life because of the crime committed by the accused. So, considering the factual matrix and circumstance of the case, the accused is sentenced to three years and three months rigorous imprisonment,” the order read.The court also slapped a fine of ₹10,000 on the accused and if he fails to pay that he will have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for another two months.According to state government figures, between 2011 and 2019, at least 90 elephants have fallen prey to electrocution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-farmer-sentenced-to-time-in-jail-for-death-of-elephant-by-electrocution-101614966281164.html
05-03-2021||India||Greta's comments on farm stir not bilateral issue between India, Sweden: MEA||Young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg's recent comments on the farmers' protests in India do not form a bilateral issue between India and Sweden, and the matter did not come up during an online summit between the prime ministers of the two countries on Friday, the Ministry of External Affairs said.At a special briefing after the summit, Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West) in the ministry, was asked whether the issue of Thunberg's comments on the farmers' protest was taken up by India with Sweden during the meeting."The answer is no. This is not a bilateral issue between India and Sweden," Swarup said.Last month, Thunberg had taken to Twitter to say, "We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India."This was followed by another tweet a day later, in which she shared "a toolkit for those who want to help".While a number of international celebrities, including pop star Rihanna, had also tweeted in support of the farmers' protests, which entered its 100th day on Friday, the 'toolkit' matter became a major issue with the Delhi Police later registering FIRs against several people for allegedly trying to tarnish India's image.The 'toolkit' document, listed various actions, including creating a "Twitter storm" and protesting outside Indian embassies, to support the farmers' protest.In a statement, the MEA had said last month that some "vested interest groups" were trying to enforce their agenda on the protests and that a very small section of farmers in parts of the country has some reservations about the farm reforms which were passed by Parliament after a full debate and discussion.However, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 41 farm unions spearheading the agitation, had welcomed the support extended by international personalities, saying it was a matter of pride that they are showing sensitivity towards the cause of farmers, but it was unfortunate that the government of India is not understanding their pain.Emphasising that the protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, the MEA in its statement had said some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The government has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to the MSP and the mandi system. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also assured farmers that the MSP would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gretas-comments-on-farm-stir-not-bilateral-issue-between-india-sweden-mea-101614963944704.html

Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have been the newest additions, according to the Union health ministry. More than 84 per cent of the fresh cases that India recorded in the last 24 hours (16,838) are from these areas, it added.The overall Covid-19 curve in India has not seen a major rise in recent months and the vaccination drive, which began on January 16, is in full swing with the highest-single day doses administered to people on Friday. However, specific states and Union territories are experiencing a resurgence of the disease with authorities controlling the spread through lockdowns, night curfews, increased surveillance and testing.1. Maharashtra:Maharashtra continues to be the worst-hit state by the coronavirus pandemic across India. On Friday, 10,216 fresh cases and 53 more related deaths were recorded which pushed the caseload and death toll to 2,198,399 and 52,393 respectively. Friday’s tally has been the highest since mid-October last year. On March 3, 9,855 cases were added and were the highest in four months. The capital city of Mumbai added more than 1,100 cases for the third consecutive day on Friday.Maharashtra has been witnessing a rise in its daily Covid-19 tally since the second week of February—when the cases were near the 3,500-mark. The state government has resorted to lockdown restrictions or night curfews in districts such as Pune, Nashik, Amravati etc, which have been the fresh Covid-19 hotspots apart from Mumbai.2. Punjab:Punjab on Thursday recorded 1,074 Covid-19 disease cases—the highest in nearly five months. The caseload stands at 185,381 of which 5,887 people have died and more than 173,000 have recovered. Punjab had also seen the second-highest deaths (15) across the country on Thursday, according to the Union health ministry. The fresh resurgence of cases in the state has been happening for almost a month. Jalandhar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar and Hoshiarpur continue to be the worst-hit districtsAs many as 173,658 healthcare and frontline workers have been administered the first vaccine dose so far while 44,306 of these workers have received the second dose. Punjab health minister had earlier appealed to all the Phase 1 beneficiaries of the vaccination drive to get inoculated and warned that cases were on the rise in the state and all precautions had to be taken.3. Madhya Pradesh:Madhya Pradesh has been the new addition to the list of states that are reporting an uptick in their daily coronavirus disease tally. Fresh cases in the state had remained below the 400-mark till March 4. However, on this day, 440 fresh cases and one more death were reported. The caseload is over 263,000 with 3,866 deaths and 256,116, as per the state health department’s bulletin. Indore and Bhopal have contributed the maximum towards Madhya Pradesh’s daily tally.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said last week that the entire state would be brought under night curfew, if required, in order to curb the spread of the disease. He also advised everyone to strictly adhere to all Covid-related guidelines such as wearing masks, social distancing, etc.4. Gujarat:Gujarat on Friday added 515 new cases, which have been the highest in one and a half months, taking the caseload and 272,240, according to the state’s health department. One related death pushed the toll to 4,413. The last surge in Gujarat’s cases was last week when the daily infections crossed the 400-mark on February 25.The state government had on February 27 extended night curfew in four major cities—Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot—for another 15 days. Originally, this was supposed to end on February 28 but an official statement stated that the extension was done in view of the recent rise in cases.5. Delhi:The national capital on Friday added 312 cases in the last 24 hours, which have been the highest since last month. The daily cases in Delhi have increased since the last week of February. Three more deaths on Friday took the toll to 10,918.Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal directed authorities on Friday to continue with the existing strategy against the disease amid the rise in several other states.

05-03-2021||India||SKM seeks judicial probe into Republic day tractor rally clashes in Delhi||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Friday sought a judicial probe into the violence that occurred on January 26 in Delhi during a tractor parade held by protesting farmers demanding the repeal of the Centre’s three contentious agriculture laws."We demand a high-level judicial probe into the incident that happened on January 26 where a peaceful 'kisan parade' was intentionally disrupted and the route was blocked under a deep-rooted conspiracy hatched by the Delhi Police at the instance of Union government," Morcha’s legal panel convener Prem Singh Bhangu said here.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) is an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions protesting the farm laws.The SKM's legal panel also denounced the alleged repressive measures and violation of human rights by the Centre and the Delhi Police to foil the "peaceful" agitation of farmers at the borders of Delhi.Bhangu along with other members of the legal panel demanded immediate release of the farmers lodged in different jails of Delhi and withdrawal of "false cases" registered against farm leaders and farmers.The panel also demanded scrapping of notices being issued to farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttrakhand "under the garb of joining investigation with intention to implicate them in false cases".More than 20 FIRs have been registered against suspected and unidentified persons in which police are intending to involve innocent people by issuing notices, Bhangu said.The legal penal called upon the farmers not to be afraid of the notices and repressive measures being taken by police and not to join the investigation and also not to respond to the notices.Bhangu said as on Friday, 125 farmers out of 151 have been released on bail and others are likely to be released as their bail applications are pending for hearing.The tractors and other vehicles which were illegally retained by police need to be released as early as early possible, he said.The legal panel is also considering to initiate legal action against police officers responsible for torture and causing injuries to farmers, Bhangu said.A tractor march meant to highlight farmers' demands was dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital on January 26 as hordes of rampaging protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult -- hoisting a religious flag from the rampart of Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India's Tricolour.Tens of thousands of protesters had clashed with police at multiple places, which led to chaos at well-known landmarks of Delhi and suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the day, leaving the farmers' two-month peaceful movement in tatters.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops even as the Centre claimed that these were for the benefits of the farming community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skm-seeks-judicial-probe-into-republic-day-tractor-rally-clashes-in-delhi-101614961640724.html

Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju who appeared for the ED submitted that Sivasankar was a key conspirator who was faking sickness. He sought stay of the HC order which had clearly noted the prima facie guilt of the accused.The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy issued notice to Sivasankar on ED’s plea but refused to stay the HC order. The bench enquired from the counsel for Sivasankar if he was already out of jail. Senior advocate Jaideep Gupta who appeared for Sivasankar told the court that he was in custody since October 28 last year and was released from jail following the HC order.“We will not put you in jail,” the bench remarked while rejecting ED’s request for his custody. The court noted that the HC found the accused to be suffering from serious ailments. Besides, there was nothing to show that he was involved in smuggling gold, the bench observed, adding that even the amount involving him was less than ₹one crore.The top court is expected to hear the matter after six weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-reprieve-for-kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-ias-officer-m-sivasankar-101614959826720.html
05-03-2021||India||'India wants normal ties with all neighbours, including Pakistan': MEA||A little more than a week after New Delhi and Islamabad recommitted themselves to the 2003 truce on the Line of Control (LoC), India on Friday said it wants normal relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan, though its position on key issues remains unchanged.The Indian and Pakistani armies have said they began strictly adhering to a ceasefire on the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two countries.In response to a question on whether the recommitment to the ceasefire would lead to more confidence-building measures or whether there had been any change in India’s stated position of linking talks to Pakistan cracking down on terrorism, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava only said all issues between the two sides should be tackled peacefully.Also read: 'Ensure disengagement at other friction points on LAC' - India tells China again“India desires normal relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan. We have consistently maintained that issues, if any, between India and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally and peacefully,” he said.“Our position on key issues remains unchanged,” he added, without going into details.Shortly after the armies of the two countries issued a rare joint statement regarding the ceasefire on February 25, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s key advisor on security affairs, Moeed Yusuf, had said in an audio statement issued in Islamabad that the agreement was the outcome of “behind the scenes” contacts and “more roads will open” in future.There has also been a noticeable dialling down of the rhetoric from leaders of the two countries and the agreement on the ceasefire has been welcomed by key players such as the US and the European Union (EU).At a US state department news briefing on Thursday, spokesperson Ned Price called on all parties to reduce tensions along the LoC by “returning to the 2003 ceasefire commitments”. He said the US also condemns “terrorists who seek to infiltrate across the LoC”.The US continues to “support direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other areas of concern,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wants-normal-ties-with-all-neighbours-including-pakistan-mea-101614960990587.html

05-03-2021||India||On reports of Myanmar cops crossing over to India, MEA says ‘ascertaining facts’||Amid reports of several Myanmar policemen seeking refuge in India, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said on Friday said it ascertaining facts and will revert with more details, reported news agency ANI. The remark by MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava comes in the backdrop of multiple reports suggesting personnel from Myanmar police have crossed over to India from the northeastern border to escape taking orders from a military junta that is trying to suppress protests against last month's coup. According to a home department official quoted by news agency PTI, 16 people of Myanmar have crossed over to the Indian side in recent days. "Of the 16 foreign nationals, 11 including a woman claimed they were police personnel of Myanmar. They possessed Myanmar citizen identity cards but it is hard to verify whether they belong to the police force or not," the official told PTI.Another official in Mizoram told news agency Reuters that people were slipping in despite intensive patrolling by Indian soldiers on the border along the Tiau river flowing between forested hills. "People are coming from different routes. The border is porous, you can't prevent it,” the official said.Earlier in the day, authorities in Mizoram said a team of officials is verifying the reports. Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana said that the men claiming to be policemen entered Serchhip district bordering Myanmar on Wednesday. “These men claim they are policemen. We have sent officials to verify their claims. They are yet to submit a report. It is very likely that the information is true,” the minister said.Following the alleged incident, India has stepped up security along the border with Myanmar, where the military overthrew a democratically elected government on February 1. "As of now, we are not letting anybody enter," Maria Zuali, a senior government official in Mizoram’s Champhai district, told Reuters. There is so far no word by Myanmar’s military on police defectors.Mizoram, which shares a 510km border with Myanmar, has been preparing for the event of a possible influx of refugees from the neighbouring nation in view of the growing dissent against the military coup. The Champhai administration has asked people to immediately report any information about Myanmarese nationals entering through the border to seek shelter. “If somebody crosses over without the notice of the district administration or village councils in border areas, those persons have to be caught and the local authorities alerted. They have to record entries of people who are not Indian nationals,” Zuali told HT.The army coup in Myanmar has triggered protests across the nation in which more than 50 people have died, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-reports-of-myanmar-cops-crossing-over-to-india-mea-says-ascertaining-facts-101614957638968.html

Such women also have an important contribution to the development of the country,” said Irani.Irani was speaking about ‘Women Power in Democracy', at the Indian Institute of Mass Communication in New Delhi. She also said that any talk on women power in a democracy only emphasises women serving in Parliament overlooking all the others engaged in different fields, who she said are contributors at the grassroots level.The minister cited an example from her life to pointed out that her ‘thinking, passion, and aspiration’ helped her achieve her goals. “I was raised in Gurugram, Haryana. At that time, if I had said that a girl born in a ‘tabela’ would cover the distance of 20km from Gurugram to Delhi in 40 years, people would have laughed at me. But I was confident that my thinking, passion, and aspiration could not stop a city boundary. I never saw the difficulties coming in the way as an obstacle. I saw this as a creative opportunity to find a solution,” she said.Talking about International Women’s Day on March 8, Irani stated that a woman’s struggles are not limited to just one day of the year therefore she should be celebrated throughout the year.Irani was delivering the ‘Friday Dialogue’ in IIMC, in the presence of director general Sanjay Dwivedi, students and the faculty. The address was a virtual interactive session where the minister also took questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-who-stay-at-home-contribute-equally-to-india-s-growth-smriti-irani-101614957967626.html
05-03-2021||India||India steps up border patrols to stop arrivals from Myanmar||Indian security forces stepped up patrols on the border with Myanmar on Friday to stop refugees entering after some police officers crossed over to escape taking orders from the military junta there, officials said."As of now, we are not letting anybody enter," Maria Zuali, senior government official in Mizoram state's Champhai district, told Reuters by telephone.The move follows the defection over the border of some low-ranking Myanmar police officers who were unwilling to obey orders to suppress demonstrations against the junta.Myanmar's military overthrew a democratically elected government on Feb. 1, setting off nationwide protests that have left more than 50 people dead. A spokesman for the military has not commented on the police defectors.Indian soldiers and police were patrolling the frontier on Friday, Zauli said.In neighbouring Serchhip district, senior official Kumar Abhishek said eight people, including a woman and a child, had crossed the border and were being taken care of."We are anticipating that some more may come," he said.Authorities were making preparations to house between 30 and 40 people, he said.Asked about the crossing over of Myanmar police, Anurag Srivastava, spokesman for India's foreign ministry, told reporters at a briefing in New Delhi that it was ascertaining the facts.In all, about 30 Myanmar police and their family members had crossed over into India in recent days, a senior police official in Mizoram said, including some who had come overnight.The official, who requested anonymity, said people were slipping in despite intensive patrolling by Indian soldiers along a border that hugs the Tiau river flowing between forested hills."People are coming from different routes," the official said, "The border is porous, you can't prevent it."A federal Indian security official said that police crossing over had said they did not wish to carry out orders from the military to quell the protests."They alleged that there are human rights violations and they were asked to shoot at civilians," the official said, also requesting anonymity.The influx of such refuge-seekers, particularly police, puts India in a quandary because of New Delhi's close ties with the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw.Over the last two years the Tatmadaw has mounted operations at India's request to flush out insurgents along the northeastern border. India, on its part, gifted Myanmar its first submarine last year."It's a little difficult situation for India because diplomatic balance is crucial," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-steps-up-border-patrols-to-stop-arrivals-from-myanmar-101614953948949.html
05-03-2021||India||2500-year-old Egyptian mummy in Telangana museum gets a new life||A 2,500-year-old Egyptian mummy housed in the Telangana State Archaeology Museum in Hyderabad, which had been facing the threat of disintegration over years, has now been restored to a large extent and experts say there is no threat of any decay for at least another two to three decades.“The main reason for the decay of mummy was oxidation over a period of time. Based on the experts’ suggestions, the mummy was shifted from the wooden chamber into a glass chamber imported from Germany. The chamber is connected to a nitrogen supplier, which constantly supplies nitrogen and removes oxygen,” said B Ganga Devi, assistant director of the museum, who has been taking care of the mummy over the years.The 1.40-metre-long mummy, believed to be that of Nasihu, the daughter of the Sixth Pharaoh of Egypt of 2500 BC, has been on display at the state museum since 1930.The mummy was brought to Hyderabad by Nawab Nazeer Nawaz Jung, also known as Viqar-ul-Umrahi Paigah, the son-in-law of Mir Mahboob Ali Khan, the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad, around 1920. Nawaz Jung had bought it for 1,000 pounds in an open auction.“It was kept in the first floor of the now Chiran Fort in Begumpet for a long time, before it was gifted to Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam, who in turn donated it to the state museum in 1930,” heritage activist Mohammad Safiullah said.Till a couple of years ago, the mummy was on display in an airtight wooden enclosure with glass planks on sides. “Over the years, the wooden chamber became weakened exposing the mummy to air, posing a risk of getting decayed,” said B Ganga Devi.The embalmed body was getting fragmented around the face, shoulders and the feet. The wrapping around the body was getting peeled off and the cracks were very conspicuous at several places.Several efforts have been made over the last 10-12 years to restore the mummy. In August 2009, the YS Rajasekhara Reddy government (then CM of undivided Andhra Pradesh) summoned an expert in restoration of mummies from Egypt.“He made a preliminary study and went back. Some other experts from Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA), Egypt, were also supposed to join him in taking up the restoration work, but the project did not take off following the sudden demise of Rajasekhara Reddy in September 2009,” an official in the department of archaeology, who refused to be quoted, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2500yearold-egyptian-mummy-in-telangana-museum-gets-a-new-life-101614955153374.html

Wang suggested the two sides should set aside the border issue, while Jaishankar insisted bilateral ties can be repaired only by completing disengagement at all friction points.“It is, therefore, our expectation that the Chinese side will work with us, both through the WMCC [Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination] and the senior [military] commanders’ meetings to ensure that disengagement in the remaining areas is completed at the earliest,” Srivastava told a regular news briefing.“This would allow both sides to consider de-escalation of forces in eastern Ladakh as that alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for progress in our bilateral relationship,” he said.Srivastava pointed out that Jaishankar had told Wang during last week’s phone conversation that following the completion of disengagement in Pangong Lake area, “the two sides should now move quickly to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh”.Details for establishing the hotline between the two foreign ministers will be worked out through diplomatic channels, he added.The senior military commanders, at their last meeting on February 20, had noted that the disengagement at Pangong Lake was a “significant step forward and it provided a good basis for the resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC in the western sector,” Srivastava added.The commanders had also had a detailed exchange of views on the remaining issues at their last meeting.Srivastava noted that Jaishankar had also pointed out to the Chinese foreign minister that “both sides have always agreed that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border area was an essential basis for the development of bilateral relations”.He added, “A prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-disengagement-at-other-friction-points-on-lac-india-tells-china-again-101614953296303.html
05-03-2021||India||In 7 points, India rebuts US NGO’s ‘partly free’ downgrade in democracy report||The Centre on Friday rebutted a stinging assessment of India’s democratic status by a US government-funded NGO that studies political freedom around the world, describing the conclusion that India’s status as a free country has declined to “partly free”, “is misleading, incorrect and misplaced”.The fact that many states were ruled by parties other than the one at the national level, “through an election process which is free and fair and which is conducted by an independent election body… reflects the working of a vibrant democracy, which gives space to those who hold varying views”, the government said, its first response to Freedom House’s annual report released this week, “Freedom in the World 2021 - Democracy under Siege”.The report downgraded India’s status as a democracy and free society to “partly free”, observing that New Delhi “appears to have abandoned its potential to serve as a global democratic leader”. It said India’s fall “from the upper ranks of free nations could have a particularly damaging impact on global democratic standards”.India’s score in Freedom House’s reports had declined over the last three years, from 77 in 2018 to 71 in 2020. The latest report changed India’s classification from “free” to “partly free”; India’s score was also reduced to 67 out of 100. The annual report is perceived as one of the oldest quantitative measures of democracy.Friday’s statement, issued by the ministry of information and broadcasting, focussed on seven points, responding to some concerns flagged by the democracy report that range from internet shutdowns and use of sedition law to what the report had referred to as discriminatory policies against Muslims in India and North East Delhi.Discrimination against MuslimsThe government said the Centre treats all citizens as equal as ‘enshrined’ under the Indian Constitution and all laws are applicable without any discrimination. Due process of law is followed in issues relating to law and order- irrespective of the alleged instigator’s identity. It also defended the handling of the Delhi riots that broke out last year over the controversial citizenship law, asserting that the law enforcement machinery acted quickly and in an impartial and fair manner. Appropriate actions were taken to control the situation.Use of sedition lawThe information and broadcasting ministry statement suggested that the decision to invoke the sedition law in specific cases was taken by the state government concerned as part of its mandate to maintain law and order. ‘Public Order’ and ‘Police’ are state subjects under the federal structure of governance. The state governments are primarily responsible for maintaining law and order in their respective areas which include investigation, registration and prosecution of crimes, protection of life and property. Hence, measures ‘deemed as fit’ are taken by law enforcement authorities in order to preserve public order, it added.Covid-19 lockdown ordered by CentreThe Centre also countered the NGO’s criticism for what it had described as “a ham-fisted lockdown that resulted in the dangerous and unplanned displacement of millions of internal migrant workers”. Friday’s statement released by the government highlighted that a majority of states had already ordered full or partial lockdown between March 16 to March 23 last year on the basis of their assessment of the Covid-19 pandemic in their respective areas. The statement said that the nationwide lockdown was ordered since any mass movement of people would have led to a rapid spread of the disease across the country. The Centre, it said, was ‘fully conscious’ that no one should face undue stress during the lockdown period, and it took several measures including allowing states to use disaster response funds to provide healthcare, food, shelter to the homeless and migrants; letting migrants work outside containment zones and announced a Rs. 1.7 lakh crore.On human rights organisationsThe government said the Indian Constitution provides for adequate safeguards under various laws for protection of human rights and pointed to the presence of human rights commissions at the national and state level as rights watchdogs.Intimidation of academics, journalistsThe government pointed out that the Centre had issued a special advisory to all states and union territories regarding the safety of journalists. It said the Indian constitution provides for freedom of expression under Article 19. Discussion, debate and dissent is a part of the country’s democracy, it said, stressing that the government attached the highest importance to the safety and security of all its residents including journalists.Internet shutdownsThe statement said that temporary suspension of internet and telecom services was ordered to maintain law and order and emphasised that the orders to shut internet could only be issued by the top home ministry official at the centre and in the state governments concerned. These orders are also reviewed by a panel headed by the cabinet secretary or the chief secretary, the top civil servant in the country and the state government, respectively.Freezing Amnesty International’s assetsAmnesty International had received permission to receive foreign funds under the foreign funding law FCRA only once and that too 20 years ago, the statement said. Since December 2000, Amnesty International, despite its repeated applications, has been denied FCRA approval by successive governments since as per law it is not eligible to get such an approval. However, in order to circumvent the FCRA regulations, Amnesty U.K. remitted large amounts of money to four entities registered in India, by misclassifying the remittance as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the I&B ministry statement said. A significant amount of foreign funds was also remitted to Amnesty India without MHA’s approval under FCRA, which the Centre said, was a malafide rerouting of money in contravention of the law. The statement recalled that the previous UPA government had also rejected Amnesty’s applications to receive foreign funds, that at one point, also led to the international human rights body to suspend its operations once .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misleading-misplaced-govt-rebuts-freedom-house-report-on-democracy-in-india-101614954228863.html
05-03-2021||India||Jagan Reddy launches Fact Check website to counter fake news against govt||Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday launched an official “Factcheck” portal aimed at curbing misinformation by vested interests against the state government.Launching the website: http://factcheck.ap.gov.in at his camp office, the chief minister said the objective of this initiative is to stop the spread of malicious propaganda on social media. He also launched an exclusive Twitter handle for the same.Jagan said the officials could make use of the platform and counter the propaganda with evidence. The CM also directed authorities to take action against individuals involved in such malicious activities.“No one has the right to damage the reputation of an individual or the system with mala fide intentions. There is a need to counter such malicious campaigns which are intended to mislead the people on the ambitious programmes of the government. People have to know the facts,” he said.The launch of the new portal follows the latest campaign on social media against the government accusing it of promoting Christianity thereby hurting the sentiments of the Hindus.“A couple of days ago, there was a systematic campaign in the social media by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and sympathizers with the hashtag #Encroachment4ChristInAP, alleging that a huge cross was being erected on a hillock in Edlapadu, Guntur, where carvings of Hindu deities already exist,” a CMO official pointed out.BJP national secretary and co-incharge of Andhra Pradesh Sunil Deodhar took to Twitter claiming that the cross was being constructed where once footprints of Sita Maa and carving of Lord Narasimha existed. He also added that “Christian mafias” were creating havoc in the Guntur district, despite protests by RSS and the BJP cadre.The official handle of Guntur Rural district police promptly responded to his tweet, explaining the topography of the location through a video. Sub-Inspector of Edlapadu clarified that the hillock on which the cross was being erected is 500 metres away from the hillock on which the idol of Narasimha Swamy is present.“He also mentioned that no official complaint was lodged either with the police or the Revenue Department regarding the concern raised by the BJP member on social media,” the CMO official pointed out.Similarly, there were a few posts regarding the reduction in height of the Polavaram dam that went viral on social media. The posts claimed that Polavaram project height is being reduced from 45.72 meters to 41.1 meters.“Some media houses reported this speculation with heated debates, and posts appeared on social media with false information without any verified source. But during a review meeting on the progress of the Polavaram project chaired by the chief minister, the officials clarified that the works on the project were going as per the design that was cleared by Central Water Commission and Union Water Resources Ministry. There is no proposal of reducing the height of the dam,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-launches-fact-check-website-to-counter-fake-news-against-govt-101614953630408.html

The Prime Minister made the comments after receiving the prestigious CERAWeek Global Energy and Environment Leadership Award. “It is with great humility that I accept the CERAWeek Global Energy and Environment Leadership Award. I dedicate this award to the people of our great Motherland, India,” Modi said at the start of his address."This award recognises environmental leadership. It is commonly said that the best way to show is through action. There is no doubt that when it comes to caring for the environment, the people of India are the leaders, and it has been the case for centuries." the Prime Minister said while delivering the keynote address virtually.The Prime Minister suggested two ways to fight climate change and natural calamities. "One is through policies, laws, rules and orders. These have their own importance. For example, India is working to increase its share of natural gas from 6 per cent to 15 per cent by 2030. LNG is being promoted as fuel. We also launched a National Hydrogen Mission for use of hydrogen as a fuel. The second is behavioural change. It is the most powerful way to fight these challenges,” he added.As he called on people to change, PM Modi further remarked that by doing so the world will be a better place to live. "This spirit of behavioural change is a key part of our traditional habits which teach us consumption with compassion," he added.Referring to Mahatma Gandhi as one of the greatest environment champions, the Prime Minister said that people would not have the problems that they do today had humanity followed the path given by the Father of the Nation.It is with great humility that I accept CERAweek Global Energy & Environment Leadership Award. I dedicate this award to people of our great motherland India. I dedicate this award to glorious tradition of our land that has shown the way when it comes to caring for environment: PM pic.twitter.com/PiT05thzORThe Prime Minister also said that India’s forest cover had grown significantly over the last seven years and the population of lions, tigers, leopards and waterfowls went up during this time period. During 2020’s last Mann Ki Baat radio programme, he attributed the growth in forest cover to not only the Centre’s efforts but also to those who contributed towards forest and wildlife conservation.CERAWeek, which was founded in 1983 by American author and energy expert Dr Daniel Yergin, is organised every year since then and is regarded as the world’s premier annual energy platform. The leadership award was instituted in the year 2016 and aims towards recognising the future of global energy and environment, offering solutions and policies for energy access, affordability and environmental stewardship.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-receives-ceraweek-global-energy-and-environment-leadership-award-101614951191082.html

Senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily, who had earlier stated that there was no stalemate in the talks and that differences would be sorted out, said his party was taking a firm stand on the matter. Asked what was the hurdle to the exercise, the senior leader said "negotiations are on. We will fight for a respectable number of seats to keep the morale of the Congress men very high," he told reporters here. The DMK, he said, was sure to realise this as there was a need for consolidation of secular forces in Tamil Nadu "It is necessary to defeat the divisive forces represented by the BJP-led NDA and Tamil Nadu is a strong platform to keep up the spirit of federalism and nationalism, he said. Earlier, Moily who was here to discuss the DMKs offer and way forward with the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee at the Congress headquarters Sathyamurthy Bhavan, had indicated that discussions with the DMK on sharing of seats would be resumed. On Thursday, the DMK had urged the Congress to resume talks after AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Dinesh Gundu Rao met TNCC leaders here and discussed the DMKs offer of seats which was not agreeable to the national party. The two rounds of discussions between DMK and Congress have remained inconclusive and party sources said Congress wanted a decent number of assembly seats.TNCC Chief K S Alagiri dismissed speculation that the party would walk out of the DMK-led alliance, saying it was a "making of the media." "We dont have faith on the third front. At present we are consulting our party members," he told reporters after meeting his party leaders. Confirming that discussions with DMK would resume, Moily said "it (talks) have not yet reached a stalemate... The differences will be sorted out." To a query on the group of 23 dissenting Congress leaders holding a separate meeting recently, he said "there is no such thing as G 23 or G 24." The Congress is totally united under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and she has always heard grievances and taken action on them, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-will-fight-for-respectable-number-of-seats-from-dmk-veerappa-moily-101614950467326.html

Her family does not have any information regarding what the summon was about, he added.In a tweet Mufti said, "GOIs tactics to intimidate & browbeat political opponents to make them toe their line has become tediously predictable. They don’t want us to raise questions about its punitive actions & policies. Such short sighted scheming wont work."GOIs tactics to intimidate & browbeat political opponents to make them toe their line has become tediously predictable.They don’t want us to raise questions about its punitive actions & policies. Such short sighted scheming wont work .The case has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, news agency PTI reports citing officials.More details are awaited. The development comes days after her party unanimously re-elected her as the president of JKPDP, which was formed by Mufti’s father and former J&K chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in 1999. She has been travelling to different regions of the Union territory to address meetings and gather new faces for the PDP. Despite defections of leaders to join a new political front led by Altaf Bukhari after the scrapping of Article 370, her party continues to stand strong in south Kashmir, which was reflected in the PDP’s win on 27 DDC seats in the recently concluded elections.Mufti was released last year after being detained from August 5, 2019, to October 13, 2020, following the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-former-jammu-and-kashmir-chief-minister-mehbooba-mufti-in-money-laundering-case-on-march-15-officials-101614950429415.html
05-03-2021||India||UK knows urgency in Mallya's case, extradition linked to legal process: Envoy||The extradition of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya from the UK is linked to the completion of a legal process that cannot be circumvented though Britain appreciates the urgency attached to such cases, British high commissioner Alex Ellis said on Friday.The UK home secretary signed off on Mallya’s extradition to India more than two years ago but his return to India has been held up because of secret legal proceedings, according to the British government. Mallya is learnt to have applied for asylum in the UK.Asked about Mallya’s case at his first news briefing since taking over as the British envoy last month, Ellis said Britain appreciates the “urgency and importance” attached to such matters and the “desire to get people who are accused of corruption back to India”.Extradition is a mix of administrative and judicial processes and the UK home secretary “has done what the home secretary needs to do from the executive’s point of view in the case of Vijay Mallya but that is part of a judicial process and our courts work their way through those processes,” Ellis said.“There’s a process going on...it’s a legal process and that has to be followed through, can’t short-cut that. That’s why you have legal processes,” he said.The 65-year-old businessman is wanted in India to face charges of defrauding a consortium of banks of more than a billion dollars in relation to the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2013.In response to another question, Ellis said the UK hopes the case of Christian Michel, a British national accused of being the middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal, would be resolved as speedily as possible.Michel has been held in India since December 2018 after he was extradited from the United Arab Emirates. Reports have suggested that a report by UN experts, which is set to be released soon, has concluded that Michel was arbitrarily detained and should be immediately released.Ellis said the UK is doing everything necessary in a consular case involving a British national, including supporting Michel and providing consular assistance to his family.“We hope and want to have...a swift resolution of the case. It’s for the Indian judicial process to work out what should happen. That’s not our business, but obviously we want things to move as quickly as they can,” he said.The British envoy also acknowledged that discussions were going on between UK-based Cairn Energy and the Indian government after the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague last year awarded the firm $1.2 billion in damages in a retrospective taxation case.“There’s been a ruling made by the arbitration panel, an unanimous ruling. Now we have to see what happens next and...we encourage both parties to reach a swift settlement,” Ellis said.Ellis noted that India has “huge ambitions about infrastructure and the transformation which needs to take place in the country”, and pointed out that such a goal requires both domestic and foreign capital, and “creating an environment in which foreign capital comes to the country”.People familiar with developments said recently that the Indian government’s tax amnesty scheme, Vivad Se Vishwas, is a viable option within the legal framework for amicably resolving retrospective tax litigation with two foreign firms, Cairn Energy and Vodafone Group that together involve a sum of at least ₹30,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-knows-urgency-in-mallya-s-case-extradition-linked-to-legal-process-envoy-101614947694897.html

The SFDR technology will help DRDO with the technological advantage to develop long-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs).DRDO in a statement also said that only a handful of countries have such a technology. It said that the test was carried out using a booster motor to simulate an air-launch scenario. The nozzle-less booster propelled the missile to the required Mach number for Ramjet operation.“The performance of the missile was monitored using the data captured by Electro Optical, Radar and Telemetry instruments deployed by ITR and confirmed successful demonstration of the mission objectives. The launch was monitored by senior scientists of various DRDO labs, including Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL), Research Centre Imarat (RCI) and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory(HEMRL),” DRDO said in its statement.According to a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Ramjet powered missiles provide greater range and a higher average speed compared to missiles powered by solid propellants. The report also said that ramjet missiles use atmospheric oxygen rather than including an oxidizer as part of the solid motor. Another report on the website Popular Mechanics points out that ramjet missiles can carry a bigger warhead as they do not have to carry an oxidizer.DRDO began developing SFDR first in 2017 and had conducted successful tests in 2018 and 2019 as well. After Friday’s successful testing, defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated scientists of DRDO, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the defence industry. Satheesh Reddy, DRDO’s chairperson, also applauded the team after the successful testing of the SFDR technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-successfully-tests-sfdr-technology-in-a-bid-to-develop-long-range-missiles-101614947414299.html

The structure, called Bailey bridge, was inaugurated on Thursday."We have inaugurated 200-feet-long Bailey bridge for traffic movement. The bridge has been built in eight days," BRO's chief engineer AS Rathore told news agency ANI.The bridge is located in Raini village, in Tapovan area of Chamoli district, which was affected the most by the flash flood caused by glacier burst. The Rishiganga Hydropower Project, which was being built in the area, was washed away along with a dam.Also watch: How people of Raini village first warned people of glacier breachAnother hydroelectic project was also swept away in the tragedy in which more than 70 people were killed and over 200 are still missing.The flood was triggered after a chunk of a glacier - which experts said was 15 football fields long and five across - broke off from the main structure and fell into a small river.The roaring deluge of water, rocks and soil hurtled down the V-shaped valley in the mountainous region, sweeping away homes, roads and bridges.Many expert blamed climate change for this tragedy, but locals also highlighted the rampant construction going on in the ecologically fragile area.A group of experts formed by the government said on Wedesday that the February 7 flood not "immediately" a human-induced disaster. The scientists of Defence Geo-Informatics Research Establishment - a premier research body under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) - said that global warming and heating up of the Himalayas could be the main reasons for the glacial breach in Chamoli district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bridge-in-uttarakhand-washed-away-in-flash-flood-rebuilt-in-8-days-101614947346562.html

(But) since the names were taken, (I want to say) the very same names were raided in 2013," she said in an interaction with journalists at IWPC (Indian Women's Press Corps).It "wasn't an issue (in 2013). It's an issue now," she said.She, however, did not talk about the outcome of the 2013 raids and if any follow-up action was taken in the last seven years.The Income Tax Department on March 3 began raids on the homes and offices of Pannu and Kashyap as well as his partners, who launched the now-shuttered production house Phantom Films.The searches, part of a tax evasion probe against Phantom Films, carried out across 30 locations in Mumbai and Pune, also covered Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhasish Sarkar and some executives of celebrity and talent management companies KWAN and Exceed.Asked to comment on the raids, Sitharaman spoke of the 2013 raids not being an issue and they suddenly become one now."Answer it for the hypocrisy or answer it, saying from then this is happening till now, what's the matter (with now)," she said. "In the national interest, do we want to know if there is some evasion happening."Pannu and Kashyap are both known to be outspoken in their views on a range of issues."I don't know. I am not commenting on a particular case. But if that relates to particular names I want to ask - should we raise questions whether there was a serious omission and commission or should we raise a question about 'oh it's happening now'?" Sitharaman said. "Please look back. It happened in 2013."The tax department in a statement on Thursday stated that search and survey operations were carried out in Mumbai, Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad."During the search, evidence of huge suppression of income by the leading film production house compared to the actual box office collections has been unearthed," it had said, referring to Kashyap's venture. "The company officials have not been able to explain the discrepancy of around ₹300 crore.""Evidence related to manipulation and under-valuation of share transactions of the production house amongst the film directors and shareholders, having tax implication of about ₹350 crore has been found and is being further investigated," it had said, adding "evidence" of cash receipts by the actor amounting to ₹5 crore had been recovered.Tax department sources said some inter-linked transactions between the entities searched are under the scanner of the department. The raids, they added, are aimed at gathering more evidence to further probe tax evasion allegations against them.Founded in 2011, Phantom Films produced films such as "Lootera", "Queen", "Ugly", "NH 10", "Masaan" and "Udta Punjab". However, it was disbanded seven years later. Kashyap later launched a new production company called Good Bad Films.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-raids-on-taapsee-anurag-kashyap-sitharaman-says-they-were-raided-in-2013-as-well-101614945782081.html

It is scheduled to come up for hearing later Friday.The ED has alleged that Abdullah "misused" his position as president of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) from 2001-2011 and made appointments in the sports body so Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sponsored funds could be laundered. Abdullah said the list of properties attached by the ED in Kashmir and in Jammu were unrelated to the alleged criminal activity mentioned in the Final Report/FIR and termed it a "continuing violation of his fundamental rights".According to party MP Hasnain Masoodi, the properties were either ancestral or acquired before the alleged offence took place and were therefore not involved in any money-laundering or related criminal activity. Abdullah raised the validity of the ED in the case. He said in his petition that on the date of the registration of the ECIR (Enforcement Commission Information Report) and the initiation of investigation, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was governed by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, 1956, and had special status under Article 370 of the Constitution of India. He said the ED registered the case on December 28, 2018, under the Ranbir Penal Code (the Indian Penal Code’s substitute in the erstwhile state) without ascertaining whether it had any jurisdiction to do so. On December 19, 2020 the ED issued a provisional order attaching the properties under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). An appeal could be filed before the adjudicating authority of the PMLA within a six-month period. According to an ED statement, the attached properties include three residential houses -- at Gupkar Road in Srinagar, Katipora Tehsil in Tanmarg and Bhatindi in Sunjwan village of Jammu. "A commercial building at posh Residency Road in Srinagar has also been attached besides lands at four different places in JK," the agency had said. While the book value of the attached properties is ₹11.86 crore, their market value is estimated to be about ₹60-70 crore, officials said. The 84-year-old NC patron has been questioned by the ED in the case several times, the last in October 2020 at Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-abdullah-questions-ed-order-in-alleged-money-laundering-case-101614944474474.html

The resolution, which was moved by chief minister Amarinder Singh, called the three laws "unacceptable for the farmers as well as the Punjab government".The chief minister said that the three laws are detrimental to the farmers. He also appealed to the Centre to withdraw all cases and notices against the farmers who have been sitting on protest demanding repeal of the laws. Singh said that this is needed to build a "congenial environment for an amicable solution"."The farmers have never done anything anti-national, they are not anti-national, and they will never do anything against the unity and integrity of this country. They are patriotic and nationalistic," said Singh.The resolution was passed by voice vote.Earlier, the members of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) created uproar in the assembly when the chief minister was replying to the Governor's address. Singh then lashed out at SAD, saying both Sukhbir Badal and Harsimrat Badal brazenly cheated the people of Punjab with their double-speak on the farm laws.There were several appeals from the speaker K P Singh to the SAD members to let the proceedings continue, but the members refused to listen to him. The speaker adjourned the House twice, but the uproar continued when it reconvened.When the Akalis continued to shout slogans in the well of the House, the Speaker first named all the members of SAD and suspended them for the remaining part of the session.He even asked the watch and ward staff of the assembly to remove them from the House. Marshals then evicted the suspended MLAs from the House.The budget session of Punjab assembly will continue till March 10.In October last year, Punjab became the first country to pass a resolution formally rejecting Centre's contentious farm laws. It also passed an amendment removing Punjab from the ambit of these laws. Thousands of farmers have been protesting near Delhi against the Centre's farm laws since November 26 last year. As their stir completes 100 days on Saturday, the protesters gave planned a blockade of a key expressway near the national capital. The Centre, meanwhile, has termed these laws historic and said they will help small farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-passes-resolution-demanding-unconditional-withdrawal-of-farm-laws-101614943995665.html
05-03-2021||India||Pandemic-induced job losses ate up ₹13 lakh crore of household income: Report||Households have lost a whopping ₹13 lakh crore of their incomes from the pandemic-induced job losses, according to a report that also warns of the economy losing momentum by mid-2021 on a likely slowdown in consumption demand that has propped the economy in recent months.Describing the growth momentum seen in second and third quarters of FY21 as a positive surprise, economists at UBS Securities India led by Tanvee Gupta Jain said the economy could slow by mid-2021 as households that lost incomes during the pandemic to the tune of ₹13 lakh crore could drag consumption with a lag.In the second quarter of the current financial year, GDP contraction narrowed to 7.5%; while in Q3, it grew 40 basis points (bps) as compared with a 23.9% contraction in the first quarter.Given this, sustainability of the recovery seen in the second and third quarters and also the growth outlook are dependent on the revival in new investment intentions and easing of financial sector stress.The report, based on a one-day virtual macro tour that the brokerage had with experts, attributes the strong growth rebound seen so far to pent-up consumption, and a surge in investment activity, primarily investment projects committed before the pandemic but getting completed now.Though general economic activity is back to the pre-pandemic level, the key question is if this growth momentum can be sustained as the composite economic indicator has plateaued in January after recovering swiftly in the prior two quarters.Therefore, the prognosis for the March quarter appears to be softening of the momentum, according to the report.However, the counter-cyclical fiscal policy in the Budget focuses on higher capex (2.5% of GDP, which is the highest since FY08 and up from 1.7% in the previous year), which will help boost the nascent economic recovery. The multiplier impact of higher capital expenditure (capex) is 2.5 times higher than revenue expenditure.The report also warns that the perceived revival in the realty sector is mostly driven by record low mortgage rates (as low as 6.6% at SBI), state incentives and pent-up demand.Housing sales shrank 31% in 2020 as against 2019 in terms of value and unit sales, while new property sales are only 16 per cent of the total so far.As the public debt-to-GDP ratio set to rise to 90 in 2021-22 from 72 before the pandemic, the general view is that the country's debt sustainability hinges on its ability to maintain and improve its potential growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemicinduced-job-losses-ate-up-rs-13-lakh-crore-of-household-income-report-101614943776737.html

05-03-2021||India||As China eyes Taiwan and beyond, Quad's Indo-Pacific agenda takes priority||Leaders of the four-nation Quad grouping that seeks to counter Beijing will meet this month to work together for peace, prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Friday against the backdrop of an increasingly assertive China under President Xi Jinping unveiling plans to tighten its grip on Hong Kong and building a high-speed railway and expressway linking Beijing and Taipei.The meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, will be US President Joe Biden’s first interaction under the diplomatic and security initiative that was revived during the Donald Trump era as a buffer against Beijing in 2017. Foreign ministers of the four countries met last month to prepare for the meeting of the heads of government in March.That the Biden administration has taken steps to hold the first Quad Summit within months of taking over demonstrates that the security relationship has been institutionalised. The Biden administration has made it clear right at the beginning of his term that he would work more closely with other countries including Quad members to strengthen partnerships as part of its strategy on China.This would include deepening the partnership among Quad countries, not just as an anti-China platform but a convergence of democratic powers to back the rule of law. The four powers will also coordinate to express their position in UNSC through the US as P-5 and India as a non-permanent member, and look at forming an economic platform in the future through common interests.China watchers in New Delhi said the backdrop of the Quad meeting was crucial given how, over the last few days and weeks, Beijing had made it clear that it intended to go all out to consolidate its control over Hong Kong and Taiwan and assert its footprint in the South China Sea where it has territorial disputes with almost all neighbours.As things stand, Indian officials do not expect any dramatic change in Xi Jinping’s approach towards India. Chinese troops had triggered friction at multiple points along the border in Ladakh last year that led to casualties on both sides in June 2020, a new low in relations between the two giants in over 40 years.Last month, the two countries finally decided to disengage their troops from one part of the border. But China appears less-than-enthusiastic to expand this understanding to troops in other parts of the Line of Actual Control including the Gogra-Hot Springs and Depsang bulge area. At the same time, the Indian army formations in the east have flagged efforts by the People’s Liberation Army to carry out rapid infrastructure upgrades across two Indian states, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.On Friday, Prime Minister Li Keqiang signalled that the Chinese efforts to strengthen the military would continue as he announced a defence budget of 1.35 trillion yuan ($208.47 billion) for the military, the second-largest in the world after the US. China’s defence budget - it is nearly three times India’s military budget - is expected to grow by a little less than 7% over the previous year.Experts believe China’s defence budget understates the actual military expenditure - it does not include the billions poured into research and development to develop an array of weapons including fighter jets - but is tracked closely as an indicator of the direction and pace of the Chinese military investment.“We will boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations, and enhance the military’s strategic capacity to protect the sovereignty, security and development interests of our country,” Premier Li was quoted as saying in a government translation of his remarks.Indian strategists believe that China’s growing defence budget under Xi Jinping would put pressure on New Delhi to raise military spending also in view of the Ladakh friction. India has already increased the budget to buy weapons and systems by 20% this year to catch up with China.India has also been cementing its defence cooperation with countries outside Quad as well. Next month, India’s INS Vikramaditya will exercise with France’s nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier strike force in two phases in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.This week, the Indian Air Force started participating in the annual multinational air exercise hosted by the United Arab Emirates. Exercise Desert Flag, being held at UAE’s Al-Dhafra airbase, also has air forces from the United States, France, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Bahrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-china-eyes-taiwan-and-beyond-quad-s-indo-pacific-agenda-takes-priority-101614941573506.html

Modi had visited Stockholm in April 2018 for the first India Nordic Summit while Löfven came to India in February 2016 for the special Make in India week.The two leaders had earlier met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September 2015 and in April, 2020, they had a telephonic conversation to discuss the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-virtual-summit-with-sweden-pm-modi-says-climate-change-a-priority-101614939655852.html

Citizens attributed the result to a range of factors – from the safety of women to communal harmony to the presence of an active civil society.“Life is peaceful in Chennai,” Nanditha Krishna, president of C P Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation, said.“We often hear about riots and lynchings in other parts of the country. It is good to see none of it in Chennai. It is also a lot safer for women. Travelling late night isn’t a problem unlike in Delhi,” Krishna, who is an author, historian, environmentalist and a recipient of the Centre’s Nari Shakti Puraskar 2015, said.She added: “The lifestyle here is laid-back which is important because you don’t always have to be in a rush to board trains like in Mumbai. It isn’t too expensive for a middle-class person. Indulging in music, dance and fine arts is a part of one’s culture here.”The resilience here is often listed as a top quality, particularly in terms of the civil society’s management and relief work during the 2015 floods and the Covid-19 pandemic.CheChennai’s IT-corridor along the expanded parts of the city in Old Mahabalipuram (OMR) is a mix of employees from across the country as well as those from Japan and Korea.In terms of the “mobility index”, the city’s performance has been “driven by the large presence of its public transport system,” the survey said, putting it down as the best in the country. The survey attributed this to Chennai’s well-connected and economical public transport system.“Chennai is one of the few cities in the country that is largely connected with a high frequency in its public transport system of buses. This is well complemented by the suburban railways, metro and MRTS,” Awasthy Dilip, senior programme manager of Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), said.In 2014, the Greater Chennai Corporation adopted a non-motorised transport system policy.“Over the last five years, Chennai has prioritized pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users,” Dilip said.“More than 100 km of streets have been made safe for pedestrians. The city has piloted a pedestrian plaza at T Nagar, a parking management system and connectivity to public transportation through cycle-sharing systems, including electric cycles. These are difficult initiatives which see push back but it’s a great step for Chennai to test these initiatives. We are in a good place but we need to improve and do way better.”The results are a reflection of development projects combined with sustainable efforts, the state government said.“Improving solid waste management is a key component of the city corporation,” Harmandar Singh, principal secretary for Tamil Nadu municipal administration and water supply, said.“Chennai is innovative in energy conservation. We are good at reusing treated water, recycling and upcycling waste. Economic ability is the only area where we are slightly low because they’re accounting for cluster-based economic development which is outside the city where we have automobile facilities,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-fourth-best-city-to-live-in-coimbatore-secures-seventh-spot-101614939845393.html

To mark the day, farmers are planning to block a major expressway outside New Delhi tomorrow.The protesting farmers will block the six-lane Western Peripheral Expressway, also known as Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway for five hours, from 11 am to till 4 pm, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) announced on Wednesday. The SKM is spearheading the farmers' agitation along with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)."We believe that after these 100 days, our movement will put a moral pressure on the government to accede to our demands, because the weather will also worsen," news agency Reuters quoted SKM spokesperson Darshan Pal as saying. "It will weaken the government, which will have to sit down with us to talk again," he further said."The laws are like a death warrant to us," said Pal, adding, "We are prepared for the long haul."Tens of thousands of farmers are camping at the Delhi borders to protest against the three farm laws termed historic by the Centre. In these 100 days, the farmers have braved harsh weather conditions but remained firm on their demands. They want the repeal of the contentious laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP).The protesting farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system. The Centre, however, has touted the laws as long-needed reforms in the agriculture sector and says it will bring investment to the market. The government has also assured that the MSP system will remain as it is.However, farmers fear that it will leave them at the mercy of the big corporates and will end the 'mandi system,' where farmers are assured of a minimum price for their produce.Multiple rounds of talks have taken place between the government and the farm leaders, but so far it has failed to end the deadlock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-to-complete-100-days-on-march-6-expressway-blockade-planned-to-mark-the-occasion-101614937211072.html
05-03-2021||India||Goa: BJP relieves state spokesperson as dissension deepens in Panaji unit||The Goa BJP has relieved a party spokesperson of responsibilities as it deals with a widening rift within the ranks of its Panjim unit ahead of the upcoming Panaji city corporation polls.Party spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik, who joined hands with former MLA Siddharth Kuncalienker, and Utpal Parrikar, the son of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, has been relieved of his responsibilities, state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said in a communique.The move comes after Naik, Kuncalienker and Utpal fielded their own set of candidates in some of the seats for the polls, claiming it was their responsibility as citizens to back ‘good’ candidates for the polls.Municipal elections in Goa are not held on party lines but political parties announce their ‘panels’ of candidates that are often backed by the local MLA.In the case of Panaji, the BJP lost its hold of the state capital -- a seat former chief minister Manohar Parrikar represented for five terms, barring the period he was the country’s union defence minister, until his death in 2018 -- to the Congress candidate Atanasio Monserrate in the bye-elections to the seat.A few months later, Monserrate along with nine other Congress MLAs jumped ship to the BJP and it is he, with the backing of the state party leadership, who is now calling the shots with the BJP-backed panel in the city.Utpal admitted he was breaking ranks with the party but stopped short of saying he was rebelling against the party.“My stand is clear. I have given support to individuals on a personal level. My support is personal as a citizen. I have raised objections with the party president,” Utpal announced at a press conference.“If I wanted to rebel, I would have rebelled at the time of assembly elections. Many people quit the party after being denied a ticket. I did not. I have the political goodwill of the people of Panaji,” Utpal said.Also Read: 'Discriminatory': Goa in Supreme Court on mining leases renewal cancellationKuncalienker and Naik had also announced their support to candidates other than those officially endorsed by the local MLA.State BJP president Tanavade, however, said that the party would sort out all internal differences over the coming days, claiming that the decision of members of the party to break ranks was taken in haste.“These are differences within the BJP family. We will all soon start working together. Such issues are going to crop up as the party expands, but will not affect our chances of winning in any way,” Tanavade said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-bjp-relieves-state-spokesperson-as-dissension-deepens-in-panaji-unit-101614936762436.html

Petitioner Santa Khurai, a Manipur-based Nupi Maanbi (traditional identity within the trans umbrella), challenged the constitutionality of clauses 12 and 51 of the guidelines that bar persons of gender and sexual minority groups as well as female sex workers from donating blood as they are “at risk” for sexually transmitted diseases like HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Also Read | Supreme Court issues notice to Centre regarding soldier missing since 1997The petitioner pointed out that the effect of these guidelines was felt the most during the past year when transgender persons were unable to donate blood to other members of their community during emergencies, and blood banks were also running low on supplies on account of fewer donations during the pandemic. “The exclusion of transgender persons, men having sex with men and female sex workers from being blood donors and permanently prohibiting them from donating blood solely on the basis of their gender identity and sexual orientation is completely arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory, and also unscientific,” the petition stated. “The guidelines need to be based on an individualized system for all donors based on actual and not perceived risk, and should not be based on identities,” the petitioner submitted. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice to the Union Health Ministry, National Blood Transfusion Council and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) but refused to stay the guidelines. “These are medical matters. We don’t understand it. We are not going to enter areas without understanding them,” the bench comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, stated. Arguing for the petitioner, advocate Jayana Kothari pointed out that the guidelines perpetuated stigma and furthered the discriminated faced by communities and persons based on their gender identities and sexual orientation. “We have sought a change in the guidelines which are based on bands of identity, which is discriminatory, rather than on risky behaviour, which is not identity-based,” she said. All blood units collected from donors were tested for infectious diseases including Hepatitis B and C as well as for HIV. Thus, such permanent exclusion on the basis of identity-based categories is “violative of the right to be treated equally as other blood donors,” the plea stated. “The prohibition amounts to discrimination under Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 15 (right against discrimination) of the Constitution, as it deems them less worthy of social participation and healthcare,” said advocate Anindita Pujari who filed the petition. The guidelines came into force in 2017, but the bar on blood donation is decades-old, said L Ramakrishnan from the public health non-government organisation Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India (SAATHII) that works with communities marginalized on account of their HIV status and/or gender and sexuality. “Grouping entire populations as High Risk Groups (HRG) and ineligible for blood donations has two issues. One is that it perpetuates the social stigma already surrounding these populations. The other is that blood may donated by individuals who do not belong to these HRGs, but may still engage in high-risk behaviour. Given the acute need for blood donors in this country it makes more sense to move away from blanket bans but look at individualized risk similar to the new guidelines proposed in the United Kingdom, and to ensure that all blood is tested using advanced technologies that can detect HIV even when the viral load is low,” Ramakrishnan said. The ban on blood donation by gender and sexual minority groups is a legacy of the AIDS pandemic that began in the 1980s and spread across the world, including in India, prompting the setting up of NACO and a phased-wise response to prevent the spread of HIV. However, several countries, including the UK and Brazil, have replaced these bans. In the UK, all men can give blood three months after engaging in sexual intercourse with another man. Earlier, they had to wait for a year from their last encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-response-on-barring-transgenders-gay-people-from-donating-blood-101614936356466.html

Such payments refer to a certain percentage of the total deal amount that has to be paid at different stages of the execution of a contract.Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.The ₹48,000-crore contract for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets, awarded to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) last month, is the biggest indigenous defence procurement deal so far.The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the Indian Air Force in three years, with the rest being supplied by 2030. The deal involves the supply of 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.The dedicated financial allocation for indigenous weapons and systems is a game changer and will contribute in a big way to India becoming Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) in defence, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.“Our dependence on imported military hardware is a major weakness which is being corrected. Dedicated financial allocation will give a much-needed boost to the Make-in-India initiative as also help develop the domestic defence ecosystem. But the procedures and processes too should be addressed as they continue to be laborious,” Bhatia said.Last week, the defence ministry cleared domestic military purchases worth ₹13,700 crore including proposals to buy 118 Arjun Mk-1A tanks and equipping armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) with modern protection and countermeasure systems.The new tanks will cost ₹8,380 crore, with the order likely to be placed with the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) this year. Protection systems for the AFVs will cost ₹5,300 crore.Basic trainers and LCHs figure on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. This year, the government is likely to notify a second list of weapons, systems and ammunition that cannot be imported.HAL is likely to be awarded a contract to supply 15 LCHs to the Indian military this month. The IAF and the army together require 160 LCHs.The state-owned plane maker is also likely to be awarded a contract soon for 106 basic trainer aircraft for IAF. Last August, the defence acquisition council accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft for IAF.Also, India will sign a $2.5-billion contract this year for buying 56 medium transport aircraft for IAF to replace its fleet of ageing Avro-748 planes.Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) will jointly execute the project to equip the air force with 56 C-295 transport aircraft under the Make-in-India initiative in the aerospace sector.Under the contract, Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in flyaway condition while the remaining 40 will be assembled in India by TASL, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-defence-budget-for-domestic-buys-to-fund-fighters-tanks-missiles-101614852096078.html

05-03-2021||Today's||What Bollywood could learn from Munawar Faruqui||They have failed to uphold the spirit of the [the] constitution” — not my words, but those of Justice Deepak Gupta. In conversations with me, both Justice Gupta and Justice Madan Lokur have expressed dismay and anger at the abject surrender on free speech principles by their brethren in the Indian judiciary. We were talking about the interventions of the courts in Madhya Pradesh and Allahabad in the arrest of Munawar Faruqui and the denial of pre-arrest bail to Amazon executive, Aparna Purohit, for the web series Tandav, respectively. I only half-joked, when I quipped to the two retired justices of the Supreme Court, that they could not be hauled up for contempt, but I sure would be. The Allahabad High Court goes so far as to list the Hindi movies it argues has hurt Hindu sentiments. And as Justice Gupta argues, irrespective of whether you are a free speech absolutist or not, in his view, the verdict — which denied bail to Purohit, despite her unconditional apology and deletion of the offending scenes — “does not make sense on any point of law”.The real challenge to upholding India’s freedoms is how patchy and individual-driven it is when it comes to the judiciary. The system is so arranged that instead of legal precedent and case law setting the template for the court’s interventions, the idea of justice is guided by what Judge A or Judge B may think. So, Justice Dhananjay Y Chandrachud reminded us of the 1970s Krishna Iyer diktat on “bail not jail” as the desired guiding principle while adjudicating on personal liberty in the Arnab Goswami case. Justice Rohinton Nariman took less time than the turn of a minute on the clock in giving bail to Faruqui. But the same court behaved differently in the case of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, who has now been in lock-up for close to 150 days. Admittedly, the charges against Kappan are framed under an anti-terror act, making it a less simple case than the other two. But the bail not jail dictum should still hold true. The process of seeking justice cannot be so dependent on which court your case ends up in. So, Judge Dharmendra Rana called out the sedition law and the “wounded vanities” of the powerful while allowing climate activist Disha Ravi to walk out on bail. The exact same case could have had a different outcome had it been heard by someone else. The unpredictability of the courts aside, the reluctance of the film industry to stand up for itself is even more disappointing. How does one stand in solidarity with those who won’t fight for themselves? The makers of Tandav apologised, not once but twice, thereby effectively accepting the accusation that the content was offensive to Hindus. The muted, fearful response in the film industry — apart from a handful of usual suspects — does not help its cause. There were stirrings of a collective response when producers gathered to take on the slanderous and vile television coverage of Bollywood during the Rhea Chakraborty trial. But now it appears to have been akin to a gasping attempt to come up for air whilst drowning. India’s biggest actors may want to take a life-lesson from Faruqui, the 29-year-old stand-up comic who spent 37 days in jail. It’s not as if his spirit has not been damaged. “Jail takes away your sense of self-respect,” Faruqui told me, “I kept thinking, what have I done to be here? Have I killed someone?” He revealed that he now takes sleeping pills every night since his release and those don’t help either. Yet, Faruqui, whose father was paralysed for 10 years and whose mother died last year, had found salvation and hope, economic and professional in comedy. “I will not give up on making people laugh,” he told me, “I am not leaving comedy, I am living it.” There appeared to be neither rancour nor resignation in him; just a desire to put together the broken pieces of his life, with the same energy with which he once discovered, by pure accident, what an Open Mic is. Without either the wealth and connections or profile of India’s film industry, Faruqui has shown more courage and almost zero cynicism. It doesn’t matter if you found his jokes funny or not — the jail-time he was subjected to was an abomination. This has been a patchy, roller-coaster of a fortnight for India’s fundamental freedoms. It has been held together by the interventions and doggedness of a few good men (and women). And sometimes that’s all it takes.

05-03-2021||Today's||Creating a sustainable, legitimate digital regulatory regime||There may be a range of immediate or proximate causes for regulating Over The Top (OTT) platforms and/or online news media — from fake news to hate speech; from content that hurts religious sentiments to pornography; from a plausible intent of creating level-playing fields to ensuring the protection of rights of children to national security. However, such a cause has to manifest through appropriate channels or its very existence is bound to fail. And therein lies the key issue in Part III of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (Digital Media Code), which seeks to regulate two distinct types of publishers — OTT platforms carrying curated content and online news media — under a common regulatory framework.It does seem reasonable when a government says it wants to apply a level-playing field between traditional media and online media. It seems more than fair when it says that it only wishes to regulate, and not restrict, and resorts to a predominantly self–regulatory mechanism. We also often end up having a misplaced belief in restrictions, under the guise of regulation, if sugar-coated with the promise of security. The Digital Media Code fails to conform to, and, in fact, confounds, every settled constitutional mandate for lawmaking — the very obvious premise that law is to be made by the lawmakers i.e. the legislature and not the executive. That fundamental rights come with restrictions is clear. But that does not give unfettered rights to even the legislature to invoke such restrictions. Even a law enacted by Parliament, to enforce a legitimate state aim, has to ensure proportionality, which has a “rational nexus between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them” (Puttaswamy v. UOI or Privacy Judgment, 2017). And such lawmaking cannot be usurped by the executive.The Digital Media Code has been formulated rather speciously, under Section 87 (1) & (2)(z) & (zg) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (as amended) (“IT Act”) i.e., the rule-making power. Rule-making or subordinate legislations are intended to carry out the purpose of an enactment. Subordinate legislations have to stay within the boundaries of the parent provision, which has the imprimatur of the legislature. The Supreme Court’s caution that “a powerful executive may unduly overstep the limits of delegation” (Devi Das Gopal Krishnan v. State of Punjab, 1967) has come to pass in the formulation of the Code. The above provisions relate to exemptions or protections to intermediaries and their duty to block content online pursuant to orders passed, as per due process. Neither provision can extend to non-intermediaries, which is what the publishers of curated content or news media would be classified under. That the Code itself carves out a separate category for intermediaries buttresses this assumption and makes it patently flawed.Both entertainment and news are regulated for traditional media. To want similar regulations for online entertainment or news would not, in itself, be unfair or arbitrary. But clubbing both these together and regulating them on par is unsustainable. News, in particular, is not and cannot be subject to excessive legislation. Censorship, for instance, of news, is anathema to a democratic construct. That, in effect, is what invoking blocking rules, for regulating news achieves. And that is a further ground to sustain a strike down of the Digital Media Code through judicial review, for want of proportionality.The raison d’etre for the regulations i.e. of ensuring a level-playing field and several provisions for regulating OTT are welcome and follow global trends, including standardised age gating ratings and self-regulatory mechanisms. The methodology adapted is however irreparably flawed and unconstitutional. Be it self-regulation or soft regulation, even oversight, if the same laws and regulations, as those applicable for traditional media, had been invoked, including delegated legislation, it would have been the right step forward. To resort to subordinate legislation under a completely unrelated parliamentary law, using provisions that are inapplicable, undermines the core of the Constitution and is nothing more than a futile exercise bound to fail from its very inception.From an industry perspective, it is imperative that proportionality replaces fury so that constructive suggestions are put forth to ensure that national and citizen interests are protected, in a constitutionally sustainable manner while protecting stakeholder interests. There is enough within the deeply flawed regulations that are essential for ensuring victim rights, particularly of women and children; protecting against the pandemic of fake news and hate speech; age gating and other acceptable standards that qualify as reasonable restrictions on free speech. There cannot be one-sided rhetoric either from the government or the naysayers. It is imperative that the good does not get thrown out with the bad and effective remedial action is mediated by all stakeholders.

05-03-2021||Today's||Dowry remains India’s abiding shame||Her name was Ayesha. She was 23, worked at a bank and was hoping to complete a master’s degree when she chose to end her life in the Sabarmati river. The police have arrested her husband, Aarif Khan, who she married in 2018, and charged him with abetment to suicide.Rashika Jain was 25 and had married businessman Kushal Agarwal at a grand destination wedding in Jodhpur a year ago. On February 16, she was dead from a fall off the third floor terrace of her in-laws’ home in Alipore, Kolkata. The police have filed a first information report against Agarwal. In both cases, the women’s parents have alleged harassment over dowry.A consumerist, post-liberalisation economy now drives the marriage market — destination weddings, designer jewellery and, at the very least, a DJ-wale bhaiya even in small towns and villages. Much of this is paid for by the bride’s family because it’s “tradition”. But even as gifts, how do you separate an outright demand from what was given under social pressure?Six decades after the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961, the continuing prevalence of dowry remains India’s national shame. The 2019 National Crime Records Bureau data tells us that a woman is subject to cruelty by her husband and in-laws every four minutes. Every 73 minutes, there is a dowry death — 23 bodies a day. Yet, when was the last time you saw public outrage over these numbers? It is possible that these are now so routine, that we don’t even react.In the 1980s, at the height of these “kitchen accidents”, two mothers, Satyarani Chadha and Shahjahan Apa, turned a personal tragedy, the murder of their daughters, into a public crusade, leading to changes in the law. By 2014, public sympathy had waned and the Supreme Court called Section 498A, the cruelty section, among the “provisions that are used as weapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives”. Notwithstanding the misogyny of “disgruntled wives”, men rights activists are voluble when it comes to the “misuse” of this section, but inexplicably silent on dowry itself. Dowry is the issue that everyone, even government and social workers, has forgotten. Ayesha’s death led to a welcome break in the silence as Hyderabad Member of Parliament Asaduddin Owaisi said: “Irrespective of which religion you belong to, I strongly urge everyone to end this greed of dowry.” There’s one good reason for bringing dowry back into the forefront of the gender agenda. A study found that states with the highest increase of dowry deaths also have the highest decline in sex ratio. In other words, in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where dowry is rife, it does not make economic sense to have a girl child.In the run-up to International Women’s Day, it’s good to celebrate the undeniable gains on our road to gender equality. But it’s also worth remembering just how far we have to go — and how little has changed.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dowry-remains-india-s-abiding-shame-101614946497363.html
05-03-2021||Editorials||Shaping India’s urban future||The Centre, on Thursday, released the rankings of the Ease of Living Index (EoLI) 2020 for cities with a population of more than a million and those with less than a million people. Of the 111 cities that participated in the exercise, Bengaluru emerged as the top performer, followed by Navi Mumbai (6), Greater Mumbai (10) and Delhi (13) among the bigger cities, while Shimla led among the smaller cities. Like EoLI , the government also released the Municipal Performance Index (MPI) 2020 for municipalities with a million+ population and those with less than a million people. Indore topped the first category while the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) led the second. EoLI is an assessment tool that evaluates the quality of life and the impact of initiatives for development and provides an understanding of cities based on the quality of life, economic-ability and sustainability and resilience. Notably, the measures of the index align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).It is important to measure the performance of cities for three reasons. One, Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees every citizen a certain standard of life that ensures dignity and personal growth. Second, economic growth is intricately linked with urbanisation, but, in India, this has not kept pace with the rate of economic growth. Third, the rise in urban population (40% of India’s total population is expected to live in urban areas by 2030) has vastly outpaced the capacity of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The 2020 EoLI clearly shows that the development of cities has been uneven. The better performers are mostly in the southern part of the country, which has a legacy of industrialisation and finance. They also indicate that the concept of liveability is yet to be integrated with urban planning strategies. Among municipalities, NDMC and Indore have been consistent performers in other government surveys.To improve and also cater to several emerging needs, India’s cities need to go for city-to-city partnerships, mainstream the liveability indicators in planning and policy, develop urban planning frameworks and guidelines that have space for contextualised approaches of cities and can be adapted easily, improve citizen engagement, build capacities of ULBs to catalyse the vision of the 74th Amendment Act, 1992, and remove constraints in governance to not just improve service delivery, but also make them equitable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/shaping-india-s-urban-future-101614945959101.html
