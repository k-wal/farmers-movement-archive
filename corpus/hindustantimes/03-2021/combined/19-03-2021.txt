He further said that officials of the four districts had been told to restrict playing loudspeakers at all religious places between 10pm to 6am. Action will be taken in case of violation. “The high court has given clear instructions that azaan is a religious practice, but use of loudspeakers for giving azaan is not a fundamental right. Under the Pollution Act [Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000], use of loudspeakers and public address systems at public places is restricted during the nighttime. They can be used under special circumstances at halls, cultural programmes etc with special permission of officials concerned only. The loudspeakers cannot be played on a regular basis during the nighttime as it is restricted under the Pollution Act,” the IG said.Allahabad University (AU) vice chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava, through a letter dated March 3, had urged senior administrative and police officials of Prayagraj to get azaan through loudspeakers stopped, claiming that the early morning call for prayer from the loudspeaker of a mosque near her home was disturbing her sleep. The vice chancellor had cited headache and loss in work hours as fallout of the morning azaan while seeking a quick response, officials had confirmed. Following the complaint, the mosque management committee on March 17 had changed the direction of one of the two loudspeakers on the minaret and also reduced the volume by half. Kaleem-ur-Rehman, muttawali (caretaker) of Lal Masjid on Clive Road, had said that after being informed by the local police about the problem being faced by AU VC, the mosque management committee immediately decided to take steps to redress the issue.“The volume of the system, which was already a decibel less than the norm set by the court, has been further reduced by half and direction of one of the loudspeakers has also been changed, so that it points away from the VC’s home,” he had said.The muttawali said that if the VC had simply spoken to the members of the mosque management committee, then they would have been obliged as their aim was never to cause any inconvenience to anyone living near the mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-up-districts-asked-to-enforce-ban-on-loudspeakers-from-10pm-to-6am-101616178386424.html

19-03-2021||Pune||Survey finds physical abuse in non-marital relationships among youth in Pune||A survey conducted among youth in Pune has revealed that even in non-marital relationships physical abuse co-occurred with emotional or sexual abuse. Of those reporting physical abuse, 64 percent reported emotional abuse, and 35 percent reported sexual abuse. Researchers found that physical abuse in the form of slapping, pushing, pinching, pulling hair, twisting hands, beating up was reported by 13.8 percent women and 2.9 percent men. The survey was conducted by the Prayas health group based in Pune. The study was focused on unmarried youth between the ages of 20 to 29 years. A total of 1,240 participants were enrolled in the study out of which 653 were men, 584 were women, and three participants marked their gender as other. The median age of the participants was 23 years. Trupti Darak, one of the researchers on the team said that this study is important as it explores the challenges the youth of this city is facing. “We often focus on marital relationships, but non-marital relationships are becoming a norm among youth and they face a plethora of circumstances in their relationships. We have found that many participants, men as well as women have experienced sexual abuse in their childhood, and this affects their relationships now. We have also seen that many participants are fearful and uncertain about their next relationships because of previous experiences,” said Darak. She further added that due to the stigma attached to the non-marital relationship, there were no support systems present for the participants. The study also finds that emotional and physical abuse was reported more in serious relationships compared to when the relationships were labeled as casual or exploring. However, sexual abuse did not differ according to the type of relationship. “Due to no support systems for the victims, they never shared any abuse with their family and so, they were very burdened for this, this resulted in depression, mental health issues, and anxiety. It is important that we look at these relationships very seriously as they affect the future decisions of the youth,” said Darak. The negative experiences during childhood such as experiencing sexual abuse during childhood, restriction by family, and experiencing severe parental disputes in the form of frequent quarrels or fights between parents were also factors related to higher reporting of sexual abuse, revealed the study. Key Findings Info: A survey has revealed that physical abuse co-occurred with emotional or sexual abuse in non-martial relationships *65% of participants reported experience of at least one form of child sexual abuse. The proportion of women experiencing any form of child sexual abuse was significantly higher than men (86% vs 47%). *More women (61%) reported depression compared to men (39%) * 84% women and 70% men of the participants reported having at least one relationship. *Almost 10% of the participants reported having five or more relationships that lasted for at least a month. *Of the 252 men who ever reported depression, a majority (89%) reported only one episode. Of the 390 women who ever reported depression, 65% reported only one episode and 35% reported more than one episode. *Of the total episodes of depression, 333 episodes were reported within 12 months from the interview dates and can be considered as current episodes of depression. Of these current episodes, 218 (65.5%) episodes were among women and 115 (34.5%) were among men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/survey-finds-physical-abuse-in-non-marital-relationships-among-youth-in-pune-101616178026901.html

The watch has tactile hour indicators of different shapes that makes it easy for the visually impaired people to recognise them,” claims prof Siddhartha Panda of IIT-K who developed it with Vishwaraj Srivastava, a research associate at the National Centre for Flexible Electronics, IIT Kanpur.“The user has to touch and scan the touch sensitive watch’s hour indicators and with the help of different vibration patterns, the watch communicates back the time information that is easily perceived by the user. This way, the person is able to read time,” the professor said. The institute has applied to get it patented.“As there is no need for an audio feedback, this watch will provide privacy of use. Also, one of the advantages of this watch over a standard mechanical watch is that unlike the mechanical needles present on that watch, this watch has no moving parts,” prof Panda said.“Our entire watch surface is one sturdy tactile surface and thus there is no fear of breaking the needles while touching the watch,” he added.Presently, there are some watches available for the visually impaired. The current mechanical watches were not user friendly. The user has to feel the needles of the hour hand and minute hand to know the time. “Also, as there are moving parts (i.e. these needles), there is a scope of breakage. Another available option is watches with an audio feedback. Again, there could be privacy issues with an audio output. So, we realised that there existed a need for a user-friendly, silent and sturdy watch,” Bharadwaj said.IIT Kanpur director, professor Abhay Karandikar tweeted, “A novel touch-sensitive watch for visually impaired has been developed by prof Siddhartha Panda and Vishwaraj Srivastava of IIT Kanpur to sense the time accurately and silently based on touch sensing and vibrations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/iitk-develops-touch-sensitive-watch-for-the-visually-impaired-101616177607770.html

Priyanka, a mother of three who earns her livelihood by imparting training at a gym in Baraut as her husband has some spinal problem, made the request when the commissioner was hearing issues related to the villagers and seeking their suggestions for the development of the village on Tuesday. Commissioner Singh admitted that for a while he was taken aback.“It was the first instance in my career that a woman was demanding an exclusive gym for girls in a village,” said Singh and he looked towards Baghpat DM Rajkamal Yadav who was equally surprised at the idea of a village woman.Singh said they announced then and there to establish an exclusive open gym for girls in the village, claiming that it would be first-of-its-kind in the state. Singh said it would give a boost to the CM’s message to empower girls and women under the ongoing Mission Shakti in the state.While praising Priyanka, district magistrate Rajkamal Yadav said work had already been started and the gym would be established in the next 15 days. “If girls and women show enthusiasm, we can also establish an indoor gym for them in future,” said Yadav and elaborated that multipurpose gym machines would be installed in the open gym.He said it was good to see that girls and women in villages wanted to join gym for their physical fitness and assured full support to them. The DM said since the district had produced many players of repute in shooting, Kabaddi and wrestling, the district administration would soon launch a sports promotion drive in the district working on different dimensions of sports to promote it further among the youth. As for Priyanka, she had to step out of her home to earn after her husband Situ, a marginal farmer, developed some problem in his spine some five years ago. First, she joined a women’s self-help group in the village and started earning ₹2000 per month.A fitness freak since her childhood, Priyanka decided to join a gym in Baraut town (6 km from the village) when she saw some boys of the village going there three years ago. Although it was difficult for her to shell out ₹500 per month for the gym, she somehow managed. Impressed by her dedication, the gym owner offered her the job of trainer around a year ago, she said.“Now I earn ₹5,000 per month and also keep my passion for fitness alive,” said a visibly enthusiastic Priyanka. She claimed that like boys, girls of the village also aspired for jobs in police and armed forces and therefore they kept doing running, jogging and other exercises for physical fitness. She also claimed that at least 10 to 12 girls of the village had been selected in Delhi police and other similar jobs.Former village head Ch Upendra Singh said like boys, girls of the village too gave importance to their physical fitness. As per him, many of them did running and jogging on a 400-metre track made around the field of Ch Shah Mal Inter College. “Officials’ decision to set up an open gym for girls in the village would inspire more girls and women to keep themselves healthy,” said Singh.Another village woman Puja Rani, 28, a mother of two, is practising for running a distance of 2400 metre in 14 seconds. “I have been selected for the post of jail warden and I have to undergo a physical test, including covering a distance of 2400 metre in 14 seconds”, said Puja.“For now, I take 16 seconds and therefore practising hard to be able to cover the said distance in 14 seconds,” she added.

The positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – also jumped to 0.93%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points in just two days. This is the highest positivity rate since the 0.98% recorded on December 28, when it had dipped below 1% consistently for the first time in the city. With the positivity rate inching close to 1%, doctors across the city said Delhi may be looking at another surge in cases. The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday had said, “The positivity rate is currently under 1%, it has been so for a couple of months now. Till the time the positivity remains below 1%, it is okay but people should remain alert and wear masks. Compared to other cities, Delhi is in a better position. Maharashtra has a positivity rate of 19.3%, Punjab 4.96%, Madhya Pradesh 4.89%, Kerala 3.49%, Haryana 2.88%, and Gujarat 1.92%.” The number of active cases, or those currently living with infection, also crossed the 3,000-mark on Friday. According to the daily health bulletin, there were 3,165 active cases in the city till Thursday night, of which more than half – 1,624 – were in home isolation. There were 820 people hospitalised across the city. Delhi has also increased the number of tests being conducted as per the Centre’s directive to states that are seeing an increase in the number of Covid cases. There were over 73,000 tests conducted daily, on average, in the past seven days as compared to 67,000 tests the week before, and nearly 61,000 the week prior to that. However, Delhi still hasn’t reached its testing capacity. In the third week of December, over 83,000 tests were conducted each day, on average. However, only 53% of the tests were done using the more accurate RT PCR method as compared to over 62% in the past seven days. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology, the Indian Council of Medical Research, said, “With the increase in the positivity rate, we have to now focus on testing as many people as possible and detecting as many cases as possible. Then, there is a need for extensive contact tracing for each case and testing those contacts. The focus has to be on RT PCR tests.” As the RT PCR tests amplify the genetic material of the virus to detect it in patient sample, it is more accurate as compared to the rapid antigen test that is known to throw up false negatives for as many as half of the positive people tested using that method.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/daily-covid-cases-cross-700-mark-a-first-since-dec-positivity-rate-also-on-the-uptick-101616177426255.html
19-03-2021||Gurugram||Vehicle-free trial in Sadar Bazar starts today||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will commence its one-week trial of turning Sadar Bazar into a vehicle-free, pedestrian-friendly market from Saturday, according to a statement issued by the civic body Friday.Despite its narrow lanes, Sadar Bazar has a footfall of around 20,000 people during weekends and congestion has become its hallmark. It is the city’s oldest market, set up in the 1930s and has more than 1,200 shops and 400 street vendors.As per a design plan prepared by the MCG for the trial, 18 entry and exit points to the market will be barricaded and passes have been issued to all shopkeepers to station vehicles at five designated sites, chosen by the municipal body in the market’s vicinity, less than 100-150 metres from shops.For the general public, the MCG has shortlisted sites at Old Jail Complex, Grover ground and the ground near the session house to park vehicles.A feeder service of 15 e-rickshaws will ferry commuters from these three parking spots to the market.Overall, a 650-metre stretch of the market, between Jama Masjid and Head Post office — the market’s main street — has been chosen for the trial and will remain completely vehicle-free till next Saturday, said MCG officials.Besides barring entry of vehicles, the MCG is also setting up dedicated street vending zones on lanes running parallel to the 650m stretch, installing benches, streetlights, and developing green belts.“The week-long trial will be a quick, innovative and low-cost project. The main street of Sadar Bazar will be kept free from vehicles and there will be a system for parking vehicles of shopkeepers and shoppers. This trial will not only benefit citizens visting Sadar Bazar but also shopkeepers,” said Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG.Kaur further said if the market is “orderly, safe, encroachment-free, clean and beautiful,” then there will be an increase in the number of shoppers and as a result, business will also thrive.The trial stretch is nine to 13 metres wide but encroachment and haphazard parking has reduced the available space significantly.The trial was scheduled to be held last month from February 26 onwards, however, just a day before it was scheduled to start, MCG had deferred it indefinitely citing technical reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vehiclefree-trial-in-sadar-bazar-starts-today-101616177307046.html

The Bharat Mata Vahini group was demanding that offering prayers in public parks and spaces be stopped. Anticipating a law-and-order situation, the police said they had deployed a large number of personnel in the area at the time of the prayers. No untoward incident happened and the congregation offered prayers and left the park peacefully, police said.A senior police officer, who was present at the spot, said they had detained chief of the group, Dinesh Thakur. “Thakur was detained as soon as he reached the spot. He had come alone and was not expecting the police to be present there. He was detained for around three hours before being allowed to go,” he said, requesting anonymityA group of Vahini members, who reached the spot later, allegedly tried to create a commotion but left after they were warned of arrest. “We ensured that there was no confrontation. No one will be allowed to create trouble in the city in the name of religion,” the senior officer, quoted above, said. Thakur was later released, he added.Thakur said they had submitted a memorandum to the Gurugram police on Thursday demanding that religious prayers in public spaces be stopped as they were against the rules.“We had gone to the Sector 40 park to protest peacefully against this practice of offering prayers in parks. Why are Hindus not allowed to offer prayers or religious programmes in parks? We had submitted memorandums on Thursday but the manner in which I was detained was illegal,” said Thakur. In 2019, there was tension in the city after a few Hindu groups opposed the Muslims offering religious prayers in public parks and spaces. “This incident has come into our notice and we are working with the district administration and police to resolve all issues peacefully. We will hold discussions with everyone and ensure that there is no trouble in the city,” said Haji Shehzad Khan, chairman, Muslim Ekta Manch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/chief-of-right-wing-group-detained-for-trying-to-stop-friday-prayers-at-sec-40-park-101616177306297.html

They also said that people turned up to buy meat on Tuesdays as well and there was not much slowdown in sale on that particular day.The MCG’s house meeting on Thursday saw two councillors proposing that meat shops in the city remain closed on Tuesdays keeping religious sentiments in mind. Even though the municipal commissioner, Vinay Pratap Singh, said that it was an individual choice, the proposal was approved after officials pointed out that as per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation bylaws, 2008, any municipal corporation across the state has the power to close meat shops on a single day of a week, with immediate effect.MCG officials on Friday said the new rule will be implemented from next week onwards. “Over the last 12 months, a number of factors beyond our control have impacted and reduced business already. The direction to close shops one day a week is only going to hit our businesses further. The MCG should realise that only one community, that also a few members from among them, does not prefer eating meat on Tuesdays. Others consume meat and MCG should factor this and cancel this decision,” said Arif Khan, a meat seller in sector 12.Pritam Bhagat, president of Jacobpura meat shops association said that the association will write to the MCG on the matter.“Besides writing to the MCG, there is little else we can do. Meat shops carry out sizeable business on Tuesdays. Closing them will only lead to loss of business. We will write to the MCG to withdraw their decision,” said Bhagat.A few meat shop owners said that they were waiting for official communication or notice from the MCG on the matter.“We have only seen the development on social media and in news. We are yet to receive any official communication from the MCG on the matter. We will take requisite action after receiving an official communication,” said David Watharkar, owner David & Company, a meat shop in DLF Phase 1. Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, who oversees issuance of licences to meat shops, besides fining and seizing of illegal ones, said that the civic body will start enforcement measures starting next Tuesday and close meat shops found operating on the day.Singla said that the owners will be initially given verbal warnings from the MCG to shift to this change, and continued violation will invite penalties and the possibility of sealing of their shops.“Similar to other enforcement measures, we will give ample time to meat shop owners to shift to this change. After official warnings, we will start levying fines on them and if they continue to disobey the order, we will seal their shops,” said Singla.He further said that the MCG will be meeting before Monday to constitute teams of officials for enforcement measures and for issuing an official notification to meat shop owners, regarding the closing of meat shops on Tuesdays.MCG officials also said that they will be examining the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation bylaws, 2008, to see if online meat delivery stores will also come under the purview.At least two online meat delivery stores did not comment on the matter. The closure of meat shops also took a political turn with the ruling party and the opposition having a different stance on the matter.“Every occupation has one day off in a week. The MCG has taken a decision to shut down meat shops on Tuesday on the advice of meat shop owners. The shopkeepers are of a view that fewer people eat meat on Tuesday and their business will not be affected by observing off on Tuesday,” said OP Dhankar, Haryana BJP president.In the Haryana Legislative Assembly on Friday, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Leader of Opposition, however, condemned MCG’s decision.“Gurugram is a cosmopolitan city, and such type of decisions should be taken after taking advice from various stakeholders,” said Hooda.With inputs from Pawan Sharma in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mcg-order-will-have-heavy-impact-on-business-say-gurugram-meat-shop-owners-101616177249117.html

He also directed officials to keep an eye on large gatherings and crowding at public places such as markets. Gurugram reported 184 new Covid-19 cases on Friday — the highest per day infections in the past three months. (PLS CHECK)“Action has to be taken against people violating mask discipline. It has been directed by the CM to strictly challan people not wearing masks in public places. Testing and contact tracing will also be increased in the district to identify areas where infection has been prevalent,” deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who attended the meeting with the CM, said quoting Khattar. Officials said after a consistent decline in the fresh cases, people were fatigued with the pandemic discipline and turned complacent throwing caution to the wind. It has led to a dramatic increase in cases over the last two weeks, they said. On Friday, the total active case count in the city reached 742 and the total tally was at 60,385. The death toll due to the viral infection was at 360. According to the chief medical officer, Dr Virender Yadav, the test positivity rate — positive cases out of the total samples tested — has hit 3%. The union ministry health and family welfare data shows that Gurugram is among the eight affected districts across Haryana which has noticed spike in cases. In the last one week (March 13-19) at least 687 new infections have emerged compared to 474 reported between March 6 and 12. Following the state government’s directions to focus upon test, track and treat strategy, the district health department has started administering 4,000 tests from Thursday onwards. But they have been undertaking vaccination on priority to cover maximum people vulnerable to contract coronavirus infection. In the district task force meeting held on Friday, Yadav directed private hospitals to increase their vaccination coverage. “Antibodies against the coronavirus get developed in the body after 42 days of the first dose. Therefore, people should follow basic respiratory hygiene and wear masks to avoid getting infected,” said Yadav. The surge in cases has become a concern as schools have reopened, with government schools particularly reporting a good turnout. Khattar has also directed that Covid-19 protocols should be followed in schools. Besides, appropriate arrangements for social distancing in agricultural mandis have to be done where procurement of mustard and wheat has been scheduled from April 1 onwards, Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-directs-officials-to-increase-chalans-for-violating-mask-discipline-101616177248542.html
19-03-2021||Gurugram||Administration to form committee to keep watch on gatherings, RWAs to be roped in||The district administration — along with officials drawn from the health department and police force — will form a committee to keep an eye on social gatherings in the district in wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases. The committee will co-ordinate with Residents Welfare Associations (RWA), especially for the upcoming festival of Holi, to monitor compliance of all Covid-19 protocols in potential gatherings with large crowd.“As directed by the chief minister, the committee will have representatives from deputy commissioner’s office and those from the district health and police departments. The course of action is yet to be decided but letters will be sent to RWAs regarding events, where large crowd gathering is expected,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram on Friday. On Friday, in a state-level meeting with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and health minister Anil Vij, the district administration was directed to adopt several measures to control the resurgence of Covid infection, with special focus on keeping tabs on gatherings that have the potential of turning into super-spreader events. On February 2, the district administration had lifted the ceiling on the number of people attending gatherings in closed spaces. Earlier, functions in closed spaces had an upper limit of 200 guests. However, now there is no cap on number of guests subject to the condition that the guest number is equal to or less than 50 percent of the hall’s capacity. In open spaces, there is no limit on the gathering but capacity of the place to accommodate people has to be considered. States can even issue their specific guidelines for regulations on social, religious, sports, entertainment, education, cultural or religious gathering, according to the Central government guidelines issued on January 27.“Knowing that cases have increased in the last few days, we have been thinking to postpone the RWA’s Holi gettogether on March 27. Whatsapp messages are being sent to people to not hold any Holi celebrations in parks and to limit meeting people,” said Amir Singh Yadav, president, sector 15 (part 2) RWA. “We are also in the process of identifying eligible vaccine beneficiaries who have not taken the shots till now. They will be helped and encouraged to get vaccinated.” Sunil Yadav, president, sector 47 RWA, however, said that it is difficult to keep vigil in non-gated societies. “It is easy to monitor activities in condominiums and gated societies. We will be soon sending messages on RWA Whatsapp groups to follow basic hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing norms during Holi,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/administration-to-form-committee-to-keep-watch-on-gatherings-rwas-to-be-roped-in-101616177247519.html

According to the revised directives issued by the district health department on Friday, vaccination centres in 13 big hospitals of the city will now open from 8am to 8pm, and the remaining 143 sites will operate between 9am and 5pm. “Only a few people turned up for vaccination late in the night. The response has been poor in both government and private hospitals. Therefore, hospitals have been told not to schedule appointments for overnight vaccination after March 31,” said Dr Singh. Till March 17, only 27 people were vaccinated at the six hospitals during the night hours. Officials said vaccination timings at 13 hospitals have been advanced based on the suggestions given by the hospitals and also because it was found that people were more comfortable visiting the centres early in the day. “The time duration for vaccination drive in 13 private hospitals has been revised. The vaccination will now start from 8am and continue till 8pm. Earlier this week, schedules were revised to 9am to 9pm slots, which has now been changed to start vaccination early,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Among the 13 hospitals, 11 are private facilities — Medanta, Max, Fortis, Artemis, Narayana, Park, Kalyani, CK Birla, Paras, Signature and Medeor. The other two centres are Civil Hospital in sector 10 and Polyclinic in sector 31. Out of these facilities, five ran 24/7 vaccination centres to increase the coverage and to help people bring along their aged parents to the vaccination centre before or after their office hours. Data shows that less than 10 people have taken shots in private facilities during the night hours from March 15 onwards. With an aim to increasing the vaccination coverage, private hospitals have been advised to coordinate with Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) on holding drives in societies and condominiums, considering they have enough space to set up registration, vaccination and observation rooms within the premises. “Private hospitals can coordinate with RWAs to set up vaccination centres within the premises of the society. The hospitals will have to first prepare the plan, which will be implemented only after discussions with the health department,” said Yadav. Vaccination sites in the government set-up have also been increased. “Over 81 sub-centres under community and primary health centres have been activated to increase the outreach of vaccine in different areas. Vaccination will now be carried out at 156 centres, including 100 government facilities and 56 private hospitals,” said Yadav. On Friday, at least 2086 people above 60 years and 813 aged between 45 and 59 took the vaccine shots. Overall, over 140,000 lakh people in the district have been vaccinated from January 16 onwards. A helpline number (7015663108 and 108) for all Covid-19 vaccine related queries, vaccination sites and schedule has also been launched by the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/247-vaccination-to-be-discontinued-from-april-1-101616177246283.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast has strong winds for the next two days followed by possibility of rain next week. On Friday, Noida had a maximum and minimum temperature of 34.5 and 22.3 degree Celsius, respectively, as against 34.3 degree Celsius and 18.1 degree Celsius, respectively, on Thursday.“There is an increase in the minimum temperature because there is a cloud cover that leads to trapping of heat. Also the winds are southerly at times, which are comparatively warmer. The region will see strong winds for next two days and may see rains on March 22 and 23 which could help improving the pollution levels and cool down the temperatures,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Friday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 302 against 336 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 359 against 387 a day earlier. Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 340 on Friday against 373 on Thursday.An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality may improve due to better ventilation over next 48 hours.“PM10 is the lead pollutant as long range transport of dust from the dry arid southwest regions continues to contribute, but likely to decrease for next 48 hrs. Surface winds are south southwesterly and moderate, forecasted improve during the next 48 hrs. Better ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively. AQI is likely to marginally improve and stay in the lower end of the Very Poor to Poor category for tomorrow and further improve to Poor AQI for 21st and 22nd March,” said a SAFAR statement on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-improves-slightly-strong-surface-winds-predicted-101616177187984.html

They then sent them back home without any jobs,” he said.The suspects would share the Aadhar numbers and ban account details to others. “Our investigation showed that they would hack websites and bank accounts and transfer money to these accounts and immediately withdraw them from an ATM,” Kumar said. This way, it would be harder to trace the suspects.Police said they recovered 18 Aadhaar cards, 18 PAN cards, 11 mobile phones, seven passports, two LPG connection cards, seven DMRC travel cards, four debit cards, two voter IDs, three Nepali IDs, one laptop, one dongle, one hard disc and a chequebook of Bank of America from the suspects. Apart from this, police recovered 120 Nepali rupees, 21,500 Cambodian Riel, and ₹14,000 Indian currency. Kamal Rabilal Sharma allegedly told police that he travelled to different countries using the stolen money and hence he has international currencies and documents. Police are yet to figure out the number of people cheated by the gang.A case has been registered against them under Section 420 (cheating), Section 467 (forgery), Section 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC. “They were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said addl DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-persons-including-two-nepali-citizens-arrested-in-cyber-fraud-101616177186929.html

Senior officers said the two children sustained minor burns in the incident. All three of them are stated to be stable. Police said the blaze started around 2.30 am at Bengali Basti, apparently from a heap of garbage that probably caught fire from a cigarette. The fire soon spread to nearby areas and at least 14 jhuggis were gutted. As soon as the residents of the jhuggi cluster spotted the fire, they raised the alarm. The police received a call reporting the fire at 2.45 am. They immediately alerted the Delhi Fire Service (DFS) and ten fire tenders were rushed to the spot to contain the blaze. Atul Garg, director, DFS said it took his men at least three hours of firefighting to contain the blaze. The cooling operations, however, went on for a little longer. “Three people — a man and two children — were injured in the blaze and they were taken to Safdarjung hospital by the police,” he said. Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said that they have learnt that the man, identified as Mukesh Singh, 35, was injured while trying to save two children, who were trapped in one of the jhuggis during the fire. The two children are aged 4 and 2 years. They have also sustained minor burns. All three were taken to a hospital for treatment. All of them are fine now,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-injured-in-slum-fire-in-vasant-kunj-101616177128978.html

The courts will now return to its earlier system of hybrid hearings (virtual and in-person) and permitting lawyers to join the proceedings through video conferencing.Manoj Jain, registrar general of the Delhi high court, said in a meeting of the administrative and general supervision committee held on Friday, it was resolved that hybrid hearings and links would be given to lawyers.Earlier on Tuesday, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to reconsider its decision of throwing courts open to in-person hearings after a group of lawyers, led by advocate Rajiv Nayyar, had challenged the decision before the apex court.On February 20, the high court in an order had said that it, along with all district courts, would be holding in-person hearings from March 15 while adding that only in exceptional cases, the high court may permit any of the parties and/or their lawyers to join the proceedings through video conferencing, subject to the availability of requisite infrastructure. This, however, was challenged by a group of lawyers, even though no relief was granted by a division bench of the Delhi high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/courts-to-return-to-hybrid-hearings-as-covid-cases-rise-again-101616177126863.html

The suspect’s accomplice, who had managed to flee on a motorcycle, was caught later in the evening, as the woman officer had captured pictures of him as well the motorcycle’s registration number on her cellphone, the police said.Assistant sub-inspector Manju Tomar, who is posted on Supreme Court security duty, said she was standing near the CPJ College bus stop with her daughter, when around 11.30am, two men on a motorcycle stopped near them to ask after an address. When Tomar said she did not know the location, the duo left but stopped the bike a few metres ahead of the bus stop.“The man riding pillion got off and walked towards me, snatched my bag and fled. My daughter chased him and caught him by his shirt. A scuffle broke out between them and the items in my bag fell on the road. While my daughter was trying to overpower the man, I went to catch his accomplice, after a DTC driver showed me the motorcycle he was sitting on,” said Tomar.Tomar said she caught the other man, clicked pictures of him and his bike. However, the man claimed he was innocent and said he did not know the snatcher. Since her daughter was still trying to overpower the snatcher, she rushed to help her. In the meantime, the second man fled on the bike.“The snatcher managed to flee and we ran behind him. I raised the alarm and asked some bikers to catch him. After chasing him for 500-600 metres, I felt a pain in my abdomen area and stopped. Some bikers and passers-by caught the suspect and brought him before me,” said Tomar.The mother-daughter duo, who sustained minor injuries, handed over the suspect to the police who had arrived at the crime scene after receiving a call alerting them about the incident. Police identified the suspected snatcher as Jitender alias Tinku. Tomar filed her complaint and also handed over the pictures of the second suspect.“The second suspect was caught later in the day. He was identified as Vikas alias Kale. Both were booked for robbery, dishonestly receiving property and common intention, a case regarding which was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 392, 411 and 34 at the Narela police station,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Rajiv Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-cop-daughter-chase-and-nab-snatcher-in-narela-101616177067608.html

Senior traffic officers said adequate diversions have been made to minimise the inconvenience to motorists. Police said the construction work is being carried out by the public works department (PWD), which will scramble a crossing at the Red Fort, between Digambar Lal Jain Mandir and Old Lajpat Rai Market, to carry out the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk, from Lal Jain Mandir to Fatehpuri Mosque. For that, half the carriageway width, going from Daryaganj towards Kashmere Gate would be closed to all vehicular traffic till April 20, in the first phase. Brijender Kumar Yadav, deputy commissioner of police, traffic, said to minimise the inconvenience to public, the road from Daryaganj to Old Delhi Railway Station will remain open. “All buses will be diverted from Delhi Gate to Raj Ghat - Ring Road - Shantivan - Hanuman Setu and via the ISBT to Tis Hazari towards Morigate till Old Delhi Railway Station. All other vehicles will be diverted from Subhash Park tri-junction to Nishad Raj Marg to reach the Ring Road and from there to Shantivan,” Yadav said. He said traffic coming from the Jama Masjid side and heading towards Kashmere Gate or Old Delhi Railway Station will either take the service road from parade ground parking towards Kabootar Market and then go to NS Marg towards Nishad Raj Marg and proceed accordingly. Alternatively, they may also go from Jama Masjid to Brijmohan Chowk in Daryaganj to Subhash Park T-Point and Nishad Raj Marg and proceed from there accordingly. Police also said adequate traffic signage have been put up at appropriate locations to guide motorists and additional traffic personnel will remain deployed in those parts to ensure smooth and uninterrupted flow of traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/half-carriageway-between-daryaganj-and-kashmere-gate-to-shut-for-a-month-101616177066862.html
19-03-2021||Delhi||UTTIPEC approves transit plan for group housing colonies||The apex traffic and transportation body in Delhi, UTTIPEC (Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre), on Friday approved the integrated transit plan made for handling the increased vehicular traffic around eight government group housing colonies that are being redeveloped by the Centre. The proposal, which includes the construction of a 14km long elevated corridor in South Delhi, aims at providing smooth access between Sarai Kale Khan and Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).The Centre is redeveloping eight colonies -- Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Srinivaspuri, Kasturba Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Mohammadpur, Thyagraj Nagar and East Kidwai nagar-- in an effort to provide better housing to its employees. NBCC India has already redeveloped East Kidwai Nagar and the Centre is presently constructing over 25,000 dwelling units and a commercial complex in the remaining seven colonies. The proposal was tabled in the UTTIPEC meeting, chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, on Friday. After the meeting, Baijal tweeted, “After detailed deliberations following proposals were approved: Integrated Transit Corridor Development and Street Network/ Connectivity Plan for the corridor and influence zone from Sarai Kale Khan to IGI Airport.”Baijal had asked the Delhi Development Authority to discuss the funding plan for the ₹5,000 crore (approximately) project with the Union housing urban affairs (HUA) ministry before it is cleared by the UTTIPEC. HT had reported about this on March 1. The matter was duly discussed in a meeting between HUA minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Baijal on March 2.A senior official aware of the development, on condition of anonymity, said as the funding issue has been addressed, the project was tabled in the UTTIPEC meeting on Friday for approval.The transit plan includes a 14km elevated corridor from INA on Aurobindo Marg to Mahipalpur underpass on National Highway-8 and connecting all flyovers between Moolchand and Moti Bagh, just before the start of the elevated Metro corridor on the Ring Road.The feasibility study for the corridor was done by Delhi government’s public works department, while it will be executed by the central public works department. The project cost, a senior official said, will be included in the cost of redevelopment of the government colonies. The redevelopment of seven group housing colonies is a self-financing project and the cost will be recovered from the sale of the commercial space, officials in the know of the matter said.The elevated corridor between INA and Mahipalpur is needed to cater to the increased traffic volume, especially on Ring Road. Senior DDA officials said the corridor will be an alternative route to reach the IGIA and will cover all residential colonies which are being redeveloped.Another proposal approved in the UTTIPEC meeting was the multimodal intergration plan of Karkardooma Metro station. The DDA is planning a transit oriented development project around the station and the project was reviewed in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uttipec-approves-transit-plan-for-group-housing-colonies-101616177006234.html
19-03-2021||Kolkata||TMC raises pitch against possible EVM rigging in upcoming Bengal polls||With just a week to go before the West Bengal assembly polls take off, the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress has raised its pitch against possible rigging of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). While chief minister Mamata Banerjee issued an impromptu three-point checklist for her party workers to follow to prevent rigging of EVMs, a TMC parliamentary delegation submitted a memorandum to the Election Commission of India with a demand to tally VVPAT machines with EVMs. A BJP team too submitted a memorandum to the poll body in Delhi urging action against Banerjee for allegedly spreading propaganda against the BJP and the ECI. “On the polling day, even if they (polling officers) tell you that the EVM has malfunctioned, don’t go back home. Secondly, before the actual poll starts, they would press the buttons 30 times (mock poll) to show that everything is fine with the EVM. Then they would restart the EVM. But you insist that the EVM should be switched on and off at least twice before the actual poll starts. Thirdly, guard the EVMs (in the safe rooms) even after the polls. Don’t accept any food as it could be laced. If the security officials or police ask you to go away, don’t leave. It is your job to protect the EVM after the polls,” said Banerjee.Banerjee addressed three public rallies in three constituencies – Egra, Patashpur and Tamluk - in East Midnapore district. She repeated the same in all the rallies. Also read: 25% candidates in Bengal polls have declared criminal cases against themselvesWhile the eight-phase elections would kick start from March 27, counting would be held on May 2. The BJP took a jibe at Banerjee saying that the ECI had earlier thrown a challenge for political parties to tamper EVMs but nobody succeeded. “The chief minister raising the EVM issue and urging workers to guard the EVMs can mean only two things. Either she is apprehending that her workers are lacking the morale and enthusiasm to see it to the end and that’s why she is repeatedly asking them to guard EVMs till the last or she is suffering from fear of defeat. Their tenure has reached the fag end. The politically aware citizens of Bengal will not take such theories of the chief minister,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who addressed a rally in Bengal’s Purulia district on Thursday, tweeted on Friday, “BJP winning in West Bengal would mark the start of a new era of development in the state. At the same time, bullying by TMC cadres will stop.” Modi is scheduled to address another rally at Kharagpur in West Midnapore on Saturday. The TMC hit back saying the BJP was trying to hide its infighting with irrelevant tweets.“The tweet is irrelevant at this point because the Prime Minister is coming to West Bengal almost every day. Actually, the BJP knows that it is going to be defeated. It is just trying to hide the infighting which has cropped up within the party after the announcement of candidates and hence such tweets are being uploaded to create hype and divert attention,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-raises-pitch-against-possible-evm-rigging-in-upcoming-bengal-polls-101616176526919.html

They urged the farmers to stay united. “The farmers’ concerns will be addressed when there is a party in power that takes farmer’ issues seriously. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) could not keep its promise to double the income of farmers and, rather, brought steps like demonetisation, GST (Goods and Services Tax) and lockdown, which have wrecked the nation’s economy,” Akhilesh Yadav said. “All have to remain alert and maintain unity,” he added. Yadav described former Prime Minister the late Chaudhary Charan Singh as the greatest farmer leader of all times. Similarly, Jayant Chaudhary said, “Farmers should vote as farmers on the voting day and not get divided in the name of caste and religion.” “Farmers have to make it clear that they are a formidable force and they need to be recognised by those in power,” he said. “The BJP says that this is not a farmers’ agitation, but an agitation by Jats, when, in fact, this is not correct,” he said. “The BJP has ignored the demands by farmers, whose agitation is 114 days’ old, and more than 300 farmers have sacrificed their lives for the cause,” the RLD vice- president stated.

19-03-2021||Patna||Govt considers hike for Ayush doctors||The state government is contemplating an increase in the remuneration of Ayush doctors on the same pattern of revision of MBBS junior doctors done a few years back. Health minister Mangal Pandey on Friday informed the state Assembly that the proposal of increasing the stipend of Ayush (indigenous medicine) was under active consideration of the government. He said the government had already increased the remuneration of Ayush doctors from ₹24,000 to ₹44,000 a few years back. Raising the issue, RJD’s Alok Kumar Mehta said the Ayush doctors were eligible for enhanced remuneration which are at par with MBBS junior doctors (done in 2019). The MBBS junior doctors, on contract, get a remuneration of ₹65,000. “ We are considering it,” the minister said. The minister said the government had already increased the stipend of post graduate medical students in all medical/ dental colleges as per an order on January 8,2021. Excess payment to a firm: Committee to probe allegations A House committee will be constituted to probe the alleged charges of granting excess payment to the company, Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL), without the firm completing its work of putting up a portal as per the agreement. Labour resources minister Jibesh Kumar told the Assembly that the MKCL had entered into an agreement with the labour department for skill development of youths in 2016 for five years. The minister , while replying to a call attention motion, said the firm had not put up the portal for placement although it received an excess payment of over ₹24 lakh. The Opposition and ruling party members, however, alleged there had been wide scale financial bunglings in payments while demanding a thorough probe from the House committee. It was on the insistence of the members that the Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha directed that a House committee would be formed to look into the alleged irregularities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/govt-considers-hike-for-ayush-doctors-101616172985479.html
19-03-2021||Ranchi||Pathalgadi movement gets more refined, demands implementation of rules||Pathalgadi movement, once regarded as a tribal separatist movement, was now getting more refined and polished, as its supporters start to raise demand for strict implementation of laws meant for administration of scheduled areas (tribal region) identified under the Constitution.Pathalgadi is a practice adopted by many tribal villages in recent times to declare their gram sabha as the only sovereign authority, as per laws applicable in areas under fifth schedule of the Constitution.Under this practice, huge stone plaques, called Pathalgadi in the local dialect, were put up outside tribal settlements, mainly in Khunti district, stating that laws made by the Parliament or the state Assembly were not applicable in the region, besides warning outsiders from entering, wandering, living or settling down in the village.Many residents of such villages abandoned their documents, namely Aadhar, ration, and voter identity cards, as a show of protest. They also rejected development projects in the areas by disallowing entry of government officials.The movement was, however, quelled in 2018, following police action and arrest of its leaders, most of whom were charged with sedition.After a two-year long lull, the movement has regained momentum, but in a refined form. Now, emphasis was being laid on strict implementation of Panchayats (Extension of Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, in Jharkhand’s 13 scheduled districts.The aforesaid law ensures self-governance through traditional gram sabhas for people living in tribal areas identified under the fifth schedule of the Constitution. It also protects tribals’ rights regarding land, water and forest, and traditional tribal social customs.On this line, social workers of five revenue villages in worst-hit Khunti district, which witnessed violent clashes between Pathalgadi supporters and police in 2017-18, summoned a two-day meeting of ‘Aadivasi Munda Samaj’ to create awareness about tribal culture and customs on March 18 and 19.Pamphlets were distributed to encourage large gathering at the event that was planned at village Hadadlama-Banapidhi under Arki block of the district.However, some locals alleged the meeting was convened with an “ill motive” to instigate village residents against the system. The district police and para military forces too swung into action and intensified patrolling in the region.However, chief guest at the function and national president of ‘Aadivasi Munda Samaj’ Daamu Munda refuted the allegations. He said, “It was planned to hold a peaceful meeting truly aimed at creating social awareness among dominant Munda tribe in the region. But, misinformation and rumours were circulated about the event by linking it to Pathalgadi. As a result, police became active and we were asked to postpone it. We, too, do not want to vitiate the atmosphere and disturb social harmony. We have, therefore, postponed our programme as of now.”He added, “As a result of Pathalgadi movement, our Munda society got divided into two factions, one led by its supporters and the other by those opposing the movement. It was also planned to reunite the two factions at the event.”Arki police station officer in-charge Pankaj Kumar Das said, “No such meeting was held in the area. Moreover, due to Covid-19, large gathering of people is not allowed.”Fearing police action, tribal social workers and supporters hesitate to directly link themselves to Pathalgadi movement. Softening their stand and acting within legal boundaries, they demand implementation of PESA in tribal dominant regions.Almost a month ago, more than 100 tribal people from Gumla district arrived in state capital Ranchi with a large stone plaque that they wanted to install near the Jharkhand high court. A delegation of these people under the banner of Kudukh National Council (KNC) also met the Governor at the time to raise their demands.Refusing to equate this practice of raising stone plaques with Pathalgadi, Daneshwar Toppo, a member of the KNC, said, “We wanted strict implementation of 2007 gazette notification of Union ministry of law and justice under order 229, declaring 12 districts in Jharkhand as scheduled areas. Through this notification, it has been made explicitly clear that executive power of the state of Jharkhand does not extend to the scheduled areas. These scheduled districts are the heritage of scheduled tribes and the administration of these areas will be governed and controlled by the common consensus of the gram sabha. There is no right to freedom for general public in the scheduled areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/pathalgadi-movement-gets-more-refined-demands-implementation-of-rules-101616172925508.html
19-03-2021||Ranchi||State will recommend SC to remove 50% cap on reservation: CM Soren||The Jharkhand government will inform the Supreme Court that the state was a votary to remove the 50% cap on reservation in government jobs to those belonging to Scheduled Tribe (ST), Scheduled Caste (SC) and Other Backward Categories (OBC), chief minister Hemant Soren (CM) said on Friday. Responding to budgetary discussions in the state Assembly, the CM chief said the apex court has sought views of all states on the issue and they will put forth their opinion accordingly. “Few states crossed the barrier of 50% reservation, following which the respective High Courts quashed the decision. Those states have appealed in the Supreme Court. The apex court has taken cognisance and has now sought opinion over removal of the 50% cap in all the states, as it’s a national issue. We have decided that we will recommend to go beyond the 50% cap,” said Soren. Increasing reservation, especially to OBCs in the state has been a long standing demand. All major parties in the past, including the BJP, JMM, Congress, AJSU Party, JVM (P), have promised to increase OBC reservation in the state, which currently stands at 14%.The reservation to the scheduled categories in the state was currently capped at 50%, besides 10% quota to EWS (Economically Weaker Section) in the general category. While STs get 26% quota, SCs get 10%.In the run up to the 2019 state polls, the BJP promised to increase reservation for OBCs in proportion to their population and within the ambit of constitutional provisions. Other major players, including the JMM, Congress, JVM (P) and AJSU Party, also promised to increase OBC reservation to 27% in their election manifesto. The ruling JMM, which is the lead party in the incumbent JMM-Congress-RJD combine government, promised to also increase reservation for STs and SCs by 2% each.In his hour-long speech in the Assembly, the CM elaborated on his government’s plans that he said “will give a direction to the state” and help in achieving the purpose for which the state came into existence two decades ago after a long movement. As the CM launched a scathing attack on the opposition BJP and its alleged “misadventures” during the previous Raghubar Das regime, the BJP legislators staged a walk out from the House and the CM gave most parts of his speech in absence of opposition members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-will-recommend-sc-to-remove-50-cap-on-reservation-cm-soren-101616172866148.html

The buses were flagged off by Ranchi mayor Asha Lakra and RMC chief executive officer (CEO) Mukesh Kumar from city’s Kutchery chowk. The bus will run between Kutchery Chowk and Rajendra Chowk, around 7km, at a nominal charge of ₹5.The service that takes its name from the colour of the bus was aimed at providing safe mode of transportation to women, who regularly face physical and mental harassment by miscreants on public transportation, officials said.Barring the driver, the buses have an all-female staff. However, the civic body was in search of a woman driver, officials said.It was to be noted that RMC was running two such buses earlier too. However, the service was suspended after thr lockdown triggered by Covid-19 pandemic was implemented in March last year. Besides, the old buses failed to get attention, as they were of the same colour as that of other city buses. Moreover, the old buses started to pick male passengers due to low turnout of female passengers.However, RMC officials were hopeful that the new pink buses will turn out to be a success, as they were rolled out exclusively for women. “A toll free number will be provided in the bus on which passengers can lodge complaint in case male passengers were given entry into the bus or other issues,” the Ranchi mayor said.RMC CEO Mukesh Kumar said, “Two more pink buses are being prepared. They will be rolled out between Dhurwa to Kishori Yadav Chowk via Kantatoli next week.”On the first day of being rolled out, the buses received positive response, officials said. RMC city manager Nandlal Baraik, who was looking after the city bus operation in Ranchi, said, “The buses received a positive response on the very first day. College students and working women used the buses. After seeing this response, more buses will be plied in the city.”Sarita Devi, a passenger, said, “The most attractive part of the pink bus is its fare. It is providing a journey of 7km at just ₹5, while other modes of transport, whether an auto or e-rickshaw, take at least ₹20 for the same route.”With the addition of the two buses, the number of buses plying on city roads rose to 32. Apart from the buses, “pink auto service” was also popular in the city since 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-capital-rolls-out-pink-buses-for-women-101616172865454.html

We got to know many important details from the cop during investigation which will be revealed after completion of police probe. Security has been tightened outside the gangster’s house,” the SP added.A senior police official, who is part of the investigation, while pleading anonymity, said that the attack on Ajay and his father was executed by members of Ram Karan gang.“During questioning, the accused cop confessed that he had attacked the gangster on behest of Ram Karan, who had provided him the illegal weapon from which he fired shots at Ajay,” the cop added.“The cop was also doing illegal liquor business and the gangster had taken extortion amount of ₹15 lakh from him. After the gangster demanded more money from him, the cop joined hands with Ajay’s enemy Ram Karan, who is also a criminal and fired shots at him,” he said.Gangster Ajay’s brother Rajesh alleged that his brother had good relations with the accused cop.“The cop used to take help from my brother in executing his plans. Mahesh was running a nexus of criminals and was involved in illegal liquor business. He had taken money from my brother and was not returning the amount. He fired shots at my brother after getting backing of the Ram Karan gang,” he added.Sonepat police defamed for having links with criminalsThis was not for the first time that a cop of the Sonepat police was booked for wrongdoings.In April 2017, criminal Sandeep Badwasni, boss of the dreaded gagster Ajay, was killed along with two of his accomplices at the home of Sonepat police cop Sanjeet alias Boda.Last year, inspector Jasbir and other cops were booked and later they were suspended for having links with liquor trader Bhupinder in connection with liquor bottles going missing from godowns during lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gangster-shot-at-accused-cop-sent-to-3-day-police-remand-101616172386060.html

One of the key weaknesses cited in the NAAC report for abysmal show of BN College, set up in 1889, is that “many of the faculty members are actively engaged in the political activities of the state that affects the academic work of the college”, a well-known fact that heads of several colleges in the state talk about in private but are unable to raise it in public for the fear of backlash.Former PU professor and social scientist N K Choudharysaid faculty members engaged in full-time politics and not attending classes was not desirable. “It has both moral and legal aspects. A university job is not government service and hence teachers cannot be barred from participating in politics and political discourse after their teaching hours, but it cannot be allowed to happen at the cost of teaching. If a teacher gets some political assignment, he should be asked to go on leave. But unfortunately, when vice chancellors are political appointees, not much can be expected. It needs systemic improvement,” he said.The NAAC ratings have come as a rude shock to the prestigious Patna University, which has been unable to check the slide despite an illustrious past due to varied reasons. Patna Science College and Patna Law College had also earlier barely managed to be just a notch above with ‘B’ grade, while Magadh Mahila College slid from ‘A’ to ‘B++’. Patna University had also barely managed ‘B++’ in the first cycle. Earlier, BN College and Vanijya Mahavidyalay were disqualified by the NAAC due to alleged discrepancies in the self-status report (SSR) and unsatisfactory/or lack of replies to the explanations sought on their claims by NAAC. While BN CoIlege tried to make amends with fresh application, which was accepted, Vanijya developed cold feet. Other weaknesses identified include large-scale vacant teaching positions, no research projects in the last five years, no post-graduate programme and research centre, no medical facility in the college and improper condition of hostel and management system. A senior college functionary admitted that around eight of the 53 faculty members were actively into politics and affiliated to mainstream political parties. The most alarming trend is that like most other institutions of higher learning in the state, BN College, too, has fared poorly in student support and progression, research, innovations and extension. BN College principal Rajkishore Prasad said the institution at least expected ‘B’ rank, but it slipped due to reasons beyond its control. “The fact is that the student feedback is not good and there is acute shortage of teachers. Our history department has no teacher, while political science has just one. Expecting PG teaching and research with such faculty strength is sheer wishful thinking. We missed ‘B’ rank with a slender margin, but we will try again, provided we get the support to get our basics right,” he said.The rank of institutions is determined on the basis of CGPA (Cumulative Grade Points Average) calculation based on the scores obtained from the three sources, viz. the system generated source (SGS) of the quantitative metrics which comprise about 70% of the total, the scores from the qualitative, critical appraisal by the peer team through on-site visit and the scores obtained on the student satisfaction survey. These are collated through an automated procedure based on benchmarks for assessment on a seven point-scale, starting with A++, A+ and A, B++, B+ and B and C. Patna University had earlier barely managed ‘B+’, but it is the highest grade for any state university in Bihar and speaks about the condition of higher education. “The bitter truth is that the institutions alone could not be blamed for the slide. Many of the university websites are without syllabus, five-year question papers for students, activities’ calendar, though holiday calendar comes in advance. How can one expect student feedback to be good. If this is the condition of PU, one can well imagine the scenario in other institutions,” said a senior PU professor, adding that at least NAAC snub should work as a wake-up call for the state institutions as well as the government due to strict guidelines under the Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyaan (RUSA).

Awadhesh Narayan Singh, working chairman of the Bihar Legislative Council, announced this in the House following debate on a question raised by Congress member Prem Chandra Mishra on Friday. Mishra alleged that Vidyapeeth, one among the three set up by Mahatma Gandhi as alternative institutions to impart studies during the pre-Independence era, had wholly diverted from its core objectives. Set up on a sprawling 32-acre campus, it also had a museum dedicated to the first President Rajendra Prasad and library of a noted educationist and freedom fighter Maualama Mazharul Haque. “Instead of pursuing the objectives of the institution, those in-charge of the premises are using it for commercial purposes,” Mishra alleged. Supporting Mishra’s contention, RJD member Sunil Kumar Singh said he had attended marriage celebrations at the Vidyapeeth, contrary to the contention of art and culture minister Alok Ranjan, who, citing a report from the department’s deputy director, claimed the premises were not being used for commercial purposes. RJD member Ram Chandra Purbe said Gandhi had established three institutions, Kashi Vidyapeeth, Gujarat Vidyapeeth and Bihar Vidyapeeth, as alternatives to the government’s educational institutions. Kashi Vidyapeeth is a university, while the one in Gujarat is also imparting good academic values. JD(U) member and littérateur Ram Vachan Rai too expressed his concern over misuse of the national heritage. The working chairman of Council, however, feared that the house committee might delay the submission of report, as has happened in the past. He said he had ordered an inquiry by a house committee during his previous stint as the chairman. “But members kept on retiring and the committee never submitted its report,” said Singh. Mishra, however, said the committee be given a deadline to submit its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/council-chairman-orders-house-panel-probe-into-working-of-bihar-vidyapeeth-101616172325923.html

We have to create fear among the citizens that they will be punished if found violating the Covid guidelines put in place to contain spread of the contagion,” the minister told superintendents of police (SPs).Vij, who also holds the home department portfolio, directed the SPs to send him daily report containing details of total number of people challaned for not wearing mask.“People don’t mend their ways without strictness,” Vij said, during a meeting that chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar held on Friday to review preparedness to combat the recent surge in Covid-19 cases across state.Vij’s direction for acting tough coincides with Haryana reported 872 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday, the highest in recent months.Of these, Gurugram recorded 184 cases, Panchkula 166, Karnal 114 and Kurukshetra 86. On Thursday, there were 633 fresh cases and six fatalities in Haryana.It is in this backdrop that Vij repeatedly underlined the need of increasing testing along with strictness in ensuring that the standard operating procedures (SOPs) are followed to contain the virus.Vij, who attended the meeting through video conferencing from Ambala, said that at present people have formed the opinion that no one will hold them accountable for violating Covid guidelines.“I have no hesitation while saying that not only people but also officers have lowered their guard against the virus. Let’s ensure that not even a single person anywhere across state is seen without mask,” he said.Vij also flagged the issue of what “low testing as well as vaccination” being done in Fatehabad, Jind, Mahendergarh, Nuh and Palwal districts.Vij said that he will hold the district health authorities accountable for this.Testing in Fatehabad district against one lakh people is 744, in Jind it is 833, Mahendergarh 930, Nuh 983 and Palwal 984.Vij added that vaccination is also very low in these districts.“Low testing and vaccination shows the urgency of taking corrective steps. We have become complacent but need to be alert,” he said.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said, “While implementing the Covid-19 strategies, deputy commissioners should give utmost care to ensure that panic is not created among the public.”During the meeting, it came to the fore that the epicentre of the virus spread has changed from NCR region to GT Road districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vij-asks-police-to-challan-people-not-wearing-masks-101616172266124.html

The purpose of introducing this law is to prove every citizen who raises their voice against the government as guilty,” Hooda said.During his visit to Karnal on Friday, Hooda said that every section of the society is disappointed with Haryana budget as the state government did not provide any relief to them.On the CM’s announcement that there is no need of JBT teachers, he said that it has come as a severe blow to the unemployed youth.He also slammed the Haryana government’s decision to shut down 1,057 government schools, and termed it a setback to the Right to Education.‘Damages to Property Bill against democracy’Meanwhile, in a statement, Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Kumari Selja on Friday said the Damages to Property Bill is against democracy and will suppress the voices of people.“The Bill has been enacted in the legislative assembly to suppress the farmers’ movement.

Last year, wheat procurement was started on April 10.“During this year’s procurement process, the state government has decided to ensure 100% online transfer of payments directly into the accounts of farmers,” Khattar said, asking the officers concerned to hold timely talks with the ahrtiyas on this issue.State health minister Anil Vij also attended the meeting from Ambala through video conferencing.The DCs were directed to ensure that Covid-19 safety protocols are strictly followed at all procurement centres.The CM directed the DCs to issue directions in advance regarding timely lifting of crop, smooth functioning of the procurement process and to ensure that neither ahrtiyas nor farmers face any problem.Khattar further directed the DCs to ensure 100% crop registration including registration of vacant agricultural land on ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-sets-target-of-releasing-100-msp-payments-directly-to-farmers-101616171969035.html

In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, all students were promoted to the next level in March last year without examinations. Government schools remained closed for nearly a year. Upper primary schools reopened on February 10 and primary schools on March 1, with 50% attendance. “No students will be denied promotion to the next class. Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, no child can be made to repeat a class till Class 8,” said Vijay Kiran Anand, director-general, school education, on Friday.He said there will only be an oral examination of 30 minutes duration for students of classes 1 and 2. For students of classes 3 to 5, there will be a written exam of multiple choice questions of one hour duration for all subjects. There will be 50 questions.For classes 6 to 7 as well, there will be a written examination based on objective type questions and the duration of the exam will be one hour and 30 minutes. For Class, there will be a written examination, which will be a mix of multiple choice and objective type questions. Anand said answer sheets of classes 3 to 7 will be evaluated at school level and those of Class 8 by teachers of other schools. After evaluation, teachers are required to prepare report card that will help in assessing the academic performance of students. The answer sheets would be evaluated between March 27 and 30 and report cards distribution would be on March 31, in the presence of village education committee. The teachers, however, are not happy because the department has issued examination notification in a short time and evaluation work clashes with Holi holidays.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently said that promoting students without exam was the route of escapism. Instead of promoting students of basic shiksha parishad schools to the next level without examination, there should be an effort to prepare them for tough competition, he emphasised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-schools-in-up-to-hold-annual-exams-on-mar-25-26-101616171545272.html
19-03-2021||Ranchi||‘Jharkhand would recommend SC to remove 50% cap on reservation’: CM||The Jharkhand government would recommend the Supreme Court that the state is a votary to remove the 50 per cent cap on the reservation for the ST, SCs and OBCs in government jobs, chief minister Hemant Soren said on Friday. Giving his reply to the budgetary discussions in the Jharkhand assembly, chief minister Soren said the apex court has sought views of all states on the issue and they would put forth their opinion accordingly. “Few states had crossed the barrier of 50 per cent, following which the respective high courts had quashed the decision. States have appealed in the Supreme Court. The apex court has taken cognisance and has now sought opinion over the removal of the 50 per cent cap from all the states as it’s a national issue. We have decided that we would recommend going beyond the 50 per cent cap,” said Soren. Jharkhand is the second state after Rajasthan which would ask the Supreme Court to remove the 50 per cent cap on the reservation which was imposed in 1992 in the Indra Sawhney case that upheld the reservation to other backward classes.Increasing reservation, especially to the other backwards classes (OBC) in the state, has been a long-standing demand. All major parties, including the BJP, the JMM, the Congress, the AJSU Party, the JVM (P), had promised to increase the OBC reservation in the state, which currently stands at 14 per cent.The reservation to scheduled categories in Jharkhand is currently capped at 50 per cent, besides the 10 per cent quota to the EWS (Economically Weaker Section) in the general category. While the Scheduled Tribes (ST) get a 26 per cent quota, Scheduled Castes (SCs) get 10 per cent and OBCs have 14 per cent reservation.In the run-up to the 2019 polls, the BJP promised to increase reservation to the OBC in proportion to their population and within the ambit of the constitutional provisions. Other major players, including the JMM, the Congress, the JVM (P) and the Ajsu Party, had promised to increase the OBC reservation to 27 per cent in their election manifesto. The ruling JMM, which is the lead party in the incumbent JMM-Congress-RJD combine government, had also promised to increase reservation for STs and SCs by 2 per cent each, besides increasing the OBC quota.In his hour-long speech in the assembly, the chief minister elaborated on the plans of his government which he said, “would give a direction to the state” and help in achieving the purpose for which the state came into existence two decades ago after a long movement. As the CM launched a scathing attack on the BJP and the alleged ‘misadventures’ during the previous Raghubar Das regime, BJP legislators staged a walkout from the house and the CM gave most of his speech in the absence of opposition members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-would-recommend-sc-to-remove-50-cap-on-reservation-cm-101616171065815.html

With time, more and more young men and women are turning to bee-keeping as dozens of local honey brands have got established in Kashmir.The nectar collected by the bees from the meadows, orchards, forests, gardens is considered among the finest across the globe and fetches anywhere from ₹80,000 to 1 lakh per quintal.Officials said Kashmir produces four varieties of organic honey. The government is now planning to establish seven lakh bee colonies in the Valley that could generate more honey, revenue and employment for the youth. Last year, 7,206 quintals of pure honey was generated. Anantnag district alone produced 2015.06 quintals followed by Srinagar (1415 quintals).In north Kashmir’s Baramulla, Ishfaq Ahmad Dar, a young entrepreneur, got four apiaries for his small orchard outside his house for the pollination. After a good apple harvest, Dar decided to get more apiaries.“Initially, I didn’t think about honey but once I got good returns I decided to get more beehives. Now I have 150 hives through which I get five to six quintal of honey in a year,” Dar said. He said that he had engaged a couple of people as beekeepers and also seek timely advice from officers of the agriculture department for the maintenance of these apiaries.Also read: No threat to Amarnath Yatra, but sticky bombs a new challenge - J-K DGP“I am now able to earn ₹four to five lakh rupees and the market for real pure honey is always available in Kashmir,” he said, adding that he is planning to expand his beehives in the next season. “Its also a good business which seldom is in a loss,” he stated.Another beekeeper, Farooq Ahmad Shiekh, who hails from Kupwara, said that he gets honey three to four times a year from his 100 apiaries established in his backyard in Handwara.“I get two harvests in Kashmir and another in Jammu. I earn sufficient for my family. Though at times due to climate changes bee mortalities lead to losses. Most of the times, I generate good profit,” he said. Shiekh said that Kashmir nectar comes from the organic flora in the vast forests. “With every passing day, the demand for pure honey goes up,” he added.Officials said they are already organising training-cum-sensitization programs on honey bee and their management as there is a tremendous scope of beekeeping in Jammu and Kashmir.Director of agriculture, Kashmir, Mohammad Iqbal Choudhary, said that the department has prioritized upliftment of the apiculture sector and has designed and drafted Detailed Project Reports for promotion of high altitude honey in J&K under ‘Honey Mission’. “At present, we have more than 70,000 bee colonies and our target is to take this to seven lakh colonies by good management.He said that the idea is to establish seven lakh colonies within the next five years which could generate employment for 1.14 lakh families. “Ours is considered the world’s best honey and we are trying to get the GI tag for this honey,” he said, adding that the apiculture cultivation is a way forward to double farmer’s income by 2022 with the latest technological intervention. He said that this is the only thing that hasn’t got any negative growth.Choudhary said that the department has started the process of establishing viable beekeeping units as the sector has good potential to generate income not only in honey production but also in the production of by-products like beeswax, propolis, bee venom and royal jelly. “Apart from honey, its byproducts also have a great demand in the markets across the country,” he said, adding that a person with 100 hives can generate employment for four to five people.He said within his department and districts there are separate officials for apiculture who guide farmers and beekeepers from time to time.Javeed Iqbal, a wholesale honey dealer, said that people are always looking for quality honey as it has many health benefits. “Earlier we used to get most of our honey from other states and didn’t know about its quality. As more and more young people established beekeeping units, we turned to those units for honey. Even quality honey from Kashmir has a good demand outside Kashmir. The demand is growing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/honey-is-turning-life-sweeter-for-kashmiris-70k-bee-colonies-come-up-101616167285348.html

19-03-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Open, happiness||Today, on the occasion of the official International Day of Happiness, let us put aside thoughts of gloom and doom, and remind ourselves of all the things — big and small — that bring us happiness in Mumbai.Happiness in Mumbai is an evening spent among familiar-looking strangers and unfamiliar-smelling smoke at Mehboob Studios, while listening to a world-famous saxophonist or an unknown poet, and feeling as if you were on the Left Bank in Paris, while sipping your beer from a plastic cup. Happiness in Mumbai is jostling in a queue to buy a perfectly made demi-glass of cold coffee at NCPA’s Tata theatre during the interval, between the Allegro con brio and the Andante con moto of Beethoven’s Fifth, surrounded by what looks like the world’s entire Parsi population, doing the same thing.Happiness in Mumbai is a windswept morning at Matunga flower market, redolent with the fragrance of fresh jasmines and mogras and the sound of bells ringing from Ayyappan Mandir next door. It is buying a bunch of rain-soaked, shivering sontakkas from an even more rain-soaked, shivering urchin at Kemps Corner traffic lights and knowing that the memory of his smile will last longer than the flowers he’s just handed you; Happiness in Mumbai is the sight of the devoted congregating on Tuesday evenings outside Siddhivinayak Temple at Prabhadevi to propitiate the Gods ; and happiness is seeing more or less the same faces, the very next day, outside the St Michael’s Church in Mahim for the Wednesday Novena.Happiness in Mumbai is Juhu beach, where on any given day you might chance upon a famous film star hoping to pass unrecognised on his afternoon off, or an unknown film aspirant in his Sunday best, hoping to be discovered. Happiness in Mumbai is the sight of middle-aged, early-bird joggers at the crack of dawn on Marine Drive in their shiny new athleasure gear, blithely undaunted by the fact that through all their years of sweat and flex, nothing seems to get sleeker except their expensive sneakers.Happiness in Mumbai is a fleeting glimpse of the magnificent Burma teak staircase at Wadiaji Atash Behram on Princess Street, as you drive past during rush hour — a chance, sudden opening of a door which transports you into a sanctuary of silence and solemnity; it is the astringent orderliness of Colaba’s Cusrow Baug, juxtaposed so delightfully against the endearing eccentricity of its residents. Happiness in Mumbai is the louche, cut-price sprawl of Colaba Causeway, where the man behind the counter at the leather store might speak to you in fluent Italian, while singing the praises of a trendy tote, but will switch effortlessly back to Hindi, while discussing its price.It is in the reticent, fairy tale charm of cottages named Ave Maria and Peace Haven in Bandra’s by-lanes, in the imposing aloofness of the Indo-Saracenic buildings of Ballard Estate, in the sleepy quaintness of Kotachi Wadi which wears its East Indian heritage like a talisman against the brash new developments encircling it. It is in the sensuous curve of the Sea Link and in the sweet spot at its Northern end, where lovers perch to woo and coo, foolishly under the impression that they are invisible to the occupants of passing cars.It is in the magnificent stained-glass windows of Mumbai’s oldest church — St Thomas’ Cathedral, and in the rotund sumptuousness of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, with its dome set off against the brilliance of a full moon. Happiness in Mumbai is the iconic Rajabai Clock Tower, said to have been financed by a wealthy philanthropist so that his blind mother could hear the bells peal each evening and know when it was time for her dinner. If happiness in Mumbai were a taste, it would surely be dosas at Matunga’s Madras Lunch home, pani puri at Bandra’s Elco Arcade, brun from City Bakery, bhel puri at Chowpatty beach, and vada pav at Kirti College Lane in Prabhadevi.Happiness in Mumbai is the sight of fishing boats, festooned with flags after a good morning’s catch. It is a procession of stately, vintage automobiles ferrying their equally stately and vintage owners on a Sunday morning across Marine Drive. It is Queen’s necklace on any night and of course the sparkling sea that hugs the city with maternal pride every night. If happiness in Mumbai were a sound, it would be the tinkling of a piano in Juhu’s Theosophical Colony, the cacophony of the money-making machine at Dalal Street, the crackle of commentary at Brabourne Stadium during a cricket match, and the opening night roar of applause for an off-Broadway musical performed by local talent. If happiness in Mumbai were an emotion, it would be the profusion of yellow Amalta trees outside Byculla zoo; the vivid, purple, pink and white blooms of Bougainvillea across the city; and the all-too-fleeting shy grace of Mumbai’s own Gulmohars, which bloom only annually, between late April and May.All these and more are the aggregate of happiness in Mumbai; and given what the city has gone through and is going through and might go through, it would serve us well, gentle reader, to remind ourselves of all the things — big and small — that bring us happiness in Mumbai.So, what’s on your list? We’d love to know…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-open-happiness-101616167045257.html

The civic body has spent more than ₹465 crore on the project that is progressing at a slow pace. The administration has already raised ₹200 crore through bonds in June 2017 for the ₹2,550-crore project, and plans to seek another ₹200 crore from the open market. Civic activists have raised objection on the PMC’s decision. PMC has included water charges for the 24x7 project in property tax bills since 2018. The amount is around ₹110 crore per year. Till date, the corporation has spent around ₹462 crore on the project. Recently, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar reviewed the project and instructed officials to speed up the work. Suresh Jagtap, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have sought loan details from banks.” In 2017, PMC had raised ₹200 crore through municipal bonds at the interest rate of 7.59 % for 10 years. It also got one per cent concession from the central government for municipal bonds. Hence, PMC is paying around ₹15 crore per year as interest. Ulka Kalaskar, PMC chief account officer, said, “At present, municipal bonds are not viable for PMC as interest rates by financial institutes are below 7%. We have given seven days to financial institutes to submit their proposals to PMC. PMC has a good credit rating (AA+).” Civic activist Vivek Velankar said, “PMC has ₹860 crore of fixed deposits in various banks. There is no need to take high-interest loan. If PMC takes a loan on this fixed deposit, they will get ₹200 crore at the interest rate of 4%.” Nandkumar Jagatap, PMC superintendent engineer of water supply department who is handling the 24x7 project, said, “From 2017 till date, the corporation spent more than ₹465 crore on the project.

Next day he found the SUV was missing, he said.The CCTV footage showed Vaze leaving in Mercedes from police commissioner's office. Hiran is seen walking towards the car when it is parked outside CSMT.Both sit inside and ten minutes later Hiran steps out and walks away while Vaze drives back to the commissioner's office.The ATS suspects that Hiran handed over the keys of Scorpio to Vaze during this meeting, sources said.On February 25, the Scorpio was found parked near Ambani's residence `Antilia' with gelatin sticks and a threat letter.Vaze was arrested by the NIA on March 13 for his alleged role in parking the SUV near Ambani's residence.The NIA had earlier this week seized a black Mercedes car from a parking lot near CSMT and seized ₹5 lakh in cash, note-counting machine and some `incriminating' documents.Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5. His family alleged that Vaze had a role in his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ambani-security-threat-case-sachin-vaze-mansukh-hiran-met-on-day-suv-was-stolen-official-cites-cctv-tape-101616163384672.html

With assembly elections just three weeks away, the latest move has opened another front on the ongoing centre-state battle but the opposition Congress said it was a move aimed at diverting attention from burning issues. The ruling CPI(M) said the move is to implicate the CM and create a big poll issue.Earlier, the crime branch sought legal opinion on this and got the nod to book ED officials. In the First Information Report (FIR), the crime branch said it has clinching evidence against ED officials and later a leaked voice clip of the accused also confirmed this.Earlier, some women police officials, who escorted Suresh, also gave a statement saying they were witness to officials forcing her to take the name of the CM. The FIR said ED officials had questioned Suresh on August 13-14 last year and allegedly forced her to give a statement to implicate the CM in the case. The case has been registered under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 192 (fabricating false evidence), 195-A (threatening any person to give false evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. But a senior ED official, who did not want to be named, said the latest move was aimed at intimidating officials and the agency will seek legal remedies to address it. Earlier, a video clip, purported to be of Swapna Suresh’s, was leaked out from the jail in which she alleged that she was under tremendous pressure to take the name of many ministers and the CM. She is presently lodged in the women jail in Thiruvananthapuram. Later, two women officers who escorted her also claimed that they were the witness to ED officials forcing her to name important personalities including the CM. The ED, however, denied these claims. The Congress and the BJP said the latest move was aimed at diverting attention and weaken the case. “The ruling CPI(M) is cornered from all sides in smuggling case and Sabarimala issue. The case was a diversionary tactic,” said state Congress chief Mullappally Ramachandran. “The nervous CM is intimidating officials of the central agencies. It will not work,” said state BJP chief K Surendran. But CPI(M) state acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said the state won’t allow a free run of the central agencies to discredit the government amid poll. “We will tell people about the nefarious designs of central agencies,” he said. The gold smuggling case surfaced in July last year after 30 kilograms of gold was seized from a consignment camouflaged as a diplomatic bag in the UAE consulate in the state capital. Later, many, including CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar and a senior IAS officer, were arrested for helping the accused. After three months in judicial custody, he was granted bail later. The three main accused, including Suresh, were detained under Cofeposa (conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities act). Last month, the customs department had filed a shocking affidavit in Kerala High Court quoting Swapna Suresh’s statement under Section 164 of the IPC wherein she alleged that the CM, three of his ministers and the Speaker were aware of smuggling activities through the consulate. Later, the AG had sent a show-cause notice to the customs commissioner to explain why contempt proceedings were not initiated against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-ed-officials-booked-over-deposition-of-main-accused-against-cm-101616160264039.html
19-03-2021||Pune||PMC to appoint agency to check illegal underground cables||Pune: Following public complaints about unauthorised laying of underground optical fibre, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to appoint an agency to probe and fine offenders. PMC had sanctioned a trenching policy in the city to streamline the process of laying underground pipelines or cables and avoid occurrence of faults, requiring excavation for carrying out repairs and bringing the excavated surface back to its original status. The move will also keep a check on unauthorised or illegal laying of cables or digging in the city. However, the civic administration has received complaints from residents of private telecom companies flouting the trenching policy. The step to fine offenders will also boost their revenue, a civic official said. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The appointed agency will survey the areas mentioned in complaints. We have completed procedures of tenders. The agency will use direct and indirect methods to find out legal and illegal underground cables in the city. In the direct method, it will use modern technology to find underground cables and use telecom companies’ data and PMC permission. We will give an initial six-month period to the agency after receiving work from the agency. We will continue the period up to three years based on requisite condition and policy.” According to Khemnar, PMC will also provide monetary assistance to experts who will help in finding illegal underground cables. “As per the trenching policy, there is a provision of three-time penalty,” he said. Lalit Bode, executive engineer of road department, said, “As per the demand of telecom companies, we will scrutinise applications and charge ₹10,155 per running metre. At present, we check maps and drawings submitted by agencies and visit the site to crosscheck the permitted cables and actual laid cables. There is no third-party checking. Since last two years, the corporation has not given permission to any company. Right now, the PMC road department has given around 150 kilometre of permission to telecom companies to lay underground cables.” Bode said, “Residents calls and register complaints to the road department late at night. We send an engineer next day to check it. We will impose a fine on the company and if they refuse to pay, we will seize the cables.” Meanwhile, two years ago, PMC had received complaints from residents of illegal laying of cables in Kharadi, Shankarshet road, Baner, Balewadi and Aundh areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-appoint-agency-to-check-illegal-underground-cables-101616159663081.html

Based on this order now we would take further action which could even include blacklisting the suppliers.”“These tenders were issued for one of the women empowerment schemes. We will also investigate the respective officials and committees that recommended the purchase under the said conditions. The CCI has found nothing against the ZP,” he said.The CCI found that the three suppliers fixed prices close to each other which was concluded coupled with other factors like single IP address, coordination in other tenders, call data record, mobile location, among others. is conclusive of an agreement amongst the bidders to fix price, resulting in rigging the bids in the impugned tender of Pune Zilla Parishad.The order issued on March 17, states, “The Competition Commission of India has found an agreement between three suppliers, to rig the bids in respect of a tender floated by Pune Zilla Parishad for procurement of Picofall-cum-Sewing Machine, in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(1) read with Section 3(3)(d) of the Competition Act, 2002, which prohibits anti-competitive agreements.”The commission concluded that quoting of bid prices which were close to each other with a difference of just a few rupees by the bidders for the impugned tender was not a mere coincidence, but a result of consensus/ understanding amongst the bidders.The commission also opined that such conduct in public procurements, besides defeating the tendering process, has an adverse impact on the exchequer.Further, a penalty of ₹10,000 each was imposed upon each of the individuals of M/s Jawahar Brothers in terms of Section 48 of the Act. The other two bidders are sole proprietorship concerns and thus, no separate penalty is being imposed upon their respective proprietors. Besides, a cease and desist order was also issued against these suppliers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-suppliers-fined-rs10-lakh-each-for-bid-rigging-in-pune-zp-tenders-101616157802770.html

19-03-2021||Other||Many heritage structures not on fire audit compliance list of PCB||Pune: Over 100 heritage structures under the Pune Cantonment area does not figure on the fire audit list of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), according to the board officials. The conservation of these historic structures gained public attention after the British-era Shivaji market, a grade I heritage structure, in Camp was partly gutted in fire on March 16. Albert Edward Library on East Street opposite Kayani Bakery that opened in 1975, 100-year-old Victory theatre that was once used as a playhouse for the British, and 160-year-old Hindustan Covenant Church which was burnt to ashes in November 2011 are some of the historic landmarks under PCB. However, the PCB fire department admits of not having a complete list of heritage structures as most of it are owned by private individuals. Prakash Hasabe, PCB fire department chief, said, “While Victory theatre has complied with fire audit directions issued by us, we do not have list of many heritage structures as they are privately owned. We have covered only Shivaji market and post fire audit necessary recommendations were made. Human life is important and fire audit guidelines are essential for keeping the area secure for cantonment residents.” Numerous heritage structures built during the colonial raj comprise residential buildings which dot the cantonment landscape since the British era. Conservationists and heritage lovers have expressed their dissatisfaction over the negligence of PCB in including them in the heritage list of protected monuments of the cantonment board. Except Victory theatre, none of the heritage structures figure on the list of fire audit or a formal heritage monument-cum-building list of the cantonment board. “INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) has named hundreds of structures under its heritage protection list and voluntarily submitted it to the cantonment board seeking protection and conservation of the cantonment monuments. There are many threats to these structures and fire is one of them. These monuments face threats like neglect and biological growth. In 1900, Saint Paul’s church was burnt, and later Hindustani Church also was reduced to ashes. These monuments have been neglected by successive board administrations,” said Kiran Kalamdani, former INTACH member and city-based architect and conservationist who carried out a detailed survey of all the heritage monuments in PCB area in 2011-2012. The cantonment board had earlier undertaken efforts to get only eight structures listed as national heritage monuments — National War Memorial, Race Course, Armed Forces Medical College, St Patrick’s Church, St Mary’s Church, Chhatrapati Shivaji market, Babajan dargah and Maratha War Memorial —under the central act. Social activist Netraprakash Bhog said, “Heritage structures under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) like Vishrambaugwada and Shaniwarwada were saved by the citizens and preserved for future generation unlike what is happening in PCB. Similarly, all public and private heritage structures too must be taken care of and their fire audit must be conducted. PCB must restore Shivaji market to former glory and ready a list of heritage structures for public information. Currently, scant attention is paid on heritage buildings in Pune Cantonment area should be looked into immediately on a priority basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/many-heritage-structures-not-on-fire-audit-compliance-list-of-pcb-101616154864077.html

Especially during the lockdown, people have realised the importance of spending time with pets and now they are eager to capture their pets for posterity. The trend has surged since August 2020,” said photographer Prasad Ladde, who has so far done photoshoots of a rottweiler in New Sangvi and a Golden Retriever in Parihar chowk, Aundh. He charged ₹5000 each. “Prasad had lot of patience to handle my dog (rottweiler). I was excited for the shoot, but a little tense as to how he would do his work, but the end product was very good,” says Nilesh Mue of New Sangvi, Pune .“Pet photo shoots are happening like shoots for a new-born child. Pet parents want to capture a picture when the dog is one-month old and then, when s/he turns a year old,” added Ladde.Photo shoots are generally done in a garden, open ground or on a terrace. The biggest challenge photographers face is to capture the raw emotions of the dog or cat.“We can decide the theme of the photoshoot, but things will only progress according to the flow of pets on the given day. Balloons, balls, ribbons or sometimes, even cakes, are used to add effects during the photographs,” said Prathima Pingali, a Mumbai- based photographer and owner of Pawparazzi Pet Photography, who keeps coming to Pune for dog shoots.Pingali charges between ₹9,000 and ₹24,000 for one shoot.Before finalising the shoot, photographers have a detailed discussion with the pet parents on the behaviour of their pets as a safety measure.“While shooting a dog one cannot be sure about the next action, so one needs to have a lot of patience and allow the dog to settle in, before clicking a picture. Sometimes a shoot can go on for four hours, or sometimes if the dog is not in the mood, then the shoot has to be postponed,” explains lensman Sashwat Nair.“The shoots have increased these days as many people are gifting pets on special occasions, like birthdays and anniversaries. So special shoots are conducted on such occasions,” added Nair.“Sheru (labrador) is like our family member and I wanted to have an album for my dog. I knew Sashwat via a common friend so I went ahead with the photo shoot,” says pet parent Mohini Verma.Rithima Khurrana, a Koregaon park resident, said, “When we bought our German Shepherd in January, our kids wanted to have a photo shoot with him. The photos came out really well and now we will have another photo shoot when our Bruno turns six- months old.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-pet-parents-dishing-out-big-bucks-for-exclusive-photo-shoots-of-their-animals-101616152104518.html

There should be no requirement of a separate certificate if an eligible 45+ years person brings the medical record regarding co-morbidities, he said. Also read: Punjab closes schools, colleges till March 31 amid Covid spikeThe directions came during the Covid review meeting chaired by the chief minister, who pointed out with concern that of the 1,291 registered private facilities, 891 have reportedly not administered a single dose. He asked the district administration to act strictly against such hospitals, stressing that private hospitals need to join the government battle against Covid. Be prepared for a long battle: Capt The chief minister said the Covid incidence in Punjab has remained relatively low over the last one year, and the state has consistently remained at the 18th position among states in terms of the number of Covid cases. Though the death rate has been a matter of concern, but at 206 deaths per million population, Punjab compares well against Delhi at 542 and Maharashtra at 431, he said. After bringing the problem under control by the end of last year, the state is again seeing a surge for the last one month. From a low of around 200 cases daily and deaths in single digits, Punjab has gone to around 2,000 cases a day, and the deaths are also increasing, he said. “We have to be prepared for this second surge,” he said, pointing out that the 1918 Spanish flu had four spikes. “We have to be prepared for a long battle,” he warned.The Chief Minister assured, however, that his government was fully prepared to deal with the second wave. Punjab Congress puts rallies on hold till March 31 Punjab Congress will not hold any political gatherings for the next two weeks in view of the spike in Covid cases in the state, Captain Amarinder Singh said, appealing to other political parties and their leaders to keep their gatherings within the prescribed 50% of capacity, subject to maximum of 100 in closed and 200 in open spaces. “No political gatherings should take place in the most affected districts,” he said. Underlining the need for strict enforcement, the chief minister ordered compulsory enforcement of wearing of face masks in the state. He directed the police and health authorities to take all those moving around in public areas, and on the roads, without face masks, to the nearest RT-PCR testing facility for taking nasopharyngeal swabs to ensure that they are not asymptomatic Covid cases. He asked the Amritsar deputy commissioner to talk to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC) and the management of Durgiana temple to encourage devotees to wear masks inside the shrines.Rural areas equally hit this time The rise in cases was a matter of concern, particularly in the rural areas which had seen fewer cases last year, said the chief minister, directing departments to launch awareness campaigns in villages. Earlier, state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said unlike previously, when there were more cases in the urban areas, Covid cases are now almost equally divided between the urban and rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hospitals-asked-to-step-up-covid-vaccination-in-punjab-101616152102729.html

The big cat is suspected to have killed at least three people and nearly 30 animals over the last eight months in the coffee-growing region, they added.“We have some images and it [the dead Tiger]; it appears to be the same. We are rechecking this,” said Karnataka’s principal chief forest conservator (wildlife) Sanjai Mohan. He added the cause of death and whether it is the same “human-eater” is being ascertained through a series of tests and investigations.Over 150 forest department personnel and other agencies were looking for the tiger for at least two weeks. The inability to capture the tiger led to protests in the district. Resident blocked roads and highways demanding its capture.Also Read | Lion injures man who entered its enclosure in Kolkata zooA ruling Bharatiya Janata Party legislator from the district, Apachu Ranjan, also sought permission to gun down the animal. The forest department denied him permission, saying there was no such provision and assured him that it was looking for the tiger.Officials said wild animals often venture into human settlements in search of food amid increasing territorial fights, depletion of resources in the forests, erosion of buffer zones, and the lack of corridors.At least 434 cases of tigers attacking cattle and humans have been reported in the state since 2020. This marked a 37% increase in such cases. At least nine humans have been killed in these attacks, according to forest department data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/tiger-found-dead-in-karnataka-s-kodagu-district-101616149582120.html

A person will be allowed entry into such premises only if (s)he tests negative for Covid-19.However, if a person is carrying a negative result of an RT-PCR test conducted no earlier than 72 hours, they do not need to take the antigen test to enter the public premises.This decision was taken following a meeting between the government task force and municipal commissioners across the state on Thursday evening. Among the conclusions of the meeting was the decision to ramp up testing in Mumbai to quickly identify Covid-19 patients and isolate them.Also Read | Covid-19: Maharashtra announces fresh curbs, theatres to operate at 50% capacityWith 2,877 cases in a single day, Mumbai on Thursday reported the highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic outbreak on March 11 last year.

19-03-2021||Delhi||Women footballers’ time to shine: Renewed vigour, high hopes||There is no dearth of sporting talent in Delhi — all it needs is the right training and platform. And a testimony to this is the Women’s League, which will allow female footballers from Delhi clubs, as well as across India, to showcase their potential and prowess. After a year of almost no matches amid the pandemic, players are looking forward to the event with renewed vigour. ‘Empower and inspire women towards Football’“Players have been out of action for almost a year. If everything is open, why not resume football,” says Football Delhi president Shaji Prabhakaran adding how it is important to resume football activities following all Covid-19 protocols and safety measures. “We have been working towards inclusivity in the sport and the Women’s League will allow great women players from the state to have opportunities to showcase their skills and play on state and national levels. Competitions like these help in breaking traditional mindsets that believe girls can’t play football, and empower and inspire them,” adds Prabhakaran. ‘Culture of Football in Delhi has grown’Players in different city-based clubs have geared up to compete in the Women’s League, with practices being organised on different grounds across the Capital. Age is no bar - teams have players as young as 15! “I started playing while I was in school, around 10 years ago; there used to be a handful of women players and 6 clubs. But 21 clubs is a testament to the growing culture of football in Delhi, both on club as well as school and college levels,” says Dhwani Kitchlue, a member of Hans Womens Football Club, one of the oldest women’s clubs in Delhi. ‘Lack of funds, pandemic has affected practice’Vikrant Singh Baswara, coach to Growing Star Football club’s women’s team says while the organisation of the league is a welcome step, the pandemic has left players without practice. “Many clubs, who could earlier use school grounds, could not practice regularly during the pandemic. Additionally there is a lack of funds in football, especially women’s football, which also deters many prospective players from joining clubs if they charge high training fees,” he says. Players from other states in the league: The bench is dividedEach team at Women’s League is allowed to field a maximum of 25 players, in which players from other states can be transferred to play for a Delhi club. Nagendra Singh, coach of Hans Womens FC says this aspect of the league isn’t fair. “The league is being organised to promote football in Delhi, so bringing players from other states negates the purpose. This is a league for amateurs, not professional players,” he says. But David Jones, who owns Royal Rangers Football Club, slightly disagrees and opines, “Players from other states who play with a club regularly can participate. But many clubs are virtually adopting other players, only for the league. This isn’t fair to domicile players, who may lose out on the opportunity to participate in the league.” Hope for government support, better rewardsPrabhakaran says for football to really grow in the city, and the country at large, we need additional government support. “We have no sponsors but have kept the cash prize of ₹50,000 for the winners of the league, ₹25,000 for runner ups, and ₹10,000 each for third and fourth positions. But we need great incentives to make the sport a financially sustainable livelihood for players. Only then will we be able to compete on an international level,” he adds.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/women-footballers-time-to-shine-renewed-vigour-high-hopes-101616148278381.html
19-03-2021||Jaipur||Possible that children watch porn after online classes, says Rajasthan DGP||Rajasthan director general of police (DGP) ML Lather on Friday said that a youth who raped a five-year-old girl in Jhunjhunu last month used to watch porn, adding that it was possible that after online classes, "children indulge in such things".“It is true that incidents of crime against women are on the rise. But, as far as law enforcement is concerned, the police are taking swift action, whoever is the culprit will be arrested timely,” the officer was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He was responding to media queries on the issue of women’s safety in the state.When questioned on whether there’s a need to change the mindset, the DGP said, “Like in the recent Jhunjhunu case, it has come to light that he used to watch porn and consume drugs. As we all know, due to Covid-19 lockdown, students have been forced to take online classes. Therefore, parents have had to purchase smartphones for their children. It is possible that after their classes, children indulge in such activities. Parents should be careful about what their children are doing on smartphones besides attending online classes.”Incidents of crime against women are rising.Police is taking action...In Jhunjhunu case,it emerged that accused use to see porn&consume drugs.Due to online classes due to COVID,children now use smartphones,it may be that after classes they indulge in such things: Rajasthan DGP pic.twitter.com/z5elxm28NrIn Jhunjhunu, on February 19, a minor girl was allegedly abducted by a 20-year-old youth who then took her at an isolated place and sexually assaulted here. The trial was fast-tracked, and on March 16, a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court convicted him in just 26 days. A a day later, it sentenced him to death. The court had also lauded the police for a "speedy investigation".In recent days, several incidents of crime against women have been reported from various parts of Rajasthan. In state capital Jaipur, a woman on oxygen support was raped by a hospital staffer. In Baran, a woman was allegedly gang-raped in front of her husband, while a police official was terminated by the Rajasthan government for allegedly demanding sexual favours from a rape survivor in exchange for action in cases lodged by her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/possible-that-children-watch-porn-after-online-classes-says-rajasthan-dgp-101616147002101.html
19-03-2021||Kolkata||ED questions TMC leaders in connection with chit-fund scam ahead of Bengal polls||At least two Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, who have been fielded as candidates for the upcoming assembly election, were questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the multi-crore Sarada chit-fund scam on Friday. While Madan Mitra, the state’s former transport minister, will be contesting from the Kamarhati assembly constituency in North 24 Parganas, Vivek Gupta, a former TMC MP has been fielded from the Jorasanko assembly constituency in Kolkata. The central agency has also summoned another former TMC MP and two former IPS officers in connection with the same case on March 24 and March 25. One of them was given a plush post by chief minister Mamata Banerjee after his retirement. Earlier this week, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh was summoned by the central agency. Also Read | Amit Shah, Nadda hold meetings as protests break out in BJP over candidate listBoth Mitra and Ghosh were arrested earlier and later released on bail.“I received a letter from the ED and that’s why I came. Earlier too I have cooperated with them. I will cooperate whenever they call me,” Mitra told reporters outside the ED office. Meanwhile, the ED also attached an asset of TMC youth leader Vinay Mishra and his arrested brother Vikas Mishra in a money-laundering case linked to alleged cattle smuggling across the India-Bangladesh border in West Bengal.While the TMC has alleged that the central agency has suddenly become hyperactive before the assembly election on the BJP’s directions , the latter has rubbished the allegations. “What were the central agencies doing all these days? Why have they suddenly become so active just before the polls? Soon after the elections are over this hyperactivity will die down again. This is a vindictive attitude and is very unfortunate. They are acting on the directions of the BJP,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson. “This has nothing to do with politics. We have said earlier too that the central agencies are not controlled by the BJP. We don’t need to do such things. This is false propaganda, and the people of Bengal are fed up with such versions,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJPs state spokesperson. The Saradha group allegedly cheated around 1.7 -1.8 million depositors , mostly poor and lower middle class people, promising them abnormally high returns on investments in its illegal schemes. The scam began to unravel in the first quarter of 2013 and finally blew up in April 2013 when the chairman of the group that ran the ponzi scheme, Sudipta Sen, and the company’s executive director Debjani Mukherjee, were arrested. The Saradha scam generated great controversy since several leaders of ruling Trinamool Congress were allegedly involved with the scam. The West Bengal assembly elections are scheduled to begin from March 27. The BJP has set a target to win more than 200 seats out of the 294 assembly seats. The TMC has said that the BJP won’t even get 100 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ed-questions-tmc-leaders-in-connection-with-chit-fund-scam-ahead-of-bengal-polls-101616147301780.html

Not more than 10 visitors should be entertained in homes, he urged. Also read: Covid-19: Maharashtra announces fresh curbs, theatres to operate at 50% capacityMalls to be closed on Sunday in 11 districts In the 11 worst-hit districts, a complete ban has been ordered on all social gatherings and related functions, except for funerals and weddings, which will be allowed with only 20 people in attendance. This will be enforced from Sunday. In the districts under night curfew from 9pm to 5am, the chief minister has ordered cinemas, multiplexes, restaurants and malls to remain closed on Sunday, though home deliveries will be allowed subject to night curfew. Industries and essential services shall be allowed to function. One-hour silence every Saturday from 11am to noon Starting next week, one hour of silence will be observed across the state every Saturday from 11am to 12 noon in memory of those who lost their lives to Covid, with no vehicle plying at this time. In the 11 worst-hit districts of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Mohali, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ropar and Moga, the chief minister ordered restrictions on in-person public dealings in government offices, with citizens to be encouraged to visit offices only for essential services. The situation will be reviewed after two weeks, Capt Amarinder Singh said, chairing a meeting of the Covid Task Force. Testing to be ramped up to 35,000 a day Directing health officials to ramp up testing a day to 35,000, the chief minister said focus should be on super spreaders, government employees and teachers. RAT testing should be stepped up along with RTPCR testing, he said, while directing contact tracing and testing to be taken up to 30 per positive person.The chief minister directed the department of medical education and research to immediately complete recruitment of specialists/super-specialists. Hospitals have been advised to restore the Covid beds and postpone elective surgeries. Reopening educational institutions led to surge: Dr Talwar Dr KK Talwar, who heads the state government’s expert team on Covid, said the surge in cases appeared to be the result of opening of schools and colleges, with young asymptomatic people appearing to be spreading the virus. There was no evidence as of now to show that the spike was due to the mutants, as only two cases of new strains had been found in Punjab so far. At present, the state has 40% cases from the under 30 population, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-closes-schools-colleges-till-march-31-amid-covid-spike-101616146281808.html

19-03-2021||Bhopal||MP farmers organise marriage at Rewa mandi to send message to Centre||Two farmers solemnized the marriage of their son and daughter at a grain mandi in Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa district, over 500 km east of Bhopal, to send a symbolic message to the Central government. The Rewa Mandi has been the venue of a sit-in protest against the three Central farm laws for the past 75 days and the marriage was meant to convey that farmers were prepared for a marathon campaign till the repeal of the controversial laws, claimed farmer leaders.Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader Ramjeet Singh married off son Sachin to Asma Singh, daughter of farmer Vishnukant Singh of Cirrhata village of the district, on Thursday.The couple exchanged garlands and took pheras (a Hindu marriage ritual) around the idols of BR Ambedkar and Savitribai Phule. Later, they took an oath to protect the Constitution of India.“We want to give a message to the Central government that the farmers are staging a protest in every district and town of India. We will continue our protest till the withdrawal of all three new farm laws,” said Ramjeet Singh.Now, farmers have decided to organise and celebrate all family and social functions including marriages and festivals at the protest site only, he added.Farmers in several states have been protesting since November last year against the three new laws passed by the Parliament, alleging the laws would destroy the Mandi system and dilute the minimum support price (MSP) offered by the government for their produce, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by the corporates. The government has refuted these allegations and said that the laws were necessary for increasing farmer incomes, unlocking the potential of the farm sector, including infrastructure development through private participation. Several rounds of talks between the government and the farmer representatives have failed to break the deadlock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-farmers-organise-marriage-at-rewa-mandi-to-send-message-to-centre-101616141660917.html

19-03-2021||Delhi||Cellphones—the most treasured item inside India’s largest prison complex||Authorities have expedited efforts to ensure an end to cellphone use at Tihar prison, the country’s largest, days after a Telegram message claiming responsibility for the parking of an explosives-laden vehicle outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in Mumbai on February 25 was traced to a phone inside the jail. The phone was among the two later recovered from jailed terror convict Tehseen Akhtar’s possession. The phones were found after Tihar authorities conducted searches inside the prison to trace the origin of the message. Investigators have ruled out a “terror angle” in the Mumbai case and arrested police officer Sachin Vaze in connection with the bomb scare. An inquiry is separately underway to probe how Akhtar, who was involved in multiple blasts, managed to have cellphones smuggled into the high-security prison. The prison authorities have held at least two meetings over the last week to fully block cellphone signals in the prison complex spread over 400-acre in western Delhi. The prison houses all types of prisoners—gangsters, murderers, rapists, politicians, and terrorists. Many of them have been influential, even rich too, and infamous. But inside the prison, they are all under one roof and locked up behind the same high walls. The number of murders, their dreaded past, or the wealth the prisoners once had does not matter. What matters here is if they have the prison’s most treasured item—a cellphone. HT spoke to former, current prisoners, serving and retired jail officers to understand how cellphones are smuggled and used inside the prison.A status symbolSunil Gupta, a former law officer who worked at Tihar for over three decades, said the cellphone is a status symbol inside the prison. “Outside Tihar, a cellphone is the most common item. Everyone has it; whether rich or poor. But in the prison, it is the most sought-after item. The prison has a phone facility, which is free for everyone. But many inmates, who refuse to reform, do not use it. They need cellphones to run their operations.” Gupta said many criminals use cellphones to issue threats and run their businesses. “They cannot do this through the prison’s phone facility.”Also Read | Engineering aspirant to IED developer: Tihar inmate at centre of Ambani caseThe Delhi Police have over the last two weeks busted at least two gangs trying to extort money by claiming to be making calls from the prison. “They were making calls using jailed gangster Neeraj Bawana’s name. It is human psychology to be afraid after hearing that the threat call has been made from prison. In these two cases, none of the persons, who made the calls, were from the prison. They were only posing as jailed gangsters,” said a crime branch officer, who did not wish to be named. The officer added the calls they have intercepted show at least three gangs continue their extortion activities from behind the bars.Former Delhi Police inspector Anil Kumar, who was lodged for over 15 years in Tihar after his conviction in a shoot-out at Delhi’s Connaught Place in 1997, said only a few people secretly use cellphones. “These hardcore prisoners identify spaces in prison; do not let anyone near them and then use the phones. It is a wrong notion that everyone is using phones behind bars. The authorities are strict about this. This is the reason why so many inmates are caught at the gates trying to take the phones inside,” said Kumar, who was released last year.It was not always like thisUnlike the calls made from the prison’s phones, cellphone calls cannot be intercepted unless the police or intelligence agencies are monitoring them. Delhi Police records show that in recent months, there have been at least three cases of jailed gangsters making threatening calls.Gupta said before the phone facility was introduced in Tihar, they would give postcards to the prisoners to write to their families. “But some of them misused this facility. Through these postcards, threats were sent... Some also used human couriers to warn their rivals. During the weekly meetings with their relatives, the gangsters would send messages or letters. That was enough to create fear in the minds of the victim that the message had come from inside Tihar. Postcards have replaced cellphones now.”Also Read | Tihar has no jammers that can block 4G signalsJail records seen by HT show that in 2019, the prison authorities seized at least 60 phones. In 2018, at least 54 phones were confiscated. The actual number of phones smuggled and successfully hidden could be more.Heater before cellphonesGupta said until two decades ago, a room heater was the most prized item inside the prison. “Any prisoner who had it was seen as someone whose status was above other prisoners. They would use it not only to keep themselves warm but also prepare food after buying raw items from the jail’s canteen,” said Gupta. He added prisoners would smuggle heaters in clothes, etc. “Some rich prisoners would bribe jail guards and get a heater. Or their accomplices outside prison would throw them inside the jail from the main road outside the prison wall. The method of smuggling is the same. It is just that a cellphone has replaced the heater.”Many prisoners had only heard about cellphones for years but had never seen one.Former Youth Congress leader Sushil Sharma, who spent over 23 years behind bars including the first 20 without parole in a 1995 murder case, said he first saw a cellphone when he was taken for a court hearing. “Cellphones came to the prison very late. We would read about it in the papers or see actors use it on television. Many years after it became common outside, I remember seeing a lawyer using it for the first time more than 20 years ago.” He said he would read articles about the use of cellphones inside the jail, but only a few used it. “And they did it secretly. The jail officers have enough informers even among the prisoners. If they involve too many people, the informers will tip off the guards. The prisoners, who continue using cellphones, are those who do not want to be reformed. It is because of them that the image of the jail gets tarnished.”One phone, multiple usersAn under-trial, who is currently out on bail in a 2012 murder case, said that once a cellphone enters prison, it is used by several people. He added even junior jail guards would smuggle the phones. “Unless a prisoner hides phone parts in body cavities or someone successfully throws one from outside the prison gate at an identified spot, a cellphone cannot enter the prison complex without the connivance of the prison guards.” He said guards would charge anywhere between ₹10,000-20,000 for smuggling a phone. “Maybe it is even more. Often, they may not even know who the real user of the phone is. The worst that can happen if a guard is caught is a temporary suspension.” He added in most cases, they manage to get cleared. “With the prison already facing a shortage of guards, it is not practical for the top bosses to sack every employee caught for such violations.”The under-trial said a bottle cap, or a spoon, are improvised in Tihar to make a weapon. “For more than 50-60 years, this prison has beaten all kinds of technology. You may bring any technology. It is only a matter of time before the inmates find a solution.”Also Read | Delhi orders inquiry into Ambani case’s Tihar linkWith 18,000 prisoners, Tihar is the most crowded prison in the country. It has high-risk inmates such as underworld don Chhota Rajan, gangster Neeraj Bawana, gangster-turned-politician Mohammed Shahbuddin, terrorist Yasin Bhatkal, and Akhtar. There are fewer than 1,500 jail officers to manage so many prisoners.A prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said until a few years ago, many inmates would barter cigarettes or tobacco in return for making calls from smuggled phones. “Until 5-6 years ago, some prisoners would charge money to let others use the phone... a prisoner [once] charged an inmate about ₹100 to make a call to his girlfriend. Now with calls rates really cheap and all phones offering free calls, a phone is shared by many prisoners. Often, they use a common phone but have their own SIM cards. SIM cards are easy to smuggle because of their small size.”Finding ways to stop the callsThe recovery of phones from Akhtar’s possession has prompted prison authorities to look for a permanent solution to the problem. The cellphone jammer at the prison is unable to stop 4G signals. The authorities are working on getting the latest jammers or some other latest technology.Prison officers, who did not wish to be named, said every cell inside the prison was raided over the last week.Sandeep Goel, the prison’s director-general, said they will adopt the dominant tower technology to block the signals. “With permission from the telecom department, we have installed one cellphone tower at Mandoli jail complex. It worked effectively there. This tower blocks all signals from that particular area. We will install similar towers in Tihar, too, which will cut off all signals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tihar-authorities-seek-to-end-use-of-cellphones-a-status-symbol-for-prisoners-101616140524274.html
19-03-2021||Patna||Bihar litchi farmers fear losses due to weather-hit crop this year||The irregular weather conditions since mid January may impact the litchi crop’s quality and quantity in Bihar, fear farmers and agriculture scientists. Muzaffarpur and neighbouring districts account for more than 62% of India’s litchi production, down from 70% registered till a couple of years back. 45,000 litchi farmers are estimated to be in Muzaffarpur district alone, according to officials.“Litchi is grown on 46% of cultivable land in Muzaffarpur district, which on an average produces 1.5 lakh tonne of the fruit. But the temperature has played a spoilsport, resulting in a drop in the produce this year. The farmers of the north Bihar region fear a reduced crop,” said Bhola Nath Jha, one of the largest producers and exporters of the tropical fruit from the state.Vishal Nath, director of National Research Centre on Litchi (NRCL) in Muzaffarpur, said for thousands of farmers, litchis were the primary source of livelihood. “Muzafffarpur’s shahi (royal) litchi is famous for its big size, unique flavour, aroma and taste. It is not available anywhere else. But because of the unpredictable weather conditions, its quality can turn out to be poor some times as is feared this year.”Dr SD Pandey, a senior scientist at NRCL said litchi was affected by weather variations more than any other summer fruit. “Litchi is a sub-tropical fruit and requires a specific climate, unlike the off-season rains and unexpected temperature fluctuations seen in the current litchi season. Diurnal temperature variations (difference between day and night temperatures) too, play an important role in regulating the overall fruit growth, including total soluble solid content of the fruit, its acidity and sugar-to-acid ratio,” he said.Pandey claimed that the usual growth of the fruit seen during this period did not take place this time. “Fruit growth was slow because litchi grows under a specific micro-climatic condition. The temperature was very low during the flowering of the fruit and it was not good for its natural growth,” said the expert.The feared loss in litchi crop’s quality and quantity will result in a second consecutive year of heavy losses to farmers, whose fortunes were hit by the outbreak of coronavirus last year, said Bachcha Prasad Singh, a progressive farmer and the president of National Litchi Growers’ Association.Ashok Choudhary, a manager of a large litchi orchard in Jhaphan, said that the bad signs were beginning to show. “Traders were not lining up to buy the orchards. Earlier, we used to sell our orchard by the end of February. The reason is none other than an estimated loss in crop due to unfavourable weather conditions. We have sold litchi orchard spread over three bighas of land for ₹80,000 this year. What can we do? There is a problem in the market,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-litchi-farmers-fear-losses-due-to-weather-hit-crop-this-year-101616139740769.html

Announcing this, Nadaun Congress legislator Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, who is also the party’s in-charge for the elections to the Dharamshala MC, said: “In some wards, more than three aspirants have applied for the Congress ticket. We have sent panels for each of the 17 wards to the party high command for final selection. The list will be out by Sunday.” Nominations for the elections are to be filed from March 22 to 24 and scrutiny of the papers will be done on March 25. Candidates can withdraw nominations on March 27. Vision document being preparedSukhu said the party has also formed a committee to prepare a vision document for the Dharamshala MC. The six-member panel, headed by former legislator Yadvinder Goma, has local leaders Jitender Sharma, Ashok Pathania, RP Chopra, Rakesh Rana and Saroj Guleria as members. Sukhu, a former Himachal Congress chief, met party leaders from the area on Thursday night to draw up the poll strategy. Former Dharamshala MLA Sudhir Sharma, Kangra district Congress president Ajay Mahajan, former MP Chander Kumar, former state party president Kuldeep Kumar, state Congress spokesperson Kuldeep Pathania and outgoing Dharamshala mayor Devinder Jaggi attended the meeting.

19-03-2021||Other||Slam Dunk: An alternative philosophy to basketball talent development||In the last column, we observed the development of youth basketball players through what is currently a popular model of talent development in the USA. This philosophy involves putting youth basketball players in high-pressure situations from an early age, as young as seven, all the way through their teenage years. The athletes that can survive the rigors of the “pressure cooker” competitive environments over approximately a decade-and-a-half eventually make it into professional competitive basketball leagues. While this approach has certainly led to all-time great talent being produced (one could point to several NBA All-Stars that developed this way), there can also be an alternative approach to talent development in youth basketball. In this development model, youth athletes are consistently focused on the big picture goals of maximising their talent and learning a wide variety of basketball skills. Through hours of gameplay and creative constraints-based “instruction”, youth athletes develop a range of technical basketball skills needed to succeed in game environments which are complex and present rapidly changing scenarios to players. With the focus of this model being development of all basketball skills, athlete’s creativity and competitiveness is challenged through their problem-solving ability and how they respond to scenarios in which they “fail”. This model may create more creative players who might make a few more “mistakes”, however, the combination of technical skill and decision-making ability of players who develop in this way sees them often utilise their creativity in ways beneficial to their team’s success. This talent-development model certainly requires an increased focus on longer-term goals, which may lead to a lack of positive outcomes in the short-term. There are numerous present-day examples of NBA All-Stars who developed in this way, such as the Denver Nuggets Nikola Jokic, Dallas Mavericks Luka Doncic, and the future NBA Hall-Of-Fame player Manu Ginobili from the San Antonio Spurs. In the world of competitive sports, wins are prioritised at the highest level because of the direct financial benefit it brings to big sports clubs. At younger levels, if the focus is to truly develop athletes, then the argument could be made that the primary priority should be the development of all technical abilities of an athlete for their sport. There is an interesting parallel to draw between European powerhouse Barcelona FC and their football stars from the La Masia Academy, or the renowned Dutch football club Ajax FC in the Netherlands. In both these environments, at a younger age there is a focus on players skills and decision-making abilities and less focus on the outcome of matches. Considering the psychological benefits of such an approach is also an integral part of youth basketball improvement. As a younger athlete, the mental capacity and ability to handle praise, criticism and a spotlight are not fully developed. Therefore, focusing on positive outcomes in skill development at younger ages could have an increased benefit psychologically for an athlete when considering long-term improvement. The improvement in skill may lead to a greater desire to practice the sport in order to be competitive at it, which is a key ingredient in playing at the highest level in the most competitive basketball leagues, such as the NBA. As is often the case, melding the two approaches is likely to enable youth basketball talent to get the best of both worlds – developing decision-making and creative technical skill followed by consistently seeking out the best competitive environments will lead to maximum improvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slam-dunk-an-alternative-philosophy-to-basketball-talent-development-101616138239601.html

The mantra of 'reform, perform, transform' adopted by the government took the state out of its 'laggard' condition to make its economy the second biggest in the country, he said.Accusing the previous regimes of not taking initiative to improve the state's condition, he said, "This is the same UP where earlier, no festival could be celebrated peacefully. On the contrary, there have been no riots in the state in the last four years."  The government brought about extensive police reforms, he claimed, adding that it introduced a zero tolerance policy against crime and brought it down by 44 to 60 per cent in various categories."We see positive results in all sectors, be it agriculture or MSMEs. The per capita income has doubled. Rural connectivity and interstate connectivity has improved," he added.Further, the CM said the government focused on improving the education standard in the state. "Our government brought about extensive changes in education. The state was known for students copying in exams and we put an end to it and even improved infrastructure.""For students who were preparing for competitive exams and needed coaching, we brought in the Mukhya Mantri Abhidaya Yojna. As many as 18 lakh students are already connected with it," he said, claiming that 18 Atal residential schools and 30 new medical colleges were also opened in these years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/reform-perform-transform-up-cm-adityanath-on-completion-of-4-years-in-power-101616136865200.html

Senior officers said the two children also sustained minor burns, but all three of them are now stable. Police said the blaze started around 2.30am at Bengali Basti, apparently from a heap of garbage that probably caught fire from a cigarette or due to friction. The fire soon got spread to the nearby area and at least 14 jhuggis (huts) were gutted.

19-03-2021||Jaipur||Gehlot announces ₹5 lakh health insurance under Chiranjeevi Yojna from May 1||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has named the newly announced universal health coverage scheme CM Chiranjeevi Yojna and said it will cover annual medical insurance of up to ₹5 lakh for every family in the state beginning May 1. He also proposed a reform to allow lateral entry of subject experts in government departments such as mines, health and education. The announcements came during the CM’s reply to the debate on state budget in Rajasthan assembly on Thursday.Lateral entry in government parlance translates into direct and often temporary appointment to ad hoc positions, which are not filled through routine channels.The CM said that registrations for the ₹3,500 crore universal health coverage scheme, first announced during the state budget in February this year, will begin from May 1. He also announced to increase the annual area development fund for MLAs from ₹2.25 crore to ₹5 crore. Replying on the debate on Finance Bill 2021 and Appropriation Bill-2021, Gehlot also expressed concern over the “reduction” in funds given to the state by the Centre.He also urged the opposition to support the state government in taking up the issue of Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) and stalled railway route projects with the Centre. The ERCP proposes to provide drinking water to 13 districts of Rajasthan along with water for irrigation for 2.8 lakh hectares of land through 26 different large and medium projects. Gehlot has been demanding that the Centre grants its national project status in line with PM Narendra Modi’s “promises”.“I am ready to fight for ERCP just like the refinery project in Barmer. We have given 25 MPs in the Parliament. We all should work together,” Gehlot said.To opposition attacks over his government’s record on job creation, he claimed that the government provided more than 1.70 lakh new jobs during its two and a half years long tenure.“We have given 97,000 jobs till now. Examination results have been released for recruitment to 17,000 jobs. Advertisements have been issued for recruiting another 37,000 employees while the process of issuing advertisements for 23,000 new recruits was underway. In this way, our government has provided more than 1.70 lakh jobs in the last 2.5 years,” Gehlot said.The assembly passed the Appropriation Bill, 2021 and the Finance Bill, 2021 by a voice vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/gehlot-announces-rs-5-lakh-health-insurance-under-chiranjeevi-yojna-from-may-1-101616134579830.html
19-03-2021||Jaipur||New Covid-19 cases tripled within a week in Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot takes stock||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot instructed all health and administrative officials to use their experience and available resources including enforcement of restrictions, intensified testing and crowd control to contain the second wave of Covid-19, during a video-conference to review the situation on Thursday at the chief minister’s residence in Jaipur.“It is very worrying to see a three-time rise in the positivity rate of coronavirus infection within a week. On the basis of our shared experience of fighting Corona during the last one year, we have to save the people from the danger of the second wave. For this, discussions will be held with various political parties, social organisations, activists and religious leaders, etc. We have successfully fought the war against Corona so far by taking all sides together and coordinating with each other,” Gehlot said. CM said it was noted in the chief ministers’ meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday that the rate of infection was on the rise across the country and the situation was worrisome in many states. Gehlot asked officials to review the functioning of oxygen plants, testing labs, quarantine areas, and management of containment zones to deal with the rising cases. Gehlot also called for strict action against those responsible for crowding in markets and other public places and a comprehensive awareness campaign to promote Covid-appropriate behaviour. Medical and health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said more than 300 new Coronavirus positive cases were reported on each of the last two days in the state and the total number of active cases had gone past the three-thousand mark. “It is a matter of satisfaction that most of the active cases are in home isolation. The health department has planned to increase sampling, isolate suspected patients and immediate treatment to control the infection. Necessary instructions have been given to the district-level health officials for this,” said Mahajan. Medical and health minister Raghu Sharma said, “We will have to take all possible measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. At present, positive cases have increased in only a few districts and the resurgence can be controlled in this initial phase. Officers of the department have to control Corona through precautions while efficiently coordinating with other departments.” Principal of SMS Medical College, Dr Sudhir Bhandari said the infection can only be contained through early detection and treatment. “Based on the past years’ experience of coronavirus control, it is important that we make full use of investigative facilities to identify and isolate suspected patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/new-covid-19-cases-tripled-within-a-week-in-rajasthan-ashok-gehlot-takes-stock-101616129959476.html

Das was one of them. However, the institute was yet to finalise the minutes of the February meeting. Show-cause notices with an internal charge-sheet may be issued to the three after the proceedings of the governing body meeting were finalised. An inquiry will be conducted before the institute finally takes a call on their termination of services, said Dr PK Singh, director of AIIMS-Patna. “We are working on it. We expect it to be ready next week,” Dr Singh said referring to the minutes of the governing body meeting. In her letter to Dr Singh, Das said she wanted to discontinue her job to relocate to Kolkata with her family after the superannuation of her husband from government service on August 31, last year. She also requested that her resignation was accepted with only one month’s notice period, effective from March 4. As per AIIMS rules, faculty members were supposed to give three months’ notice period before quitting. While her resignation had been accepted, it was still not clear if her request for serving only one-month notice period will be granted. “Das has tendered her resignation. I’ve sent the file to the dean office. Let it be processed and we will take a call on it soon,” said Dr Singh. The faculty members in question were issued show-cause notices three years back as well on the insistence of the health ministry, but they became in fructuous after the ministry constituted a four-member high-power committee, comprising the directors of AIIMS Bhubaneswar and Patna, the deputy director and the registrar of AIIMS-Delhi to inquire into the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/senior-patna-aiims-faculty-facing-termination-charge-quits-101616122758926.html

19-03-2021||Delhi||9am-9pm: Window for jabs to be expanded at govt hospitals||Keeping vaccination centres open for 12 hours and increasing the number of inoculation sites across the city are two of several measures that the Delhi government said it is taking to increase the number of daily vaccinations from nearly 40,000 now to 125,000.Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the Centre to relax the eligibility criteria for Covid-19 vaccine jabs, adding that the state government could inoculate all adult residents of Delhi within three months if it were done.“The number of centres will also be doubled from 500 right now. At present, Covid-19 vaccination centres operate daily from 9am to 5pm, but their timings will be extended to 9am to 9pm daily,” Kejriwal also said at the press conference.Towards that end, the Delhi government on Thursday also ordered all its hospitals to extend the timings of their centres from Monday. “It is hereby ordered that with effect from 22.03.2021, all Delhi government hospitals will operate vaccination sites functioning on their premises up to at least 9pm. All facilities will ensure deployment of adequate manpower at these sites to ensure proper functioning of vaccination sites. Non-compliance shall be viewed seriously,” read the order from special secretary (health) SM Ali.In addition, all Delhi government-run hospitals have also been asked to increase the number of vaccination sites on their premises to at least six. Even the Lok Nayak Hospital currently has five vaccination sites while the Rajiv Gandhi superspeciality hospital has four.One of the vaccination centres at the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, which was the biggest Covid-19 treatment facility in Delhi, already runs round the clock. But, this is meant only for frontline workers who can get shot once after their shifts end.“Currently, we get around 30 to 40 people each day after hours at the centre. Now, everyone in the priority group will be allowed to come between 9am and 9pm to get the shots. From Friday, the hospital will start assessing the space needed for the additional centre and the staff strength to keep it open till 9pm,” said a senior administrative official from the hospital.Increasing CentresDelhi will start immunisations at all its dispensaries next week. “Inspection of dispensaries is complete and in the next couple of days, all of them will start the vaccine drive — people will have centres closer to their homes,” said a senior district official.There are around 260 dispensaries run by the Delhi government in the city and they currently operate from 9am to 5pm. “We have to check staff availability and other logistical issues before extending the timings of dispensaries,” the official said.There are, at present, 550 vaccinations sites — in 208 hospitals and 40 dispensaries — in Delhi, according to the CoWIN portal. Of them, 325 are in government facilities and 225 in private ones.The government is now looking to bring on board several private sector hospitals as well.“One round of inspection has been conducted at several small hospitals and they are likely to be added to the centres’ list next week. We have also got requests from private hospitals to keep centres open on Sundays.

The identities of the men, who allegedly raped the minor girl, are also being ascertained as it appears that some of the men knew that the girl was a minor.According to the police, the child lived with her mother in south-west Delhi. Her mother reported her missing on January 21 after which a kidnapping case was registered at Kapashera police station.The police probe has now revealed that the girl was kidnapped when she went out to buy chips from a local shop. The four kidnappers — two of them from her own neighbourhood — took her to a nearby house on the pretext of offering her a piece of a birthday cake. The cake, however, was spiked and the girl fell unconscious after eating it, said Urvija Goel, deputy commissioner of police (west).Thereafter, to force the girl into prostitution, they tortured her and offered her drugs, the details of which are yet to be ascertained, the DCP said.Once the girl was not in a position to resist, she was pushed into prostitution and raped by men in Delhi and Bihar. “There are text messages to reveal that some men looking for young women were offered the child and informed that she was a minor,” said the unnamed investigator quoted above.The prostitution gang dealt with their customers through WhatsApp. “There were over 150 WhatsApp groups of this racket and had a thousand customers from across India,” Goel said.Police said a team from Rajouri Garden police station in west Delhi was trying to trace some missing children when this girl’s name cropped up. Sometime last month, the police team got in touch with the girl’s mother and realised that the girl was kidnapped by traffickers.“About a month after her disappearance, the kidnappers allowed the girl to make a phone call to her mother. Her mother wasn’t told about her location,” said a second investigator.Eventually, the police used the communication between the mother and the kidnappers to pursue an online trail left by the suspects. The police traced the girl to Majnu ka Tilla in North Delhi on Tuesday from where she was rescued.Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said local police as well as the crime branch, have been pursuing prostitution rackets, particularly those suspected of trafficking women and minor girls. “We also take every missing complaint related to children very seriously. Even this child was traced due to our constant efforts to trace all missing children,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-rescue-12-year-old-who-was-kidnapped-forced-into-sex-work-101616111133706.html
19-03-2021||Delhi||Nehru Park jogging tracks against green norms: Forest department||Three months after the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) was issued a notice by the city’s forest department to stop work on a synthetic jogging track being installed at Nehru Park, the civic agency is continuing work, violating the Forest Conservation Act (1980).Deputy conservator forests (south division) Amit Anand, who slapped the NDMC with the notice on December 17 for constructions in Nehru Park, which is a deemed forest, said continuing work despite instructions was a violation of the FC Act.“This is surely a violation of the FC Act and they (NDMC) are overlooking the directions of the notice. Since the agency is not following the directions of the notice, action will have to be taken by the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s (MoEFCC) regional office,” said Anand.In the notice issued to the NDMC in December, the forest department had pointed out that Nehru Park was a deemed forest and any non-forest activity here, including construction of any kind, was prohibited.In Delhi’s context, “an area above 2.5 acres having a density of 100 trees per acre as well as stretches along roads and drains having a length of one kilometre,” are considered ‘deemed forests’. To undertake any “non-forest related activity” in such area permissions have to be sought from the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change under the Forest Conservation Act (1980).A senior NDMC official said the agency in a response sent to the forest department, said the 80-acre Nehru Park was not a “forest”, but a recreational park.“Nehru Park is not mentioned in the list of Delhi’s forests. It is a park meant for recreational purposes. However, any additions made to the park will in no way hamper the ecology of the area,” the official said.Apart from violating the FC Act, another restraining order was issued in January to the NDMC for concretising 40 trees in the park. After the restraining order was issued, the civic body claims to have de-concretised the trees and submitted a status report to the forest department.On January 14, deputy inspector general forests (central range) Prachi Gangwar, in a letter to the city forest department asked for a “factual report based on field visits in reference to both complaints”.HP Singh, superintendent engineer (roads), NDMC, on Thursday said they have responded to the forest department notice issued for the construction of the synthetic jogging track and the concretisation around trees.“We have replied to the forest department and are also maintaining the required distance around the trees,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nehru-park-jogging-tracks-against-green-norms-forest-department-101616110053045.html

The teachers’ body took out a protest march from DU Vice Chancellor’s office to the L-G office on Thursday against the introduction of a new pattern of funding in these 12 colleges.Delhi government’s higher education department last week asked the governing bodies of these colleges to pass a resolution stating that the pattern of assistance, as suggested by the Delhi government, and not that of the University Grants Commission (UGC), will be followed for the release of grant-in-aid.The resolution was also to state that colleges can use “surplus funds” available for the purpose of paying salaries.Earlier on Tuesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting with principals of these colleges and assured that the government will meet the DU officials to discuss the matter. He also ordered to release of all pending funds to these colleges.“The Delhi government is forcing these 12 colleges to adopt in their governing bodies the pattern of assistance issued by the directorate of higher education...The pattern of assistance document needs to be withdrawn,” DUTA said.A government official said, “The government has assured principals of 12 colleges that it will take every effort to resolve the matter."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/duta-protests-govt-s-pattern-of-assistance-101616109183812.html

19-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A fable in the cemetery||She was a cabaret dancer in Paris and a maharani in Kapurthala—but her tomb, surprisingly, chose not to mention it.Like all graveyards, the Christian Cemetery in central Delhi’s Prithviraj Road is something of a book, whose pages would be the hundreds of graves it is home to.One can spend an entire day here, walking from one grave to another, reading the heartfelt inscriptions written to celebrate mothers, fathers, grandparents, husbands, wives, siblings and children.But Stella’s memorial seems to be neither of those. She is just Stella of Mudge. A quick Google search, right by her graveside, reveals her to be somebody extraordinary. She features in a New Yorker magazine report on the Maharaja of Kapurthala, way back in 1945. She also appears in a 2003 book entitled Wicked Women of the Raj. A caption on the UK-based art auction house Christie’s website, accompanying the picture of a silver and enamel cigarette box, turns out to be a brief biography of the lady of the grave—“This box belonged to Stella Mudge, the stage name of Alice Villiers (1904-1984), a Kent-born cabaret dancer at the Folies Bergère in Paris where she met and was seduced by Maharajah Paramjit Singh of Kapurthala (1892-1955). She became his third wife and took the title of Maharani Narinder Kaur on their marriage in 1937.”The grave’s middle portion has disappeared. How can a maharani meet such an afterlife?A recent piece written on Medium website by Hemant Arya, a city flâneur, narrates Stella’s life in more detail—her modest English origins, her career in a Paris cabaret, and her destiny-altering encounter with a married Indian prince. Later, her reputation as a “money grabber” in princely India, her glamorous heydays with her car frequently getting “painted and upholstered to match her clothes,” her coronation as the Maharani of Kapurthala, and her eventual downfall following the Maharaja’s death, leading to her derelict days in a Simla hotel, and lonesome death in a Delhi hospital, aged 79.It is believed that the headstone on her grave was installed by an anonymous person in 1999. It reads—“Stella of Mudge, a fable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-fable-in-the-cemetery-101616098437717.html

The bids will be opened and vends allotted on March 19.The department had put 96 liquor vends on auction for the next financial year, up from 94 in 2020-21.The e-auction began on March 10 and the last date for bid submission was March 18.The highest reserve price of ₹7.95 crore has been set for a liquor vend in Dhanas. In 2019-2020, it had fetched the department ₹10.78 crore, highest among all vends. Last year too, it went for ₹7.05 crore, the second-highest bid.Other vends with the highest reserve price this year are at Khuda Lahora/ Khuda Jassu ( ₹6.75 crore) and Sector 30 ( ₹6.4 crore). Vends near Chandigarh’s border with neighbouring states generally fetch high bids as liquor in the city is cheaper than Mohali and Panchkula.Meanwhile, the reserve price of a vend in Sector 9, which had fetched the highest bid of ₹7.56 crore last year, is ₹6.1 crore. To curb the menace of cartelisation and monopolistic practices, a single entity of firms/companies/individuals will be entitled to allotment of up to a maximum of 10 vends.In the Chandigarh Excise Policy 2021-2022 announced on Wednesday, the administration has decided to keep the licence fee and excise duty on beer and wine unchanged. On the Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), the duty has been increased by 6%, which is expected to increase the prices of popular liquor brands by 10-12%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ut-excise-department-receives-162-bids-for-80-liquor-vends-101616098397270.html

Ranjit, of Nawanshahr, got bail from a Delhi court on March 16, and was released on Wednesday evening.“Sewa (volunteer service) is our future. Resentful of our service, some people started terming the Red Fort as sacred for them. The Red Fort has given many sufferings to the country... Guru Teg Bahadur (ninth Sikh guru) was also martyred in the fort…..How can the fort be venerable for you the walls of which are painted with blood?” said Sirsa.“We revere the front of the Red Fort where the Nishan Sahibs are hoisted, and which is connected to Guru Teg Bahadur. The youth who were defamed in the name of the Red Fort, will be honoured there itself,” he said, adding that 141 protesters (Singhs) had come out of jails and they hoped that the remaining will be released by March 28.He claimed, “Ranjit Singh was tortured and his religious faith was disrespected in jail, but he didn’t lose his courage.” Ranjit’s video grabs of being beaten with lathis and picked up — seemingly unconscious — too had gone viral. Ranjit said two days after the Republic Day, he was present near the farmers’ stage at Singhu border, when a mob had attacked the farmers with stones.

19-03-2021||Chandigarh||Stone crushing, mining put Yamunanagar on 26th spot among world’s 30 most-polluted cities||Yamunanagar has been ranked 26th among the top 30 most-polluted cities in the world and found its name among nine places of Haryana and 22 in India, as per a report released by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company.As per the report that was released earlier this week, this Haryana district has an average air quality index (AQI) of 74.5 that stands “unhealthy” based on the air quality measured in terms of levels of ultra-fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) that is said to be the most harmful to human beings due to its far-reaching health risks. An official of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HPCB), who didn’t wish to be named, said that the air quality, in this case, is measured through transport and industrial emissions, road dust, and construction activities among others.Situated on the banks of Yamuna, the Jagadhri-Yamunanagar twin towns have many air-polluting industries engaged in timber and metal production on large scale, along with units involved in stone crushing and mining activities. As reported in November, despite fewer stubble burning cases during the winter season, experts had agreed that dust, along with the poor quality of roads and heavy traffic movement, is major contributor to poor air quality in the district.The regional officer of HPCB, Nirmal Kashyap, had back then also blamed owners of the industrial units for not following the guidelines and cited that the AQI measuring device has been positioned at the busiest intersection near Gobind Pura. Kashyap didn’t respond to calls and messages for a comment on the recent ranking.DC Mukul Kumar said that he will analyse the situation with Kashyap to determine the major factors behind this.“However, the pollution board has time and again issued instructions to the industrial and mining units to cover their trucks during transportation of their goods and other materials,” the officer said.Other Haryana cities on the list are Faridabad, Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad, Bandhwari, Gurugram, Rohtak and Dharuhera. Neighbouring Ambala ranked 52nd with an average AQI of 58.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stone-crushing-mining-put-yamunanagar-on-26th-spot-among-world-s-30-most-polluted-cities-101616098037233.html
19-03-2021||Chandigarh||Bring more groups under ambit of vaccination drive in Chandigarh, say experts||With the city witnessing a resurgence in Covid-19 infections, voices for making the vaccine shots accessible for more groups have gone louder. Currently, as per the central government directives, people aged above 60 are eligible for inoculation, while those in the age group of 45 to 59 are eligible for the shot only if they have certain comorbidities specified by the Centre. This is hampering large-scale vaccination drive in the city even when it has reserved more than 80,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses with the daily capacity touching a minimum of 6,000 inoculations at around 45 centres in the city. Currently, the capacity utilisation is less than 3,000 in a single day. The rules are so stringent that the dose of vaccine is allowed to be wasted even if no beneficiary from the priority group is available. Due to this process, around 2% of the total 60,228 doses administered to date have been wasted. A vial of Covishield vaccine contains 10 doses which are subjected to be administered within four hours after the vial is opened. The central government protocol suggests that 10% wastage of the doses administered is allowed. Even the comorbid group has to get a certificate signed by a registered medical practitioner specifying that the person has a specific disease, which makes the entire process cumbersome.“At this stage, the government should urgently do away with the mandatory certificate required for inoculation and make vaccine shots available for all persons aged above 45 or 50,” Dr Yogesh Chawla, former director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said.Echoing the same sentiments, Dr KK Talwar, health adviser to the Punjab government and former director of PGIMER, said that Punjab has already appealed for bringing more groups under the ambit of vaccination.“There is a hesitancy among people and the process should be made as simple as it can be. The central government should give the authority to the state governments on how to go about it,” he added.Even the civil society groups are batting for relaxing the ‘restrictions’ on the vaccination. “I have already communicated to the administration to bring more groups under the ambit of the vaccination drive as the city has enough capacity to inoculate a large number of people in a single go,” RK Garg, president of Second Innings Association, said.Chairperson of Federation of Sectors Welfare Association, Chandigarh, Baljinder Singh Bittu, said as Covid cases are on a rise, it becomes necessary to decentralise the process and bring in more institutes to offer the shots without much focus on the eligibility. To make vaccines more accessible to the citizens, representatives have also suggested making provisions for administering vaccines at homes as well.“Many in the 60-plus age group want to get a jab, but they could not visit the facilities due to old age. The administration can actually provide the services for those persons by levying a nominal fee. This is something doable in the city like Chandigarh and we can lead by example,” Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, senior deputy mayor, Chandigarh, said.Dr Amandeep Kang, director of health services, Chandigarh, said they have enough capacity to start the drive for more groups and once the government gives a green signal, they will start it immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bring-more-groups-under-ambit-of-vaccination-drive-in-chandigarh-say-experts-101616097857077.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Trouble shooter-in-chief? Sharad Pawar steps in again to resolve Maharashtra govt’s crisis||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has once again stepped in to resolve the crisis the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government finds itself in. In fact, in the past 15 months, Pawar had to often intervene as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s inexperience in handling the government become a problem for the MVA, as was seen recently in the police officer Sachin Vaze’s case related to his involvement in the scare at industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house. As the MVA government, especially Thackeray, was cornered by the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Vaze controversy, Pawar held parleys with Thackeray on Monday to work out damage control measures, more importantly to distance the government from a controversial officer like Vaze. He called senior police officers to figure out what could be done. Following this, it was decided to transfer Param Bir Singh as the government needed to send a clear signal that it was cleaning up the mess, according to MVA insiders. Pawar also made several suggestions to Thackeray as well as home minister Anil Deshmukh regarding handling the current situation. He also made it a point to address a press conference in New Delhi and said the government would co-operate with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in investigation and the officers who misused their powers would have to face the music. This is not the first time Pawar had to step in to help Thackeray handle a crisis. In fact, the NCP chief has been guiding CM Thackeray and the MVA government in handling crises right from the beginning. He had taken the initiative to form a three-party coalition to keep the BJP away from power in a crucial state and has been ensuring the government comes out of crisis every time. Soon after the unprecedented Covid outbreak, Pawar stepped in to guide Thackeray and state administration on handling the epidemic. Pawar who has been active in politics for six decades also has a vast experience in handling administration. He was the chief minister of Maharashtra for three terms (together seven years), two terms as union agriculture minister (ten years) and one term as union defence minister (two years). He was also lauded for handling relief and rehabilitation after Latur earthquake and restoring normalcy in Mumbai within days after serial bomb blasts in 1993. His experience in handling administration or difficult political situation has been coming in handy for the MVA government. During the controversy after Sena minister Sanjay Rathod’s name was linked to death of a woman in Pune in February, it was Pawar who advised Thackeray to drop Rathod from the cabinet to prevent damage to the government’s image. During the recent budget session of state legislature, when the opposition cornered the government over Vaze’s role, Pawar rang up Deshmukh after which the home minister announced transfer of Vaze out of the crime branch. It was only then the opposition decided not to disrupt the functioning of the assembly, said a senior NCP minister. Following the arrest of Vaze by the NIA as the government was seen struggling to face the opposition’s onslaught, Pawar suggested that the government should distance itself from the police officer as the BJP was accusing the ruling Shiv Sena of links with Vaze. “Pawar had to step in to defuse the situation and advise the CM how to navigate through the controversy. He won’t like to be seen as someone who is doing backseat driving, but intervenes whenever there is a problem and the government is in crisis,” said Pratap Asbe, political analyst. NCP however maintained that Pawar is guiding the government. “If there is a problem, top leaders of the coalition sit together and discuss the situation. The decisions are taken by the chief minister who heads our government,”said state minister and NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik. “It is a fact that the MVA government gets the benefit of guidance from Pawar who has vast experience in handling administration,” he added. “Sharad Pawar is one of the few leaders in the country who has the most experience of running coalition governments. Everybody has respect towards his ability and experience. So, in times of crisis of this government every side listens to him. He has a big role in bringing together this government as well,” said Sanjay Raut, Sena leader and its chief spokesperson. He, however, said that it should not be looked as inexperience of Uddhav Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trouble-shooter-in-chief-sharad-pawar-steps-in-again-to-resolve-maharashtra-govt-s-crisis-101616097797106.html

State transport minister Razia Sultana, on Thursday, addressed the media on the occasion of the government completing four years. Accompanied by Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir, Razia, said, “What is the transport mafia? There are two types of mafia; one is illegal routes where more than permitted buses were being run. For this, we have filed a case in court. The second is the time table mafia, in which they use the time of other buses, as these run with the difference of five minutes. VTS will be imposed to end the transport mafia, as it will track location of all buses.”“VTS system will be installed on all government run buses. It will be compulsory for private buses,” she added.On the delay she said, “To control a mafia, you need planning and schemes take time for implementation.”BJP workers opposed the virtual address of CM Capt Amarinder Singh and the press conference of Razia Sultana by holding a protest and alleged that the Congress government has not met its pre-poll promises.Admitting that there had been a delay in conferring the district status on Malerkotla and the establishment of a medical college in her assembly segment, the Malerkotla MLA said she had raised these issues with the government and hoped for early execution.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&Caption Punjab transport minister Razia Sultana addressing the media in Sangrur on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transport-department-will-end-mafia-in-punjab-says-minister-101616097677228.html

Residents had stayed inside their houses and asked the officials to carry on the drive, stating they were ready to die.As per information, in 2016, Deepak Kumar and Narinder Singh had constructed 58 houses on around 2 acres of agricultural land without the approval of GMADA. The size of houses ranges from 50 square yards to 100 square yards and were sold for ₹15 lakh to ₹30 lakh. The houses were built four years back and all were registered.Additional chief administrator of GMADA, Rajesh Dhiman, said, “We have ordered an inquiry against the erring field officials of GMADA, who allowed the illegal houses to be constructed. The inquiry report will be completed in two weeks and accordingly action will be initiated. We will not spare any one and even action will be initiated against the builder.”He further said that as the residents had lost the case in Punjab and Haryana high court, demolition will be carried out after 60 days to vacate the agricultural land.They are just threatening us: BuilderWhen contacted, colony’s builder Narinder Singh said, “No one can raze the houses and they are just threatening us. We will not allow them to hold a demolition drive.” On being asked why he had not taken approval, he refused to comment.A resident, Sayed Akthar, questioned why their houses were registered with the revenue department, and why they got power and water supply connections. “The builder sold us the plot saying that it was an approved colony, so we bought it,” he said.Another resident, Prem Singh Bhist, said strict action should be taken against the officials of GMADA and the builders. “What is our fault? We have bought the plots from our hard-earned money. We don’t know where to go and what to do. Our families will be left without homes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/illegal-houses-in-mohali-s-behlolpur-gmada-marks-inquiry-against-erring-officials-builder-101616097617192.html

19-03-2021||Chandigarh||‘Only women with two or less kids eligible for maternity leave’||A woman can avail of maternity leave only if she has two or less surviving children, irrespective of whether they are biological or not, the Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled.The high court bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Sant Parkash passed the order while dismissing the plea of a nursing officer, working with Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, who had challenged the hospital’s decision to reject her maternity leave.The petitioner had applied for the leave following the birth of her first biological child after marrying a man, who already had two children from his first marriage.However, the leave request for June 2019 to September 2019 was denied by PGIMER and converted into earned leave. She had challenged this before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). But did not get any relief and approached the high court in February 2021.PGIMER had told the court that the woman had entered the names of the two children from her husband’s first marriage in the office record, and availed of child care leave and treatment facility for them on many occasions. Citing Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, the hospital had said that as she already had two surviving children, she was not eligible for maternity leave.The nursing officer had argued that she had sought the leave for her first biological child and PGIMER could not deprive her of her legitimate right to maternity leave on the artificial analogy of having two surviving children. While dismissing her plea, the high court bench observed that perusal of the service rules will reveal that maternity leave can be granted to a female government servant only if she had less than two surviving children. “Though the petitioner is not the biological mother of the two children born from the first wedlock of her husband, she cannot deny the fact that now she is their mother,” the court observed. It also took note of the fact that she has also availed of child care leave for the two children. “In view of this, any child born to her is to be considered as the third child,” the bench said, while upholding CAT’s decision to deny her relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-women-with-two-or-less-kids-eligible-for-maternity-leave-101616097378691.html

He also sought fool-proof security for the event. He told the court that COVID-19 guidelines will be strictly observed during the event.He made the Punjab government, Punjab chief secretary and home secretary, Inspector General Police and Lahore police chief respondents. Qureshi said that the government should not have refused to hold this event on the pretext of coronavirus pandemic. “The government should rather encourage such events as they give a peace message across the border,” Qureshi told PTI.He added that his foundation plans to install a plaque of Singh at Shadman Chowk where he was hanged 90 years ago. The foundation earlier in its resolution had demanded apology from the British Queen on the judicial murder of the three freedom fighters and compensation to their families. It also demanded the Imran Khan government name Shadman Chowk after Bhagat Singh. The resolution further demanded naming of a major road in Lahore after the three revolutionaries and their act of chivalry also be made part of school syllabus. It also demanded the British Queen to apologise from the families of the victims of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919).

19-03-2021||Chandigarh||No parallel probes in an FIR: HC to Punjab, Haryana, UT||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed police of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh not to conduct parallel probes in an FIR.The high court bench of justice Manoj Bajaj termed such inquiries by police officers sheer and blatant interference with the process of justice, which can’t stand the test of justification. “It is unfair for the prosecution also to forward inconsistent reports, expressing diverse opinions with respect to the same facts, and that too without any other material or evidence. Once the investigation is complete and report is submitted before the Court of law, police has no authority to deal with another line of inquiry, without intimating the court,” the bench observed striking down Punjab police instructions of May 4, 2017, which facilitated such probes further holding that the police officers of higher in rank have violated the procedural law of investigation contained in Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).The court has now directed that after registration of FIR and commencement of investigation, no representation/request on behalf of accused to examine his/her innocence would be entertained by police and no parallel inquiry would be initiated. In cases, the state government or the state police orders transfer of investigation, then it would be necessary to intimate the magistrate in writing with reasons for transfer of investigation. Whenever, the investigating officer after commencement of investigation, decides to hold or stop the investigation in respect of all or any of the accused persons it would be mandatory for such officer to send the report to the concerned magistrate, it said adding that if, the trial court upon conclusion of trial finds that the acquittal of the accused is on account of deliberate lapses in investigation, it can pass appropriate orders for suitable departmental/penal action against the officers responsible. The court said that both the governments and Chandigarh administration would ensure that the police officers and public prosecutors are properly sensitised about on this aspect. The directions came when court was dealing with pleas filed by two accused from Punjab seeking bail. It had come before court that while probes into FIRs were underway. Either accused or someone from his side approached senior officers who ordered another probe. Without associating investigating officer assigned to the FIR earlier, parallel probes were conducted, which gave conflicting reports. In one case, chargesheet was filed against accused but after parallel probe, the accused was declared innocent. “This kind of multiple probes complicate the task of trial court to trace the culprits, who often hide themselves behind the bushes of favourable inquiry reports, and at times they succeed in escaping the punishment, because the disintegrated procedure of investigation throws doubts on the prosecution case and makes it fragile. These procedures of investigation and inquiries are unheard in the annals of criminal jurisprudence and do not find support from statutory provisions,” the bench observed.The court further said that the superior officers have the prerogative to transfer the investigation, if, there are justifiable reasons, but in such an eventuality the investigation is to be transferred as a ‘whole’. After transfer of probe, the newly appointed Investigating Officer or agency would continue the investigation from the stage of transfer, as fresh or de novo (from the beginning) investigation is not permissible in law, it added.The court also noted that DGP Punjab submitted wrong information before the court when a report was sought from him. It said that DGP responded in a “casual and inattentive manner” without realizing its sensitivity. However, court refrained from making any other adverse observation further observing that it expects that in future the officer would act carefully. It further directed that copy of the judgment be sent to home secretaries and judicial officers in both the states and Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-parallel-probes-in-an-fir-hc-to-punjab-haryana-ut-101616096597143.html
19-03-2021||Chandigarh||Capt confident Sidhu will join back in his cabinet||A day after his meeting with party MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu over tea, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday expressed confidence that the former minister will be back in his cabinet. The two Congress leaders had met at the CM’s farmhouse near Chandigarh and discussed the cricketer-turned-politician’s likely re-induction into the state cabinet. “Everyone wants Navjot to be part of the team. We had a cordial meeting. He has sought some time. I am sure he will be part of our team,” Amarinder said in response to a question at a press conference here to mark the completion of four years of his government. The meeting between the CM and Sidhu, who had quit the state cabinet in July 2019, was a result of All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat amid the central leadership’s efforts to rehabilitate the former minister by giving him an important role as the deputy chief minister or the state unit head ahead of the state polls. Asked if Sidhu wanted to be deputy chief minister or the state Congress president, Amarinder said it was up to the Congress president (Sonia Gandhi) to decide these things. “It is neither my, nor Sunil Ji’s (Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar) decision. It is for the Congress president to decide,” he said, adding in a lighter vein, “If he (Sidhu) wants my job, he can have it”. The Wednesday’s meeting was the second between the two leaders who had met over lunch on November 25, 2020, after a gap of one-and-a-half years, signing a thaw in their ties. Sidhu, who had quit the government after the CM divested him of the local government portfolio, on Thursday tweeted: “Tinke se halki rui, rui se halka mangne wala aadmi.... na apne liye maanga tha, na maanga hai, na maanguga..(Have not asked for anything)” . Asked if we would be extending a similar “olive branch” to other leaders such as (Rajya Sabha MPs) Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Dullo, the CM said that while everyone had their own ambitions, it was up to the Congress president to decide. “In a difficult hour, you have to set aside your own ambitions and stand with the party,” he added. To a question on him leading the Congress and being its CM-face in the 2022 polls, the two-time CM said the decision would be taken by the AICC chief. When asked about political strategist Prashant Kishor’s appointment, he said that in a democracy, every leader and party has a team of strategists. The CM said that Kishor was in Chandigarh and had already started his work. The poll strategist, who was appointed as the chief minister’s principal adviser with cabinet rank on March 1, held meetings with officials to take stock of the progress made on the 2017 poll promises and give a push to implementation of those that are still unfulfilled in next six months, according to sources. Capt rejects EVMs; for returning to paper ballots The CM also opposed the continued use of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) in elections, seeking return to ballot papers. “In this electronic age, advanced countries like Japan, Sweden and UK have ballot papers. Everyone has ballot papers. They know these things can be fudged. We should go back to paper ballots,” he said in response to a question on the demand made by several legislators in the recently concluded budget session of the Punjab assembly for use of ballot papers in elections. Amarinder said he was among the first one to voice his opposition when Manohar Singh Gill was in the Election Commissioner several years ago. Capt not for job quota for locals Amarinder opposed the policy of job reservation for locals being followed by some states. The CM said he was not in favour of the policy of excessive regionalisation being followed by certain states, announcing that “Amarinder stands for INDIA FOR INDIANS’. “I believe that India is one country and too much regionalisation is not a good thing,” he said in response to a question on the Congress’ promise on compulsory recruitment of locals by private industry. In its 2017 manifesto, the Congress had promised “compulsory recruitment of local youth by industrial investors in Punjab up to 50% of the total workforce”. Recently, neighbouring Haryana has reserved 75% of jobs for locals in the private sector. Pointing out that there was no state in India where Punjabis were not flourishing and doing a great job, the CM questioned why Punjabis cannot buy land in Himachal Pradesh or do not have certain rights in Kashmir and Rajasthan. “If we start regionalising, we will suffer,” he warned. ‘Will move SC if assent not given to Punjab amendments’ Urging the Centre to scrap the farm laws, Amarinder said his government “will go to the Supreme Court if the President does not given assent to the state amendment Bills”. He said the governor was still sitting on the amendment bills instead of forwarding them for presidential approval, even though they were passed by the Vidhan Sabha unanimously. The CM said he could not see any middle path to break the stalemate between the farmers and the Centre. ‘Won’t interfere in sacrilege cases’ The CM said the SIT probing the sacrilege cases would soon complete its investigation and he will not interfere if they decide to challan any senior police officers or politicians. “The cases will be investigated to their logical conclusion and the guilty will be punished, irrespective of who they are,” he added. Listing out some of the key achievements of his government, he said the government had successfully broken the backbone of the drugs chain, which is what he had pledged to do with ‘Gutka Sahib’ in his hands. Contrary to what was being wrongly claimed in the media, he clarified that he had never said he will eliminate the drugs mafia completely. “I had clearly said – main nasheyan di lak todanga (will break the backbone of drug mafia),” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-confident-sidhu-will-join-back-in-his-cabinet-101616096478816.html
19-03-2021||Other||Reshuffle of cops to add to Maharashtra govt’s woes?||The minor reshuffle of top police officers, prompted by the state to appoint a new police commissioner for Mumbai to control the damage caused by the Sachin Vaze case, could become a headache for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.The state home department is in the process of sending a list of 12 Indian Police Service (IPS) officers of the rank of director general to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for the appointment of the new director general of police (DGP) from among them. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte confirmed that the government is in the process of sending the list to UPSC.The government could be in a difficult situation while appointing its new state police chief or DGP after the empanelment is ratified by UPSC, a process mandatory for the appointment. Among the four senior most officers in the race, three are the ones whom the government would not like to appoint for the post for various reasons.The empanelment of three officers from the list is mandatory as per the Supreme Court ruling given in 2006 in Prakash Singh case. The state has discretion of picking one of the three empanelled officers by UPSC.The home department has enlisted 12 Indian Police Service (IPS) from four batches (1986 to 1989) for the empanelment. The top five in the list are Sanjay Pandey, Hemant Nagrale , Param Bir Singh, Rashmi Shukla and Rajnish Seth.Nagrale was appointed as Mumbai Police commissioner on Wednesday after Singh was shunted out following the inept handling of the Antilia explosives scare and the alleged involvement of former cop Sachin Vaze in the case.Seth, who is the director general of the anti-corruption bureau, was appointed as acting DGP on Wednesday. Shukla is currently on the central deputation in Central Reserve Police Force. Pandey, the senior most contender (1986 batch), has openly expressed his displeasure for being sidelined amid the reshuffle. He was appointed as DG, Maharashtra State Security Corporation, which is assumed to be a side posting and has not been given any key posting in the recent past owing to his legal battles against the government.Shukla is assumed to not be in the list of MVA government’s “favourite officers“. A section of ministers in ruling parties believe that she was close to the previous Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government.“If UPSC choses three from the four senior most officers, Pandey and Singh would be the ones whom the government may not want to appoint as DGP, and it would be left with no option but to reappoint Nagrale for the post. When Subodh Kumar Jaisawal was appointed for the post in 2019, Pandey was not empanelled by UPSC, while the other two officers were Nagrale and Bipin Bihari, who retired in January. If Pandey is dropped again by UPSC, the third name could be that of Shukla. In that scenario, too, the government will have no option but to reappoint Nagrale as DGP,” said an official from the home department.If UPSC empanels Seth, who is fifth in the list in terms of seniority, the government is likely to continue him in the post by permanently appointing him as DGP. “To avoid the embarrassment, the government is expected to inform the UPSC panel about Shukla’s the deputation in the central services. In such a scenario, the state can expect Seth to be empanelled in the list of UPSC. The state chief secretary is a member of the UPSC panel that shortlists three names for the post. He may present the state’s case before the panel,” the official said.Meanwhile, Pandey has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray complaining about the ‘injustice’ meted out to him. “You overlooked me for the post of DG anti-corruption bureau, which was given to a junior officer, despite the tradition of giving it to the senior most officer. I was sidelined even when it came to the appointment to the Mumbai Police commissioner’s post. When Jaiswal chose to go on central deputation, the additional charge was not given to me, but to a junior officer, which was illegal as per SC ruling. The career built over several years is thus demolished due to some personal prejudices,” he said. Pandey confirmed writing the letter but refused to speak on the matter any further.When asked about the letter and the appointment of DGP, additional chief secretary (home) Manu Kumar Srivastava refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/reshuffle-of-cops-to-add-to-maharashtra-govt-s-woes-101616096477131.html

The owners of hotels and restaurants rued that the business will be affected by over 70% owing to it and this will also result in large scale unemployment as they will not be able to pay salaries to the staff.They stated that if the government is taking these steps to control the spread of the disease then it should also support the industry by announcing some relief and help them cover the losses.President of Hotel and Restaurant Association Amarvir Singh said, “We will be left with no other option but to shut down our units as 65-70% business will be affected due to the decision taken by the government. People go to restaurants after closing their shops therefore, the footfall usually increases at around 9 pm.”“The sector is already struggling at this time of crises, and this decision will lead to large-scale unemployment as the owners won’t be able to pay salaries to their employees. A meeting of the association will be held in the coming days to discuss the matter,” he added. Bandeep Singh, owner of a food joint in Sarabha Nagar, said, “We understand that the government is taking these steps to contain the spread of the disease, but it should also think of our industry. The footfall starts increasing around 8:30 pm, but at that time we will have to shut down the units to be able to reach our houses before 9 pm.”The owners of marriage palaces raised similar issues, and stated that they were already finding it difficult to make ends meet as people are not organising events due to the cap on gatherings, and the extension in the night curfew has further increased their trouble.Amarjit Singh Sant, president of the Marriage Palace Welfare Association, said, “We were already receiving only 40% response due to the cap on gatherings and night curfew, and this decision will further bring down the business to 10%. Now, we will not be able to organise two events in a day as the events that were to be organised at night will now either be held during the afternoon or the customers will cancel the bookings.” Traders rue lossesSunil Mehra, general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, stated that the trade has already been affected at large during the post lockdown period.“The extension of night curfew will further inculcate fear among the customers especially, those coming from other districts. The footfall will decrease in the coming days, and traders will suffer huge losses,” he said.The traders stated that the government should focus on expediting the vaccination drive rather than extending night curfew timings.Amarjit Singh, president of Model Town market association, said, “The business will be affected by extension in the timings of the night curfew as people will not move out even in the evening due to fear. The government should rather take up the vaccination drive at large to control the spread of the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-punjab-extends-night-curfew-timings-hospitality-industry-fears-more-losses-101616095758717.html

Four bank lockers of the group have also been found and put under restraint,” reads the statement. “There is not only misuse of the scheme but also tax evasion which is estimated to be not less than ₹36 crore. But during the search, evidence was found that the group has claimed bogus expenses on account of building material including cement, sand, and iron bars of around ₹100 crore, in the previous years, leading to huge evasion of taxes,” the statement further read.Substantial evidence has also been found that the group has routed their unaccounted income of ₹70 crore in the form of bogus share capital and unsecured loan through a shell company which has been invested in the buyout of a real estate project from a popular builder in Gurugram area, reads the statement.“The group is also regularly claiming huge bogus business promotion expenses in the previous years, and laundering the cash siphoned off as unaccounted investment in immovable properties. During the search, evidence has been found proving bogus booking of flats in the name of employees, relatives and unidentifiable persons in the affordable housing scheme project of the group,” reads the statement.The company has allotted houses to employees of the group members, whose un-encashed cheques have been found on the premises. Flats have been further sold to the actual buyer at a premium of ₹6-10 lakh each and the premiums have been received in cash and not accounted for in the books. The premium in cash has been charged from other buyers as well, in this affordable housing scheme, it added.The I-T officials claimed that notices under the Faceless Assessment Scheme sent to certain assesses were consistently not complied with.During enquiries, it was found that the persons to whom the notices were issued were engaged in liquor business run by the group and it was found that such persons to whom liquor licences were issued were benamidars of the main group members and they have stated on oath that they have no knowledge of the business being run in their names.“Evidence in the form of property documents and title deeds have been found regarding investment in benami properties in India as well as out of the country and the matter is being examined further. Besides, the group has incurred unaccounted expenditure for personal and office purposes in cash running into crores including expenditure for taking approvals for projects and lavish marriage expenses,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/raid-on-samalkha-cong-mla-s-properties-i-t-dept-claims-tax-evasion-benami-properties-of-crores-101616095757648.html

Deshmukh said that the information had come to light from the preliminary inquiry into the Antilia explosives case.“The transfer of Mumbai Police commissioner was to ensure that the ongoing probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the state anti-terrorism squad (ATS) is not hampered. The decision was taken collectively in the meeting chaired by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray,” said the home minister, who was speaking at the Lokmat Maharashtrian of The Year Award event on Thursday.Deshmukh also said that the no officer will be spared, if found guilty in the probe. “Maharashtra Police has been doing a fantastic job. Its morale is high, but the entire force is made to bear the brunt of the mistakes committed by a few officers. Those officers, be it an API (assistant police inspector) or senior rank officer, will not be spared if found guilty. Singh was the commissioner and the case [of explosives] was under his jurisdiction. Vehicles belonging to the commissionerate were used in the incident. Drivers and colleagues were found to be involved in the case, and so a thorough probe is a must,” he said.When asked if Singh could be called by NIA for interrogation, Deshmukh said, “NIA has got the right to call anybody for an inquiry. Even ATS can call any officer for an inquiry.”Deshmukh also denied the claim made by leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, stating that CM Uddhav Thackeray had recommended API Sachin Vaze’s reinstatement in the force. “It is a political allegation levelled by Fadnavis. The decision related to the reinstatement of any officer of the rank of API is done at the level of police commissioner. A five-member committee headed by the commissioner, comprising other high-ranking officers at the commissionerate, take the decision after a review. There was no question of appointing Vaze at the government level. CM or home minister deal with the reinstatement of officers of the rank above additional superintendent of police,” he said.When asked about Fadnavis’s accessibility of the information related to sensitive cases such as the explosives scare, the home minister said, “ Like any other department, there could be a rift within the police administration, leading to the leak of sensitive information. Secondly, a central agency is investigating the case,” he said, referring to NIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exmumbai-top-cop-shunted-out-over-unpardonable-mistakes-state-home-min-101616095517497.html
19-03-2021||Chandigarh||Bogus admissions detected after Aadhaar-based admissions started||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday informed the Vidhan Sabha that over two lakh bogus admissions were detected in schools after Aadhaar-based admissions was introduced.Responding to Congress MLA Geeta Bhukkal’s concern raised in the zero hour that the state government was reportedly closing 1,057 government schools, the CM said that the number of children admitted in government schools have come down by two lakh as these children were enrolled in private schools.Khattar said that students already studying in private schools were admitted in government schools to avail certain benefits.The CM said that the state government, as per rules, has also decided to shut one school out of two schools running within a radius of one kilometre.Former education minister Bhukkal had sought to know the compulsions to shut 1,057 schools. She said that earlier the government closed kisan model schools that the Congress had started and classes in the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET) had been discontinued.CLP leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the state government should run kisan model schools instead of closing them.“We should take education to the doorsteps of kisans. When will you fill up the vacant posts of teachers?” Hooda asked.State education minister Kanwar Pal said that the state had more JBT teachers than required and that the new education policy will not require JBT teachers.The CM made it clear that the government would not start training courses including teachers training courses, which are not in demand.“When we don’t have requirement of JBT teachers, why should we run such training courses,” Khattar said, adding that the state will implement the New Education Policy from 2025.He said that although the posts of JBT teachers are sanctioned, their demand has decreased.He said that keeping in view the growing demand of doctors, opening medical colleges (private as well as government) in every district is top priority of the state government.He added that the state government has also increased validity of TET from five to seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bogus-admissions-detected-after-aadhaar-based-admissions-started-101616095460627.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Will Maharashtra home min Anil Deshmukh be the next head to roll after Param Bir Singh?||With Param Bir Singh shunted out of the position of Mumbai police commissioner amid the controversy over Mansukh Hiran’s death related to the Antilia bomb scare case, there are speculations that home minister Anil Deshmukh, too, may lose the portfolio. Party insiders said the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leadership is mulling replacing Deshmukh, but it is unlikely to happen immediately. “There are two things. First, by shifting Deshmukh out of home department, the party doesn’t want to create an impression that he was somehow responsible for the mess,” said a senior minister, seeking anonymity. “Second, the selection of home minister is tricky. The party chief will have to pick a candidate who is acceptable to the top brass and at the same time capable of handling the department well.” Deshmukh on Thursday said he will remain the home minister until NCP chief Sharad Pawar wants him to handle the responsibility. “Recently, Pawar saheb in a press conference in Delhi praised my work. I will remain in this position until he wants me to continue. His word is final in our party,” Deshmukh said in response to a question at a function organised by Lokmat Group. “In my political career spanning 30 years, there is not a single blot on my image. Both the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and anti-terrorism squad (ATS) are probing what happened. All those found involved will have to face the consequences,” Deshmukh insisted. In 2019 when the MVA government was formed, Pawar surprised everyone by picking Deshmukh for the job of home minister, although the names of Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse Patil, all senior ministers, were doing the rounds. “As the Antilia bomb scare issue was discussed in the assembly, it appeared the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had more information than the home minister. Fadnavis kept attacking the government over the issue by citing one proof after other and Deshmukh seemed to be taken by surprise. How come Fadnavis managed to get a copy of call detail records (CDR) of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran? He was a step ahead of the home minister,” said a key NCP leader. “The party leadership is looking at this episode as Deshmukh’s inability to handle a sensitive department such as home, especially in the time of crisis, owing to which names of his probable successors are under consideration,” he addeed. Party insiders said the possible replacement could be deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state party unit chief Jayant Patil. Besides, health minister Rajesh Tope who impressed the party top brass by his work during the Covid crisis is another option. Ajit would have been the first choice but he is not keen to take up the responsibility. “He (Ajit Pawar) doesn’t want to leave the finance and planning departments, as they are directly related to policy and governance whereas the home department is more about dealing with problems as they arise rather than planning,” said a NCP functionary. Jayant Patil led the home department for a year after then home minister RR Patil stepped down following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008. But he is also comfortable with the water resources department he is heading now, in addition to the responsibility as the state NCP chief, said the functionary. Tope could be acceptable to all, just like Anil Deshmukh. “If both Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil refuse to take over the post, Tope might be preferred,” said the NCP functionary. Traditionally, in Maharashtra, a politically heavyweight is given the responsibility of the home department. From Gopinath Munde to Chhagan Bhujbal to RR Patil, Jayant Patil and Devendra Fadnavis, all home ministers were political heavyweights who commanded respect in the department as well as within the government. There were allegations of Shiv Sena leaders interfering with Deshmukh’s department and directly coordinating with police officers in Mumbai for local issues. Deshmukh had reportedly complained to the NCP chief that he was not given a free hand in the home department. This was also a reason why Pawar decided not to remove Deshmukh immediately. The NCP leadership also does not want to indicate that Deshmukh’s ouster is a fallout of the Antilia bomb scare case. “The one (Anil Deshmukh) having the responsibility of the home department has done a good job. Those involved in wrongdoings were found and exposed and it was proved that stern action can be taken,” Pawar told reporters in Delhi on Tuesday. He also expressed surprise over a question on removing Deshmukh as the home minister. “This is news to me,” he replied. On Wednesday, Patil, too, said news of Deshmukh’s ouster is just a rumour. State officials and former senior police officers feel the issue should have been handled differently. “The Mumbai police shouldn’t have gotten into these controversies,” said a retired home secretary, who did not wish to be named. YC Pawar, a retired IPS officer, “The home minister has not handled the case properly. It was not an ordinary extortion case. It was about the richest man of this country…Two statements made by the home minister are contradictory. In the beginning, he said investigation was in the right direction. On Thursday, he said the Mumbai police commissioner has been removed because they have found something in the probe and Singh failed to fulfill his duties... All this creates a suspicion of political patronage in this matter.” KP Raghuvanshi, retired IPS officer, who also headed the anti-terroism squad, said, “It is unimaginable that a police officer, who is part of an intelligence unit, will plant explosives for whatever reason. The officer should have been controlled by the supervisors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-maharashtra-home-min-anil-deshmukh-be-the-next-head-to-roll-after-param-bir-singh-101616095038350.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||TRP case: Will probe for as long as needed, state tells Bombay HC||Responding to the Bombay high court’s query on why Republic TV editor Arnab Goswami and ARG Outlier Media were not named as accused in the television ratings points (TRP) manipulation case, the state on Thursday said it was not in a position to answer the question immediately, but it had the right to investigate a case for long as needed. The court thereafter observed that there was a need for investigation agencies to have a reasonable approach as faith of the public in them depended on it. After the state assured the court that the interim relief against coercive action to Goswami and other employees of ARG Outlier would continue for two weeks, the court posted the hearing for Monday. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition by ARG Outlier and Goswami seeking quashing of the FIR and chargesheet in the TRP manipulation case, was informed by chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare submitted that as there were no statutory restriction, investigation would go on as long as needed. The court while accepting the submission however said that rather than keeping the petitioners on tenterhooks, the police could call on them as per clause 12 of the charge sheet which mentions chalak and malak (operator and owner) by issuing them notice. The court gave the example of the Dabholkar and Pansare case and said that it was not asking the state to give a time limit for completion of the investigations. Senior counsel Ashok Mundargi for the petitioners drew the attention of the bench to the fact that the alleged crime that the channel was involved in was influencing cable operators to place the channel at the top of the bouquet which they offered to subscribers. The action, Mundargi said, even if constituted an offence, could be dealt with by TRAI. He added that the company and Goswami were willing to cooperate with the investigation provided they were told what their alleged offences were. As the police was being evasive by keeping the investigations open ended, their apprehension of being arrested was not out of place, he said. He also referred to the two charge sheets filed till now in the case and said the claims that the TRP ratings throughout the country were manipulated by rigging a few barometers in Mumbai was not possible. After hearing the submissions the bench observed, “In a democratic set up, there has to be reasonability and objectiveness. Hence what we want to know when will you complete the investigation…There is a concept of welfare state. The state and the investigating officer should stop at one stage. It cannot continue for years together.” The fake TRP scam came to light in October when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. Hansa is one of BARC’s vendors on engagement with panel homes or people’s meters. TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers. As per the police, some of these households were being bribed to tune into Republic TV and a few other channels. Republic TV has denied wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-case-will-probe-for-as-long-as-needed-state-tells-bombay-hc-101616095037107.html

The court also directed the addition of the contractor as a party to the PIL and asked the state to file its reply within three weeks as well and posted the hearing to April 21. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Pravin Wategaonkar and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Nitin Sardesai, was informed by Dr Milind Sathe for MSRDC that documents supporting the affidavit were being submitted as per court directions on Wednesday. While referring to disclosures in the MSRDC affidavit that nearly 20,000 vehicles were using the expressway without paying toll every day, advocate Girish Godbole, amicus curiae, said it was impossible to believe that such a large number of vehicles were exempted from paying toll even if the exemption was granted by the government. He submitted that in light of this, the allegation of Wategaonkar of under-reporting/misdeclaration of toll revenue had some substance. Godbole submitted that the under-reporting of toll revenue by the contractor could result in a loss to the Union of India. After hearing the submissions, the bench asked CAG to assist the court in the determination of issues involved as experts on the matter and to file a comprehensive affidavit dealing with the issues raised in the petition and affidavit in reply by MSRDC. Advocate Vinay Joshi for CAG sought time of three weeks to comply, to which the court granted two weeks. The court also directed advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state to file an affidavit based on the documents placed before the court. The court then observed that as the contractor was not a party to the PIL with regards to the nature of allegations levelled in the petition it was necessary to make him a party as issues raised could not be heard without allowing him to have his say. The court then directed the contractor to be made a party and also directed advocate Venkatesh Dhond for the contractor to file an affidavit in response to the PIL and posted hearing of the PIL to April 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-cag-to-file-affidavit-in-mumbai-pune-eway-toll-collection-101616094618126.html

MMRDA is working towards creating a common mobility platform for contactless and seamless travel across all modes.RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said the aim is to start the services along with Metros. MMRDA is looking at operationalising Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) this year. The authority has begun pre-trials for the trains.According to the minutes of the executive committee meeting on MMRDA website, the authority got proposals from SBI, HDFC and ICICI banks for the project. The authority had also set up a committee under the chairmanship of the additional metropolitan commissioner for technical evaluation of proposals. The minutes state that SBI was the lowest bidder, quoting to charge 1.60% as the cost per transaction, and it has been appointed for the project.Owing to the pandemic, the authority set aside various options and has fixed on creating a “journey planner”, a mobile application to enable a contactless and seamless travel across public transport systems.The application will work across Metro, monorail, BEST buses, app-based cabs and the suburban railways.Currently, each transport mode in Mumbai has its own ticketing system — for suburban trains, commuters can use ATVM card apart from the physical tickets; the Mumbai Metro One also has its own card; Mumbai monorail has a token system; while all payments for taxis and auto-rickshaws and even BEST buses need to be done through cash. Across the world, big metropolises have single or multiple common mobility cards — London has the Oyster Card; Hong Kong, the Octopus card; Sydney has the Opal card; Toronto has Presto; and Manila has the Beep card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-integrated-ticketing-system-mmrda-appoints-sbi-as-banking-partner-101616094436902.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants bail to driver of car used in 2018 Rajeshwar Udani murder||The Bombay high court (HC) has granted bail to a 19-year-old who was booked as an accused in the kidnapping and murder of diamond merchant Rajeshwar Udani on November 28, 2018.Bail was granted on the grounds that the man, who was only a rickshaw driver, was asked to drive the car in which the murder took place by the other co-accused, and prima facie he did not seem to be involved in the conspiracy to kill Udani. The single bench of justice Revati Mohite Dere while hearing the bail application of Pranit Bhoir, one of the seven accused arrested for the murder of Ghatkopar resident Udani at Panvel, was informed by advocates Rahul Thakur and Ganesh Gupta that Bhoir was called by his cousin and co-accused to drive the car in which the murder took place. As Bhoir was an autorickshaw driver, he agreed, not knowing about the conspiracy of the passengers to smother and kill Udani. The advocates submitted that after Udani’s body was disposed by the other accused in Dehrang Dam in Panvel, Bhoir had gone home after informing his cousin of the developments. The advocates submitted that as Bhoir did not have any criminal antecedents and was merely driving the car in which the gruesome murder took place, he could not be incriminated for hatching the plan to kill Udani. In light of these submissions, the advocates sought bail for the 19-year-old. The incident was reported at the behest of Udani’s son who first lodged a missing complaint when his father failed to return home on November 28, 2018. Later, a case of murder was filed after the post-mortem report revealed Udani was smothered and strangled to death. Apart from Bhoir, Sachin Pawar, a political party worker; suspended police constable Dinesh Pawar; Siddhesh Patil; Mahesh Bhoir; Shaista Khan; and Nikhat Khan were arrested in the case. The conspiracy of kidnapping and killing Udani was allegedly hatched by Sachin Pawar who, according to actress Devoleena Bhattacharjee, thought Udani was romantically involved with her. Bhattacharya and Pawar were partners.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that while the role of the other accused in the murder was clear, Bhoir’s involvement in the conspiracy and murder was not established and hence deserved to be granted bail. Bhoir was granted bail for a sum of ₹25,000 with one or two solvent sureties in like amount. He has been asked to attend the police station once a month till the completion of the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-driver-of-car-used-in-2018-rajeshwar-udani-murder-101616094257020.html

19-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to stay release of John Abraham starrer Mumbai Saga||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday refused to stay the release of John Abraham starrer Bollywood movie Mumbai Saga.Ravi Mallesh Bohra, known in Mumbai’s underworld as DK Rao, and family members of late gangster Amar Naik moved HC for staying release of the film, which is purportedly based on the lives of DK Rao, late Amar Naik and his brother Ashwin. The movie is scheduled to be released on March 19.A division bench comprising justice Amjad Sayed and justice Nitin Jamdar refused interim stay on release of the film, primarily on the grounds that the petitioners had moved the court at eleventh hour.Relying on newspaper reports, Bohra, Ashwin, and the wife and daughter of late Amar Naik moved HC contending that the movie depicted and portrayed their lives and times. They have sought stay on release of the film contending that the release of the movie would violate the right to fair trial of Bohra and Ashwin, and the right to privacy of all the petitioners.They said the trailer of the film was published on YouTube on February 26 and clearly stated that the film was “inspired by true events”.Their petition added that on March 6, a legal notice was issued to the producer and director of the film, calling upon them to desist from going ahead with scheduled release of the movie as it depicted events concerning Bohra, and since the contents were not tested on the touchstone of the evidence on record of the pending case against him.Bohra and Ashwin have contended that both of them are under-trial prisoners, and the release of the film will prejudice their pending trials and also likely to affect the sanctity of the judicial process.Slain Amar Naik’s wife, Anjali, and daughter Akaksha, contended that they have already suffered immense trauma because of the encounter killing and stigma for being his family members, and added that the film will add to their woes. They have claimed that the film would tarnish the family’s image and will also breach their right to privacy and the reputation build by the mother-daughter duo following death of the gangster in an encounter with police.The mother-daughter duo further claimed that Naik was a reputed vegetable vendor and was implicated in several false cases at the behest of his business rivals, but was never tried for any of the alleged offences. They added that the family had to face disastrous consequences of the false implications, and both of them are still running from pillar to post for justice.They claimed the film will again show Naik in bad light, which will be detrimental to them as it would further the social stigma and may even pose a threat to their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-stay-release-of-john-abraham-starrer-mumbai-saga-101616094137401.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Air India pilots demand roll back of blanket ban on posting on social media||Air India’s union of Airbus pilots — Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) — has appealed to its management to roll back their policy that does not allow any Air India employee, whether serving or retired, to post anything on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, WhatsApp or Twitter, blogs or video channels, be it during or after duty hours. ICPA has termed the policy to be entirely illegal and with no basis in law.Despite repeated attempts, Air India did not respond to HT’s queries.Besides other restrictions, the pilots, in a letter to its chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal, raised concerns on getting approval from the airline even for uploading personal content related to Air India or any of its activities. The pilots also pointed out that the policy implemented from March 1 this year states that the airline has rights to monitor comments or discussions about them, their employees, clients and the industry posted on the internet.The pilots said that India currently has no law that either empowers or remotely justified such an act by the employer, especially Air India being a state instrumentality under Article 12 of the Constitution, to impose such a blanket ban on the use of social media. The letter read, “While we note the concerns that Air India may have in respect of protecting its image over social/digital media, especially preceding its proposed disinvestment, the introduction of a policy as the present one, is entirely unheard of and infringes upon various rights of its employees. It goes on to categorically state that it covers conduct of employees as private participants on social media platforms, thereby making it patently illegal. The present Policy introduced by Air India, is most importantly, violative of the fundamental right of freedom and speech, guaranteed to the employees of Air India, under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution, being citizens of India.”The pilots said, “Even assuming for a moment that Air India still has the authority and the power to introduce the present blanket policy, the same is expressly hit by the bar under section 9A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and cannot be allowed to subsist.”Stating the law in detail, the pilots reiterated that the introduction and enforcement of the policy by Air India without any consultation, discussion, notice or any other form of communication with the employees, will result in multiple violations by them and hence asked them to drop the policy.Aviation expert Mohan Ranganathan said, “Abusing the uniform in any situation is not accepted. Hence, if Air India has specified to not upload posts in the airline’s uniform, they are right. However, restricting personal posts unrelated to Air India is not accepted in any situation and is against one’s fundamental rights. Air India is run by the government, and restricting employees to even comment on posts and keeping a record of their activities on digital social media platforms is because they are dancing to the tune of the minister. They should be taking strict action against safety violators rather than coming up with such things.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-air-india-pilots-demand-roll-back-of-blanket-ban-on-posting-on-social-media-101616093957048.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||At 2,877 cases, Mumbai sees highest daily spike||With 2,877 cases in a single day, Mumbai on Thursday reported the highest single day spike in Covid-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic outbreak in the city on March 11 last year. Until Thursday, the highest number of cases reported in Mumbai in a single day was 2,848, on October 7. Experts and doctors have categorised this as yet another peak in Mumbai’s Covid graph. The previous peaks were reported during the festival season in September and October, and in May. Mumbai also reported eight deaths due to Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the toll to 11,559 with a case fatality rate of 3.2%. The number of active cases in the city has also gone up to 17,153 on Thursday. Until now, Mumbai has reported a total of 352,851 Covid-19 cases. This has brought down Mumbai’s recovery rate to 91%, from the 94-95% recorded in January and February. This is a result of 23,402 tests that were conducted in Mumbai on Wednesday, with the single day positivity rate of 12.2%. In contrast, on October 7 last year, Mumbai had a higher single day positivity rate of 20.01%, as it had conducted 14,233 tests on that day. Positivity rate is calculated as a percent of positive cases to the total number of tests done. The overall growth rate of Covid-19 cases in the city has shot up to 0.51%, which was about 0.15% mid-February. The doubling rate has dropped to 136 days down from 455 days mid-February. Doubling rate is the number of days it takes for Covid-19 cases to double in the city. Experts have attributed the spike to unlocking of the city and opening up of economy. “There is also a Covid-bravado among all citizens – akin to a sense of living with Covid-19 which translates to non-adherence to hygiene such as wearing of face masks, hand sanitizing; and a sense of “relief that a vaccine against the virus has now come, and it is only a matter of time before citizens can live without fear of the infection,” experts say. Dr Rahul Pandit, a senior city-based doctor who is member of the government Covid-19 task force, said, “There is no doubt that the number of cases is alarming. This can be looked at as a peak in cases for Mumbai. We also need to see this in perspective of the number of tests done and the positivity rate. Mumbai has ramped up its testing capacity considerably, so it is one of the reasons for high numbers. It also means we are able to locate positive patients on time, with more tests.” According to Dr Pandit, Mumbai can expect this peak for a few more days. “There is no way to predict how many days this peak will last. Mumbai has typically not been like other places where it touches the peak and comes down. We have stayed at the peak for some time.” Mumbai on Thursday vaccinated a total of 39,644 beneficiaries, of which 23,599 were senior citizens and 4,525 were citizens above the age of 45 with co-morbidities. While 33,125 beneficiaries received the first dose of their vaccine, including healthcare and frontline workers, senior citizens and those above 45 years with comorbidities, 6,519 received the second dose among healthcare and frontline workers. So far, Mumbai has vaccinated 768,261 people, of which 669,450 received their first dose, and 98,811 have received their second dose. So far, 351,767 senior citizens have been vaccinated, and 49,920 citizens above age 45 years with comorbidities have been vaccinated. There are 91 vaccination centres in the city. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, incharge of BMC’s health department,said, “Two conclusions were made in the meeting: to ramp up testing, and rapidly vaccinate the population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-2-877-cases-mumbai-sees-highest-daily-spike-101616093837662.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dharavi sees 30 cases, most since September||Dharavi on Thursday recorded 30 fresh Covid-19 cases for the first time since September 11 last year when it reported 33 cases in a single day. Dharavi now has a total of 4,382 Covid-19 cases, over 315 deaths, and 140 active Covid cases.Over the past few days, daily cases in Dharavi have been increasing, for the first time since their decline over five months ago. In the past week, Dharavi has reported over 15 cases every day, up from around ten cases before that, and cases in single digits over the past few months.Active cases in the slum pocket had dropped to as low as 20 cases, crossed the 100 cases mark on March 10.Reacting to the spurt in Covid-19 cases, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) adopted several measures to contain the spread of the virus in Dharavi, during its peak in May. These include organising fever camps to conduct free tests for the population of the slum, testing via mobile vans, and door to door screening.The Dharavi slum is spread over 2.4 sq km, has a population of 653,000 lakh, but it is estimated that its actual population is 850,000 due to unaccounted migration, with a population density of 354,167 per square kilometre, compared to Mumbai’s population density of 20,634 people per sq km. About 80% of its population depends on 450 community toilets in the locality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-dharavi-sees-30-cases-most-since-september-101616093717099.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Get masks in exchange for plastic at CSMT, Dadar railway stations||To increase the recycling of plastic waste materials on the suburban railway stations, the Central Railway (CR) has initiated the ‘Plastic Lao, Mask Pao’ campaign. Through this month-long campaign, which starts today, the passengers will be asked to donate plastic waste and get facial masks in exchange.Plastic waste collection kiosks are placed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Dadar railway stations. Passengers can deposit all plastic waste materials including bottles, polythene bags etc.“On the occasion of global recycling day, we have partnered with the United Nations Development Programme. Through this campaign, we hope to create awareness of the importance of collecting and recycling plastic waste. Railways also want to send the message to everyone that it is important to wear a mask to contain the spread of coronavirus.” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, CR.The Central and Western Railway had also placed plastic bottle recycling machines on the suburban railway stations.Earlier, the Western Railway had installed benches made of recycled plastic. The benches were installed at Churchgate railway station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-get-masks-in-exchange-for-plastic-at-csmt-dadar-railway-stations-101616093597066.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Syllabus trouble for second-year direct entry engineering students||Admissions to first-year professional courses were hit with constant delays this year and students are still bearing the brunt of it. Among these are the direct second-year engineering (DSE) entry students who are faced with the task of completing the entire year’s portion in less than six months, while their batch mates have already finished a semester. DSE students are those who opt for a three-year diploma in technical education after the completion of Class 10 board exams and are then allowed direct or lateral entry into second-year engineering courses. Maharashtra, at present, has over 750 such diploma institutes with an intake capacity of around 1.5 lakh seats.“Unlike the first-year engineering admissions which got delayed, the regular second-year engineering batches started their lectures on time in October, last year, and completed their semester-three exams as well. Our admissions through the state common entrance test (CET) cell ended only in February, by then our batch mates had finished semester-three and we’re studying for semester-four,” said a student on condition of anonymity. He added that while their batch mates have six subjects to study for the current semester, DSE students will have to study 12 subjects from semesters three and four at the same time.“Our batch mates attend two-to-three-hour classes online every day, while DSE students are made to sit through seven-hours of daily online lectures to make up for the lost time. We are overburdened and have no time to prepare for examination at present,” said another student, as they all are still unsure when the semester-three exams will be held for DSE students.The Maharashtra Students Welfare Association (MSWA) has now approached the University of Mumbai (MU) seeking clarity in this matter. “The DSE students are worried that they might have to appear for exams for both semesters within six months, and this is something the university should have thought through in advance. What’s worse is that after repeated requests, the MU examination department has not yet clarified the examination schedule for this batch,” said Vaibhav Ekde, president MSWA.The MU examination department is still working on exam dates. “The exam for semester-three DSE students will mostly be held in the month of April, we will release the schedule soon. Students will have enough time to prepare for their exams of both semesters,” said Vinod Patil, director, board of examination and evaluation, MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-syllabus-trouble-for-second-year-direct-entry-engineering-students-101616093424132.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra, Mumbai record their sharpest spike in Covid-19 cases||More than a year after Maharashtra reported its first Covid-19 infection on March 9, 2020, and Mumbai saw its first case two days later, India’s worst-hit state and city reported their sharpest one-day spikes of 25,833 and 2,877 infections, respectively, on Thursday, according to official data. Maharashtra eclipsed its September 11, 2020 caseload of 24,886, while Mumbai went past its October 7 record of 2,848. September 11 was the peak of the first wave of infections in the state. On Tuesday, the state government admitted it was witnessing a second wave of Covid-19 infections, days after a central team report said the state was in the beginning of one. The daily caseload in Maharashtra had dropped to as low as fewer than 2,000 cases in the first week of February. After reporting 1,927 infections on February 2, fresh cases started rising to 6,397 on March 1, 10,216 on March 6, 15,051 on March 15 and crossed the 20,000 mark after 172 days on March 17 (23,179 infections). Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director of Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said although it is the peak, one more week is needed to assess the situation. “We need to access whether the figures come down or go upwards from here. This will require at least a week. We have, however, managed to reduce the number of deaths from the peak of 350 to 60. Even this, too, needs to be curtailed further,” said Lahane, adding that cases have also increased owing to more tests being conducted. The state’s cases tally reached 2,396,340 on Thursday, while its toll went up to 53,138 with 58 more deaths. Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the Centre has given its green light to 134 private hospitals to start vaccination and asked authorities to chalk out a plan to vaccinate 300,000 people daily.Dr Ameet Mandot, who runs Gut Clinic at Parel, blamed both the citizens as well as authorities for the steep rise in cases. “Citizens have become very casual and there is no seriousness shown by them in adhering to Covid-19 norms. In addition, authorities are failing to enforce rules as we are witnessing crowded marriage halls, functions sans social distancing and revellers in pubs dancing without any masks. There seems to be no effort by authorities to curb this,” said Mandot. Thackeray, in his review meeting on Thursday to assess the Covid-19 spread, told doctors to keep a watch on the various strains of the virus and guide the government in treating the same. He also ordered authorities to complete vaccinations of priority groups within the next three to four months. As of Thursday, of the 166,353 active cases, Pune continues to lead the state with 35,539 active infections, followed by Nagpur with 24,209, Mumbai and Thane take the third and fourth positions with 17,153 and 15,548 active cases respectively. The total number of recoveries stood at 21,75,565.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mumbai-record-their-sharpest-spike-in-covid-19-cases-101616093422757.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Board to announce guidelines for SSC, HSC exams in two days||Ahead of Class 10 and 12 state board exams that are scheduled to be held in April and May, the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will release a set of detailed guidelines within two days on the conduct of exams amid the pandemic and the resultant lockdown. On Thursday, the board also urged parents not to believe in rumours regarding the exams that had recently surfaced on social media. “The expert committee that is planning the conduct of exams in the state has given its recommendations and a set of guidelines will be released soon. However, there are a lot of unverified reports pertaining to the structure and conduct of exams that are doing the rounds in the media and on social media which we want to dismiss. All official communication shall be shared with schools and parents soon,” stated the board. With exams drawing close, a lot of speculation regarding how they will be held has been doing the rounds on social media. For instance, a message stating that the board has decided to bring down the passing criteria from 35% to 25% has been circulated. Similarly, some reports also suggested that this year, students will be allowed to write their exam papers from their schools instead of the centres that are allotted to them every year. Officials at the education department have however said that these were merely suggestions that came from various stakeholders and are being studied. “Parents should not panic and believe in any of this until there is an official word from the board,” said a senior official. The HSC (Class 12) exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, 2021, SSC (Class 10) exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20. Results of HSC will be out in July and for SSC in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtraboard-to-announce-guidelines-for-ssc-hsc-exams-in-two-days-101616093116947.html
19-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination centres rise from 10 to 91, response still low||Despite the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) move to increase vaccination centres across the city from ten – when the nationwide mass immunisation programme kicked off on January 16 – to 91 at present, inoculation has failed to gain the expected momentum. Medical experts have largely cited a lack of awareness and scepticism about the vaccines for low turnout, in addition to the inability of senior citizens to reach vaccination centres that are located far away from their homes. With the spurt in Covid-19 cases during the ongoing second wave, doctors are advising the elderly suffering from comorbidities to avoid crowded vaccination centres since they are highly vulnerable to contract the infection, owing to their compromised immunity levels. As against the civic body’s daily target of one lakh inoculations every day, the number of vaccine beneficiaries across three groups – healthcare workers, frontline workers and individuals, above the age of 45 – has barely crossed 45,000 to date. Going by the civic body’s daily target, 10 lakh inoculations should have been registered over the last ten days (March 8 to 17). The number of vaccinations during the same period, however, stands at 2,45,383 across the three categories which include 2,22,301 senior citizens. This despite a progressive rise in the number of vaccination centres over the last ten days. For instance, 40,502 were given shots at 65 centres on March 8, which on March 9 increased to 43,581 at 68 centres. On March 10, 42,702 people got inoculated at 71 centres. While the number dropped to 36,933 beneficiaries at 72 centres on March 11, the number of beneficiaries the next day increased to 44,264 at 77 centres. The turnout increased to 45,050 at the same 77 centres the next day. On March 15, the number of centres increased to 85, while the number of beneficiaries dropped to 44,683. It dropped further to 42,534 beneficiaries at 89 centres the next day. On March 17, almost a 10% drop was recorded with 38,369 beneficiaries at 91 vaccination centres. Civic officials are hopeful that the number of inoculations will gradually increase. “When we started the vaccination, we recorded only 50% turnout in the initial few days. But we gradually achieved almost 100% turnout in most centres. There is still scepticism among the public about the vaccines,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. Emphasising the need to increase awareness among the public through social media, pamphlets, among other mediums, doctors said misinformation spreading on ‘WhatsApp University’ often discourages people from getting the vaccine shots. “Now, with Covid-19 scare, people want to know about the details of the vaccination like its efficiency rate, probable side effects among others. So, once the civic body can gain their confidence, the number will shoot up,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of the Association of Medical Consultant (AMC). A section also highlighted the need to bring vaccination to the doorstep for better accessibility. “There is a need to introduce mobile vaccination vans which will help reach every corner of the city. BMC had taken up the same policy when they started screening public in slums for Covid-19,” said Ravi Raja, leader of opposition in BMC. A senior BMC officer blamed the Central government for tying their hands. “Though the delivery of health care largely rests with the states since health is a state subject, the central government is not giving us enough lee-way,” said the officer. Another senior health official said the Centre needs to change its approach. “To start vaccination centres in private hospitals, we have to send a list for approval to the Centre which often takes days. For instance, on March 9, we sent the names of 30 private hospitals to be included in the inoculation programme. But we haven’t got the approval so far. In fact, in many cases, if we send them 50 names of hospitals for approval, they select them in phases. This delays the whole process” In response, Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary said hospitals, both private and government, which are empanelled under Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojna, Central Government Health Scheme or any State Health Insurance scheme are automatically added to the list of covid vaccination centres with no need to send the list to the Central government.“However, states that don’t have empanelled hospitals in any of the above-mentioned categories need to get their hospitals approved by the Centre as they need to fulfil the guidelines meant for Covid-19 vaccination centres, including sufficient space, cold chain etc facility. Since states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi do not have empanelled hospitals they sent us the list for approval, and we only require them to ensure the list of hospitals fulfil the criteria. In Maharashtra, 419 hospitals have been approved,” he said. The sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 is also dissuading people from taking the jab since it entails standing for hours in over-crowded centres. “Now that it is confirmed that we are facing the second wave, senior citizens are being advised to avoid visiting overcrowded centres which can make them vulnerable to contracting the infection. This to some extent, affects the overall turnout,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital, Marine Lines. Vaccination numbers at glanceSince the beginning of the nationwide mass immunisation programme on January 16, 1,36,114 healthcare workers of the 2.5 lakh registered have been immunised. On February 4, BMC initiated inoculation for frontline workers at their centres. Of the 2 lakh who have registered, 1,26,644 have taken the jab. On March 1, the civic body started the third phase of the mass vaccination programme for senior citizens and those above 45 years with co-morbidities. BMC during their My Family, My Responsibility door-to-door campaign found that there are more than 30lakh senior citizens. Till March 17, 3,28,168 or 11% above 60 years have been vaccinated, and 45,395 citizens above 45 years with comorbidities have taken the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-centres-rise-from-10-to-91-response-still-low-101616092877407.html

Police on Thursday arrested the suspect, who is also a native of Kerala. The suspect was identified as Raju, who worked with a private company in Noida. He was apprehended from near his house, police said. The incident came to fore on Wednesday when the woman approached Sector 24 police and shared her ordeal. According to her complaint, the suspect had been introduced to her through a common friend.“He had offered to help me find a job. He asked me to come to his house in Sector 12 on February 6 saying that his family would be there and I should give an interview,” said the woman in her complaint.When she reached the house, it was empty and upon enquiring, the suspect said that his wife had gone out and would be back shortly, police said. The suspect offered her apple juice after which she lost consciousness. The woman woke up disoriented in the middle of the night and went back to her house where she realized that she had been sexually violated, police said.She only approached police on March 17 after which she was sent for a medical examination. Based on her complaint, a case was registered against the suspect at Sector 24 police station under sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 376 (rape) of the Indian penal Code.“The woman is new to the city and only recently contacted us. It seems that the drink which was offered by the suspect was spiked and made her lose consciousness after which she was raped,” said Sudheer Kumar, station house officer, Sector 24 police station.The suspect was produced before a magistrate and sent to judicial custody for 14 days, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/woman-raped-on-pretext-of-job-in-noida-101616092697104.html

There are 38.41 contacts (average of primary and secondary) in Bengaluru, while the number is as high as 66.04 per person in Mandya. The total average in the state is around 4.46 in the month of March, according to the war room data.There are around 63,247 primary and secondary contacts in the state, according to the war room, including around 8,780 in Bengaluru alone.The number of people in active quarantine in Bengaluru rose to 15,189. The state government has so far vaccinated 1997005 people and there have been around 25 people who have developed serious complications post inoculation.The Karnataka government on Monday said it was putting together a concerted effort involving healthcare workers, officials and other personnel to prevent the possible second wave of Covid-19 in the state. K Sudhakar, state’s health and family welfare and medical education minister, said all agencies and personnel will work on “mission mode” for the next 50 days to prevent a rise in positive cases.Chief minister B.S Yediyurappa on Wednesday said the state will target vaccinating 300,000 people per day to counter the spike. He ruled out any restrictions on movement or another lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.The Centre, meanwhile, turned down the state’s request to set up vaccination centres in old-age homes, apartment complexes and hard-to-reach villages.In a letter, dated March 17 (but released on Thursday), the Union government conveyed that “it would be advisable that the state may consider limiting the Covid-19 vaccination services to health facilities as permitted by GoI.”The letter added that the state may consider cohort mobilisation of beneficiaries through special vehicles to the designated Covid-19 vaccination centres so that they may be comfortably vaccinated and also observed for 30 minutes for any AEFI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-reports-1-000-covid-19-cases-for-third-straight-day-eight-deaths-101616092638693.html

The fire broke out apparently due to a gas leakage from an LPG cylinder, they said. The incident was reported around 8am from the house of Jaiveer, a street food vendor. His brother Avneesh, who sustained minor injuries in the incident, said that Jaiveer was preparing snacks for the makeshift eatery when the incident took place.“It seems that there was a leakage in the gas pipeline of the cylinder. Soon there was a fire and it quickly spread to the regulator and then there was a minor blast. All of us escaped as soon as we could,” said Avneesh.In the incident, Jaiveer, his wife, two sons aged six and two years and two of his brothers sustained minor injuries, police said.The fire was brought under control by the neighbours who rushed the injured to the district hospital while a call was also made to police.“Teams were rushed to the spot. The injuries of Jaiveer’s brothers were minor and they were discharged from the district hospital after receiving first aid. The other four have sustained some blisters and were referred to a higher centre in Delhi for treatment,” said Munish Kumar Chauhan, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.All the victims are out of danger, police officials said, adding that the fire was controlled and did not cause too much damage.Chief fire officer Arun Kumar Singh said that the incident was not reported to the fire department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-two-kids-among-six-injured-in-fire-caused-by-cylinder-gas-leak-101616092637488.html
19-03-2021||Noida||Farmers protest against Greater Noida authority||GREATER NOIDA: Farmers protested against the Greater Noida authority, near its main administration office in sector Knowledge Park 5 from 11 am to 5 pm on Thursday, after the Uttar Pradesh government refused to provide them with residential plots and increase the land compensation among other benefits.Following the protest, top officials of the Greater Noida authority have assured the farmers that they will address their demands.The Uttar Pradesh government had earlier decided that it will not give the farmers a 4-time hike from the prevailing circle rate, 20% developed land against the total acquired land, and reservation in government jobs among other benefits. The state government took the decision after farmers from Bodaki and Palla sold their lands to the Greater Noida authority, through direct registration.There are two ways to take land from the farmers: either by implementing provisions of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, or through direct land purchase.The farmers have given their lands to the Greater Noida authority through direct registration. They do not deserve the benefits given to the farmers from nearby villages, according to the UP government.“If the UP government and the Greater Noida authority do not accept our demands, we will protest again. We are ending our protest today, with the hope that the officials will address our issues and discuss it with UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath for a solution,” said Manish Kumar, a farmer from Bodaki.Sachin Kumar, officer on special duty, Greater Noida authority, and other officials reached the protest site on Thursday and assured the farmers that their issues will be resolved soon.Around 500 farmers, including 200 women, reached the protest site in their cars and tractors. The authority has called in around 300 police constables, fire tender and buses to handle a crisis situation — only if the farmers try to disturb the peace in the area, said the officials.“The authority has assured us that our demands will be discussed, and the farmers will meet the UP CM in a month for a solution,” said Praveen Kumar, another farmer.Sachin Kumar, OSD, Greater Noida authority, said, “The authority will discuss their demands and take appropriate action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-protest-against-greater-noida-authority-101616092636876.html
19-03-2021||Noida||Air quality in Noida worsens||Noida: The air quality in Noida and adjoining cities worsened on Thursday amid a spike in the pollution levels due to the dusty winds. According to the weather analysts, the air quality in parts of Greater Noida and Ghaziabad was in the ‘severe’ category during the day, due to the dusty winds.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) in Noida on Thursday was 336 — on a scale of 0 to 500 — against 328 on Wednesday. On Thursday, the AQI in Greater Noida was recorded at 389 against 369 a day earlier, and Ghaziabad at 373 against 364 on Wednesday.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said that the “air quality will improve to the ‘very poor’ category soon”.“Surface winds are moderate and west south-westerly. However, the AQI is likely to improve marginally and remain in the lower end of the ’very poor’ to ’poor’ category on Friday. The AQI is likely to be ’poor’ on Saturday and Sunday,” SAFAR said in a statement on Thursday. Meanwhile, Noida recorded maximum and minimum temperatures at 34.3° Celsius and 18.1° Celsius on Thursday, against 34.4° and 18.1° Celsius on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-in-noida-worsens-101616092636254.html
19-03-2021||Noida||Five arrested for illegal construction in Greater Noida, premises sealed||Greater Noida: The Bisrakh police in Greater Noida arrested five persons on Wednesday for allegedly developing an illegal structure in Shahberi, and also sealed the premises. Despite a court’s stay order, the suspects were developing a housing project in the area.The complainant — Manoj Kumar Tomar, a head constable — said he had got a tip-off that some people were illegally digging the plot for the construction of a housing project. “When I visited the construction site, I saw that five persons — Vijendra Chaudhury, Sunil Tewatiya, Omvir Singh, Vinod Kumar and Bhola Prasad — were working on the housing project. We stopped the construction work, sealed the premises and seized the construction materials,” Kumar said.The Noida police had developed a police check post in Shahberi in November 2019, according to Anita Chauhan, SHO, Bisrakh police station. “It was also developed to keep illegal construction in check. The police team got a tip-off on Wednesday and conducted a search operation. Five persons were arrested from the spot and booked under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant), and 447 (criminal trespass),” Chauhan said, adding that the arrested men were produced before a court, and sent to jail.On July 17, 2018, nine persons were killed when a twin building collapsed in the Shahberi village. The 47-year-old developer, Shahabudin Khan, had constructed the building without a layout plan approval from the Greater Noida authority. The accused had used bad quality construction material, which led to the incident, according to officials. So far, the police have registered FIRs against 181 developers, and arrested 50 of them in a crackdown.The Greater Noida authority had started the Shahberi land acquisition in 1994. It had acquired around 155 hectares by 2009, however, a group of farmers filed a writ petition, and the court stayed the land acquisition in 2011. The authority started land acquisition again in 2013, but the Allahabad High Court issued another stay order in 2014, directing the authority to maintain a status quo. However, rampant illegal construction was seen in 2017 and 2018, when the building collapsed. The Greater Noida authority estimated that there are around 1,453 illegal buildings in Shahberi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/five-arrested-for-illegal-construction-in-greater-noida-premises-sealed-101616092578577.html
19-03-2021||Noida||Yeida ropes in central govt agency for ₹300-cr pod taxi project||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) said on Thursday that it has roped in the central government agency, Indian Port Rail and Ropeway Corporation Limited (IPRCL), to work on a ₹300 crore pod taxi project that will connect the Film City with the airport.“We have given the work to the Indian Port Rail and Ropeway Corporation on Thursday. It has started working on this ambitious project that will play a crucial role in boosting the connectivity between the Film City and the airport. It will be a world-class and iconic project in this region,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO), YEIDA.The YEIDA will finalise the date following the completion of the project in a month, when the detailed project report (DPR) of the project will be submitted. The DPR will give exact details related to alignment, funding pattern and the completion of the work, Singh added.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has already given a green signal to the project and has directed the YEIDA to work on projects to enhance the connectivity between the airport and other important destinations across the Delhi-NCR.The distance from the proposed Film City project in Noida sector 21, along the 165 km Yamuna Expressway, to the Noida International Airport in Jewar is 6.5 km. The work on the ₹25,000 crore airport project is likely to be completed by 2023-24, as the concessionaire of the project — YIAPL, which is a 100% subsidiary of Zurich Airport International and has been incorporated to develop the Noida airport in Jewar, will start working at the site by mid-2021, said the officials. The airport will begin operating with two runways, and the airport will have five runways at its full capacity.“Our aim is to complete the pod taxi project before 2023, when the airport will start its operations. The DPR will be completed within a month. Once the DPR is submitted, work for the next stage will start,” said Singh.The YEIDA has also planned to connect Greater Noida with the airport, through a pod taxi route. “First, we will build a pod taxi from the airport to the Film City, and then we will start working on a 30 km pod taxi project to connect Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk with the airport. The UP government has asked us to build a pod taxi from the airport to Greater Noida as it will be a part of the multi-model connectivity project that aims to connect the airport with over one mode of commuting,” Singh added.According to YEIDA, the pod taxi project will cost around ₹40 crore per km. “For a 6.5 km pod taxi project, we need around ₹300 crore as per the initial estimates,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yeida-ropes-in-central-govt-agency-for-300-cr-pod-taxi-project-101616092577488.html
19-03-2021||Other||36% dip in budget for SC, ST, OBCs welfare||Bengaluru The allocation for welfare of Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), other backward classes (OBC) and minorities by the Karnataka government in 2021-22 has seen a decline of nearly 37% since 2019-20, according to official data. According to the Annual Financial Statement for 2021-22, released along with the Karnataka state budget, the allocation for welfare of these communities has come down from ₹278,345.12 lakh in 2019-20 to ₹176,082.83 lakh in 2020-21, registering a negative growth of 36.73%. The decline in allocations for marginalised sections come at a time when Karnataka chief minister B.S Yediyurappa has made large budgetary allocations for state’s dominant and politically influential communities like Lingayats and Vokkaligas with just two years remaining before the 2023 polls. Yediyurappa has cited revenue shortfalls from the Centre and the impact of Covid-19 for the lower allocations in various sectors, but this has been mitigated by higher borrowings, according to at least two Congress legislators. “There is an economic downturn and this is the main reason (for the decline). But the total allocation will not be lower than last year,” said a cabinet minister, requesting not to be namedEven the capital outlay on social security & welfare has seen a decline of 3% from ₹7,507.38 lakh in 2019-20 to ₹7,275.33 lakh in 2021-22, data shows. The decline in welfare and security comes even as the overall capital outlay on social services has seen an increase from ₹919,181.18 lakh in 2019-20 to ₹1,100,584.87 lakh in 2021-22. “The allocations should be in proportion to the population of these communities but there has been a steady decline in allocation completely,” KM Ramchandrappa, president of the Karnataka Backward Castes Federation , said. The private group that fights for rights of marginalised castes, which represents around 55 marginalised communities, is preparing to protest the declining allocation and importance given to these communities across the state from next week. Yediyurappa in this year’s budget announced ₹500 crore each to the Vokkaligas and Lingayats while setting up caste-specific boards to work to help improve both economic, social and educational conditions of these dominant communities. The state has also set up a Brahmin board with an allocation ₹50 crore in the 2021-22 budget. Yediyurappa has also set aside ₹1,500 crore for minorities. With just two years remaining for the next assembly elections in the state, Yediyurappa has taken it upon himself to bring the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power, which would mean reaching out to dominant communities and caste groups that are seen to back other political parties, analysts said.While the Lingayats and Brahmins are seen to side with the BJP, the Vokkaligas, an agrarian community, are known to back former prime minister H.D Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), which has big presence in the southern region of Karnataka or the ‘Old Mysuru’ region. Others like backward classes, SC, ST and minorities tend to back the Congress. According to government data, there are at least 95 caste groups and over 370 subgroups within Category-I, who are entitled for 4% reservation. There are 102 main caste groups, including the dominant Vokkaliga communities, in Category-II (A) along with over 300 subgroups, who are entitled to 15% reservation. Category II (B) is reserved for members of the Muslim community. There are three main castes within III (A) and 34 subgroups with 4% reservation within them while there are at least 45 caste groups within III (B) including the politically influential Lingayats and their subsects who have 5% reservation.“We are not opposed to allocations to other communities. But an allocation of ₹1,000 crore to two communities that are believed to account for around 25% of the population, while the outlay for over 200 other castes that are extremely backward get just ₹60 crore. How is this justified?” Ramchandrappa said. According to the budget document, the allocation for SCP/TSP (scheduled caste sub-plan and scheduled tribe sub-plan) is ₹26,005 crore. “There is (a) decrease in total allocation due to the increase in committed expenditures like salary, honorarium, payment of principal and interest, pension etc., from ₹129,455 crore in 2020-21 to ₹142,855 crore in 2021-22,” according to the budget. Yediyurappa, however, clarified that it was a typo, and the allocation will remain the same as the previous year or ₹26,930 crore. “There is only an oral assurance but nothing on paper and we are sure nothing will come out of it either,” Priyank Kharge, former social welfare minister and Congress legislator, said. “We have seen a trend of declining allocations for marginalised communities. The decline is much more when it comes to nomadic communities,” CS Dwarkanath, an advocate who works with several caste groups and former chairman of the Karnataka backward classes commission, said. Experts on the subject said the actual picture and intent of expenditure of such allocations come out only the following year when revised estimates are presented, highlighting if the money was spent or not. “Such appeasing announcements are like magic cards. Whether any group gets the money or not is something we will know only the following year,” Dasanuru Kusanna from the Institute of Social and Economic Change said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/36-dip-in-budget-for-sc-st-obcs-welfare-101616092578126.html

On March 12, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) questioned Gowda for his alleged involvement in leaking the video. Gowda has since been absconding.In the video, he claimed that he did not appear before the investigating officers because he believed he will be fixed in the case. “My name has been dragged into the sex tape case involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. There is a systematic effort to fix me in the case,” said Gowda.He also claimed that he was in touch with the woman in the video, adding that it was not for extortion but to “help a woman in distress”. “I want to clarify that I’m not involved in this case. It is a fact that I was in touch with that woman. But she contacted me as I was a journalist, and she has some problems. She got my number from some friends and called me to say that former minister Jarkiholi cheated her. I asked her to bring any audio or video clipping she has evidence… I might have interacted with her 15-20 times for this case,” he said in the video.Gowda added that since he got busy with family commitments, he lost touch with the woman. “Now it is said that I’m the mastermind who circulated the video. I want to clarify that only when the video came on my phone, I realised such a video was leaked and the woman had come to me earlier. I have no role in this video getting released. People have been claiming I got paid ₹5 crore for this CD, but the fact is that I’m paying ₹15,000 EMI for a ₹5 lakh loan I have taken. There have been a couple of times, where my cheques have bounced before my salary didn’t come on time,” he claimed.He further added, “…I should have helped her when I had the chance, but I was waiting for evidence... but now the situation is such that even though the woman is the victim in this case, police are painting a picture that Jarkiholi is the victim. They are portraying this woman in her 20s as an accused and harassing her.” He said he will appear before the investigating officers within eight days.On March 3, Jarkiholi resigned from the post of water resources minister after a social activist filed a police complaint accusing him of sexual harassment. The activist has since withdrawn his complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jarkiholi-case-absconding-journalist-says-sit-trying-to-fix-his-involvement-101616092576875.html

He added that the party will take a decision on contesting the Belagavi Lok Sabha bypoll in next three-four days.“In both constituencies (Basavakalayan and Maski), no matter what economic promises the Congress and BJP roll out, we will strive to win,” Kumaraswamy told reporters in Bengaluru on Thursday.The JD(S) announced the name of Syed Yesrab Ali Quadri, a former Congress worker, as its candidate from Basavakalyan. The party is yet to announce a candidate from Maski.In 2018, the two assembly constituencies were won by the Congress while the BJP won the Belagavi parliamentary seat. The Basavakalyan seat had fallen vacant after the death of B Narayan Rao of the Congress while bypoll to Belagavi seat was necessitated after the death of Union minister Suresh Angadi. Pratapgouda Patil of the Congress won Maski in 2018 but has since defected to the BJP. Meanwhile, the Congress on Thursday announced Mallamma, the widow of Narayan Rao, as its candidate from Basavakalyan seat. It also announced Basavanagouda Turvihal from Maski. Turvihal had contested the seat on a BJP ticket in 2018 but lost to Pratapgouda Patil by just over 200 votes.The Congress also announced Ashok Managuli as its candidate for Sindgi, where the date for the bypoll is yet to be announced. Ashok’s father M.C Managuli was a senior JD(S) leader and a former minister.The JD(S) allied with the BJP in the upper house of the state legislature to instate party veteran Basavaraj Horatti as the chairman of the council.However, Kumaraswamy, in an earlier interview to HT, said that this alliance is “non-binding”. The Congress has often termed the JD(S) as the “B-Team” of the BJP.The JD(S) and BJP see Congress as the common enemy and the regional outfit has allied with both parties in the past to remain relevant in the state.The JD(S) draws its strength from the Old Mysuru region in Karnataka where the dominant Vokkaliga community is its core support base. The JD(S) sees Congress as a threat in these regions and has often struck regional alliances with the BJP to win local, state and national elections. The Congress and JD(S) parted ways on a bitter note after its decimation in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections where both parties were reduced to just one seat each while the BJP swept 25 out of the total 28 parliamentary constituencies in the state.Patil was one of the 17 legislators who had defected to the BJP and engineered the collapse of the Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in 2019.Kumaraswamy said that by winning in these constituencies, mostly in the northern districts of the state, the party will send a strong message across the state.The JD(S) has also seen some of its workers join the two national parties in recent days. Madhu Bangarappa, a former legislator, joined the Congress last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jds-will-contest-both-assembly-bypolls-call-on-ls-seat-in-3-4-days-kumaraswamy-101616092576228.html

Although the number of deaths have remained stable – an average of 2.1 deaths a day in March – the number of active cases and hospitalisations have increased.The number of active cases inched closer to the 3,000 mark, with over 1,500 people in home isolation as on Wednesday night, the highest since early January. The number of hospitalisations increased to 794, as compared to 579 recorded a week ago, shows government data.Delhi currently has 5,711 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 across city hospitals, down from over 18,000 reserved beds during the third wave of cases in November, when the city recorded an average of 6,122 new infections every single day.For the current uptick in cases, city doctors blame weddings and other large social gatherings.“There was euphoria when the number of infections in the city went down, as any viral infection does naturally. With over 50% of the population exposed to the infection, the transmission slowed down. But, people gathering for events such as weddings led to an increase. This is exactly what happened after Dussehra and Diwali,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences and chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care.He said he has is aware of super-spreader events, where between 30 and 40 people in a wedding party contracted the infection.“We now know that the infection spreads through droplets and aerosols. So, whenever people pull down their mask at such events, the risk of contracting the virus is very high,” he said.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max healthcare also said, “Festivals and wedding are a hotbed for infections as people tend to forget to take precautions. I know of instances where 40 to 50 people in a wedding got the infection.”State health minister Satyendar Jain, however, sought to calm fears, and said the positivity rate in the city has been below 1% for two months.“The situation in Delhi is well within control as compared to other states. But I will still emphasise that people continue to remain cautious of the coronavirus,” said Jain||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-607-covid-19-cases-as-infection-graph-inches-upwards-101616092097860.html
19-03-2021||Delhi||Parking space may be defined by dwelling units, not plot size||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Thursday approved dynamic parking norms to rationalise the existing provisions in a bid to address the growing parking problem in the capital. The policy was approved in a meeting chaired by Delhi Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal along with other key proposals such as Transit-Oriented Development and setting up of a committee to monitor the restoration work of the Yamuna floodplain.The dynamic parking policy, which will be put in the public domain for comments soon before being notified, mandates that parking space in residential areas will be based on the size and number of dwelling units on a plot instead of the total built-up area. DDA officials said this will help reduce congestion on roads, which in many places, have been turned into parkings by local residents.A DDA official said that to address the parking problem, especially in residential areas, there is a need to rationalise parking. “Presently, parking norms are based on the designated use premise. It has been observed that the surplus parking from buildings spills over to roads and results in congestion in the public spaces….The new norms are based on the number and size of the dwelling units instead of built-up area in case of residential projects,” said the official.The official added, “In case of government housing, the norms for GPRA colonies will be adopted. In the case of banquet halls, parking norms are enhanced keeping in view the orders of the NGT.”For hospitals and government offices, the parking norms will be based on actual usage, DDA officials said.TOD development around 12 Metro stationsThe DDA also approved the Transit-Oriented Development policy on Thursday. DDA officials said that 12 metro stations have been identified around which mixed-use development will be planned based on the TOD policy.As per the modification in the policy, the parking space will be one Equivalent Car Space (ECS) per 100 sqm of covered area with mandatory 5% of the parking area earmarked for bicycles and wheelchairs. The developer will have to provide at least 50% of all parking facilities within TOD schemes as public parking facilities and at least 10% of the parking area will have charging points for electric vehicles. The maximum Floor Area Ratio of a building on any plot in the TOD influence zone will be 500.Floodplain restorationWith the restoration of the Yamuna floodplain going on, the L-G constituted a committee to oversee the work. The panel named River Yamuna Management Committee will be headed by the L-G and have Delhi’s chief secretary, DDA vice-chairman, Jal Shakti ministry official and stakeholders, including UP and Haryana governments as members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/earmark-parking-based-on-dwelling-units-instead-of-total-area-dda-proposes-in-new-policy-101616092039781.html

Sanjay Garg, head of Delhi Archives, said the department will be displaying around 40-50 sunboard banners in Central Park detailing key events from the freedom fighter’s life.“We will mainly be focusing on Singh’s connection to Delhi -- the places he visited such as Feroze Shah Kotla; the detailed official report of when he bombed the assembly to make a statement; the SSP report which also states that schoolchildren of that time put up photos of Singh in their school – all these will be included in our gallery, apart from other chapters of the freedom struggle,” said Garg.Officials also said four photographs of the legendary leader will be displayed alongside a light and sound show on his life. “The light and sound show is based on a book on Singh and will highlight Singh’s contribution to the freedom struggle. The show will nearly be an hour long and it will be on our social media platforms as well,” said Rajinder Singh, secretary of the Punjabi Academy.Although the Delhi Archives has organised programmes on Martyr’s Day, the scale of programmes has increased in light of the Freedom@75 event, officials said. The department will also be working on multiple events on the freedom struggle celebrations.Along with creating video slideshows of digitized documents on the freedom struggle, the department is also planning to hold “mobile exhibitions” that will travel to different parts of the city, digital documentaries, and talk sessions, among others.Delhi Archives is also involved in a talk show on “the link between the freedom struggle and Delhi”, slated to be held on March 27 at the India Islamic Centre. “We have invited dignitaries such as Vinay Bharat-Ram, chairperson of DCM group, who have seen Delhi change over the years along with the families of freedom fighters Jugal Kishore Khanna, Jamia Millia Islamia co-founder Hakim Ajmal Khan and Mir Mushtaq Ahmed to speak on their memory of Delhi,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-plans-light-and-sound-show-photo-gallery-at-cp-to-mark-martyr-s-day-101616092036938.html

Of the two bullets fired by the police, one hit the suspect, identified as Adil alias Shakeel, in his thigh. Adil was injured and caught with a semi-automatic pistol, three cartridges and a bike. He was admitted to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital for treatment. His condition is stated to be stable, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said that on February 25 around 6pm, Adil and his two associates – Yogesh Verma and a minor boy – were roaming around on a motorcycle in JJ Colony, Bhalswa Dairy looking for a target, when they were spotted and challenged by two policemen on duty — constables Sandeep and Bhupender. The constables became suspicious and stopped the trio for checking at a police picket.“The policemen asked them to show the documents of their bike. But, instead the trio fled. When the policemen chased and tried to catch them, the suspects opened fire. One bullet hit constable Sandeep in his abdomen while Bhupender escaped unhurt,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.A case was registered and several teams started looking for the three suspects. Two of them, including the juvenile, were apprehended on March 1, following a gun battle with an outer-north district team in Rohini Sector-30. Adil, however, continue to be on the run.On March 17 (Wednesday night), the special cell team received information that Adil would be coming near the paper market n Ghazipur on a bike. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the suspect was asked to surrender as the police team spotted him. However, Adil again whipped out a pistol and opened fire at the police party, DCP Kushwah said.“Adil fired three bullets while two were fired by the police personnel in self-defence. He suffered a bullet in his right leg and was alter arrested. The bike he was riding was the one used during the firing on the two policemen last month,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-who-fired-injured-police-constable-arrested-after-shootout-in-ghazipur-101616091978860.html

It also makes a mockery of the letter and spirit of democracy by disempowering the Delhi government, which is elected by the people of national capital.”Kejriwal thanked the West Bengal CM for her support. “Thank you didi for supporting people of Delhi against Centre’s unconstitutional step. Anyone who supports India and its democracy cannot support this Bill. I hope the BJP will withdraw this Bill. Please take care of your health. I also pray for your handsome victory in coming elections,” the Delhi CM tweeted.The Union government introduced the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the Lok Sabha on Monday to amend the 1991 GNCT Act. The Bill says that “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation, and seeks to make it mandatory for the Delhi government to seek the prior opinion of the L-G before any executive action.Banerjee said she swill seek support for the AAP against the Bill. “They want to govern Delhi by proxy… What the BJP is trying to do in Delhi is hardly an exception. In state after state governed by non-BJP parties the Centre has been creating problems for duly elected government by misusing the office of the Governor… I shall write a letter to all non-BJP chief ministers in the country, urging them to extend their support to you.”In separate press briefings, AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Satyendar Jain slammed the Centre over the introduction of the Bill. Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP, called the proposed legislation “unconstitutional” and “undemocratic”. Singh said the AAP will continue to protest against the Bill.“We will keep protesting against the Bill in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. We have support from several other political parties,” he said.Jain said the BJP was resorting to “unconstitutional” means after losing in successive elections in Delhi. “They just want to bring this Bill to stop all the welfare and good governance in Delhi,” he said.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless”. Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “It is difficult to understand why the AAP government is protesting against the Centre’s move. It is only aimed at strengthening checks and balances in Delhi’s governance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mamata-backs-aap-over-centre-s-bill-calls-it-devious-move-to-make-cm-subordinate-of-lg-101616091978200.html
19-03-2021||Delhi||Revised promotion policy for Class 9, 11 to continue this year||The Delhi Directorate of Education, citing “exceptional circumstances” arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic, on Thursday announced that it was extending the one-time revised promotion policy announced last year for students of Class 9 and 11 in public and private schools this year as well.In May last year, the education department had announced a revised policy under which students of these classes, who appeared for their exams, were allotted grace marks to ensure they scored minimum marks required to pass —33%.Instead of giving weightage to annual exams, the revised promotion policy states that a student securing 33% marks in five subjects will be passed. The order stated that results will be calculated on the basis of annual exam, mid-term, and internal assessment or practicals. Previous promotion policies called for securing 25% in the 60-mark annual exams in the five main subjects. The department has also allowed schools to grant a maximum of 15 marks as “grace” to reach the 33% mark “in one or any number of subjects only for promotion to next higher class.”“The exceptional circumstances of Covid pandemic led to the closure of schools for a long period, without face-to-face classroom teaching-learning activities, Directorate of Education has decided to extend the Revised Promotion Policy 2019-20 as a onetime measure,” director of education Udit Prakash Rai stated in Wednesday’s order. Those failing to clear the exams can appear for compartment exam at a later date.The department has asked all government, government-aided, and recognised unaided (private) schools to comply with these guidelines. Private schools wishing to change the criteria — than the ones mentioned in the guidelines — can approach director (education) for approval.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, welcomed the revised promotion policy. “The promotion criteria have been simplified and will benefit students. We followed the guidelines last year and will do so this year,” she said.The revised promotion policy had effectively increased the Class 9 pass percentage (64.5%) to the highest in five years. The Class 11 pass percentage (96.2%) had also jumped by nearly 11 percentage points in the last academic session — meaning that an increased number of students would be appearing for the class 10 and 12 board exams slated to take place in May this year.Principals across the government schools believe that the implementation of the revised promotion policy will have an impact on the board exams of 2021-22 as well.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, said, “While there is a need to help students who may have struggled due to the online and semi-online teaching modes, we have noticed that students who were promoted with grace marks are the ones not coming to our school for extra classes we are currently conducting. The no-detention policy means that all have to be promoted till Class 9 and there is no filtering.”Mary Jyotsna Minj, head of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, New Kondli, said, “Since education is continuing in blended mode, we will feel the effects of this on board students in next couple of years. It will be challenging for schools with more students as we have to arrange for staggered classes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-impact-revised-promotion-policy-for-class-9-11-to-continue-this-year-says-edu-dept-101616091976934.html
19-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram meat shops ordered to stay shut on Tuesdays||Meat shops in the city will remain closed on Tuesdays, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram decided in its House meeting on Thursday. A few councillors raised the issue during the meeting citing religious sentiments and after long deliberation, the proposal was approved.There are 129 licensed meat shops in the city, with as many as 150 more operating illegally, according to MCG officials. They said that as per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation bylaws, 2008, any municipal corporation across the state has the power to close meat shops on a single day of a week, with immediate effect.The MCG had put forth an agenda before the House on restarting the issuance of licences to meat shop owners and doubling the license fee from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000. Soon after the agenda was tabled, MCG councillors Ashwani Sharma and Dharambir Singh, of wards 23 and 21, respectively, said that the civic body should raise the licensing fee to ₹50,000 and requested the closure on Tuesdays, citing religious sentiments.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, however, said that food was a personal choice. “One shouldn’t raise such issues, you may believe in closing meat shops on Tuesday. In my opinion, this is an individual choice. I eat meat but my wife doesn’t. I do not force her, and she does not force me. It is completely a personal choice. When households have differences on this issue, the House should give this a serious thought before making any decision regarding the entire city. Food is an independent choice,” said Singh.The MCG commissioner then left the decision on this matter to the House as councillors emphasised that bye-laws allow for the same. Mayor Madhu Azad also lent her support to the motion and subsequently, the resolution on closing meat shops falling within the MCG area on Tuesdays was approved.“As per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Byelaws, 2008, any municipal corporation can close meat shops on a single day during the week. Hence, such a decision can be implemented with immediate effect,” said Ashish Singla, MCG’s chief medical officer, who oversees the issuance of licences, fines and closure orders for meat shops in the city.Pritam Singh, the president of Jacobpura meat shops association, said the move would cause revenue loss. “If the MCG has passed this resolution, there is little else the association or the shopkeepers can do. The MCG should have taken into account that even if a few members of one community do not consume meat on Tuesday, other communities consume it. We were open seven days a week but now, will be forced to close on Tuesdays and lose revenue,” said Singh.The MCG’s original agenda of increasing the licensing fee from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 was approved after an extensive discussion, after officials decided that ₹50,000 was not feasible.The MCG started issuing licences to meat shops in 2017. Singla informed the House that 129 meat shops were registered under this policy till March 2018, after which no new licences were issued.During the meeting, Vinay Pratap Singh also said that the MCG should increase the penalty imposed on illegal meat shops from ₹500 to ₹5,000 and the same was unanimously approved. He also said that if a shop is fined three times for illegally running operations, then the MCG should permanently seal the same.“With the MCG’s jurisdiction increasing recently and the demand for meat and opening of meat shops increasing, and the decision to reopen licensing was taken to increase the civic body’s revenue. Since 2018, we were only renewing the annual licences of 129 shop registered with us,” said Singla.Councillor Dharambir Singh declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/meat-shops-to-shut-on-tuesday-decides-house-101616091556200.html
19-03-2021||Pune||Senior citizens on front foot in Pune city vaccine drive||At least 93,721 senior citizens (above 60 years of age) have taken the Covid vaccine between March 1 to March 18, according to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). However, during the same period, the number of beneficiaries between the age group of 45 years and 59 years with comorbidities is only 17,332.Experts suggest that patients with comorbidities should get vaccinated as soon as possible as they are high-risk patients just like senior citizens.Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra Chapter, said that there is less awareness among beneficiaries who are between the age of 45 years and 59 years.“The list of 20 comorbidities shared by the central government excludes many beneficiaries. Also, not every beneficiary is aware that they are eligible to get a vaccine under particular comorbidity. For example, not many people are aware that persons with disabilities are also included in the list of comorbidities. There should be more awareness among the general public to get more people vaccinated,” said Bhondwe.He further added that vaccination centres should be increased and many should start 24/7 vaccination.“This will help working professionals get vaccinated sooner. Also, many private hospitals have the staff and infrastructure to start the 24/7 vaccination. This will help beneficiaries across the society in getting vaccinated,” said Dr Bhondwe.Ketan Kulkarni, a 54-year beneficiary with comorbidities said that despite booking a slot for vaccination, the process has taken the whole working day.“Earlier, I applied for the slot on Sunday. But there was no vaccination drive, so I had to come on the weekday. I had to apply for a half-day leave as my slot was booked for noon. But then I extended my leave for the rest of the day as the process was taking a lot of time. There is a need to start vaccination post office hours, as it will make the process hassle-free for working professionals,” said Kulkarni.He further added that he has to take another day off to vaccinate his parents who are senior citizens.Speaking about the low turnout for comorbid patients, PMC officials said that there is no data as to how many beneficiaries fall in the age group of 45 to 59 years with comorbidities.“There is no concrete data about the numbers as the beneficiaries have not registered with us like the healthcare workers (HCW’s) and the frontline workers (FLW’s). But the numbers show that the vaccination is less,” said a PMC official on condition of anonymity.As of March 18, at least 41,864 HCWs have received their first jab. Whereas, only 27,706 frontline workers have received their first dose of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/more-senior-citizens-get-vaccinated-in-pune-city-101616082435731.html
19-03-2021||Delhi||Can vaccinate all of Delhi in 3 months, says CM Arvind Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday appealed to the Centre to relax the eligibility criteria for Covid-19 vaccinations, saying that his government can inoculate all adult residents of Delhi within three months to tackle steadily rising infections that have triggered concerns of a fresh wave.Emphasising that vaccination is the most effective way to control the spread of Covid-19, Kejriwal said that his government will increase daily inoculation capacity from 30,000-40,000 to 125,000 by doubling the number of centres from the existing 500, and extending their timing by four hours.Health care and frontline workers, along with people over 60 years and those aged at least 45 with specified comorbidities, are currently eligible to get vaccinated in India. The world’s largest vaccination drive was launched in the country on January 16, with two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) being cleared so far for use.“The Centre should make vaccines open for all those who are 18 years of age and above. India is producing enough Covid-19 vaccines now to get this done. Walk-in centres should be opened for all. I urge the central government to take this up on a war footing. If this is allowed, we can vaccinate everyone in Delhi (18 years and above) in three months,” Kejriwal said.Addressing a digital news briefing after holding a review meeting with health minister Satyendar Jain and top officials of the Delhi government, Kejriwal said they will write to the Centre about allowing states to relax the eligibility criteria.He was speaking a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to chief ministers, stressing on the need to take “decisive action” in an urgent meeting during which the issue of expanding the drive was raised by at least three CMs.Delhi continued its trend of rising infections on Thursday, with the city reporting 607 new cases, the highest daily infections since January 6. Even though the positivity rate remains low, experts believe the latest spike is a matter of concern and could spark the fourth wave of infections in the Capital if strict measures are not ensured. The seven-day average of cases, which denotes the case trajectory, currently stands at 456, the highest in over two months, or since January 12. This number has now been rising for the past 24 days in the city, which has led to experts saying that it may be the start of the fourth wave of infections in the Capital“The daily number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi has been increasing over the past three days, but there is no need to panic... Today, in the meeting, I have given strict instructions to intensify our Covid-19 management system of testing, tracing and isolation. Surveillance will be enhanced and the general laxity observed among people in following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour will be addressed by strict enforcement,” Kejriwal said.A senior official of the Union health ministry said on condition of anonymity: “We are focusing on people who are vulnerable; therefore, in need of the vaccine. Individuals who are vulnerable must be protected first; that’s our priority. Vaccine eagerness can become as big a problem as vaccine hesitancy.”Kejriwal said that if people are vaccinated, there is a good chance that they won’t get Covid-19 for a year or so. “Currently, we are vaccinating 30,000-40,000 people in a day and are going to increase it to 125,000 soon. The number of centres will also be doubled from the existing 500. At present, Covid-19 vaccination centres operate from 9am to 5pm, which will be increased to run them from 9am to 9pm every day,” he said.By Thursday evening, the health department issued two orders directing all hospitals to extend the timings as announced by Kejriwal and for all Delhi government hospitals to increase their vaccination centres from Monday onwards.Urging the Centre to also relax the parameters for vaccination centres, Kejriwal said that at present, only a few centres are open for 24 hours. “It has been more than two months since the inoculation drive started... So, instead of having a list of categories for the people who are eligible for vaccines, we should have a list of those who are not eligible. Rest all adults should be vaccinated,” he said.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said the Covid-19 numbers are likely to increase further in the coming weeks. “People have stopped following Covid-19 appropriate norms. It is seen most in marketplaces. Intensive campaigns and strict enforcement to ensure mask wearing and social distancing should be carried out,” he said.The Union health ministry has separately listed out districts in 12 states and Union territories where infections have grown significantly. From a low of under 11,000 cases every day in the second week of February – the lowest levels recorded since the peak of the first wave in country in September last year – India is now again recording over 29,000 new cases a day on a weekly average. On Thursday, it added 39,671 infections, highest since November 28, 2020.Except for Kerala, Odisha and Bihar, almost all regions are showing an increase in their outbreak, according to the University of Michigan’s India Covid-19 metrics tracker that shows all of the other regions with an R number above 1.India has so far delivered 38.92 million doses. In the last 24 hours, 1.78 million doses were delivered. “If more centres can be added and they work on a mission mode, we will reduce wastage... Also, keep in mind the expiry date of the vaccine. Use the earlier batches first,” Modi said in the meeting with chief ministers on Wednesday.BS Vohra, president of the Joint Forum of East Delhi RWAs, said if norms are relaxed, a lot more people can be vaccinated in the coming months, but suggested that the government carry out more campaigns to curtail vaccine hesitancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/can-vaccinate-delhi-s-adult-population-in-3-months-if-norms-relaxed-kejriwal-101616067615557.html
19-03-2021||World||China wraps up Canadian’s espionage trial in two hours||The trial of a Canadian businessman detained in China since late 2018 ended in a two-hour closed door hearing in a northeastern city on Friday, the latest development in a case seen by Ottawa as a tit-for-tat retaliation for the arrest of a top Huawei executive on a US extradition warrant.The verdict in the case of Michael Spavor, 45, charged with espionage, will be announced on a later date, the Dandong intermediate people’s court said in a statement.China arrested Spavor and fellow Canadian former diplomat Michael Kovrig in December 2018, soon after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, on a US request.Canada has repeatedly called the arrests of its two citizens “arbitrary”.According to news reports from Dandong, Jim Nickel, charge d’affaires of the Canadian embassy in China, told reporters that Spavor was present for the hearing.Diplomats were not allowed into the hearing.Kovrig will go on trial in Beijing on Monday.Last June, the Dandong court in the northeastern Liaoning province initiated Spavor’s public prosecution for suspected spying.The Canadian duo had little contact with the outside world and limited access to lawyers since their arrest.Virtual consular visits could only be resumed last October after a nine-month gap because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Chinese authorities had then said.China has denied that the cases of the two Canadians are linked to Meng’s arrest.“China has repeatedly stated its position on the cases involving the Canadian citizens. Chinese judicial organs handle cases independently in accordance with the law and fully guarantee the lawful rights of the individuals concerned,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said when asked to comment on the case.“China always handles relevant matters including consular notification in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Consular Agreement between China and Canada as well as Chinese laws and regulations,” he said.Earlier this week, China’s Xinhua news agency cited unidentified Chinese authorities as saying Kovrig violated Chinese laws by acting as a spy and stealing state secrets with the help of Spavor, linking the two cases.“Kovrig was accused of using an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig,” a state media report said.Canada’s foreign minister, Marc Garneau, on Wednesday said, “The arbitrary detention of Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor is a top priority for the government of Canada and we continue to work tirelessly to secure their immediate release.”“We believe these detentions are arbitrary, and remain deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding these proceedings,” Garneau said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-wraps-up-canadian-s-espionage-trial-in-two-hours-101616177551535.html

19-03-2021||World||Europe becomes first region to surpass 1 million Covid-19 deaths: Report||Coronavirus-related deaths in the European region surpassed 1 million on Friday as vaccination efforts attempt to keep up with new variants causing a third wave of infections that could once again overwhelm hospitals.Since the pandemic began, at least 37,221,978 infections and 1,000,062 deaths were reported in the European region, according to a Reuters tallyThe region, which includes 51 countries, has about 35.5% of all coronavirus deaths and 30.5% of all cases in the world. The region includes Russia, the United Kingdom, the 27 members of the European Union and other countries. The European region has administered about 12 vaccine shots for every 100 people, behind the United States which has administered about 34 doses per 100 people, according to figures from Our World in Data. Israel leads the world in vaccination efforts with about 110 shots given for every 100 individuals. Some vaccines require two doses.With the number of EU Covid-19 related deaths above 550,000 and less than a tenth of the population inoculated, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the situation was worsening. "We see the crest of a third wave forming in member states, and we know that we need to accelerate the vaccination rates."On Wednesday, the European Union threatened to ban exports of Covid-19 vaccines to Britain to safeguard scarce doses for its own citizens.The number of infections in Europe have started picking up, with France recently seeing its biggest one-day jump in cases since November. The region is currently reporting a million new cases about every six days.As Germany plans to lift the lockdown and revive its economy, an expert at the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Tuesday that the number of infections is rising exponentially, with the country entering a third wave of the pandemic.As the European Union looks to meet its summer target of inoculating 70% of adults, at least 13 countries in the bloc have suspended or delayed using AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after reports of blood coagulation in people who have received the shot.Countries in eastern Europe, including Russia, remain the worst-affected based on the total number of cases and deaths.Russia has the highest total number of Covid infections, with over 4.4 million or nearly 12% of all the cases in the region. The country has one of the highest Covid-19 fatality rates in the world on a per capita basis, with about 153 deaths per 100,0000 residents, behind the United States with 164 deaths for every 100,000 people.While the official death toll in Russia stands at 94,267, at least 221,534 have perished due to the disease, according to a Reuters calculation which includes deaths reported by the country’s Rosstat statistics agency.Italy became the third country in Europe to exceed more than 100,000 deaths last week. Prime Minister Mario Draghi warned that the situation would worsen again with a jump in hospitalizations.The World Health Organization appealed to the governments not to pause vaccination campaigns, while the European Medicines Agency has said that the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than the number seen in the general population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-becomes-first-region-to-surpass-1-million-covid-19-deaths-report-101616173303712.html
19-03-2021||World||Georgia spa shooting victims ID'd as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris head to Atlanta||The names of four additional victims in the Atlanta-area massage businesses shootings have been released, hours before President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris arrive in Atlanta to meet with Asian American community leaders.The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office said Friday that the four victims at two Atlanta businesses are Soon C. Park, 74; Hyun J. Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong A. Yue, 63. Family members identified Grant by her maiden name, Hyun Jung Kim.The medical examiner performed autopsies on all four victims Wednesday, saying all but Suncha Kim died Tuesday from gunshots to the head. She died from a gunshot to the chest.Three of the women died at the Gold Spa in Atlanta, while the fourth woman died across the street at Aromatherapy Spa. The medical examiner didn’t immediately say which woman died at Aromatherapy.A 21-year-old white man, Robert Aaron Long, is charged with murder in Tuesday’s slayings. He’s also accused of killing four people and wounding a fifth person at Youngs Asian Massage Parlor near Woodstock, in Atlanta’s northwestern suburbs.Cherokee County authorities earlier identified the dead there as Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Youngs.Police continue to investigate the deadly shootings, with Deputy Atlanta Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. saying Thursday that “nothing is off the table” in his department's inquiry, including whether the slayings were a hate crime.The Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office said it also was investigating whether the killings were hate crimes.Georgia lawmakers last year passed a hate crimes law that allows additional penalties to be imposed for certain offenses when motivated by a victim’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender or disability. A hate crime is not a standalone crime under the law, but it can be used to add time to a sentence once someone is convicted of another crime.Investigators believe Long had previously visited two of the Atlanta massage parlors where four of the women were killed, Hampton said.Long told police that the attacks were not racially motivated. He claimed to have a sex addiction, and authorities said he apparently lashed out at what he saw as sources of temptation.Crabapple First Baptist Church, where Long was an active member, issued a statement Friday saying it was seeking to remove Long from membership, saying “we can no longer affirm that he is truly a regenerate believer in Jesus Christ.”The church said its teaching does not condone violence against Asian Americans or women and it's improper to view women as somehow responsible for male sexual urges.“Each person is responsible for his or her own sin,” the church said. “In this case, the shooter is solely responsible for his heinous actions, not the victims who were targeted.”Long’s statements spurred outrage and widespread skepticism in the Asian American community, which has increasingly been targeted for violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Jay Baker also drew criticism for saying Long had “a really bad day” and “this is what he did.”Sheriff Frank Reynolds released a statement Thursday acknowledging that some of Baker’s comments stirred “much debate and anger” and said the agency regrets any “heartache” caused by his words. Baker was replaced Thursday as spokesman for the investigation.Long's lawyer, J. Daran Burns, issued a statement Thursday offering condolences to the victims’ families and saying he is working on Long’s behalf “to investigate the facts and circumstances” surrounding the slayings.Long waived his right to an initial hearing in Cherokee County Magistrate Court.Biden and Harris had already been scheduled to travel to Atlanta to tout the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill, but the trip took on new meaning after the shootings. The visit also comes amid an intense debate over voting rights in Georgia.Biden and Harris, the first vice president of Asian descent, will instead meet with Asian American leaders to discuss threats against the community, meet with other local leaders and visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for an update on the pandemic.Also Thursday, Biden directed that flags be flown at half-staff through sunset Monday in honor of the dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-spa-shooting-victims-id-d-as-joe-biden-kamala-harris-head-to-atlanta-101616172424517.html

19-03-2021||World||WHO gives nod to AstraZeneca vaccine and its 'tremendous potential'||The World Health Organization's vaccine safety panel said on Friday that available data from AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot do not point to any overall increase in clotting conditions but it would continue to monitor for any adverse effects."The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine (including Covishield) continues to have a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world," the WHO's global advisory committee on vaccine safety said in a statement.Covishield refers to AstraZeneca vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India.The WHO panel of 12 independent experts, who met virtually on Tuesday and on Thursday, reviewed safety data from Europe, the United Kingdom, India, and WHO's global database."While very rare and unique thromboembolic events in combination with thrombocytopenia, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), have also been reported following vaccination with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Europe, it is not certain that they have been caused by vaccination," it said.Europe was pushing to get its vaccination drive back on track on Friday after European and British regulators had also said the benefits of AstraZeneca's shot outweighed risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-panel-gives-nod-to-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-has-tremendous-potential-101616170685798.html

19-03-2021||World||US charges 4 Proud Boys members with conspiring to impede Congress on January 6||A federal grand jury has charged four members of the far-right Proud Boys with conspiring to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory, according to a new superseding indictment unsealed on Friday.The indictment alleges that Ethan Nordean of Washington, Joseph Biggs of Florida, Zachary Rehl of Pennsylvania and Charles Donohoe of North Carolina conspired to encourage members of the group to attend the Stop the Steal protest in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6.It also says they worked to obtain paramilitary equipment used for the attack on the US Capitol, dismantled metal barriers set up to protect the building, and communicated using handheld radios and encrypted messaging applications.All four defendants are the leaders of Proud Boys chapters in their respective states, the indictment says.The indictment also alleges that they made their intentions clear as far back as November, with Biggs declaring in a social media post on Nov. 5, threatening war if the election was stolen from then-President Donald Trump, who lost the vote.Later that month, on Nov. 27, Nordean declared: "We tried playing nice and by the rules, now you will deal with the monster you created."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-4-proud-boys-members-with-conspiring-to-impede-congress-on-january-6-101616168469587.html
19-03-2021||World||India, Australia to hold key trilateral meetings in April, Indo-Pacific on agenda||Members of the Quad are moving forward with their agenda for ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific by working with other like-minded countries, with India and Australia set to hold two key trilateral ministerial meetings in New Delhi next month. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and Australian foreign minister Marise Payne will hold separate meetings with their French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian and Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi on the margins of the annual Raisina Dialogue during April 13-15, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. These meetings are expected to focus on issues such as maritime security and collaborating on shared challenges across the region, the people said. France is seen as a natural fit for working with the Quad as it has 1.5 million citizens on island territories within the Indo-Pacific, and 93% its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of more than 11 million sq km is also within the region. Work on arranging the India-Australia-Indonesia trilateral has been on for more than six months but the meeting was held up because of Jakarta’s sensitivities, one of the people cited above said. The French foreign minister is among the speakers at Raisina Dialogue and the Indonesian foreign minister too is expected to attend the event, a second person said. The trilateral meetings will follow close on the heels of the La Pérouse exercise in the Bay of Bengal during April 4-7, which will see the French Navy joining the navies of India, Australia, Japan and the US – the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad. India will deploy frontline warships and P-8I maritime patrol aircraft for what is being dubbed as a “Quad-plus France” manoeuvre, and the five countries will showcase their naval strength and commitment to freedom of navigation by practising complex drills. At the same time, work has begun on implementing the Quad Vaccine Partnership, which was seen as the most significant outcome of the first virtual Quad leaders’ summit on March 12 and envisages the production of one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 for developing countries. The people said the Quad members are keen on production of vaccines beginning at Indian facilities as early as the second quarter of 2021 though several issues are still being addressed by the four countries. Under the partnership, vaccines developed by the US will be made in India with funding from the US and Japan, while Australia will provide “last mile” delivery support with focus on Southeast Asia. “A lot depends on India’s manufacturing capacity, given the demands on Indian manufacturers to fulfil both the demands of the domestic inoculation programme and commercial supplies and grants for foreign countries,” the first person cited above said. “There could be issues such as intellectual property rights but they can be addressed by the four countries working together,” the person added. In a media briefing after the Quad Summit, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had said a “bridging arrangement” will be needed for manufacturing US-developed vaccines in India, including trials, tests and authorisation for doses to be certified as fit for export. This issue is being looked at by the Quad vaccine experts group, one of three working groups formed during the summit. It is believed the four members of Quad are keen on progress on vaccines before the leaders hold their first in-person meeting. Efforts are currently on to schedule this meeting on the margins of the G7 Summit to be hosted by the UK in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the G7 Summit. Australia was chosen for logistics support for vaccine delivery as it has already created an extensive network with an existing commitment of $407 million for regional vaccine access and health security to Pacific Island countries. Australia will contribute an additional $77 million for providing vaccines and delivery support in Southeast Asia. The other crucial working group formed during the Quad summit – the critical and emerging technology working group – will focus on collaboration on issues such as 5G, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and cyber-security. This will include both setting of standards and ensuring such cutting edge technologies aren’t misused by state actors, the people said. “We’ve seen how such technologies can be misused during the US presidential elections and the effort will be to prevent such activities,” the first person cited above said. The issue of rare earth metals too figured at the Quad Summit, and Australia, which has the world’s sixth largest reserves of these materials, is working closely with India and US to address China’s dominance in supplying these critical elements to makers of everything from smartphones to high-performance motors and batteries for electric vehicles. Rare earths are critical for India’s plans to become a leader in electric vehicles and Australia will soon conduct a demand-supply assessment for India, after having completed a similar exercise for the US, the people said. Though the joint statement issued after the Quad Summit made no direct reference to China, the people acknowledged that the impact of China’s assertive actions in the area ranging from the East and South China Seas to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) figured prominently in the deliberations by the four leaders. US President Joe Biden set the tone for these discussions with his unusually candid observations on China, the people added. Immediately after the Quad Summit, another person familiar with the deliberations had said that the four leaders discussed India’s military standoff with China along the LAC, and the three other members had a “sympathetic view” towards New Delhi on the issue. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the eventual outcome of the ongoing meeting of senior US-China officials in Alaska could have an impact on the workings of the Quad. “Quad’s future, which seemed bright after the summit, will partly depend on eventual dynamics between the US and China. It is still early days and the first session of the meeting in Alaska didn’t go well. The outcome is awaited,” he said. “Within Asean, privately the governments are reportedly happy with the Quad’s vaccine initiative as there is a deficit in access to vaccines and a trust deficit where Chinese vaccines are concerned. So they are interested in the vaccine partnership, but there are also some critics and dissenters, who are looking negatively at the vaccine initiative,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-australia-to-hold-key-trilateral-meetings-in-april-indo-pacific-on-agenda-101616169025654.html
19-03-2021||World||Switzerland postpones plan to lift Covid-19 curbs||Switzerland has postponed plans to relax its COVID-19 restrictions, the government said on Friday, citing increasing coronavirus cases and insufficient progress on vaccinations.Switzerland had planned to allow outdoor events like football matches and concerts with up to 150 people from Monday as well as allowing restaurants to open terraces to outdoor diners, but instead opted for a more cautious approach as neighbouring France and Germany also rein in reopening."The risk of an uncontrolled increase in the number of cases is currently too great for further openings," the government said on Friday. "In addition, too few people have yet been vaccinated to prevent a sharp rise in hospitalizations."The number of coronavirus cases in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein rose by 1,750 on Thursday, well above the seven-day average of 1,285 cases.Currently, infections are expected to double every three to four weeks, the government said, warning new variants of COVID-19 make up to 80% of the new cases."We've known for a while that they aren't merely more infectious, but also more dangerous," Health Minister Alain Berset said at a press conference. "This is not the moment we'd hoped for."The government did relax restrictions on indoor meetings for families and friends, up to 10 people from five previously, ahead of Easter.Torn between public fatigue and warnings from public health experts about reopening too quickly, the government has forged a middle path that is often less strict than neighbouring countries' approaches.It has unveiled a 1 billion Swiss franc ($1.07 billion) plan to offer free coronavirus tests for all residents, while grappling with shortages of vaccines it needs for its goal to inoculate all who wish by summer.Shops, museums, and libraries reopened this month and sporting and cultural activities for youngsters resumed. Schools and many ski lifts are open, but restaurants and cultural venues remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-postpones-plan-to-lift-covid-19-curbs-101616168264387.html
19-03-2021||World||Nepal becomes 3rd country to give emergency nod to Covaxin||Nepal on Friday gave emergency authorisation to India's Covid-19 vaccine COVAXIN, becoming only the third country to approve the shot, developed by Bharat Biotech and a state research institute.COVAXIN was shown to be 81% effective in an interim analysis of late-stage trial data on some 26,000 people in India. The vaccine was approved for emergency use in India in January and Zimbabwe cleared it early this month."Conditional permission has been granted for emergency use authorisation," Nepal's Department of Drug Administration said in a statement.Wedged between India and China, the Himalayan country has already received more than 2.3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India, including 1 million doses as a gift.China has also promised 800,000 doses of its own vaccine but the time for the delivery of the Chinese shots is unknown.The latest approval comes as authorities in Nepal said they were suspending their vaccination campaign because of a lack of supply.Jageshwar Gautam, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Population, said more than 1.6 million people had received their first shots under the inoculation drive begun in January."We do not have enough vaccine shots to begin our next phase of vaccination of people above 55 years of age," Gautam told Reuters."The campaign will be suspended until we get more supply."Nepal has reported 275,750 cases and 3,016 deaths so far, according to government data.Bharat Biotech says it has received interest in COVAXIN from 40 countries. It has sought or is in the process of seeking emergency approvals in Brazil, the Philippines and Thailand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-becomes-3rd-country-to-give-emergency-nod-to-covaxin-101616168087407.html
19-03-2021||World||US CDC changes 6-foot rule for schools, allowing desks to be closer||The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed its social distancing guidelines for schools Friday, saying students can now sit 3 feet apart in classrooms.The revised Covid-19 recommendations represent a turn away from the 6-foot standard that has forced some schools to remove desks, stagger scheduling and take other steps to keep children away from one another.Three feet “gives school districts greater flexibility to have more students in for a prolonged period of time,” said Kevin Quinn, director of maintenance and facilities at Mundelein High School in suburban Chicago.In recent months, schools in some states have been disregarding the CDC guidelines, using 3 feet as their standard. Studies of what happened in some of them helped sway the agency, said Greta Massetti, who leads the CDC's community interventions task force.While there is evidence of improved mental health and other benefits from in-person schooling, “we don't really have the evidence that 6 feet is required in order to maintain low spread,” she said.Also, younger children are less likely to get seriously ill from the coronavirus and don't seem to spread it as much as adults do, and "that allows us that confidence that that 3 feet of physical distance is safe,” Massetti said.The new guidance:— Removes recommendations for plastic shields or other barriers between desks. “We don't have a lot of evidence of their effectiveness” in preventing transmission, Massetti said.— Advises at least 3 feet of space between desks in elementary schools, even in towns and cities where community spread is high, so long as students and teachers wear masks and take other precautions.— Says spacing can also be 3 feet in middle and high schools, so long as there's not a high level of spread in the community. If there is, spacing should be at least 6 feet.The CDC said 6 feet of distance should still be maintained in common areas, such as school lobbies, and when masks can't be worn, such as when eating.Also, students should continue to be spaced 6 feet apart in situations where there are a lot of people talking, cheering or singing, all of which can spread droplets containing the coronavirus. That includes chorus practice, assemblies and sports events.The CDC said teachers and other adults should stay 6 feet from one another and from students.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the revised recommendations are an "evidence-based roadmap to help schools reopen safely, and remain open, for in-person instruction.”“Safe in-person instruction gives our kids access to critical social and mental health services that prepare them for the future, in addition to the education they need to succeed," she said in a statement.Last year, the CDC advised that one way for schools to operate safely was by keeping children 6 feet apart, the same standard applied to workplaces and other settings.In contrast, the World Health Organization suggested 1 meter — a little over 3 feet — was sufficient in schools. The American Academy of Pediatrics says to desks should be spaced 3 feet apart and “ideally” 6 feet.The CDC guidance was problematic for many schools that traditionally had 25, 30 or more children per classroom in closely grouped desks. Some schools adopted complicated, hybrid scheduling, that might, for example, have half a class come to school on some days and the other half on other days.The Ridley School District in suburban Philadelphia took steps like that to follow the 6-foot guideline after the CDC emphasized it last summer. But neighboring communities went with 3 feet, “and we're not seeing the data really reflect a different spread rate,” said Lee Ann Wentzel, the district's superintendent.The district had already decided to shift to 3-foot distancing starting next month and invite all students to attend five days a week. But Wentzel said she was glad to hear of the change in CDC guidance because it will be easier to explain and defend the district's decision.A recent study in Massachusetts looked at infections of students and staff members in schools that used the 3-foot standard and those that used the 6-foot one. It found no significant difference in infection rates.Massetti said other research has also been influential, including two studies the CDC released Friday.One was a study in Utah that found low coronavirus transmission rates among students who did a good job wearing masks and whose desks were only 3 feet apart. The other study, done in Missouri, pointed to a similar conclusion, Massetti said.The guidance change comes at a time when new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus are increasingly spreading. That means a continued emphasis on mask wearing and other such measurs, Massetti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-changes-6-foot-rule-for-schools-allowing-desks-to-be-closer-101616165983691.html
19-03-2021||World||Happiness Report: World shows resilience in face of Covid-19||The coronavirus brought a year of fear and anxiety, loneliness and lockdown, and illness and death, but an annual report on happiness around the world released Friday suggests the pandemic has not crushed people's spirits.The editors of the 2021 World Happiness Report found that while emotions changed as the pandemic set in, longer-term satisfaction with life was less affected.“What we have found is that when people take the long view, they’ve shown a lot of resilience in this past year,” Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, one of the report's co-author, said from New York.The annual report, produced by the U.N Sustainable Development Solutions Network, ranks 149 countries based on gross domestic product per person, healthy life expectancy and the opinions of residents. Surveys ask respondents to indicate on a 1-10 scale how much social support they feel they have if something goes wrong, their freedom to make their own life choices, their sense of how corrupt their society is and how generous they are.Due to the pandemic, the surveys were done in slightly fewer than 100 countries for this year's World Happiness Report, the ninth one compiled since the project started. Index rankings for the other nations was based on estimates from past data.The results from both methods had European countries occupying nine of the top 10 spots on the list of the word's happiest places, with New Zealand rounding out the group. The top 10 countries are Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Austria.It was the fourth consecutive year that Finland came out on top. The United States, which was at No. 13 five years ago, slipped from 18th to 19th place. On a shortened list ranking only those countries surveyed, the U.S. placed 14th.“We find year after year that life satisfaction is reported to be happiest in the social democracies of northern Europe,” Sachs said. “People feel secure in those countries, so trust is high. The government is seen to be credible and honest, and trust in each other is high.”Finland’s comparative success in curbing Covid-19 may have contributed to the enduring trust the country's people have in their government. The country took rapid and extensive measures to stop the spread of the virus and has one of Europe's lowest Covid-19 mortality rates.“In Finland as well, of course, people have been suffering,” Anu Partanen, author of “The Nordic Theory of Everything" said on Friday in Helsinki. “But again in Finland and the Nordic countries, people are really lucky because society still supports a system buffering these sorts of shocks.”Overall, the index showed little change in happiness levels compared to last years' report, which was based on information from before the pandemic.“We asked two kinds of questions. One is about the life in general, life evaluation, we call it. How is your life going? The other is about mood, emotions, stress, anxiety. What we have found is that when people take the the long view, they’ve shown a lot of resilience in this past year," Sachs said. “Of course, we’re still in the middle of a deep crisis. But the responses about long-term life evaluation did not change decisively, though the disruption in our lives was so profound.”Issues that affect the well-being of people living in the United States include racial tensions and growing income inequality between the richest and poorest residents, happiness experts say.“As for why the U.S. ranks much lower than other similarly or even less wealthy countries, the answer is straightforward,” said Carol Graham, an expert at The Brookings Institution who was not involved in the report. “The U.S. has larger gaps in happiness rankings between the rich and the poor than do most other wealthy countries.”Report co-author Sonja Lyubormirsky, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, noted that American culture prizes signs of wealth such as big houses and multiple cars more so than other countries, “and material things don’t make us as happy.”Conversely, people's perception that their country was handling the pandemic well contributed to an overall rise in well-being, Columbia’s Sachs said. Several Asian countries fared better than they had in last years' rankings; China moved to 84th place from 94th last year."This has been a difficult period. People are looking past it when they look for the long term. But there are also many people that are suffering in the short run,” he said.Finnish philosopher Esa Saarinen, who was not involved in the report, thinks the Finnish character itself might help explain why the country keeps leading the index.“I think Finns are pretty kind of content on some level at being just what we are,” he said. “We don’t really have to be more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/happiness-report-world-shows-resilience-in-face-of-covid19-101616165892572.html

He flew on the space shuttle Columbia in 1986 and currently serves on the Nasa Advisory Council.Nelson, who served three terms in the Senate, would take control of NASA as it seeks to return humans to the moon for the first time since the 1970s and expands its reliance on a commercial space industry.Biden has agreed to continue a program, known as Artemis, that began under former President Donald Trump and aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2024, intended as a prelude to an even more ambitious human Mars landing in the future.Nelson would succeed Jim Bridenstine, appointed by Trump, as Nasa administrator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-picks-ex-us-senator-bill-nelson-as-nasa-chief-white-house-101616165305564.html
19-03-2021||World||'We need time': Scandinavian caution keeps AstraZeneca shots on hold||Denmark, Sweden and Norway said on Friday they needed more time to decide whether to use AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine even though the EU drug watchdog said the benefits outweighed the risks, prompting several countries to resume its use."We need time to get to the bottom of this," Soren Brostrom, head of the Danish Health Authority, told reporters on Friday.Several European countries last week suspended use of the vaccine following reports of rare instances of blood clots in some people who had been vaccinated.On Friday nearly a dozen of them resumed inoculations on the EMA's recommendation."This does not change the fact that, on the basis of a precautionary principle, we are continuing our suspension, because we need to understand this better, so that we can say with certainty that we recommend this vaccine," Brostrom said.Health authorities in all three Scandinavian countries said they would decide on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine next week.Norway has so far reported five cases in which recipients of the vaccine were later admitted to hospital with a combination of blood clots, bleedings and low platelets, one of whom has died.A sixth person, who also got the vaccine, has died from brain a haemorrhage in combination with a low count of platelets."These cases are rare, but very serious. We can not rule out that these cases may be linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine," the Norwegian Medicines Agency said.Sweden is also looking into isolated cases of blood clots and coagulatory issues among people who took the vaccine, including two deaths, though authorities have said any possible link to the inoculations remains uncertain."We know already that we have quite a few people that have begun to be hesitant about the vaccine," Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, the architect of Sweden's no-lockdown pandemic strategy, told public service broadcaster SVT."That means it is hugely important that we are able to issue clear communications about how and why we continue to use (the AstraZeneca vaccine)."Both Sweden and Norway have seen a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Denmark has seen numbers fall and is gradually reopening society.AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-need-time-scandinavian-caution-keeps-astrazeneca-shots-on-hold-101616162404654.html
19-03-2021||World||Drone strike on Riyadh oil refinery claimed by Houthis sparks fire: Saudi Arabia||An air attack on an oil refinery in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Friday caused a fire that was brought under control, the energy ministry said, after Yemen's Houthi group said they targeted the site with six drones.The refinery is operated by state-controlled oil giant Saudi Aramco. The attack, which happened at 6:05 a.m. Saudi time, did not result in injuries or deaths, and did not disrupt the supply of oil or oil derivatives, the energy ministry said.The Houthis said earlier in the day that they had hit a facility belonging to Aramco in Riyadh, without specifying the targets they said were hit."Our armed forces carried out at dawn today an operation... with six drones which targeted the Aramco company in the capital of the Saudi enemy, Riyadh," said Yahya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman.Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment but said it would do so "at the earliest opportunity".The Iran-aligned Houthis have stepped up attacks into Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, in recent weeks.Sarea said operations against Saudi Arabia will continue and escalate as long as Saudi "aggression" against Yemen continues.The Saudi energy ministry said this and other attacks had targeted the security and stability of the world's energy supply, not just Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition which intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against Houthi forces, which ousted the internationally-recognised Yemeni government from power in Sanaa in late 2014.Riyadh says it intercepts most of the drones and missiles which the Houthis say they launch at airports, air bases and energy infrastructure, but some do inflict damage.On March 7, the coalition said a barrage of drones and missiles had been intercepted en route to targets including an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, the site of a refinery and the world's biggest offshore oil-loading facility. A residential compound in Dhahran used by Saudi Aramco was also targeted.Sarea warned "foreign companies and citizens" to avoid military sites and key infrastructure.In renewed diplomatic efforts to end the war, the United Nations and United States have urged the Houthis, who are also pressing an offensive against the government-held city of Marib in Yemen, to turn to negotiations rather then military escalation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drone-strike-on-riyadh-oil-refinery-claimed-by-houthis-sparks-fire-saudi-arabia-101616162390584.html
19-03-2021||World||UN rights chief: Justice at stake in trial over Floyd death||The UN human rights chief said Friday that the US trial over the killing of George Floyd presents a “crucial, defining opportunity for justice” that has been denied to countless other families, urging efforts to address the root causes of racial discrimination.Michelle Bachelet highlighted the case during a Human Rights Council session focusing on systematic discrimination against people of African descent, saying she met last week with family members of such people killed by law enforcement officials.Her office declined to specify who they were, citing confidentiality agreements.Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the May 25 death of Floyd, a Black man, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for about nine minutes.“Ten months after the killing of George Floyd set off new waves of outrage and demands for change across the world, a key trial related to his killing is now beginning,” Bachelet said.“But this crucial, defining opportunity for justice is denied to countless other families."“So many cases involving deaths of people of African descent never make it to court, and the pain of so many families goes unacknowledged or even denied,” she said.During her meetings last week, relatives of victims told her of the ongoing trauma faced by the loss of a child or sibling "so suddenly and violently,” Bachelet said.She cited their struggles with police and judicial authorities to achieve justice.Bachelet said police brutality and racial discrimination continue against people of African descent, despite heightened visibility about the issues.“To end racial injustice in law enforcement, we cannot simply see the tip of the iceberg, we must face the mass below the surface," she said.“We must address the legacies of enslavement, the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans, and its context of colonialism.”Bachelet said she plans to issue a report to the 47-member-state council in June to recommend “an agenda for transformative change to dismantle systemic racism and police brutality against Africans and people of African descent” and help victims.Lisa Peterson, an US acting assistant Secretary of State, delivered a statement to the council on behalf of 150 states, saying that fighting racism and racial discrimination means “acknowledging and addressing the legacy of past transgressions” that often turn up in “systemic racism.”“A great deal more needs to be done,” she said. “Many of our own countries suffer from historical inequalities that, decades and even centuries later, still cast long shadows over the present day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-justice-at-stake-in-trial-over-floyd-death-101616163149894.html
19-03-2021||World||Boris Johnson to get ‘safe and effective’ Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to protect against Covid-19 on Friday, even as many European countries who had paused its use amid some blood clot fears began resuming the jabs.The European and UK regulators said they had conducted a “thorough” scientific review of all the available data and concluded that the available evidence does not suggest that blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism) are caused by the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and produced by AstraZeneca, which is also being manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India.The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), however, does advice that anyone with a persistent headache beyond four days after receiving their vaccine should seek medical advice.“Our thorough and careful review, alongside the critical assessment of leading, independent scientists, shows that there is no evidence that that blood clots in veins is occurring more than would be expected in the absence of vaccination, for either vaccine,” said Dr June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive.“You should therefore continue to get your jab when it is your turn. While we continue to investigate these cases, as a precautionary measure we would advise anyone with a headache that lasts for more than four days after vaccination, or bruising beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, to seek medical attention,” she said.The MHRA’s investigation found a “very small number of reports” of an extremely rare form of blood clot in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis, or CSVT) occurring together with lowered platelets soon after vaccination. This type of blood clot can occur naturally in people who have not been vaccinated, as well as in those suffering from Covid-19.Therefore, the health experts say that given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these CSVT events among the 11 million people vaccinated, and as a link to the vaccine is unproven, the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, continue to outweigh the risks of potential side effects.“However, please remember that mild flu-like symptoms remain one of the most common side effects of any Covid-19 vaccine, including headache, chills and fever.These generally appear within a few hours and resolve within a day or two, but not everyone gets them. We will continue to robustly monitor all the data we have on this extremely rare possible side effect,” added Raine.Meanwhile, during a Downing Street briefing on Thursday evening, Boris Johnson repeated his previous assertions that both vaccines currently being administered by the National Health Service (NHS) are “safe and effective”.“So the Oxford jab is safe; and the Pfizer jab is safe – the thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid – which is why it’s so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes,” he said.“And as it happens, I’m getting mine. And the centre where I’m getting jabbed is currently using the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for those receiving their first dose, and that is the one I’ll be having,” said the 56-year-old, who qualifies for a jab after the NHS expanded its rollout to all adults aged over-50.The UK PM also sought to allay fears around the supply of vaccines, which has been attributed to a delay in the delivery of 5 million doses from the Serum Institute of India, a company he praised for its “herculean job” of manufacturing vaccines in large quantities.Johnson said: “We’ve always said that in a vaccination programme of this pace and this scale, some interruptions in supply are inevitable and it is true that in the short term we are receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago.“That is because of a delay in a shipment from the Serum Institute, who are doing a herculean job in producing vaccines in such large quantities – and because of a batch that we currently have in the UK that needs to be retested – as part of our rigorous safety programmes. So as a result we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March. But that is still more than we received in February.”He reiterated that the supply speed would not affect the timetable set for all adults to receive their anti-Covid jabs by end-July or for the lockdown to be eased in phases over the next few months.“There is no change to the next steps of the roadmap,” he said.Meanwhile, latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest infection levels have continued to decrease across England and Wales but have "levelled off" in Northern Ireland and increased in Scotland. An estimated one in 335 people in the UK had Covid-19 in the week to March 13, according to the figures.On Thursday, the UK recorded 6,303 new coronavirus cases and 95 deaths, taking its death toll from the deadly virus to 125,926.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-get-safe-and-effective-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-101616162234049.html
19-03-2021||World||India ranks 139 out of 149 countries in World Happiness Report | Here's list of 20 happiest nations||India has been ranked 139, out of 149 countries evaluated, in the World Happiness Report 2021, which has been collated slightly differently due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The annual report, released by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, measures subjective well-being by relying on three main indicators: life evaluations, positive emotions, and negative emotions.To measure life evaluations, the Gallup World Poll, which remains the principal source of data for the report, asked people to evaluate their current life using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life for them as a 10 and worst possible as a 0. According to the report, life evaluations provide the most informative measure for international comparisons because they capture the quality of life “in a more complete and stable way than emotional reports based on daily experiences.”Positive emotions have been captured in the report by asking respondents whether they smiled or laughed a lot the previous day. An affirmative response is coded as a 1 while a negative response is coded as 0 and the average response is calculated for each person, with values ranging from 0 and 1. On the other hand, negative emotions are measured by asking them whether they experienced specific negative emotions a lot on the same day.“Negative affect, for each person, is given by the average of their yes or no answers about three emotions: worry, sadness, and anger. National averages are created in the same way as for positive affect,” the report reads.Read | India downgraded from ‘free’ to ‘partly free’ in democracy reportFinland was able to defend its title of the world’s happiest country as the overall rankings, according to the report, “remained very similar to last year.” The other countries that scored high on the rankings include Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, and the Netherlands. The United States has been ranked 19, five spots behind Canada, while people in Afghanistan remained the least happy.In the World Happiness Report 2020, India was ranked 144 out of 156 countries surveyed. But this year’s rankings exclude countries where the survey was not carried out or where the sample sizes were smaller, compared to the three-year averages usually used. The ten countries behind India on World Happiness Report 2021 rankings are Burundi, Yemen, Tanzania, Haiti, Malawi, Lesotho, Botswana, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, and Afghanistan.Here’s the list of the top 20 ranked countries on the World Happiness Report 2021:1.

19-03-2021||World||Twitter to review platform rules for world leaders, asks users to weigh in||Twitter on Friday began a survey of global users about platform rules for world leaders while consulting human rights and academic specialists on its next policy steps.The announcement comes after Twitter joined other social networks banning then-president Donald Trump for his comments seen as inciting the violent attack on the US Capitol in January.The ban was criticized by Trump supporters while others had argued Twitter should have taken action earlier despite its policy of allowing leeway for world leaders and newsworthy posts."Politicians and government officials are constantly evolving how they use our service, and we want our policies to remain relevant to the ever-changing nature of political discourse on Twitter and protect the health of the public conversation," the Twitter safety team said in a blog post."That's why we're reviewing our approach to world leaders and seeking your input."Twitter will be asking users their views in a survey in 14 languages, from Friday until April 12."Generally, we want to hear from the public on whether or not they believe world leaders should be subject to the same rules as others on Twitter. And, should a world leader violate a rule, what type of enforcement action is appropriate," the statement said."We're also in the process of consulting with a range of human rights experts, civil society organizations, and academics worldwide whose feedback will be reflected in forthcoming revisions to the policy framework."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-review-platform-rules-for-world-leaders-asks-users-to-weigh-in-101616160933101.html
19-03-2021||World||Fiery start to US-China talks shows acrimony is here to stay||The first face-to-face meeting between the US and China since President Joe Biden took office was bound to be confrontational. The question now is whether the two sides can find a way cooperate after unloading so many grievances in public.Top diplomats from the world’s two largest economies criticized each other over everything from trade to human rights in a high-stakes first encounter Thursday in an Alaskan ballroom. US Secretary of State Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Beijing of undermining global stability, while his counterpart, Yang Jiechi, said the US wasn’t “qualified to speak to China from a position of strength.”The barbs on both sides appeared intended for domestic consumption, with Biden seeking to show his supporters that he’s tough on China and President Xi Jinping needing to satisfy his own increasingly nationalistic population. Still, the unusually acrimonious exchange showed the world just how hard it will be to repair a relationship that deteriorated rapidly under Donald Trump.“It’s not surprising for the Alaska meeting to start with a strong smell of gunpowder,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University. “It is obvious that a new equation for China-US relations is emerging. That is conflict, competition and cooperation.”The diplomatic blow-up tamped down investor sentiment in China, contributing to a slide of about 3% in China’s CSI 300. Regional shares were already under pressure following an overnight tumble on Wall Street.The delegations are due to meet for a final time on Friday morning after two rounds of closed-door talks following their initial exchange. While it was unclear whether the private discussions were more productive, a senior US administration official said the talks were “substantive, serious and direct” and went beyond the allotted time.“Perhaps it will give the Biden administration a little bit of leeway to start actually talking about issues, to start trying to come to some common understanding with the Chinese,” said William Zarit, a senior counselor at the Cohen Group and ex-US minister for commercial affairs in Beijing. “Most of these things are really to show strength in domestic politics here in the US”Both sides have highlighted numerous areas where they need closer cooperation, including climate change and pandemic relief. Biden administration officials have also expressed openness to relax some visa restrictions on Chinese nationals put in place under Trump, but not his tariffs and sanctions as demanded by China.Before the meeting, officials in Beijing had raised the possibility of a virtual summit between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping to coincide with Earth Day next month if the talks went well. But there had been unease among some in the Biden administration about meeting the Chinese side so soon, and the early response was that it may have been a miscalculation, according to one person familiar.The meeting laid bare a battle between two world views shaking global institutions and disrupting industries from semiconductors to social media. With an economy set to overtake the US’ within a decade and an increasingly modern military, China has decided to draw a line against what it sees as foreign interference. The US, meanwhile, has decided it must contain Beijing’s growing global influence.Show of StrengthTrump’s decision to run against China in last year’s election campaign, as Xi rounded up dissidents at home and the coronavirus surged around the world, accelerated the process. Biden administration officials in Anchorage, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, faced pressure to overcome skepticism that their plan to rebuild the US’s alliance network could be more effective than Trump’s “America First” policies.The US delegation was hoping to show strength by hosting the meeting on American soil after a week of meetings showcasing their Asia-Pacific alliances, including a budding partnership with India. While in Asia, Blinken signaled Biden would keep up the pressure on Beijing, accusing China of “coercion and aggression” and tightening sanctions against lawmakers responsible for crackdowns in Hong Kong.But the Chinese officials -- emboldened by the country’s rapid recovery from the world’s first coronavirus outbreak and the domestic turmoil in the US-- had similar plans. Yang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had for weeks warned Washington that they wouldn’t tolerate any foreign power crossing “red lines” like Taiwan and Hong Kong.The pair unloaded China’s most critical talking points on the US, citing the killing of Black Americans and the Black Lives Matter movement as evidence of US hypocrisy. The comments were lapped up on China’s heavily censored social media, with posts citing Yang accumulating hundreds of thousands of likes in a matter of hours.Shi Yinhong, director of Renmin University’s Center on American Studies in Beijing, said both sides appeared to be hardening their positions on fundamental issues. While there might be some scope for collaboration on issues such as Iran, North Korea or Myanmar, he said, it was “quite, quite limited.”“It’s probable that after this Anchorage diplomat summit, Sino-American relations may deteriorate further,” Shi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fiery-start-to-us-china-talks-shows-acrimony-is-here-to-stay-101616160050776.html
19-03-2021||World||France to use AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for people aged 55 and over||France is resuming its AstraZeneca Plc vaccination campaign for people aged 55 and over.“The High Health Authority (HAS) gives its green light to the resumption of vaccination with AstraZeneca for people aged 55 and over,” Health Minister Olivier Veran said in a Tweet.For everyone under the age of 55, HAS recommends using other vaccines, an official at HAS said by phone, asking not to be identified in line with the agency’s rules.The new guidance comes after the European Medicines Agency said that Astra is safe and efficient, though it may increase the risk of thrombosis. Until now, Astra was recommended for people over the age of 50.The decision in France to start inoculating again with Astra follows similar moves across the European Union, with countries like Germany and Spain resuming their use of the vaccine after temporarily suspending it to investigate possible blood-clot issues.HAS will give a recommendation in the coming days on how to administer a second shot to those under the age 55 who have already received a first Astra shot.France is marking the re-start of its vaccination campaign with the immunization of 55-year-old Prime Minister Jean Castex Friday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-use-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-people-aged-55-and-over-101616159759567.html
19-03-2021||World||Maritime bodies say over 2 lakh seafarers impacted globally by Covid-19 restrictions||Maritime bodies ICS and ITF on Friday said about two lakh seafarers stand impacted by crew change crisis due to travel restrictions by many countries on account of the new Covid-19 variant.International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) expressed concerns over the rise in the number of seafarers impacted by crew change due to Covid-variants."The latest collective industry analysis shows that 200,000 seafarers are currently affected by the crew change crisis, a marked reduction from the height of crisis where 400,000 needed to be repatriated. However, with governments reintroducing stricter border control and travel restrictions due to new Covid-19 variants making it harder for crew to transfer to and from ships," the bodies said in a statement.So far, only 55 countries and two associate members of the IMO have declared seafarers as key workers and more work must be done to ensure crew do not once again become collateral damage in the pandemic, the statement said.In December 2020, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) found that governments have failed to protect seafarers’ rights as set out in international law under the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, the statement said adding the UN agency called on states to recognise seafarers as key workers “without delay”.Concerns about prioritisation for vaccination for seafarers must also be addressed, the statement said.Vaccine passports being considered by some states pose a potential barrier to crew change as seafarers from developing nations are unlikely to have an opportunity to receive vaccines until July at the earliest, it added.“The crew change crisis is not resolved but has reached a situation where it has been more manageable. However, there is great concern over the increased travel restrictions being imposed by governments in response to new variants. Seafarers must be designated as keyworkers. The crisis is still ongoing, and we will not let up our efforts. Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers,” said Guy Platten, Secretary-General ICS.Stephen Cotton, ITF General Secretary said: “The stark reality is that only a few handfuls of countries have treated seafarers with the respect they deserve by designating them real key worker status. Unless government’s move from the protectionist positions that they’ve been in for over 12 months now, and allow seafarers genuine free movement and prioritization for vaccinations sadly the situation could easily spiral out of control yet again.”ICS is one of the principal international trade associations for merchant shipowners and operators, representing all sectors and trades and over 80 per cent of the world merchant fleet.The ITF is a global union federation of nearly 700 transport workers trade unions representing 20 million workers, 216 of which represent over 650,000 seafarers spread across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maritime-bodies-say-over-2-lakh-seafarers-impacted-globally-by-covid-19-restrictions-101616158881920.html
19-03-2021||World||Taliban expect US withdrawal from Afghanistan, vow to restore Islamic rule||The Taliban warned Washington on Friday against defying a May 1 deadline for the withdrawal of American and NATO troops from Afghanistan, promising a “reaction," which could mean increased attacks by the insurgent group.The Taliban issued their warning at a press conference in Moscow, the day after meeting with senior Afghan government negotiators and international observers to try to jumpstart a stalled peace process to end Afghanistan's decades of war.President Joe Biden's administration says it is reviewing an agreement the Taliban signed with the Trump administration. Biden told ABC in an interview Wednesday that the May 1 deadline “could happen, but it is tough,” adding that if the deadline is extended it won’t be by “a lot longer.”“They should go,” Suhail Shaheen, a member of the Taliban negotiation team, told reporters, warning that staying beyond May 1 would breach the deal. “After that, it will be a kind of violation of the agreement. That violation would not be from our side. . . Their violation will have a reaction.”He did not elaborate on what form the “reaction” would take, but in keeping with the agreement they signed in February 2020, the Taliban have not attacked US or NATO forces, even as unclaimed bombings and targeted killings have spiked in recent months.“We hope that this will not happen, that they withdraw and we focus on the settlement, peaceful settlement of the Afghan issue, in order to bring about a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire at the end of reaching a political roadmap (for) Afghanistan,” Shaheen said.He also reaffirmed that the Taliban were firm on their demand for an Islamic government. Shaheen didn't elaborate on what an Islamic government would look like or whether it would mean a return to their repressive rules that denied girls education, barred women from working, and imposed harsh punishments.Shaheen did not say whether the Taliban would accept elections, but he emphasized that the government of President Ashraf Ghani would not fit their definition of an Islamic government.In previous statements, the Taliban have said their vision of an Islamic government would allow girls to attend school, and women to work or be in public life. But in every conversation, they emphasized the need to follow Islamic injunctions without specifying what that would mean.They have said they would not accept a woman as president, and while women could be judges they could not take the job of the Chief Justice.But even without the Taliban in government in Afghanistan, The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security Afghanistan said Afghanistan was one of the worst places in the world to be a woman in 2020.Only one woman attended Thursday's talks in Moscow, and in the two decades since the Taliban were ousted, successive governments in Kabul have been unable to ratify a law outlawing violence against women.Meanwhile, the Taliban refused to promise they would not launch a spring offensive despite calls from the United States, Russia and China.“I started Jihad (holy war) to remove foreign forces from my country and establish an Islamic government and Jihad will continue until we reach that goal through a political agreement,” said Khairullah Khairkhwa, a member of the negotiating team, who was one of five Taliban freed from U.S. prison on Guantanamo Bay in 2013 in exchange for the release of a captured U.S. soldier.Washington has been at war in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks masterminded by al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden who was based in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The invasion toppled the Taliban regime but the 20-year-war has made Afghanistan America’s longest conflict.The Taliban, who during their rule imposed a harsh brand of Islam, now control about half of the country. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that the insurgents could make even more gains without US and NATO troops on the ground.The Moscow conference was attended by US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, Abdullah Abdullah, head of Afghanistan’s National Reconciliation Council, and Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who led a 10-member delegation. Representatives of Pakistan, Iran, India and China also participated.In a statement issued after the talks, Russia, the US, China and Pakistan called on the warring parties to reduce the level of violence in the country — and specifically urged the Taliban not to pursue a spring offensive.The joint statement emphasized that the four countries do not support the restoration of an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan similar to the Taliban's past rule.Shaheen emphasized that the Taliban would stick to the goal of building an Islamic state. He argued that the Afghans themselves should determine their government order without outside meddling. He added that the talks in Doha should help determine the future governance structure.The talks in Qatar between the Afghan government and the Taliban have stalled, but Russia voiced hope that the talks in Moscow could help reinvigorate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-expect-us-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-vow-to-restore-islamic-rule-101616158916293.html
19-03-2021||World||Germany gripped by ‘third wave’ as EU tackles vaccination woes||Germany’s health minister warned that the country is in the grip of a “third wave” of rising coronavirus cases as Europe tries to get its stalled vaccination program back on track.“The numbers are rising, the share of mutations is large and there are some fairly challenging weeks ahead of us,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday at a news conference in Berlin, adding that there isn’t enough vaccine supply in Europe at the moment to halt the surge.Germany and other European Union countries are trying to reset their inoculation campaigns after a chaotic week of suspensions, health scares and export-ban threats. Countries across the bloc on Friday resumed using AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine after temporarily suspending it to investigate a possible blood-clot issue. But while the European Medicines Agency has cleared the shot for use, worries among citizens may linger.Further muddying the waters, France’s public-health agency on Friday recommended that the Astra vaccine should only be given to people aged 55 and older, as cases of clotting occurred mostly with people younger than that. The government in Paris said it would follow the agency’s advice.The stubbornly high infection rate in Germany -- mirroring the situation across the continent from France to Italy and the Czech Republic -- raises the prospect that lockdown restrictions in Europe’s largest economy may be prolonged into next month or even sharpened, and a cautious reopening announced at the start of the month delayed.Germany’s coronavirus cases rose by the most in two months in the 24 hours through Friday morning, days before Chancellor Angela Merkel hosts talks to decide on the next steps in the country’s strategy to contain the virus.The seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people continued to climb, rising to 95.6, the highest in more than a month and close to the threshold at which Merkel and regional officials agreed to reimpose restrictions.Under the guidelines, curbs should be reinstated if the local incidence rate rises above 100 for three consecutive days, although several cities and regions have chosen to disregard the so-called “emergency brake.”It will take “some weeks” for people most at risk to be fully inoculated, even if promised deliveries arrive on schedule, and only then can there be a discussion about lifting restrictions, Spahn warned.Merkel and regional leaders are due to hold their next round of talks on Monday. Remaining lockdown restrictions -- including the closing of non-essential stores, hotels, restaurants and gyms, as well as cultural venues -- are due to expire on March 28.Karl Lauterbach, a lawmaker for the ruling Social Democrats who is a trained epidemiologist, said the recent rise in cases makes stricter curbs inevitable. “It doesn’t make any sense to wait,” Lauterbach said at the news conference alongside Spahn.He urged Germans to avoid travel over the Easter vacation, saying it would inevitably “fire the third wave” and make it much harder to get the virus under control.An increasing number of Germans would support a tightening of the lockdown, an opinion poll published Thursday suggested. Among 1,207 people surveyed by infratest dimap for ARD, 32% said the current curbs are not stringent enough, 12 percentage points more than at the start of this month. The share that said they think the restrictions are adequate fell to 38% from 47%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-gripped-by-third-wave-as-eu-tackles-vaccination-woes-101616157956229.html
19-03-2021||World||Myanmar junta chokes information flow as anti-coup protests intensify||Two more journalists were detained in Myanmar on Friday, part of the junta’s intensifying efforts to choke off information about resistance to last month’s coup.Mizzima News reported that one of its former reporters, Than Htike Aung, and Aung Thura, a journalist from the BBC’s Burmese-language service, were detained by men who appeared to be plainclothes security agents outside a court in the capital of Naypyitaw. The journalists were there to cover legal proceedings against Win Htein, a detained senior official from the National League for Democracy, the party that ran the country before the takeover.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. In the face of persistent strikes and protests against the takeover, the junta has responded with an increasingly violent crackdown and efforts to severely limit information reaching the outside world. Security forces have fired on crowds, killing hundreds, internet access has been severely restricted, private newspapers have been barred from publishing, and protesters, journalists and politicians have been arrested in large numbers.About 40 journalists have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup, with roughly half still in detention, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press.A statement from the BBC said it is “extremely concerned” that Aung Thura had been taken away by unidentified men.“The BBC takes the safety of all its staff in Myanmar very seriously and we are doing everything we can to find Aung Thura,” the organization said, adding that he was an accredited journalist with many years of reporting experience. It called on the authorities “to help locate him and confirm that he is safe.”The reporters were taken into custody a day after Kyi Toe, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy, was arrested, according to a Facebook post by Phyo Zeya Thaw, a party official.Kyi Toe had been a major source of information in the early days following the Feb. 1 coup, after the ousted civilian government's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior officials were detained. The takeover came the same day that newly elected lawmakers were supposed to take take their seats in Parliament.Amid a crackdown on the press, no privately owned newspapers were published this past week for the first time in eight years, following bans and voluntary suspensions. The military government also has banned at least five local news organizations from disseminating information on any platform, but its orders were mostly ignored.Restrictions on the internet have also been in place since shortly after the coup, including a blockage of mobile internet access. Broadband Wi-Fi service remains available, though spotty.Despite a crackdown that has killed more than 200 demonstrators so far, protesters were back in the streets Friday morning in several cities and towns. Some rallies proceeded without violence, but in Aungban town in eastern Shan state, online Tachileik News Agency reported that at least seven people were injured when security forces sought to break up their march using tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition.Eleven News, a major media group in Myanmar, reported on Twitter that seven people had been killed in Aungban, but that death toll could not immediately be confirmed, though photos of at least one of the victims were posted on social media.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported that as of Thursday, it had verified 224 killings linked to the coup’s aftermath, more than half of them in Yangon, the biggest city. It said 2,258 people have been arrested or charged, with 1,938 still detained or evading arrest.Despite the violence, Myanmar's neighbors have so far been tentative in their response. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo issued a strong statements on Friday, urging a halt to violence and asking other regional leaders to hold a summit on the crisis.“Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately to avoid more victims. The safety and welfare of the people must be a top priority,” Widodo said in a televised address. “Indonesia also urges dialogue and reconciliation to be carried out immediately to restore democracy, peace and stability in Myanmar."Widodo, the leader of Southeast Asia’s largest economy, said that he will immediately speak with Brunei, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to set up a meeting of leaders of its 10 member countries.Widodo’s move came after ASEAN foreign ministers held a March 2 meeting at which they reached no consensus on the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-chokes-information-flow-as-anti-coup-protests-intensify-101616157857143.html
19-03-2021||World||China rebukes LinkedIn for failing to control political content: Report||It seems Microsoft's professional networking site LinkedIn is in hot water in China as the country's internet regulator has rebuked the executive of the company this month for failing to control political content, The New York Times reported.LinkedIn has been the lone major American social network allowed to operate in China. The Microsoft-owned service for professionals censors the posts made by its millions of Chinese users.But it is not clear what material got the company into trouble. The regulator said it had found objectionable posts circulating in the period around an annual meeting of China's lawmakers, The New York Times reported citing people, who have been briefed on the matter.As a punishment, the people said, officials are requiring LinkedIn to perform a self-evaluation and offer a report to the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator.The service was also forced to suspend new sign-ups of users inside China for 30 days, one of the people added, though that period could change depending on the administration's judgment.The Cyberspace Administration of China did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.Last week, Microsoft's professional networking site LinkedIn said it is pausing new member registrations in China as the company works to ensure it remains in compliance with local law.China is known to heavily regulate and censor domestic internet usage and actively block any websites or links that are seen as going against the narrative of the communist party.The country has the world's most sophisticated censorship system known as the 'Great Firewall'. The Chinese government controls the media through techniques including blocking IP addresses, DNS attacks and filtering specific URLs and keywords within URLs, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).According to an SCMP article in November, over the years, the number of websites blocked in China has ballooned to 10,000.The blacklist includes social networks like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp; news outlets like Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times; and popular collaboration tools such as Dropbox and Google Drive (or anything else on Google).In 2016, Freedom House ranked China last for the second consecutive year out of 65 countries that represent 88 per cent of the world's internet users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rebukes-linkedin-for-failing-to-control-political-content-report-101616156957865.html
19-03-2021||World||Medical workers conflicted by France's lockdown that isn't||When nurse Anaelle Aeschliman started her 12-hour night shift caring for unconscious patients with COVID-19, the French prime minister was announcing new restrictions to combat the resurgent coronavirus epidemic in Paris.She was not impressed. The 26-year-old had been hoping for a full nationwide lockdown to slow the streams of gravely ill patients filling ICUs like hers, in the west of Paris.Instead, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced a mishmash of measures — including closures of nonessential shops — that are mostly limited to Paris and northern France and don't oblige people to spend most of the day indoors. Announced Thursday night, they take effect on Friday night, when Aeschliman will be back in the ICU, for another 12-hour shift."Locking down region by region isn’t enough. I think it’s a sanitary suicide,” she said Friday morning, as she went home for a shower and some sleep after working through the night.“I admit I was a bit disappointed that we aren’t being locked down nationwide," she said. "When you look at the numbers, they’re unsustainable, and it is going to become ever-harder as the virus continues to circulate.”In March 2020, when France first locked down with some of the toughest restrictions in Europe, the government exhorted people to stay home. This time, it is, in effect, urging them to go out and get some fresh air.People in the Paris region and in the north of the country covered by the new rules can walk as long as they like in a day, within a 10-kilometer (six-mile) radius of their homes and carrying a paper authorizing the stroll. Schools will remain open.The new measures affect about 21 million people in the country of 67 million. At the same time, however, a change in the nationwide curfew will give citizens an extra hour of freedom. It will start at 7 p.m. instead of the previous 6 p.m., and run until 6 a.m. Restaurants, bars, cinemas, gyms, museums, theaters and concert halls have been shut for almost five months.For Pierre Squara, the doctor in charge Friday at the ICU unit of the Ambroise Paré private hospital where Aeschliman also works, encouraging people to leave their Paris apartments makes sense, especially with spring around the corner.“Now that good weather is coming and people will be able to go outside, it will disperse the virus a bit more,” he said. "It is better to be outside than to be four people in an apartment of 25 square meters. Because Paris apartments are small.”Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said the government had sought to draw conclusions from better scientific knowledge of the virus and from France’s two previous lockdowns in spring and autumn.“Everything we can do outside, we need to do it outside,” he told RTL radio.Attal urged people to limit social interactions, keep wearing masks outdoors and limit gatherings to six people maximum.As the measures apply for at least four weeks and travel between regions will be forbidden without a compelling reason, many people were rushing on Friday to Paris train stations to leave for other less-affected regions.French authorities also announced that the country is resuming shots with the vaccine made by AstraZeneca on Friday. Castex was to be vaccinated in the afternoon, aiming to show “confidence” in the product.France on Thursday reported about 35,000 new confirmed infections in 24 hours nationwide, numbers that have steadily increased in recent weeks. The variant first identified in the UK accounts for most infections, and around 250 people are dying each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-workers-conflicted-by-france-s-lockdown-that-isnt-101616155462092.html
19-03-2021||World||US states throw open vaccine eligibility before May 1 goal||A dozen US states are expanding access to Covid vaccinations earlier than planned for every adult, accelerating the biggest such campaign in the country’s history and making long strides toward President Joe Biden’s May 1 deadline for eligibility.Biden set the timeline last week, and since then officials have announced strategies to beat his deadline in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Nevada, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois and Utah. Others plan to move ahead with certain groups earlier than expected, such as Wisconsin, which will make more than a million people with underlying conditions eligible for vaccinations next week.The US has suffered from the pandemic more than other developed countries, with almost 539,000 dead after a disjointed response under former President Donald Trump. But the nation amassed a huge trove of vaccines that the current administration is pushing out as fast as possible.Biden has set goals for the campaign that so far have been easily met. He said the US on Friday will clinch his goal of administering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots in the first 100 days of his presidency, reaching the mark six weeks ahead of time. The state measures mean the nation likely will hit his May 1 mark. Biden has said the country could be almost back to normal by the July 4 holiday.Betsy Chilton, 29, of Sioux City, Iowa said she’s looking forward to getting the vaccine now that eligibility will be expanded.“Being a young, relatively healthy person, I’m definitely last in line, which is totally OK,” she said. “But we all have people that we care about that are elderly or in some way at risk. I want to be able to be around my grandparents and not be worried.”The federal government has promised states an increased vaccine supply in coming weeks. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said on Twitter that supply allowed for a “quicker schedule than originally planned.”The pace of vaccination has increased dramatically over the past two months, jumping from an average of about 800,000 doses a day in mid-January to 2.5 million doses a day this week, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. On Thursday, Americans were up to 2.7 million shots.The gains aren’t yet equitable. The inoculation campaign has reached a little more than 20% of the country, but not a single state has protected that share of its Black or Hispanic populations, according to a Bloomberg demographic analysis.And opening eligibility doesn’t necessarily mean administration is going efficiently, said Ajay Sethi, an associate professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. In some cases, states are reaching the limits of vaccine acceptance.For those still waiting to get it, he said, just knowing they’re eligible can make an emotional difference. “Sometimes people feel better standing in line than not having any line at all,” Sethi said Thursday. “Once a few states do it, other states decide to do it as well, especially if leaders are finding that they don’t want to hit the wall, they want to keep the momentum, they might as well open up the eligibility criteria.”Flood ForecastIn Iowa, which took a laissez-faire stance on pandemic safety rules, all adults will be eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19 during the week of April 5, Governor Kim Reynolds said this week.But she cautioned that the projections could change. “Right now, if we’re able to ramp up in a manner they’re projecting and we’re ready to go, it’ll be good news for Iowans,” she said.Large expansions of supply and eligibility will test states’ abilities to deliver shots. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had previously complained of vaccine shortages, called it a “logistical nightmare” on a briefing call Wednesday.“The Biden administration did a great job of securing more vaccines, but the allocation to the state increases dramatically in a very short period of time,” he said. “So we’re going to have to do millions and millions of doses.”That’s leaving aside stagnation of demand. In Mississippi, which expanded access to all adults on Tuesday, officials at a news conference pushed the hesitant to get shots. They acknowledged that not everyone in priority groups had been fully vaccinated.“We still have a long way to go,” said Paul Byers, state epidemiologist at the Mississippi Department of Health. “But our vaccine allocations are increasing. I think the time is right for us to continue to open it up and utilize that vaccine moving forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-throw-open-vaccine-eligibility-before-may-1-goal-101616154687503.html
19-03-2021||World||Finland defends title as world’s happiest nation in 4th straight win||Finland defended its title as the world’s happiest country through a year marked by the pandemic, with people’s trust in each other and their government proving a key factor.It’s the fourth straight trophy for the Nordic country in the World Happiness Report 2021 published on Friday by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.As the pandemic turned 2020 on its head, the report provided two rankings: the usual one based on the average of three years of surveys taken in 2018-2020 by Gallup, and another focused on 2020 alone to help understand the outbreak’s effect on subjective well-being -- and how factors contributing to well-being affected pandemic outcomes.Trust was the key factor linking happiness and successful Covid-19 strategies, where societies with higher confidence in public institutions and greater income equality were the more successful in fighting the virus.Finland has so far weathered the pandemic better than most countries, avoiding lockdowns that reduced life satisfaction across the globe. Hospitals haven’t been overwhelmed and it’s managed to keep deaths below 150 per 1 million people, compared with the global average of about 980. Denmark, which came in second, has also weathered the pandemic relatively well.The U.S. dropped one place to number 19, five spots behind Canada and three below developing country Costa Rica, while people in Afghanistan remained the least happy.The two ranking methods used this time show that changes in the overall scores were modest, “reflecting both the global nature of the pandemic and a widely shared resilience in the face of it.”For example, the top 10 in the two methods used shared nine nations: Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and Austria.“We must aim for well-being rather than mere wealth, which will be fleeting indeed if we don’t do a much better job of addressing the challenges of sustainable development,” said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. “The pandemic reminds us of our global environmental threats, the urgent need to cooperate, and the difficulties of achieving cooperation in each country and globally. We need urgently to learn from Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-defends-title-as-world-s-happiest-nation-in-4th-straight-win-101616155225117.html
19-03-2021||World||Hospitals in Syria's capital full with coronavirus patients||Intensive care units in public hospitals in the Syrian capital Damascus have reached full capacity due to a sharp rise of coronavirus infections, leading doctors to transfer patients to hospitals in other provinces, the health ministry said late Thursday.The announcement was a rare public acknowledgment of the severity of the outbreak in Syria, which has been ravaged by a decade of conflict that had major effects on the medical sector.Syria has reported a rise in infections in recent weeks that included President Bashar Assad and his wife Asma who are currently recovering, according to the president's office.Syria reported 149 new cases on Thursday, raising the total of registered infections in the country to 16,925, including 1,130 deaths since the first case was reported in March last year.The number is believed to be much higher as most Syrians cannot afford to have a PCR test. Syria is in a deep economic crisis, as the war has left more than 80 per cent of the population below the poverty level.A test at a private hospital or clinic costs 126,500 Syrians pounds — about USD 28 at the black market rate — at a time when most monthly incomes in Syria are less than USD 100.The head of the emergency department at the health ministry, Toufic Hasaba, told state news agency SANA that intensive care units in Damascus' four state-run hospitals are full and those in need were taken to hospitals in other provinces earlier this week.Hasaba urged people to take precautionary measures including wearing masks, social distancing and sanitization.The health ministry said that coronavirus cases have shot up over the past two weeks, but did not give a reason.The pandemic, which has severely tested even developed countries, has been a major challenge for Syria's health care sector, already depleted by years of conflict that killed more than half a million and displaced half the country's pre-war population of 23 million.Syria began a vaccination campaign earlier this month, but no details have been given about the process. The health minister said the government procured the vaccines from a friendly country, which he declined to name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitals-in-syria-s-capital-full-with-coronavirus-patients-101616153900682.html
19-03-2021||World||Tesla cars banned by China's military on concerns about cameras||Tesla Inc. cars have been banned from Chinese military complexes and housing compounds because of concerns about sensitive data being collected by cameras built into the vehicles.The order, issued by the military, advises Tesla owners to park their cars outside of military property, according to people familiar with the directive who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The ban, relayed to residents of military housing this week, was triggered by concerns that the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data via the cars’ in-built cameras in a way the Chinese government can’t see or control, one of the people said.Images of what was purported to be a notice about the ban were also circulating on Chinese social media. Multi-direction cameras and ultrasonic sensors in Tesla cars may “expose locations” and the vehicles are being barred from military residences to ensure the safety of confidential military information, the notice said.A representative for Tesla in China declined to comment on the military’s move. China’s Defense Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a fax sent after after business hours.Tesla, like many other automakers including General Motors Co., uses several small cameras, mainly located on the outside of the vehicle, to help guide parking, autopilot and self-driving functions. Most Tesla models also have an interior camera mounted above the rear view mirror that can be used to detect whether a driver is looking at the road, looking down at their lap, wearing sunglasses, or looking at something else entirely.Internal CameraThe California-based company -- which produces Model 3s and Model Y SUV crossovers at a Gigafactory near Shanghai -- hasn’t shied away from that fact, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeting in April 2019 that the internal camera is there “for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft and people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet.”“In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video,” Musk explained.Since then, Tesla has started using cars’ internal cameras to monitor what it calls FSD (full self driving) beta testers, or Tesla owners who have volunteered to test out the company’s driver-assist capabilities.Earlier this month, Musk tweeted that the company’s FSD beta trial had been expanded to around 2,000 owners but Tesla had also “revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road.” Musk said the next significant release of FSD beta would be in April.Concern over this program contributed to the ban by the military, one of the people said.None of the in-car cameras in Teslas sold in China are turned on or part of the FSD beta trial, the Tesla representative said. Tesla’s privacy policies comply with national laws and local regulations in China, they said.China ApologyChina, the world’s biggest market for EVs, is key to Musk’s global growth ambitions. The carmaker received significant support from the state to build the factory near Shanghai, its first outside of the U.S., and Musk’s strategy has been one of deference to the government, in contrast to his more combative approach in the U.S.Recently, though, the tone seems to have shifted. Tesla was called in by Chinese regulators over quality and safety issues with its cars, including battery fires and abnormal acceleration. The automaker was also forced into issuing a public apology to China’s state grid in early February after a video purportedly showed staff blaming an overload in the national electricity network for damage to a customer’s vehicle.This isn’t the first time Tesla has found itself at the center of controversy over the use of cameras. Last week, a group of hackers said they breached a trove of security-camera data collected by Silicon Valley startup Verkada Inc., gaining access to many different types of footage, including some from inside a Tesla warehouse in Shanghai.The hackers said they obtained access to 222 cameras in Tesla factories and warehouses and that the data breach was carried out to show the pervasiveness of video surveillance and the ease with which systems could be broken into. Tesla China told Bloomberg it was one of its suppliers that had been hacked, and that data from the Chinese Gigafactory is stored in secure local servers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-cars-banned-by-china-s-military-on-concerns-about-cameras-101616154099516.html
19-03-2021||World||Joe Biden says US to hit 100 million Coovid-19 vaccinations goal on Friday||With the US closing in on President Joe Biden's goal of injecting 100 million coronavirus vaccinations weeks ahead of his target date, the White House said the nation is now in position to help supply neighbors Canada and Mexico with millions of lifesaving shots.The Biden administration on Thursday revealed the outlines of a plan to “loan” a limited number of vaccines to Canada and Mexico as the president announced the U.S. is on the cusp of meeting his 100-day injection goal “way ahead of schedule.”“ I’m proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met our goal," Biden said. He promised to unveil a new vaccination target next week, as the U.S. is on pace to have enough of the three currently authorized vaccines to cover the entire adult population just 10 weeks from now.Ahead of Biden's remarks, the White House said it was finalizing plans to send a combined 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to Mexico and Canada in its first export of shots. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the details of the “loan" were still being worked out, but 2.5 million doses would go to Mexico and 1.5 million would be sent to Canada.“Our first priority remains vaccinating the U.S. population,” Psaki said. But she added that “ensuring our neighbors can contain the virus is a mission critical step, is mission critical to ending the pandemic.”The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been authorized for use in the U.S. but has been by the World Health Organization. Tens of millions of doses have been stockpiled in the U.S., waiting for emergency use authorization, and that has sparked an international outcry that lifesaving vaccine is being withheld when it could be used elsewhere. The White House said just 7 million of the AstraZeneca doses are ready for shipment.The initial run of doses manufactured in the U.S. are owned by the federal government under the terms of agreements reached with drugmakers, and the Biden administration has faced calls from allies across the globe to release the AstraZeneca shots for immediate use. Biden has also fielded direct requests from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to buy vaccines produced in the United States.Global public health advocates say wealthy nations like the U.S. need to do far more to help stem the spread of the pandemic. The World Health Organization on Thursday issued a report that fewer than 7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Africa thus far. That's the equivalent of what the U.S. administers in a matter of days.Biden did move to have the U.S. contribute financially to the United Nations- and World Health Organization-backed COVAX alliance, which will share vaccine with more than 90 lower- and middle-income nations, but the U.S. has yet to commit to sharing any doses.From his first days in office, Biden has set clear — and achievable — metrics for U.S. success, whether they be vaccinations or school reopenings, as part of an apparent strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration's sometimes-fanciful rhetoric on the virus.The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the U.S. had even one authorized vaccine for COVID-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.By the time Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the U.S. had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Biden's goal was not ambitious enough. He quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.Now the U.S. is injecting an average of about 2.2 million doses each day — and the pace is likely to dramatically rise later this month in conjunction with an expected surge in supply of the vaccines.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, injections of 96 million doses have been reported to the agency since Biden’s inauguration, but those reports lag the actual date of administration. Vaccination trend lines pointed to Biden breaking the 100 million mark on Thursday, with the numbers likely to be confirmed by the CDC as soon as Friday.The president has moved to speed up deliveries of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, as well as to expand the number of places to get shots and people who can administer them, with a focus on increasing the nation's capacity to inject doses as supply constraints lift.The risk in setting too rosy expectations is that an administration might become defined by its failure to meet them, such as in May 2020, when President Donald Trump said the nation had “prevailed” over the virus.At the time, the country had seen about 80,000 deaths from the virus. This week, the U.S. death toll topped 538,000. Trump’s lax approach and lack of credibility also contributed to poor adherence to public safety rules among the American public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-to-hit-100-million-coovid-19-vaccinations-goal-on-friday-101616152998916.html
19-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Germany warns of 'exponential' virus spread||Coronavirus cases in Germany are rising at a "very clearly exponential rate", a top public health institute said Friday, as the EU's biggest country debated tightening a shutdown.The vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, Lars Schaade, told reporters that highly contagious virus variants were getting the upper hand, wiping out progress seen last month in containing the pandemic."It is very possible that we will have a similar situation over Easter to the one we had before Christmas, with very high case numbers, many severe cases and deaths, and hospitals that are overwhelmed".The RKI on Friday reported 17,482 new infections in the previous 24 hours and 226 deaths in Germany, with the seven-day incidence rate soaring to 96 per 100,000 people despite a months-long shutdown of large swathes of public life.German leaders agreed earlier this month to impose new restrictions in regions where the seven-day incidence rate surpassed 100.The country's second city of Hamburg said it would pull the "emergency brake" from Saturday after exceeding the 100-mark three days in a row. Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, also crossed the benchmark on Friday."We are in the third wave of the pandemic, the numbers are rising, the percentage of virus mutations is high," Health Minister Jens Spahn told the news conference.Spahn, who this week faced growing calls to resign amid frustration with the government's pandemic management, called on Germans to refrain from spring break travel to help curb infections.The grim news came as Germany resumed administering AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jabs after the European regulator EMA assessed it was "safe and effective" to use.'Short, sharp' restrictionsAmid a widely criticised sluggish vaccination campaign, Germany decided on Monday, along with most EU governments, to suspend the use of the vaccine for the EMA to examine a handful of cases of cerebral vein thrombosis that emerged.Doctors will now have to inform patients about the possible blood clotting risk before giving them the jabs.Critics had complained that the decision to halt the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine over the last days only served to fuel mistrust over the jabs and further delay Germany's inoculation programme.By Thursday, only 3.8 per cent of the German population was reported fully immunised.Spahn said the resumption of the AstraZeneca vaccinations combined with expected new arrivals of jabs from other manufacturers in April should speed up the German campaign.But he admitted that "an honest analysis of the situation shows that there aren't enough vaccines in Europe to stop the third wave with vaccination alone".He said it would take several weeks before even those in the highest risk groups were fully inoculated and warned that the country should brace for an extension of current restrictions.German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet with the country's 16 state leaders on Monday to set new shutdown rules based on the latest pandemic developments.Karl Lauterbach, a public health expert from the Social Democrats, junior partners in the government, said there was, for now, no alternative to keeping restaurants, most shops and entertainment venues closed."You can look at it any way you want, we have to go back to lockdown," he said, calling for "short, sharp" restrictions. "The sooner we react, the shorter the lockdown will need to be."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-germany-warns-of-exponential-virus-spread-101616152950093.html
19-03-2021||World||Twitter's 'Birdwatch' crowd experiment courts familiar challenges||In January, just weeks after Twitter Inc permanently banned former President Donald Trump following the storming of the US Capitol, the social media company started asking US users to help identify and fact-check misleading tweets in a new pilot program.But Birdwatch, which has about 2,000 participants and is currently cordoned off in its own section of the site, is already facing many of the same challenges as Twitter itself -discerning facts from partisan opinion and dealing with the potential for harassment or people trying to manipulate the system."There's a lot to do to get there, to the point where we're comfortable putting these things on tweets," Keith Coleman, Twitter's vice president of product, told Reuters."Birdwatchers" can flag misleading tweets and annotate them with "notes" to give more information, which other participants can rate as helpful.Under pressure to clean up its site, Twitter started labeling misleading tweets for the first time last year, a move that intensified debates about the role major social media platforms play in public discourse. It also fueled allegations from Republican lawmakers that tech companies are censoring conservatives.In asking users to contribute their own checks, Twitter will have to balance curating Birdwatch to make it useful without losing the legitimacy it wanted from relying on its community.Public Birdwatch data shows notes ranging from balanced fact-checks to partisan criticism. For example, some marked the baseless claim of widespread voter fraud in November's US presidential election "not misleading." Many simply gave opinions - a tweet from SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk should "go to Mars. And stay there" - while others added notes to opinions.People are "fact-checking things that professional fact checkers never would," said Alex Mahadevan, a reporter with the Poynter Institute's MediaWise project, who analyzed Birdwatch's data.Coleman said the Twitter team's next move would be updating the rating algorithm that determines which notes to highlight to make sure Birdwatchers with different views agree the information is helpful."It's totally fine that there's a mixture of quality on the input; what will matter is the quality of the output," he said.Wisdom of CrowdsCrowd-sourced knowledge and community moderation are not new models: they underpin platforms like social network Reddit Inc, and Facebook Inc also runs a "community review" program in which users are paid to identify suspect content for vetting by professional fact-checkers. Thomson Reuters Corp-owned Reuters is one of Facebook's paid third-party fact-checkers.One of the most prominent examples of a crowd-based approach is Wikipedia, where volunteers write and edit millions of articles.Katherine Maher, CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia, said in an interview that the community's mission to build an encyclopedia - making it what she called a "purpose platform" rather than "an expression platform" - defines how contributors behave and that Twitter, which has a more diffuse purpose, could be more difficult to wrangle.Borrowing methods from how Wikipedia promotes and rewards credible contributions could help, Maher said. Public editors on Wikipedia are granted greater controls by other users, based on their work.Twitter's Coleman said the company was working on how to build reputational scores for Birdwatchers, based on whether a range of people find their contributions helpful.Maher also said Twitter would need to develop standards and their enforcement for Birdwatch and decide how people could appeal annotation. It needs to solve the issue, she said, of "Who watches the watchers?"BirdwatchersTravis Whitfill, a healthcare researcher and biopharma venture capitalist in Dallas, Texas, said he joined the Birdwatch program as a way to correct medical and Covid-19 misinformation.Wesley Miller, a 47-year-old research analyst, joined the pilot after briefly quitting Twitter last year in protest at the company's lack of action against Trump.Jeffery Johnson, a 19-year-old conservative college freshman in Bentonville, Arkansas, said he joined partly as a joke but liked the idea of users rather than Twitter deciding on the truth.Researchers said it was hard to tell if the program would attract mission-driven volunteers, zealots with agendas or bad actors in the future if it rolls out more broadly.To help guide Birdwatch's development, Twitter said it is creating an advisory council of outside experts with backgrounds ranging from crowdsourcing to political science.The company has also acknowledged it will have to work out how to prevent its unpaid Birdwatchers from being harassed for their notes.Coleman said it was considering options like removing people's Twitter handles from their annotations and working out whether there would be extra rules for Birdwatch content. Contributors also will be allowed to use pseudonym accounts to protect their identities."We don't know what will happen and whether people will feel safe," said Coleman. "It's really critical they do."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitters-birdwatch-crowd-experiment-courts-familiar-challenges-101616152180536.html

19-03-2021||World||Covid-19 transmission on flight from New Delhi, in hotel corridor, finds New Zealand study||The transmission of coronavirus occurred on an international flight, in a hotel corridor, and then to household contacts despite the efforts taken by authorities to isolate and quarantine patients, New Zealand researchers have found. In a study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, the researchers identified a multibranched chain of transmission of coronavirus among nine patients, including a probable case of aerosol transmission without direct person-to-person contact.A cohort of 149 repatriated New Zealand citizens or permanent residents, without any pre-departure testing, travelled from New Delhi to Christchurch on August 26, 2020, on a Boeing 747 chartered flight via Nadi, Fiji, the researchers reported. While several passengers remained in Fiji, others arrived in Christchurch and were put under managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days.Out of all the passengers who arrived in Christchurch on the chartered flight, eight showed positive results for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Three of the case-patients were shown to be genomically linked and have been denoted in the study as case-patients A, B, and C. During the first flight from New Delhi to Nadi, with around 35% occupancy, as per the study, all passengers were evenly spaced throughout the aircraft and case-patients A, B, and C sat within two rows of each other.Patients A and B tested positive for Covid-19 on August 30, and patient C experienced symptoms on September 6 and tested positive on September 8. The researchers noted that the timing of patient C experiencing symptoms was consistent with transmission by patient A or B during the flight from India to New Zealand.“Case-patients A or B might have been infected during or before the flight from a common source...the passengers in question did not travel together and did not know each other,” they wrote, highlighting that infection prevention measures were followed by the flight crew and passengers were required to wear facemasks for the duration of the flight.The researchers then found evidence of transmission in the MIQ facility, which was a repurposed commercial hotel and each room with its own bathroom and no balconies. Patient C tested positive on day 12 of the mandatory quarantine period and was relocated to the isolation section of the facility.Before patient C’s relocation, an adult and infant child, both of whom had returned from India on the same flight, were quarantined in the adjacent room. The adult and the child completed their 14-day quarantine and tested negative for Covid-19 twice. However, the duo, denoted in the study as case-patients D and E, later showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 while in the community.“We consider that these 2 case-patients were infected while in MIQ,” the researcher said.According to the study, the researchers reviewed closed-circuit television footages between the arrival of patients C, D, and E and the transfer of patient C to the isolation section. The researchers said that there were no instances where the 3 persons were outside of their rooms at the same time.However, during the routine testing within the doorway of hotel rooms on day 12, there was a 50-second window between closing the door to the room of case-patient C and opening the door to the room of case-patients D and E, said the researchers.“Therefore, we hypothesized that suspended aerosol particles were the probable mode of transmission in this instance, and that the enclosed and unventilated space in the hotel corridor probably facilitated this event,” they added.After the mandatory quarantine and repeated negative results for Covid-19, some of the travellers were flown to Auckland on a chartered flight and met household contacts. Two of those contacts, with no recent history of travel outside New Zealand, became infected. The researchers said that they found a genomic link between coronavirus isolated from all nine case-patients.“These findings reinforce the need for rigorous border control processes for countries pursuing Covid-19 elimination, as well as real-time integration of genomic and epidemiologic data to inform outbreak investigations,” they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-transmission-on-flight-from-new-delhi-in-hotel-corridor-study-101616150033499.html

Critics have derided that explanation.One protester was killed in the northeastern town of Loikaw, the Myanmar Now news portal said, and there was some shooting in the main city of Yangon, but no word on casualties.Demonstrators were also out in the second city of Mandalay, the central towns of Myingyan and Katha, and Myawaddy in the east, witnesses and media reported.The total number killed in weeks of unrest has risen to at least 233, according to the latest report and a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.'NO MORE VICTIMS'Western countries have condemned the coup and called for an end to the violence and for Suu Kyi's release. Asian neighbours, led by Indonesia, have offered to help find a solution but a March 3 regional meeting failed to make headway.The 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has long held to the principle of not commenting on each other's internal affairs, but there are growing signs the Myanmar crisis is forcing a reassessment of that.In some of the strongest comments from a regional leader on the crackdown, Indonesian President Joko Widodo called for democracy to be restored and for the violence to stop."Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately so that there are no more victims," Jokowi, as he is known, said in a virtual address."The safety and welfare of the people must be the top priority. Indonesia also urges dialogue, that reconciliation is carried out immediately to restore democracy, to restore peace and to restore stability."Myanmar's coup leader, General Min Aung Hlaing, took part in a video conference with regional defence chiefs on Thursday, his first international engagement since seizing power, state television showed.At the meeting, the head of Indonesia's armed forces, Hadi Tjahjanto, expressed concern over the Myanmar situation, the Indonesian military said on its website. Indonesia's army ruled for years but eventually completely withdrew from politics.Singapore has also spoken out against the coup and the killing of protesters and its military chief, Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, said on Facebook he had expressed his "grave concern" at the meeting and urged Myanmar to avoid lethal force.REPORTERS DETAINEDIn Geneva, UN human rights experts denounced forced evictions, arbitrary detentions and the killings of protesters. They said foreign governments should consider pursuing those responsible for crimes against humanity.Ousted lawmakers were exploring whether the International Criminal Court can investigate crimes against humanity since the coup, Myanmar's U.N. envoy, who publicly broke with the junta, said in New York.Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi, 75, is being detained at an undisclosed location and faces accusations of bribery and other crimes that could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.The army has defended its takeover, saying its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election swept by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date.Information within Myanmar is becoming increasingly difficult to verify after authorities have restricted the internet services that protesters use to organise and report.The UN human rights office said this week about 37 journalists had been arrested and two more were detained in the capital, Naypyitaw, on Friday while covering a hearing for an arrested member of Suu Kyi's party, said the Mizzima news portal, the employer of one of them.The other detained reporter was Aung Thura of the British Broadcasting Corp (BBC), it said. The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-kill-9-protesters-as-indonesia-calls-for-end-to-violence-101616149046839.html
19-03-2021||World||Meet Indian-born blockchain entrepreneur Vignesh Sundaresan, the mystery buyer of $69 mn digital artwork||An Indian-born blockchain entrepreneur has revealed himself as the mystery buyer who paid a record $69.3 million for a digital artwork last week, describing his purchase as a shot fired for racial equality.Programmer Vignesh Sundaresan, who is based in Singapore, said in a blog post Thursday that he had purchased the most expensive digital artwork ever sold to "show Indians and people of color that they too could be patrons" of the arts.Around 22 million viewers tuned in to Christies.com on March 11 for the final moments of a bidding process that saw Sundaresan -- under the pseudonym Metakovan -- win the rights to digital artist Beeple's "Everydays: The First 5000 Days".Bidding for the virtual collage of 5,000 images -- the first purely digital NFT-based artwork ever sold by a major auction house -- had started at $100 before the price skyrocketed.An NFT, or a non-fungible token, uses the same blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies to turn anything from art to sports trading cards into virtual collector's items that cannot be duplicated.They have recently taken the art world by storm with many seeing them as an opportunity to monetise digital art of all kinds.These strings of virtual code offer wealthy collectors the bragging rights to ultimate ownership, even if the work can be endlessly shared and viewed online.Investors meanwhile see digital art as a new commodity to be traded."When you think of high-valued NFTs, this one is going to be pretty hard to beat," Sundaresan said anonymously via Christie's, shortly after winning the bid.In the detailed blog post Thursday, he credited his rise from an engineering student with "no money" to a millionaire serial entrepreneur to his discovery of cryptocurrencies in 2013."This is the crown jewel, the most valuable piece of art for this generation," Sundaresan said of the piece, that now ranks third among the most valuable artworks ever sold by a living artist, following works by Jeff Koons and David Hockney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meet-indian-born-blockchain-entrepreneur-vignesh-sundaresan-the-mystery-buyer-of-69-mn-digital-artwork-101616149238351.html
19-03-2021||World||Atlanta shooting: Biden, Harris to meet Asian-American leaders on Georgia visit||President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were planning to promote the newly enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package when they visited Georgia on Friday, but a deadly shooting rampage in the state has changed their plans.A 21-year-old man has been charged with murdering eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three spas in and around Atlanta on Tuesday, rattling Asian Americans already grappling with a rise in hate crimes directed at them since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Biden and Harris will meet community leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community to hear concerns about the killings and discuss a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Thursday.Investigators said the suspect, an Atlanta-area resident who is white, suggested that sexual frustration led him to commit violence. Numerous political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by rising anti-Asian sentiment.Biden has also directed White House officials Cedric Richmond and Susan Rice to engage with the community, Psaki said, and supports recent legislation calling for an expanded Justice Department review of COVID-19-related hate crimes.Given recent events, "the president and the vice president felt it was important to change the trip a little bit and offer their support and condemn the violence," a White House official said.Biden ordered the U.S. flag flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of Tuesday's shootings.The Democratic president kicked off the "Help is Here" campaign on Monday to promote his promise of "shots in arms and money in pockets," after signing the COVID-19 relief bill into law last week, which includes $1,400 stimulus payments to most Americans. Biden has visited Pennsylvania and Harris has been to Nevada and Colorado to tout the benefits of the relief package.Biden and Harris on Friday will also visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to receive an update on the pandemic.They plan to meet as well with Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, whose get-out-the vote efforts are widely credited with helping Biden carry the state last November and Democrats win two U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia this year that gave them control of the chamber.A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House of Representatives this month would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches.Republicans across the country are using former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity."Voting rights is something that is on the minds of everyone on that trip," the White House official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-shooting-biden-harris-to-meet-asian-american-leaders-on-georgia-visit-101616148459203.html
19-03-2021||World||Germany resumes AstraZeneca vaccinations days after clot scare||Germany resumed vaccinations with the coronavirus vaccine made by AstraZeneca on Friday, following a recommendation by European regulators that the benefits of the shot outweigh the risks.The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that the vaccine is safe but it can’t rule out a link to a small number of rare blood clots reported on the continent, and patients should be told to look out for any warning signs.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The move paved the way for more than a dozen European countries, which had suspended use of the shot over the past week, to begin using it again.Authorities in Berlin said two large vaccination centers that offer the AstraZeneca shot to people in the German capital will reopen Friday, and people whose appointments were canceled this week will be able to get the vaccine over the weekend without making a new one.“We’ve got a lot of room as far as vaccinations with AstraZeneca are concerned,” Berlin’s top health official, Dilek Kalayci, told public broadcaster rbb.The suspension of the AstraZeneca shot further slowed Germany’s already sluggish vaccine campaign this week. So far, about 10 million doses have been administered in the country, with 8.4% of the population receiving at least one shot and 3.7% getting both doses.Germany’s disease control agency reported 17,482 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 overnight, and 226 deaths.Lars Schaade, the deputy head of the center, the Robert Koch Institute, said the rate of infections is “now clearly exponential.”Officials have warned that the country could face a return to stricter lockdown measures by Easter.“The rising case numbers could mean that we won't be able to undertake further opening steps in the coming weeks,” said Health Minister Jens Spahn. “On the contrary, we may have to take steps backward.”His comments were a clear message to some state governors who have resisted pulling the “emergency brake” agreed two weeks ago with Chancellor Angela Merkel to reimpose fresh restrictions in regions where the number of new weekly cases rises above 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. The nationwide average stood at 95.6 on Friday.Meanwhile, researchers in Germany say they may have found an effective way to treat the rare cerebral vein blood clots seen in a small number of cases after vaccination. Andreas Greinacher, the head of the department for transfusion medicine at the University of Greifswald, said his team’s research is being submitted to the journal The Lancet for peer review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-resumes-astrazeneca-vaccinations-resume-days-after-clot-scare-101616148109984.html
19-03-2021||World||China says 'strong smell of gunpowder' sensed in US talks||China said Friday a “strong smell of gunpowder and drama” resulted from talks with top American diplomats in Alaska, continuing the contentious tone of the first face-to-face meetings under the Biden administration.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, speaking in Beijing, said American officials at the Alaska meetings had provoked Chinese officials into making a “solemn response” after U.S. officials made “groundless attacks” against Chinese foreign and domestic policies.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi took aim at each other’s country’s policies on Thursday in their meeting in Anchorage.Zhao accused the U.S. side of overrunning the agreed time for opening remarks, prompting the sharp response from the Chinese delegation. The meetings, set to continue Friday, come amid disputes over trade, technology, human rights and China’s territorial claims to Taiwan and islands in the South China and East China seas. China has also strongly objected to U.S. calls for greater transparency about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, the first cases of which were recorded in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.“It was the U.S. side that ... provoked the dispute in the first place, so the two sides had a strong smell of gunpowder and drama from the beginning in the opening remarks. It was not the original intention of the Chinese side," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.At the Alaska meeting, Blinken affirmed U.S. solidarity with its allies in pushing back against China’s increasing efforts to spread its authoritarian mode of government through political and economic pressure. Yang responded with a list of Chinese complaints, accusing Washington of hypocrisy for criticizing Beijing on human rights and other issues at a time when the United States itself has been roiled by domestic discontent.Blinken said China’s actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability, and thus the U.S. was obligated to raise them publicly. Yang responded by accusing the U.S. of failing to deal with its own human rights problems and took issue with what he said was “condescension” from Blinken, Sullivan and other U.S. officials.The State Department also accused the Chinese delegation of exceeding the time limit for opening statements and suggested it seemed "intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-strong-smell-of-gunpowder-sensed-in-us-talks-101616148264023.html
19-03-2021||World||Indonesia to resume use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after reviewing blood clot concerns||Indonesia's Food and Drug agency (BPOM) said on Friday it has approved the usage of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after reviewing reports the vaccine had caused blood clots among some recipients in Europe.In a statement, the agency said that even though vaccination could lead to "adverse events" following immunisation, "the risk of death from Covid-19 is much higher.""The benefits of giving the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine outweigh the risks," the agency said.BPOM did caution against the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people with a low blood platelet count, known as thrombocytopenia, and blood clotting disorders.Indonesia had previously delayed administering the AstraZeneca vaccine following the blood clot reports, saying it was awaiting the results of a review by the World Health Organization (WHO).The European Medicines Agency said this week there were no indication the events were caused by the vaccination, a view echoed by the WHO. AstraZeneca also said its review had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.Indonesia has been grappling with one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia – with 1,437,283 cases and 38,915 deaths.The Southeast Asian nation kicked off its vaccine programme this January, after receiving its first shipment of the CoronaVac vaccine produced by China's Sinovac Biotech.Indonesia received 1.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via the COVAX vaccine-alliance scheme this month and is set to receive some 10 million more in the next two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-to-resume-use-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-after-reviewing-blood-clot-concerns-101616145249288.html
19-03-2021||World||EU resets vaccine effort after chaos that may undermine trust||Europe’s efforts to speed up its Covid-19 vaccination campaign now face the hurdle of damage to public trust after a chaotic week of vaccine suspensions, health scares and export-ban threats.Countries across the European Union, including Germany, France and Spain, are resuming using AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine after temporarily suspending it to investigate a possible blood-clot issue. But while the European Medicines Agency has cleared the shot for use, worries among citizens may linger.Leaders, aware of the hit to confidence, are getting their own jabs to show it’s safe, with French Prime Minister Jean Castex taking his on Friday. Public confidence is crucial for the EU, which is trying to get a grip on a vaccine drive that’s lagging the US and the UK and potentially delaying an economic recovery. The rising pace of cases and a renewed four-week lockdown in parts of France underscore the urgency of the threat.The UK is also working to prevent any damage to its inoculation campaign. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was treated for Covid last year, will get vaccinated, and has said it will “certainly” be the Astra shot.Europe can ill afford uncertainty about vaccine efficacy. The continent’s Covid-19 infection rate has increased for the past three weeks, to an average of 381 per 100,000 people, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The EU is trying to look ahead to the second quarter, when deliveries of vaccines are expected to pick up rapidy. The bloc has approved four shots for use.“You can see that the political environment is getting a bit jittery, very nervous about making progress,’ said Maria Demertzis, deputy director at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. “I don’t think that will have a lasting effect. Within a month, we are going to see an acceleration of vaccination strategies in the EU and by then, things will calm down a little bit.”In Italy, before the formal suspension, initial reports of fatalities of inoculated people had an immediate fallout. One immunization center in the small town of Villorba in the northern Veneto region said people stopped turning up for appointments.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Health Minister Jens Spahn will hold talks with regional leaders later on Friday as they try to speed the country’s sluggish vaccination drive. Spahn said Thursday that the EMA decision “confirms the safety and reliability of the AstraZeneca vaccine.”“I have great confidence that the goal to vaccinate 70% of the adult population before the end of the summer will be reached,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Spanish newspaper El Mundo in an interview published Friday.The EU drug regulator’s announcement capped a tumultuous few days that featured an agonizing back-and-forth over vaccine safety. But while the EMA cleared the shot, it said it couldn’t entirely rule out a link with some rare blood-clotting cases.The EMA’s caveat on the clotting issue could prolong uncertainty that has surrounded the AstraZeneca since the trial phase, when a dosing mistake and different intervals between the two shots created confusion.In Scandinavia, the EMA assurances weren’t enough to persuade national authorities to immediately resume vaccinations. Sweden, Denmark and Norway are keeping suspensions in place pending national reviews.On Thursday, the agency’s executive director, Emer Cooke, sought to dispel lingering doubts, highlighting the bigger threat from the virus.“This pandemic is costing lives,” she said. “We have vaccines that are safe and effective, that can help prevent death and hospitalization. We need to use those vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-resets-vaccine-effort-after-chaos-that-may-undermine-trust-101616144551340.html

It has vaccinated about 100,000 people so far and plans to vaccinate a million people next month, using the Russian Sputnik-V shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-detects-possible-covid-variant-in-its-biggest-city-101616144272339.html
19-03-2021||World||Indonesian President calls for ASEAN meeting to discuss Myanmar crisis||Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Friday called for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders to discuss the crisis in Myanmar.In a speech broadcast from the presidential palace in Bogor, West Java, the President said he would soon hold talks with Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah as chair of the ASEAN to discuss the possibility of holding a high-level meeting on the crisis, reported The Strait Times.He urged for democracy, peace, and stability to be restored and violence to be stopped immediately.Indonesia urged for "dialogue and reconciliation to be carried out immediately to restore democracy, to restore peace and to restore stability in Myanmar".Jokowi also expressed his condolences to the victims and their families following the military crackdown against protesters following the Feb 1 coup."On behalf of myself and all Indonesian people, I would like to express my deepest condolences and sympathy to the victims and families of victims as a result of the use of violence in Myanmar," he said."Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately so that there are no more victims," he added. "The safety and welfare of the people must be the top priority."Earlier, ASEAN Foreign Ministers had held an informal online meeting on March 2 to urge the Myanmar military to desist from violence and respect the will of the Myanmar people.The meeting came after the shuttle diplomacy of Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, who has said that ASEAN was ready to facilitate dialogue when required.Wunna Maung Lwin, the top envoy appointed by Myanmar's military regime after the coup, was present at the meeting, reported The Strait Times.Unlike the United States and other Western countries, ASEAN has refrained from condemning the coup in its member state Myanmar owing to a consensus as a key principle in its operations.On February 1, Myanmar's military overthrew the government and declared a year-long state of emergency hours before the newly-elected parliament was due to convene. State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, along with other top officials accused of election fraud, have been placed under house arrest. The coup triggered mass protests across the country.Meanwhile, the total number killed in weeks of unrest has risen to at least 224, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said, noting another death in the commercial hub of Yangon and two in the cities of Monywa and Bago on Thursday, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-president-calls-for-asean-meeting-to-discuss-myanmar-crisis-101616141899814.html
19-03-2021||World||Major challenge for Putin as Russia looks to resolve water crisis in Crimea||A water emergency in Crimea is absorbing billions of taxpayer rubles as Russia tries to patch up an impossible problem stemming from the peninsula’s annexation in 2014. President Vladimir Putin’s Black Sea gem looks increasingly like a millstone.Ukraine dammed the North Crimean Canal seven years ago, cutting off the source of nearly 90% of the region’s fresh water and setting it back to the pre-1960s, when much was arid steppe. Add a severe drought and sizzling temperatures last year, plus years of underinvestment in pipes and drilling, and fields are dry. In the capital Simferopol and elsewhere, water has been rationed.Tiny Crimea gave Putin a boost, when, following protests that overthrew Kyiv’s Russia-friendly government, he seized a territory that belonged to Moscow for centuries but had been part of an independent Ukraine since 1991. The annexation of the territory that’s equal to less than 0.2% of Russia’s total helped lift Putin’s national popularity to record levels in the year or so that followed. That bump has since faded.Today locals, who were made ambitious promises in 2014, are struggling with the fallout from a wide-ranging nationalization drive that's not always served their interests, a poorly handled, muffled coronavirus crisis — and dry taps. Sanctions-inflated prices, high even after a $3.7 billion bridge over the Kerch Strait linked the territory to Russia, have meanwhile eaten away at pension and salary increases. Opinion polls are hard to come by, but anecdotal evidence reveals building frustration.The need to pour even more cash into Crimea means Russians elsewhere may lose out. They’re already suffering in an economy slowed by Western sanctions incurred over that move and other misdeeds, and bearing the brunt of the Kremlin’s decision to focus on stability over growth, limiting pandemic income support. The crisis of 2020, perhaps as much as 2014-2015, has hurt households first and foremost.Crimea cost 1.5 trillion rubles to support in the first five years of occupation, equivalent to roughly two years of Russia’s education budget, according to one former central bank official — more than $20 billion at today’s exchange rate. This year, subsidies, grants and subventions alone will add up to around $1.4 billion. And the price tag is set to rise.Water isn’t the only struggle, but it’s been the toughest to resolve, especially since winning the return of Crimea remains a priority for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Last month, the Simferopol reservoir was 7% full. Without water from the Dnieper River, Crimea’s arable land has shrunk, from 130,000 hectares in 2013 — already a fraction of Soviet-era levels — to 14,000 in 2017. Thirsty crops like rice have shriveled.It wasn't until last year that officials were spurred into significant action on water, with a 48 billion-ruble plan that includes pipe repair to end wastage, well drilling and, crucially, desalination — expensive for crops, but a solace for residents. Government officials said at a Kremlin meeting on Thursday that the problem will be solved.That’s a challenge. Even if there’s more rain this year, it’s long-term access to cheap water that is vital. That could easily be achieved by reopening the canal — an option Kyiv rules out. Barring that, the idea of a self-sufficient Crimea is a distant one, however many Chinese tourism delegations are welcomed in the hope of drumming up new sources of cash.Water disputes are nothing new between neighbors and near-neighbors, from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sparring over the Rogun dam to the Nile and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, or the Mekong, in Southeast Asia. In Crimea, it touches the very heart of Russia’s balancing act, between geopolitical ambition, national pride, rising discontent — and the costly reality of sanctions holding back development in the territory to the point where the Kremlin wants to offer some big-spending investors anonymity.If it isn’t patched up soon, this crisis risks coming to a head at an important time for Putin. He needs a solid win in September’s Duma state assembly and regional elections — the last before 2024, when his current term ends. Russians still overwhelmingly support the annexation of Crimea. It’s less clear that will continue as the resulting costs rise, national growth stagnates and the pandemic endures, potentially prompting other regions to demand their share of spending.The Kremlin faces a difficult pass. After unprecedented street protests over the jailing of critic Alexey Navalny, it’s cranked up efforts to silence naysayers, with social media clampdowns and the mass arrest last weekend of municipal deputies.Could rising political pressure and sheer thirst combine to spark a Russian incursion into Ukraine? Such a move could mean access to the dammed canal, while delivering a timely nationalist boost. But that seems improbable. It would raise questions over plans for the eastern Donbas separatist region, where conflict simmers. And Ukraine is useful bogeyman to explain away the failure to develop Crimea, Maximilian Hess, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, points out — an easier discussion than under-investment and allegations of kleptocracy.Water interests on both sides could even shape helpful, if informal, bargains, Hess adds. One possibility would be for Russia to provide guarantees around disputed access to the Sea of Azov, through which Ukraine exports steel, coal and more. In 2018, Russia seized a group of Ukrainian ships and blocked off the Kerch Strait.The reality is there’s no prospect of an imminent solution. Parched Crimea, where even Russia’s banks fear to tread, is a reminder that the price of international isolation means costly life support and stagnation for all involved.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

19-03-2021||World||Lloyd Austin on mission to deepen India-US ties, urged to raise Russia deal||Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was urged by a senior U.S senator to convey Washington's opposition to India's proposed purchase of Russian air defence systems as he headed to New Delhi on Friday for talks aimed at deepening security ties.Austin is making the first visit by a top member of the Biden administration to Delhi as part of efforts to forge a alliance of countries seeking to push back against China's assertiveness in the region.The leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan - countries together known as the Quad - held a first summit last week pledging to work together for a free and open Indo-Pacific and to cooperate on maritime and cyber security in the face of challenges from China.On Thursday, the deeply strained relations between the United States and China were on rare public display when their top diplomats levelled sharp rebukes of each others' policies in the first high-level, in-person talks of the Biden administration in Alaska.India drew closer to the United States following its own tensions with China on their disputed Himalayan border, where deadly clashes erupted last year. Washington has helped New Delhi, leasing surveillance drones and supplying cold-weather gear for Indian troops.During Austin's visit, the two sides will be discussing India's plan to purchase armed drones from the United States as well as a large order for over 150 combat jets for the air force and the navy to help narrow the gap with China, people with knowledge of the matter said.One thorny issue expected to come up is India's planned purchase of Russian S-400 air defence systems which under U.S. law can attract sanctions. Washington has imposed sanctions on Turkey for buying that equipment.The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, urged Austin to make clear to India officials the Biden administration's opposition to deal.“If India chooses to go forward with its purchase of the S-400, that act will clearly constitute a significant, and therefore sanctionable, transaction with the Russian defense sector under Section 231 of CAATSA," Menendez said in a letter to Austin, referring to the law called Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act."It will also limit India’s ability to work with the U.S. on development and procurement of sensitive military technology. I expect you to make all of these challenges clear in conversations with your Indian counterparts," he said.U.S. firms Boeing and Lockheed are front runners for the multi-billion dollar combat jet deals. An Indian government official said no deals were likely to be announced during the visit and that the talks would cover regional and international security issues."The U.S. and India are close security partners, we expect to have wide ranging discussion with the U.S. side on how to further defence cooperation," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lloyd-austin-on-mission-to-deepen-india-us-ties-urged-to-raise-russia-deal-101616138416675.html

The Kanbawza Tai news portal said on Facebook six people had been killed.Police in the main city of Yangon forced people to clear protesters' barricades, residents said, while demonstrators were also out in the second city of Mandalay, the central towns of Myingyan and Katha, and the eastern town of Myawaddy, witnesses and media reported.The total number killed in weeks of unrest has risen to at least 224, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said earlier.A junta spokesman has said security forces have used force only when necessary but critics have derided that explanation.Myanmar's UN envoy, who publicly broke with the junta, said a committee of ousted lawmakers was looking at ways people can be held accountable for violence following the coup."The ICC is one of them," Kyaw Moe Tun told an event in New York. "We are not a state party to the ICC, but we need to ... explore the ways and means to bring the case to the ICC."In Geneva, United Nations human rights experts denounced forced evictions, arbitrary detentions and the killings of pro-democracy protesters. They said foreign governments should consider pursuing those responsible for crimes against humanity.Hundreds have fled towns and cities since the coup and are sheltering in areas controlled by ethnic minority militias on the Thai border, an official from one group said.People have also crossed the western border into India.INDONESIA ARMY CHIEF CONCERNEDNobel peace laureate Suu Kyi, 75, is hugely popular for her decades-long campaign for democracy.She is being detained at an undisclosed location while facing accusations of bribery and other crimes which could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.Western countries have condemned the coup and called for an end to the violence and for Suu Kyi's release. Asian neighbours have offered to help find a solution, but Myanmar's military has shown no sign of seeking reconciliation.Coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing took part in a video conference with other Southeast Asian defence chiefs on Thursday, his first international engagement since seizing power, state television showed.During the meeting, the head of Indonesia's armed forces, Hadi Tjahjanto, expressed concern over the situation in Myanmar, the Indonesian military said on its website. Indonesia's army ruled for years but later completely withdrew from politics.Indonesia had led diplomatic efforts in Southeast Asia to resolve the crisis but a March 3 regional meeting it helped coordinate failed to make headway.A Myanmar military spokesman did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.EU SANCTIONSThe European Union is due to place sanctions on individual military figures on Monday and then target businesses they run in what would be its most significant response since the coup.The EU's expected sanctions follow a US decision last month to target the military and its business interests. Britain last month froze the assets and placed travel bans on three generals.The army has defended its takeover, saying its accusations of fraud in a November 8 election swept by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date.Information within Myanmar is becoming increasingly difficult to verify after authorities have restricted the internet services that protesters use to organise and post reports and pictures.About 37 journalists have been arrested, including 19 who remain in detention, the UN human rights office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ousted-myanmar-lawmakers-eye-icc-probe-as-another-protester-killed-101616136567154.html

We know that it is in that kind of situation that the virus prospers," he added.According to new guidelines, people will be encouraged to work from home and will be allowed to go outdoors to walk or exercise only after having an 'approval certificate'. They also cannot go further than 10 km from their home. The night time curfew - currently in effect from 6 pm - will be extended to 7 pm when the new measures are implemented, reported CNN.Schools and universities will remain open. Essential businesses will remain open - and these will now include book shops and music shops.Earlier, Castex on Tuesday said that the country has entered 'a kind of third wave' of Covid-19 infections, amid a surge of cases as numerous variants of the virus has affected the nation."The pandemic is playing overtime. We are in what looks like a form of third wave ... characterized by the variants," Castex had said, addressing the parliamentarians.France has so far recorded a total of 4,241,959 infections and 91,833 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University (JHU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-go-into-month-long-lockdown-from-march-19-amid-covid-19-surge-101616131864858.html

The UK government firmly believes that freedom of speech and the right for peaceful protest are vital to any democracy but we also accept that if a protest crosses the line into illegality, security forces in a democracy have the right to enforce law and order," UK Minister of State for Asia Nigel Adams said during a debate in Parliament complex on the issue of peaceful protests and press freedoms in India.On January 26, violence broke out during the farmer tractor rally on the occasion of Republic Day.Protestors broke barricades to enter Delhi and indulged in vandalism across several parts of the national capital during their tractor rally organised to protest against the Centre's three new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-us-senators-say-farm-laws-internal-indian-policy-urges-biden-govt-to-engage-with-pm-modi-on-farmers-protest-101616130194234.html
19-03-2021||World||Outed by online campaign, children of Myanmar junta 'hounded' abroad||Protesting alone outside an Australian hospital where the son of Myanmar’s attorney general works as a doctor, Burmese electrical engineer Susu San is determined to let the military junta know their children will be hounded wherever they go.The 33-year-old woman was hard to miss as she stood in the hospital car park, dressed in a pink track suit, one hand raised in a three-fingered salute of resistance, the other clutching a placard calling for the junta to release Myanmar's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi."They think they are untouchable," said Susu San, having traveled 1,500 km (930 miles) from the northern tip of Queensland to the workplace of one of the "junta children" at a hospital in the small city of Mackay.“This is a way to empower our people by saying that no one can escape from lawlessness and brutality."Since the coup, some protesters have launched an online campaign to denounce family members and associates of the junta in Myanmar and beyond - and spotlight those living comfortably in democratic nations far from the bloody chaos at home.Organisers say it is a non-violent way to put pressure on the junta to reverse the coup and return Myanmar to democracy.“The military understands one language. That is pressure,” said Tun Aung Shwe, a member of the Burmese community in Australia who was among a group that has gone to Canberra to urge the government to sanction people affiliated with the junta."Social punishment is effective as it shakes up the junta, getting them to rethink what they are doing.”Repeated calls to the military and government seeking comment were unanswered.Aside from shaming friends, associates and kin of the junta on social media, activists have also created a website, called socialpunishment.com, information from which has been widely shared on Facebook.The website features more than 120 profiles of people who are accused of failing to speak out against a coup that has halted 10 years of democratic reform and brought bloody suppression.It ranks them on a "traitor" scale from elite to low, and there are photographs of the profiled person, details of their associations, and whereabouts on the globe, making it easy for Burmese in those countries to track them down.As of 2016, there were nearly 33,000 people from Myanmar living in Australia alone.Susu San said her target at the Mackay Base Hospital was 28-year-old doctor Min Ye Myat Phone Khine.According to the website, his mother is the junta's attorney general, Thida Oo, whose office is now crafting legal cases against Suu Kyi. She had served as a permanent secretary in the attorney general's office during the civilian government, and her acceptance of a role in the junta was seen as a deep betrayal by Suu Kyi's supporters.Neither have responded to requests from Reuters for comment, but two days after Susu San's protest Min Ye Myat Phone Khine posted messages for the first time on his Facebook page since the coup, declaring support for the pro-democracy movement."I have come out of the shadow of my parents to walk my own path," he wrote on March 8, "I will stand boldly with the people because I am only one citizen seeking to achieve a true and fair democracy."ETHICAL DOUBTSStill, the campaign against the children of the junta has raised questions among some participants over the ethics of shaming people online because of the actions of their parents.Anger over mass arrests and killings during anti-coup protests outweighed those qualms, campaigners said. An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, said security forces have killed more than 224 people so far. Reuters could not independently confirm this number.Susu San grappled with the ethical complexities of targeting “junta children”, as she calls them, but ultimately decided in her mind that it was ‘fair’, given the number of Burmese being gunned down in the street.Min Ye Myat Phone Khine's earlier failure to speak out against the coup on his social media accounts persuaded Susu San that he was fair game.Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on two children of Myanmar’s military leader Min Aung Hlaing and six companies they control. Britain has sanctioned more than half a dozen generals, banning entry and freezing assets, while Canada said it would take action against nine military officials.The junta has not responded to the imposition of these sanctions, but had said earlier that it had expected sanctions and was not worried by them.In Australia, some in the Myanmar community are campaigning for the government to sanction children of members of the junta by freezing their assets or revoking their visas. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has still to respond to a request from Reuters for comment.Some people targeted in Australia have had their personal information, phone numbers, places of work, and suburbs where they live, published online.The campaign to shame the junta is an extension of wider campaign to boycott military run companies, and isolate individuals who back the coup.This broader campaign, which was inspired by the protest movement, has four pillars: "Don't sell anything to them", "Don't buy anything from them", "Don't associate with them" and "We will never forget."Amara Thiha, a Myanmar fellow at the U.S.-based Stimson Center think-tank, warned that there were signs that going after individuals online could prove counterproductive.He noted a hardening of the language and threats used by soldiers and their supporters on social media as they came under greater pressure. 'PUNISH ME, NOT MY DAUGHTER'Bryan Tun, the son of Myanmar’s commerce minister, Pwint San, is also working as a doctor in Australia. Though not listed on the website, Tun said he has been abused on social media even though he is a longtime supporter of Suu Kyi’s party, posts messages of support for the protest movement and disagrees with his father politically."I have been socially punishing him since this thing happened. I have been openly protesting against him," said Tun, 28, a doctor at Redland Hospital in Queensland.Reuters could not reach Pwint San for comment.Despite his experience, Tun said he still believed the online campaign was a valid act of resistance."I think that is one of the very few weapons that people have," he told Reuters. "They [the military] are killing people on the streets with guns."But some targets of the online campaign feel victimised.One of the first to be attacked online was Nan Lin Lae Oo, a student the social punishment campaign identified as the daughter of Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swar Lin.Dubbed a “murderer’s daughter”, pictures of her were plastered around the Toyo University campus in Tokyo, where she is studying. Activists have urged the university to expel her.Reuters was unable to contact either the general or his daughter for comment. The Myanmar military has not answered calls.A Toyo University spokesman, Masakazu Saito, said the university was now consulting with police, but declined to comment further, citing concerns for the student's safety.The police declined to comment.Some parents have made impassioned pleas on social media, like the wife of a retired senior military officer, Htin Zaw Win, whose daughter was identified, by the "Civil Disobedience Movement Naming & Shaming" on its Facebook page, as a student at Yangon's University of Medicine 1.“You can do any kind of social punishment to me, the mother," Khin Khin Aye Cho wrote on Facebook. "If it will satisfy you to beat both parents to death, then I will accept anytime and I will sacrifice my blood for my daughter."Please allow my daughter, the daughter of retired military family, Ayebhone Pyaecho's life to grow.Reuters was unable to contact any of the family. They have refrained from social media since that post.(Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in Tokyo and Reuters staff.

Sobrato, the board chairman.O'Brien gave the service at Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, one of the most prominent Catholic churches in Washington, in January for Biden, who is the nation's second Catholic president, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, their families and elected officials before the inauguration ceremony at the U.S. Capitol.The priest has known Biden's family for about 15 years, according to the university. O’Brien was then serving at Georgetown University, another Jesuit college. O'Brien has been president of Santa Clara University since July 2019.Sobrato's statement, posted Monday to the university's website, did not specify the allegations against O'Brien but said the trustees “support those who came forward to share their accounts.”Sobrato said that while O'Brien is on leave, the priest will be cooperating with the independent investigation, with conclusions to be shared with the Santa Clara University Board of Trustees. O'Brien didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.O’Brien joined the Society of Jesus in 1996, according to the university, and was ordained to the priesthood in 2006.Located in Silicon Valley, the Jesuit institution has an annual undergraduate enrollment of roughly 5,500 students. It has a million-dollar endowment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/priest-who-presided-over-inaugural-mass-for-biden-faces-probe-in-california-101616130806869.html
19-03-2021||World||Britain to slow Covid-19 vaccine rollout due to delay in supplies from India||Britain will have to slow its Covid-19 vaccine rollout next month due to a supply crunch caused by a delay in a shipment of millions of AstraZeneca shots from India and the need to test the stability of an additional 1.7 million doses.Supply constraints are the biggest threat to Britain's vaccine rollout - currently the swiftest among the world's major economies - and health officials warned that the programme would face a significant reduction in supplies from March 29."It is true that in the short term we're receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago," Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference, saying this was because of a delay in a shipment from India's Serum Institute and because a batch in the UK needed to be retested."As a result, we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March, but that is still more than we received in February, and the supply we do have will still enable us to hit the targets we have set," he said.Earlier, health minister Matt Hancock had said that while Britain was currently in the middle of some "bumper weeks of supply", a batch of 1.7 million vaccine doses had been delayed as it had to be retested for stability. He didn't specify the manufacturer.Britain is using vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, with 10 million doses of the 100 million ordered from AstraZeneca coming from the Serum Institute.A spokesman for the Serum Institute said it had delivered 5 million doses to Britain a few weeks ago, adding it would "try to supply more later, based on the current situation and requirement for the government immunisation programme in India".Serum Institute Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla was quoted by the Daily Telegraph newspaper as saying that supplies were dependent on how many doses the Indian government allowed to go to the United Kingdom.But, with Britain already at loggerheads with the European Union over vaccine exports, Johnson struck a conciliatory tone, saying he did not think India had blocked any deliveries and wanted to work with Europe too.Pressed on whether the Indian government had stopped exports of vaccine to Britain, Johnson said: "No, no, there is a delay as there often is, caused for various technical reasons, but we hope to continue to work very closely with the Serum Institute, and indeed with partners around the world including on the European continent."Israel is the leader in vaccinating its population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Chile and then the United Kingdom - and investors are watching closely to see which economies could recover first.More than half of all adults in England have had their first Covid-19 vaccine. For the United Kingdom as a whole, just under half of adults have had their first dose.VACCINE ROWWhile Britain tries to secure more vaccines, it is also facing growing anger from the European Union, which on Wednesday threatened to slap a ban on vaccine exports to Britain.Hancock said that European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen should respect contract law and that Britain expected to get the deliveries it had ordered."There are very significant consequences to breaking contract law," Hancock said.Britain imports Pfizer's vaccine from Europe, but despite the spat, Johnson said people should not be anxious about supplies from the EU."These vaccines are a multinational effort and they are produced as the result of international cooperation and we in the UK will continue to view it in that spirit," he said.Pfizer and AstraZeneca said on Wednesday their delivery schedules had not been affected. An AstraZeneca spokesman said on Wednesday that the "UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption".Britain's medicines regulator said there had been five cases of a rare type of blood clot in the brain among 11 million people given AstraZeneca's vaccine but said that it found the benefits of the shot far outweighed any possible risks.England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said anecdotal reports suggested that some people had not turned up to vaccination appointments after the shot was suspended in some European countries, but record numbers were still being vaccinated.Hancock denied rumours that the delays would mean no adults would get a first dose of the vaccine in April, but said it was important to make sure there was enough vaccine to give people a second dose within 12 weeks of their first.He also said that Britain was on target to offer everyone over 50 a first shot by mid-April, and a shot to all adults by the end of July. He added that a roadmap for lifting lockdown restrictions in England was unaffected.Earlier, housing minister Robert Jenrick said that supplies would pick up again in May, and Moderna Inc has said it is expecting first deliveries of its vaccine to Britain to start in April.Hancock said Britain expected doses of Moderna's vaccine to arrive "in the coming weeks".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-slow-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-due-to-delay-in-supplies-from-india-101616128881535.html
19-03-2021||World||President Biden urged to rescind Trump-era ban on H-1B, other foreign work visas||Five powerful Democratic senators on Thursday urged President Joe Biden to rescind his predecessor Donald Trump’s ban on some non-immigrant visas, including the H-1B visa which is popular among Indian IT professionals, saying this creates uncertainties for US employers, their foreign-born professional workers and their families.In June 2020, Trump instituted Proclamation 10052, halting the processing of non-immigrant H-1B, L-1, H-2B, and J-1 visas, based on the alleged potential risk to the labour market.Although Proclamation 10052 is set to expire on March 31, 2021, businesses have indicated that inaction will further harm their businesses and economic recovery.The senators said that because the visas that Proclamation 10052 halted either target low-unemployment professions or require that the visa holder does not displace an American worker, businesses that rely on foreign workers have struggled to fill jobs despite increased unemployment.Reports have suggested that jobs in fields such as information technology -- which H-1B visa holders would have filled -- have remained open or were moved overseas, said senators Michael Bennet, Jeanne Shaheen, Angus King, Cory Booker, and Bob Menendez.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.“The continuation of this ban creates delays and uncertainties for US employers, their foreign-born professional workers, and their families,” wrote the senators in a letter to President Biden.“Rather than attracting talented individuals to the United States, allowing these bans to remain in effect makes the immigration system harder to navigate and drives foreign talent to other countries,” they wrote.Additionally, many businesses in seasonal communities that Proclamation 10052 has affected rely on foreign workers to meet the demand of the high-visitation summer months.Failing to revoke the visa ban immediately threatens both workers and employers in these communities who cannot adequately and safely prepare for the surge season, they said.“Every day these visa bans remain in place undermines our collective vision for a new, more prosperous and welcoming nation. We urge you to follow through on your promise to rescind Proclamation 10052 without delay, resume timely processing of nonimmigrant visas, and direct US Embassies and Consulates to open up visa appointments for nonimmigrant visas as soon as possible,” the senators wrote.Despite the increased unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), businesses that rely on foreign workers struggled to fill jobs as the nonimmigrant categories affected by PP10052 either target low-unemployment professions (e.g., H-1B and L-1 visas) or require that the nonimmigrant will not displace an American worker (e.g., H-2B, J-1), the senators wrote.The H-2B programme allows US employers or agents “to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs.”“Several of these categories (H-2B and J-1 Summer Work Travel and Camp Counselor) by regulation are seasonal and heavily used during the summer months when seasonal communities across the country welcome an influx of visitors.The J-1 visa is an exchange visitor visa for individuals approved to participate in work-and-study-based exchange visitor programmes in the United States.The L-1 Visa is reserved for managerial or executive professionals transferring to the US from within the same company, or a subsidiary of it."Failing to revoke the Proclamation immediately places these programmes at risk because both workers and employers cannot adequately prepare for the surge season,” they wrote.Looking ahead to long-term economic recovery, the deficit of foreign workers to fill available American tech jobs will worsen through any further lack of access to foreign talent, they said.“Reports also suggest that many jobs in fields such as information technology that would have been filled by H-1B nonimmigrants have remained open or were moved permanently overseas."Moreover, these same businesses have also noted that Proclamation 10052, coupled with defunct executive orders, has kept U.S. citizens and permanent residents separated from their parents, adult children, and siblings,” the senators wrote.“We believe that it’s possible to continue processing these visas while also preventing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. This specific Proclamation is not premised on the safety and welfare of American citizens,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-urged-to-rescind-trump-era-ban-on-h-1b-other-foreign-work-visas-101616129059265.html

"This case has been assessed by Health Canada and determined not to be related to the vaccine."Earlier, the European Union said the vaccine was "safe and effective" and British regulators said its use should continue, after reports of rare blood clots prompted over a dozen countries to suspend the use of the vaccine.Germany, France and other European nations have since announced plans to resume using the vaccine.Health Canada also said it had assessed available data on the events and had determined the shot was not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots.The country is using AstraZeneca doses made at the Serum Institute of India. It has received 500,000 doses and expects to get 1.5 million more by May.

19-03-2021||World||Biden admin urged to raise China's aggressive behaviour in its neighbourhood including India, Taiwan||On the eve of the crucial US-China meeting in Alaska, a group of 20 influential lawmakers urged President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to lend support for Taiwan, raise the issue of its aggressive acts in South China Sea and against its neighbours, including India."While the United States is focused on encouraging multilateralism in the South China Sea, China continuously undermines these efforts, engages in malign and aggressive activity in the Indo-Pacific region, and commits egregious human rights atrocities. China shamelessly demonstrates a blatant disregard for human rights and a lack of respect for international diplomacy," wrote the lawmakers led by Congresswoman Ashley Hinson on Thursday.“It commits horrific genocide against its own Uyghur population, attacks Hong Kong’s democracy, engages in unwarranted combat at the India-China Line of Actual Control, and incessantly increases the militarization of the Taiwan Strait. Clearly, the CCP is not aligned with American interests or values,” they wrote.“As we work to strengthen diplomatic and economic relations in the region, China abuses its economic power through coercive trade policies that aim to force vulnerable countries to alter their trade relationships with the US. These unfair practices directly hurt US farmers and producers, as China treats them as pawns in its quest for global influence," said the lawmakers in their letter addressed jointly to Biden, Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.The lawmakers said it is imperative that the Biden administration stands up to China’s attempts to dismantle democracy and reaffirm that US support for Taiwan is non-negotiable.“Taiwan has become one of our strongest allies over the past forty years; the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances demonstrate the unwavering, bipartisan support of this important relationship. Taiwan has proven its commitment to the United States time after time, most recently by removing barriers to trade to create an important market for US agriculture producers and communicating its desire to engage in security issues in the South China Sea,” they wrote.The lawmakers commended Biden and the leaders of Japan, Australia, and India on their quadrilateral cooperation, particularly as it relates to their joint effort to combat the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.“We respectfully suggest you welcome the important perspective of allies in the Indo-Pacific region, such as Taiwan, while you continue these discussions. Taiwan, which provided the US with direct support through personal protective equipment donations at the beginning of the pandemic, would be a valuable voice at the international table,” the lawmakers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-urged-to-raise-china-s-aggressive-behaviour-in-its-neighbourhood-including-india-taiwan-101616121350606.html
19-03-2021||World||China to open first trial of Canadians held on 'spy' charges for over 2 years||China was expected to open the first trial Friday for one of two Canadians who have been held for more than two years in apparent retaliation for Canada’s arrest of a senior Chinese telecom executive.Canada said its consular officials were not given permission to attend the proceedings despite several requests. They have been notified that a court hearing for Michael Spavor would be held Friday, and one for Michael Kovrig would follow on Monday.China has not publicly confirmed the court dates, and calls to the court in Dandong, the northeastern city where Spavor was charged, went unanswered.Sidewalks were roped off with police tape and journalists were kept at a distance as police cars and vans with lights flashing entered the the court complex, located beside the Yalu River that divides China from North Korea.The Canadian Embassy's Deputy Chief of Mission Jim Nickel knocked on a door to the court seeking entry but was refused. He was told the trial would begin at 10 a.m. but was given no word on how long it would last or when a verdict would be announced.Another 10 diplomats from eight countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, stood on the street opposite the courthouse in a show of support.International and bilateral treaties required that China provide Canadian diplomats access to the trial, but the court said Chinese law regarding trials on state security charges overrode such obligations, Nickel said.“The official notification received from Chinese authorities indicated that these trials are closed to both the public and the media," Canada Global Affairs spokesperson Christelle Chartrand said on Thursday.Spavor and Kovrig were detained in December 2018, days after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested at the request of the U.S. at the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia. The U.S. is seeking her extradition to face fraud charges related to her company’s dealings with Iran.The two Canadians have been held ever since, while Meng has been released on bail. They were charged in June 2020 with spying under China’s national security laws.Spavor, an entrepreneur with North Korea-related business, was charged with spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets. Kovrig, an analyst and former diplomat, was charged with spying for state secrets and intelligence in collaboration with Spavor.Prosecutors have not released details of the charges and trial proceedings in national security cases are generally held behind closed doors. The state-owned Global Times newspaper said Kovrig was accused of having used an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig.In Vancouver on Thursday, Meng’s lawyers told an extradition hearing Canadian officials abused their power when they conspired with the U.S. to arrest her. Defense lawyer Tony Paisana said Canadian Border Services Agency officers took Meng’s phones, obtained their passwords, then handed to them to Canadian police so the data could be shared with the FBI.Paisana said Meng was never told during questioning that she faced an arrest warrant in the U.S. and would have immediately asked for a lawyer if so informed. British Columbia Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes suggested border officers would have questioned Meng more rigorously if their exam was actually a covert criminal investigation, as her lawyers said.China has demanded Meng’s immediate and unconditional release, saying the U.S. engineered her detention as part of a drive to contain China’s growing rise. Canadian authorities say Kovrig and Spavor were arbitrarily arrested to put pressure on Ottawa and say they should be released without charge.China has also restricted various Canadian exports, including canola oil seed, and handed death sentences to another four Canadians convicted of drug smuggling.Outside the courthouse, Nickel said Canada still held hope that Spavor and Kovrig could be released through joint efforts with the U.S., whose Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan are currently holding their first face-to-face talks with China's top diplomats in Anchorage, Alaska.“So we're hopeful that, in some measure, this trial may too lead to their immediate release," Nickel said.___Associated Press writers Rob Gillies in Toronto and Jim Morris in Vancouver, British Columbia contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-open-first-trial-of-canadians-held-on-spy-charges-for-over-2-years-101616121620514.html
19-03-2021||World||'I am not a virus:' Asian-American lawmakers reject bigotry||Asian-American lawmakers on Thursday described harrowing discrimination -- including a congresswoman's personal experience in historic abuse by the government -- as they testified about the national tragedy of racism highlighted by this week's Atlanta murders.A congressional hearing turned personal as Democrats vented about how former president Donald Trump and others have demonized Asians as responsible for the coronavirus, with one warning that such language has put a "bull's eye" on the backs of Asian Americans and Pacific islanders."I have a responsibility and a moral obligation to speak out about the normalizing of attacks on the AAPI community," said congresswoman Doris Matsui, a 76-year-old Californian.During World War II, the US government forcibly relocated Matsui's Japanese-American parents and grandparents to an internment camp in Poston, Arizona."They lived in appalling conditions, surrounded by a barbed wire fence, armed guards on towers, incarcerated solely because of their ancestry."Matsui was born in the very camp where her family was held."Our government, and many of its leaders, advanced the myth that the Japanese-American community was inherently the enemy," she said. "Americans across the country believed it, acceded to institutionalized racism, and acted on it."- 'Please stop' -The testimony by congresswomen Matsui, Grace Meng and Judy Chu, and Senator Tammy Duckworth, came after six women of Asian descent were murdered Tuesday in Georgia.Experts say anti-Asian violence has risen substantially nationwide since the pandemic took hold one year ago.Trump famously called Covid-19 the "China virus," congressional Republicans regurgitated the rhetoric, and attacks on Asian-Americans apparently spiked."Our community is bleeding. We are in pain, and for the last year we've been screaming out for help," Meng, a 45-year-old New Yorker of Taiwanese descent, told the House judiciary subcommittee on civil rights.The panel heard how Asian Americans have been verbally harassed, slapped, spat on, and stabbed.When House Republican Chip Roy warned that the hearing was an attempt at "policing" free speech, he drew rebukes."I am not a virus," congressman Ted Lieu, who was born in Taiwan and served in the US Air Force, reminded Roy."Whatever political points you think you're scoring by using ethnic identifiers in describing this virus, you're harming Americans who happen to be of Asian descent," he added."So please stop doing that."Anti-Asian attacks continue. Nearly 3,800 have been reported since last year, the group Stop AAPI Hate says.Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at University of Minnesota, said Asian Americans have been "terrorized," and the ongoing abuse marks "a systemic national tragedy" that won't just disappear after the pandemic."We have heard in the past 24 hours many describe the anti-Asian discrimination and violence as un-American," she said."Unfortunately, it is very American."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-am-not-a-virus-asian-american-lawmakers-reject-bigotry-101616120796526.html

Beard stopped short of calling that person a suspect but said he wanted to reassure people they weren't looking for anybody else in connection to the attack.“A double homicide is a tragedy and there are going to be family members out there who are grieving,” Beard told reporters.He said police were called to the house in the suburb of Epsom at about 11:30 am and found three people in critical condition.Beard said medics provided first aid to two of the injured but both of them — a man and a woman — died at the scene. He said the third critically injured person was taken to a hospital and was undergoing surgery Friday afternoon.Beard said the four people appeared to know each other. He said the investigation was still in its early stages and he couldn't yet offer a detailed account of what happened or any possible motive for the killings.Epsom lawmaker David Seymour said he was shocked and saddened by the deaths. He said there would be many questions, and people in the community would want to know how and why the attack happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-killed-1-badly-injured-after-stabbing-at-new-zealand-home-101616120405093.html
19-03-2021||World||Top American, Chinese diplomats clash at start of 1st talks of Biden presidency||The United States and China leveled sharp rebukes of each others' policies in the first high-level, in-person talks of the Biden administration on Thursday, with deeply strained relations of the two global rivals on rare public display during the meeting's opening session in Alaska.The United States, which quickly accused China of "grandstanding" and violating the meeting's protocol, had been looking for a change in behavior from China, itself having expressed earlier this year a hope to reset sour relations.On the eve of the talks, Beijing had presaged what would be a contentious meeting, with its ambassador to Washington saying the United States was full of illusions if it thinks China will compromise.Sparring in a highly unusual extended back-and-forth in front of cameras, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan opened their meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi in Anchorage, fresh off of Blinken's visits to allies Japan and South Korea."We will ... discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies," Blinken said in blunt public remarks."Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability," he said.Yang responded with a 15-minute speech in Chinese while the U.S. side awaited translation, lashing out about what he said was the United States' struggling democracy, poor treatment of minorities, and criticizing its foreign and trade policies."The United States uses its military force and financial hegemony to carry out long arm jurisdiction and suppress other countries," Yang said."It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China," he added."Let me say here that in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength," Yang said."...the U.S. side was not even qualified to say such things, even 20 years or 30 years back, because this is not the way to deal with the Chinese people..."PROTOCOLApparently taken aback by Yang's remarks, Blinken held journalists in the room so he could respond.Sullivan said the United States did not seek conflict with China, but would stand up for its principles and friends. He touted this year's Mars rover landing success, and said the United States' promise was in its ability constantly to reinvent itself.What is typically a few minutes of opening remarks in front of journalists for such high-level meetings lasted for more than an hour, and the two delegations tussled about when media would be ushered out of the room.Following the exchange, a senior U.S. administration official said China had immediately "violated" agreed-to protocol, which was two minutes of opening statements by each of the principals."The Chinese delegation ... seems to have arrived intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance," the official told reporters in Alaska.The United States would continue with its meeting as planned, the official said, adding that "exaggerated diplomatic presentations often are aimed at a domestic audience."Before taking office, U.S. President Joe Biden had been attacked by Republicans who feared his administration would take too soft an approach with China. But in recent weeks, top Republicans have given the president a gentle nod for revitalizing relations with U.S. allies in order to confront China, a shift from former President Donald Trump's go-it-alone "America First" strategy.While much of Biden's China policy is still being formulated, including how to handle the tariffs on Chinese goods implemented under Trump, his administration has so far placed a stronger emphasis on democratic values and allegations of human rights abuses by China.Michael McCaul, the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Yang's conduct showed China had no plans to change its ways."Their belligerence and false accusations should serve as a wake-up call to the Biden administration about exactly who they are dealing with," he said.'PRETTY TOUGH' CONVERSATIONSWashington says Blinken's Asia tour before the meeting with Chinese officials, as well as U.S. outreach to Europe, India and other partners, shows how the United States has strengthened its hand to confront China since Biden took office in January.But the two sides appear primed to agree on very little at the talks, which were expected to run into the Anchorage evening and continue on Friday.Even the status of the meeting has become a sticking point, with China insisting it is a "strategic dialogue", harkening back to bilateral mechanisms of years past. The U.S. side has explicitly rejected that, calling it a one-off session.On the eve of the talks, the United States issued a flurry of actions directed at China, including a move to begin revoking Chinese telecoms licenses, subpoenas to multiple Chinese information technology companies over national security concerns, and updated sanctions on China over a rollback of democracy in Hong Kong."We're expecting much of these conversations will be pretty, pretty tough," a senior U.S. administration official told reporters in Alaska before the meeting began.Yang questioned Blinken on Thursday about whether the sanctions were announced ahead of the meeting on purpose."Well, I think we thought too well of the United States, we thought that the U.S. side would follow the necessary diplomatic protocols," he said.China, however, indicated this week that it is set to begin trials of two Canadians detained in December 2018 on spying charges soon after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of telecoms equipment company Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. warrant.Meng awaits the outcome of a case that could see her extradited to the United States, but China's foreign ministry rejected assertions that the timing of the trials was linked to the Anchorage talks.Washington has said it is willing to work with China when it is in the interests of the United States and has cited climate change policy and the coronavirus pandemic as examples. Blinken said Washington hoped to see China uses its influence with North Korea to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.The largest group representing exiled Uighurs wrote to Blinken urging him to demand that Beijing close its internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where U.N. experts say more than 1 million members of the ethnic group and other Muslim minorities have been held.Blinken had pledged to raise the issue, his State Department having upheld a Trump administration determination that Beijing was perpetrating genocide in Xinjiang, something China vehemently denies.Yang said China firmly opposed U.S. interference in its internal affairs. The United States should handle its own affairs and China its own, he said.Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the tough statements from both sides in the run-up to the meeting had created a potential risk that it would devolve into an exchange of accusations and demands."Neither side benefits from this meeting being judged a total failure," Glaser said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-american-chinese-diplomats-clash-at-start-of-1st-talks-of-biden-presidency-101616118453587.html

SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and supplies to the moon on a single mission, claims the agency."The SLS is the most powerful rocket NASA has ever built, and during today’s test the core stage of the rocket generated more than 1.6 million pounds of thrust within seven seconds. The SLS is an incredible feat of engineering and the only rocket capable of powering America’s next-generation missions that will place the first woman and the next man on the Moon,” said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk.“Today’s successful hot fire test of the core stage for the SLS is an important milestone in NASA’s goal to return humans to the lunar surface – and beyond," he added.The previous and the first hot fire test of the SLS core stage was conducted on January 16 which ended earlier than planned. The longer duration test provided the agency with a wealth of information on a variety of operational conditions, including moving the four engines in specific patterns, powering them up to 109 per cent, throttling down and back up as they will during the flight.Also Read | Georgia shooting: Cops search for motive as Asian Americans decry attacksThe core stage of the SLS rocket has a complex network of flight software and avionics systems to help fly, track and steer the rocket during launch and flight. The two propellant tanks in the core stage hold over 700,000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to fuel the engines.Industry partners like Boeing, the prime contractor for the core stage, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, the prime contractor for the RS-25 engines, are also involved in the mission.The SLS rocket is one of the backbones of Nasa for deep space exploration.

19-03-2021||World||Georgia shooting: Cops search for motive as Asian Americans decry attacks||Homicide detectives on Thursday weighed the possible motives of a gunman accused of fatally shooting several Asian women in Atlanta-area spas, as a U.S. lawmaker said the Asian-American community was "bleeding" from a recent surge in violence and discrimination.Robert Aaron Long has been jailed on charges of murdering four people at two day spas in Atlanta and four other victims at a massage parlor in Cherokee County, about 40 miles (64 km) north of the state capital, on Tuesday. The four victims in Atlanta and two of the dead in Cherokee County were women of Asian descent."Nothing is off the table for our investigation," Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton said at a news conference in response to a question about whether police were looking at the killings as possible hate crimes."We had four Asian females that were killed, and so we are looking at everything to make sure that we discover and determine what the motive of our homicides was," he said.Investigators have determined that Long had previously frequented both spas in Atlanta where he is accused of opening fire with a 9mm gun he purchased earlier in the day.Investigators said Long, a 21-year-old Atlanta-area resident who is white, suggested to them that sexual frustration led him to commit violence. Numerous political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by rising anti-Asian sentiment since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.President Joe Biden ordered the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of Tuesday's rampage. He and Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Atlanta on Friday to offer support to the Asian-American community.In Washington, U.S. lawmakers, professors and actor Daniel Dae Kim said the Asian-American community was reeling from a year of heightened anti-Asian attacks and discrimination."Our community is bleeding, we are in pain and for the last year we've been screaming out for help," Democratic Representative Grace Meng, who is of Taiwanese descent, told a House of Representatives subcommittee on Thursday.The Georgia killings have prompted police departments to step up patrols and visibility in Asian-American communities around the country, including New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco.The incidence of hate crimes against Asian Americans rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.Civil rights advocates have connected the rise in incidents to the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China. Some Americans, including Republican former President Donald Trump, started calling the coronavirus the "China virus," "the China plague" and even the "kung flu."Hampton said Long patronized both establishments attacked in Atlanta, the Gold Spa beauty salon and an aromatherapy spa across the street, but it was not clear whether he "specifically targeted" any of the victims at those two businesses.Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department said on Wednesday that Long had confessed to the shootings and indicated he had a sex addiction and "wanted to eliminate" the temptation the establishments represented to him.A former roommate who spent several months living with Long in a halfway house for recovering addicts told Reuters Long had been treated for sex addiction, was "deeply religious" and would become "very emotionally distraught that he frequented" spas for "explicitly sexual activity."Long was headed for Florida when he was apprehended, perhaps to carry out further shootings, authorities said.Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace issued a statement on Thursday saying "much work on the investigation and prosecution remains ahead" and vowing to "prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law."Long had been scheduled to make his initial court appearance in Cherokee County on Thursday, but the hearing was canceled after he waived his right to the proceeding, according to a statement from his lawyer.The attorney, Daran Burns, said his firm had been appointed to represent Long by the county's Office of Indigent Defense, and that Burns met with his client at the county jail on Wednesday.Burns made no mention of Long's guilt or innocence, but said his firm "will conduct a thorough investigation on our client's behalf."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-shooting-cops-search-for-motive-as-asian-americans-decry-attacks-101616118960056.html

19-03-2021||World||Atlanta shooting: Asian American churches plan acts beyond prayer for healing||Asian American Christian leaders said Thursday their congregations are saddened and outraged after a white gunman killed eight people — most of them women of Asian descent — at three Atlanta-area massage parlors. And they're calling for action beyond prayers.Asian Americans were already rattled by a wave of racist attacks amid the spread of the coronavirus pandemic across the United States. While the motive behind Tuesday's rampage remains under investigation, some see it as a wake-up call to stand up against a rise in violence against the community.The lead pastor at Korean Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, located a few miles from two of the spas that were targeted, said he will ask congregants during his Sunday sermon to “not just pray, not just worry," because "it’s time for us to act.”“I’m going to urge people with love and peace that we need to step up and address this issue, so that ... our next generation should not be involved in tragic ... violence,” the Rev. Byeong Han said. “That’s what Christians need to do.”South Korea’s Foreign Ministry says diplomats in Atlanta have confirmed with police that four of the dead were women of Korean descent, and are working to determine their nationality.Jane Yoon, a congregant at Korean Central Presbyterian and a 17-year-old high school junior in nearby Marietta, said she increasingly worries for her family, which is of Korean descent, and was shocked by the killings.“I was definitely very outraged," she said. "I was in shock at first of the news and just also how close it is to my community.”It also hit home on a very personal level: Last week, she said, she was in a car accident and another driver punched her in the face and body before she was able to call 911. Yoon said the woman, who was arrested, did not make any racist comments during the assault, but she couldn't help but think about rising attacks against Asian Americans.Following that incident, she has been getting spiritual guidance and counseling from the congregation.Also Read: Georgia massage parlour shootings leave 8 dead, 1 suspect captured at AcworthIn the Atlanta suburb of Roswell, the Rev. Jong Kim of Grace Korean Presbyterian Church said he found a glimmer of hope in the wake of the killings after a woman reached out to donate $100 to his church “to express her feelings of sorrow to the Asian community.”Kim spoke to several other Korean pastors in the area Thursday, and they now plan to join the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, through which they hope to have discussions about issues of race and ethnicity and provide funeral service assistance for the victims' families.The Atlanta chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice has said that while details of the shooting are still emerging, “the broader context cannot be ignored.” The attacks, it said, “happened under the trauma of increasing violence against Asian Americans nationwide, fueled by white supremacy and systemic racism.”Ripples from the killings have been felt well beyond Atlanta.In Chicago, Garden City Covenant Church invited Asian Americans “in need of a community who understands your pain” to join an online meeting in which they could “share, listen, lament and pray” together.“There were a lot of tears, and there were a lot of questions, and for many I think there is a sense also of helplessness,” said Gabriel J. Catanus, the lead pastor, who is Filipino American. The church’s diverse congregation includes about 60 percent Filipino Americans, he said, along with worshippers from Latino and other communities.“It’s an important Biblical practice, and Christian practice, to come before God honestly and to pour one’s own heart out before God,” he said. “God can handle even the rage and the devastation that comes out of us at times.”Catanus said he was glad to see that people are now “more awakened” to the experiences of Asian Americans. But he said much works remains to be done in faith communities and called on religious leaders to denounce anti-Asian racism from their pulpits.“In the Christian community and in our Christian institutions, specifically, we need to confess that we have in many ways failed to lead and to teach our people,” he said. “Our discipleship has failed in many ways to address these very powerful forces that have led to violence and death.”Kevin Park, an associate pastor at Korean Central Presbyterian Church, said not only Asian Americans but the whole country needs to speak out against the violence, racism and “more subtle marginalization” that have been suffered for generations.“There’s opportunities among faith communities that we need to stand up together and reach out to communities that are hurting, not only Asian American communities but other communities of color,” he said.“And I think there needs to be kind of this movement toward solidarity. ... We’re all in this together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-american-churches-plan-acts-beyond-prayer-for-healing-101616118015597.html

A source close to the royal family revealed to People Magazine that Prince William is looking out for his wife, and growing more protective of her after this accusation."William is very protective of Kate and can get very angry. For Meghan to name Kate in a negative light is worse than being attacked himself," the source close to Prince William told People magazine.Meghan's controversial statements were also followed by an explanation that Kate apologised to her after the incident."And I don't say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding, and she was upset about something. But she owned it, and she apologized and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing," the Duchess of Sussex said during the tell-all interview.After the interview, the royals and the staff members were filled with "anger", disclosed the source.Making further revelations, the insider also told that the Duke of Cambridge is feeling "fiercely protective over his wife" and "he's unhappy with Markle's mention of Middleton".However, after mentioning Kate, the duo refused to name further royal family members regarding a discussion that took place between Harry and other members about the 'concerns' over the Prince's then-unborn son Archie's skin tone.Meghan had also revealed that she was denied help when she felt suicidal, among many other bombshell revelations.Meghan and Harry's CBS special with Oprah marked the couple's first joint interview since their royal exit, which was recently made permanent. In the interview, the duo discussed the reasons behind their decision to step back from their royal duties, which they had first announced in January 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-very-protective-of-kate-after-meghan-harry-s-interview-101616113270945.html
19-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Nepal to resume cross border transportation with India||Nepal on Thursday decided to resume cross border transportation with India as the Himalayan nation’s Covid-19 cases significantly decreased.The decision was taken during a meeting of Nepal’s Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre (CCMC) at the Prime Minister's Office at Singhadurbar, the centre’s secretary Khaga Raj Baral told reporters."The CCMC meeting has decided to recommend to the Cabinet to resume cross-border transportation between Nepal and India via various 12 routes," Baral said.However, passengers travelling by land routes are required to adhere to coronavirus protocols and produce a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test report conducted 72 hours before their journey.The Nepal government had suspended the cross-border movement with India in March last year as part of its measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Nepal, which shares an 1,800-km open border with India, has a total 37 motorable land entry points with it.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Population said the country’s Covid-19 tally has reached 275,625 with 107 new cases in the past 24 hours. With the death of one person, the death toll reached 3,015.So far, more than two million people have been tested in the country.There are 1,000 active cases in the country, the ministry said, adding that 271,610 people have so far recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-nepal-to-resume-cross-border-transportation-with-india-101616112567894.html
19-03-2021||World||US to push more 'aggressive' messaging effort to deter migrants||The U.S. government will be "more aggressive" in telling migrants not to come to the United States, a top U.S. official said on Thursday, after earlier warnings failed to stem the flow of thousands of Central Americans to the U.S.-Mexico border."The message isn't, 'Don't come now,' it's, 'Don't come in this way, ever,'" Roberta Jacobson, the White House's southern border coordinator, told Reuters in an interview. "The way to come to the United States is through legal pathways."The Biden administration is wrestling with a growing humanitarian crisis at the southern U.S. border, where an uptick in the number of migrants fleeing violence, natural disasters and economic hardship in Central America is testing President Joe Biden's commitment to a more humane immigration policy.Biden's promise to end former President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies has been complicated by a recent spike in the number of migrants crossing the border illegally. U.S. officials are struggling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in jail-like border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.The Biden administration's message to would-be migrants has become stricter in recent days amid intense criticism from opposition Republicans that Biden's relaxation of some of Trump's policies has encouraged people to come to the United States.Biden officials initially said migrants should not come to the United States now, but that they could come later. In an interview with ABC on Tuesday, Biden took a firmer stance, telling migrants "don't come" and that they would soon be able to "apply for asylum in place."Jacobson echoed that tougher tone on Thursday, stressing that the policy of the United States was to expel migrants trying to cross the border illegally, with the exception of unaccompanied children. But she acknowledged that as a U.S. official her warnings might be lost amid the deception of people smugglers who are telling migrants the border is open.She said the United States would step up its messaging effort, using social media, radio and non-governmental organizations in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to urge migrants not to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border."We're going to be more aggressive, more agile about getting our message out, we're going to try and combat the smugglers' messages and make sure that people understand the truth," she said.A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said that effort was underway and included radio outreach in Guatemalan indigenous languages.U.S. border authorities caught roughly 100,000 migrants at the border with Mexico in February, the highest monthly total since mid-2019. Roughly 4,500 children were being held in border facilities as of Thursday, an administration official said during a call with reporters, a slight increase from Sunday.While Biden officials have said migrant families will be "expelled" to Mexico or their home countries under a Trump-era health order known as Title 42, more than half of the 19,000 family members caught at the border in February were not expelled, with many released into the United States.Jacobson said the expulsions were limited last month by a lack of capacity in Mexico to receive them."Those numbers are going to change, frankly, from week to week, but the policy is that families will be expelled," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-push-more-aggressive-messaging-effort-to-deter-migrants-101616112277594.html
19-03-2021||World||Biden says US to hit 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations goal this week||With the U.S. closing in on President Joe Biden's goal of injecting 100 million coronavirus vaccinations weeks ahead of his target date, the White House announced Thursday the nation is now in position to help supply neighbors Canada and Mexico with millions of lifesaving shots.The Biden administration revealed the outlines of a plan to “loan” a limited number of vaccines to Canada and Mexico as the president announced the U.S. is on the cusp of meeting his 100-day injection goal “way ahead of schedule.”“ I’m proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met our goal," Biden said. He promised to unveil a new vaccination target next week, as the U.S. is on pace to have enough of the three currently authorized vaccines to cover the entire adult population just 10 weeks from now.Ahead of Biden's remarks, the White House said it was finalizing plans to send a combined 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to Mexico and Canada in its first export of shots. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the details of the “loan" were still being worked out, but 2.5 million doses would go to Mexico and 1.5 million would be sent to Canada.“Our first priority remains vaccinating the U.S. population,” Psaki said. But she added that “ensuring our neighbors can contain the virus is a mission critical step, is mission critical to ending the pandemic.”The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been authorized for use in the U.S. but has been by the World Health Organization. Tens of millions of doses have been stockpiled in the U.S., waiting for emergency use authorization, and that has sparked an international outcry that lifesaving vaccine is being withheld when it could be used elsewhere. The White House said just 7 million of the AstraZeneca doses are ready for shipment.The initial run of doses manufactured in the U.S. are owned by the federal government under the terms of agreements reached with drugmakers, and the Biden administration has faced calls from allies across the globe to release the AstraZeneca shots for immediate use. Biden has also fielded direct requests from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to buy vaccines produced in the United States.Global public health advocates say wealthy nations like the U.S. need to do far more to help stem the spread of the pandemic. The World Health Organization on Thursday issued a report that fewer than 7 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Africa thus far. That's the equivalent of what the U.S. administers in a matter of days.Biden did move to have the U.S. contribute financially to the United Nations- and World Health Organization-backed COVAX alliance, which will share vaccine with more than 90 lower- and middle-income nations, but the U.S. has yet to commit to sharing any doses.From his first days in office, Biden has set clear — and achievable — metrics for U.S. success, whether they be vaccinations or school reopenings, as part of an apparent strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration's sometimes-fanciful rhetoric on the virus.The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the U.S. had even one authorized vaccine for Covid-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.By the time Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the U.S. had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Biden's goal was not ambitious enough. He quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.Now the U.S. is injecting an average of about 2.2 million doses each day — and the pace is likely to dramatically rise later this month in conjunction with an expected surge in supply of the vaccines.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, injections of 96 million doses have been reported to the agency since Biden’s inauguration, but those reports lag the actual date of administration. Vaccination trend lines pointed to Biden breaking the 100 million mark on Thursday, with the numbers likely to be confirmed by the CDC as soon as Friday.The president has moved to speed up deliveries of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, as well as to expand the number of places to get shots and people who can administer them, with a focus on increasing the nation's capacity to inject doses as supply constraints lift.The risk in setting too rosy expectations is that an administration might become defined by its failure to meet them, such as in May 2020, when President Donald Trump said the nation had “prevailed” over the virus.At the time, the country had seen about 80,000 deaths from the virus. This week, the U.S. death toll topped 538,000. Trump’s lax approach and lack of credibility also contributed to poor adherence to public safety rules among the American public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-us-to-hit-100-million-covid-19-vaccinations-goal-this-week-101616111490210.html

It says the United States will “pay a due price."Earlier this month, Malaysia’s top court rejected an assertion by the North Korean man that the U.S. charge was politically motivated and ruled that he can be extradited to the United States.The man, named Mun Chol Myong, has lived in Malaysia for a decade and was arrested in May 2019 after U.S. authorities requested his extradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-cuts-diplomat-ties-with-malaysia-over-us-extradition-101616111004202.html
19-03-2021||World||US, China spar with rare harsh public rebukes in first in-person talks of Biden administration||The United States and China leveled sharp rebukes of each others' policies in the first high-level, in-person talks of the Biden administration on Thursday, with deeply strained relations of the two global rivals on rare public display during the meeting's opening session in Alaska.The United States is looking for China to change its behavior if it wants to reset sour relations, but Beijing has said Washington is full of illusions if it thinks it will compromise.Sparring in an unusually extended back-and-forth in front of cameras, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan opened their meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi in Anchorage, fresh off of Blinken's visits to allies Japan and South Korea."We will ... discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies," Blinken said in unusually blunt public remarks at the top of the first meeting."Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability," he said.Yang responded with a 15-minute speech in Chinese while the U.S. side awaited translation, lashing out about what he said was the United States' struggling democracy and poor treatment of minorities."The United States uses its military force and financial hegemony to carry out long arm jurisdiction and suppress other countries," Yang said."It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China," he added.Apparently taken aback by Yang's remarks, Blinken held journalists in the room so he could respond.Sullivan said the United States did not seek conflict with China, but would stand up for principles and friends. He touted the United States' recent Mars rover landing success, and said the country's success was its ability constantly reinvent itself.Washington says the Asia tour before the meeting with Chinese officials, as well as outreach to Europe, India and other partners, shows how the United States has strengthened its hand to confront China since President Joe Biden took office in January.But the two sides appear primed to agree on very little at the talks, which were expected to run into the Anchorage evening and continue on Friday.Even the status of the meeting has become a sticking point, with China insisting it is a "strategic dialogue", harkening back to bilateral mechanisms of years past. The U.S. side has explicitly rejected that, calling it a one-off session.On the eve of the talks, the United States issued a flurry of actions directed at China, including a move to begin revoking Chinese telecoms licenses, subpoenas to multiple Chinese information technology companies over national security concerns, and updated sanctions on China over a rollback of democracy in Hong Kong."We're expecting much of these conversations will be pretty, pretty tough," a senior U.S. administration official told reporters in Alaska before the meeting began.Washington has said it is willing to work with China when it is in the interests of the United States and has cited the fight against climate change and the coronavirus pandemic as examples. On Thursday, Blinken said Washington hoped to see China uses its influence with North Korea to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.China has indicated it is set to begin trials of two Canadians detained in December 2018 on spying charges soon after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of telecoms equipment company Huawei Technologies on a U.S. warrant.China's foreign ministry said the timing of the trials had nothing to do with the Anchorage talks.Beijing has called for a reset to ties, now at their lowest in decades.The largest group representing exiled Uighurs has written to Blinken urging him to demand that Beijing close its internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where U.N. experts say that more than 1 million members of the ethnic group and other Muslim minorities have been held.Blinken had pledged to raise the issue, his State Department having upheld a Trump administration determination that Beijing was perpetrating genocide in Xinjiang, something China vehemently denies.Yang said Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan were all inseparable parts of Chinese territory and China firmly opposed U.S. interference in its internal affairs. The United States should handle its own affairs and China its own, he said."The way we see the relationship with the United States is as President Xi Jinping has said, that is we hope to see no confrontation, no conflict, mutual respect and win-win cooperation with the United States."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-spar-with-rare-harsh-public-rebukes-in-first-in-person-talks-of-biden-administration-101616110323349.html
19-03-2021||India||B’luru firm to make 200mn Sputnik V doses||The developer of Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine said on Friday it has signed a partnership with Bengaluru-based drugmaker Stelis Biopharma for the production of 200 million doses of the two-dose jab. The announcement by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which backed the development of Sputnik V, means the deal with Stelis is the fourth partnership in India for the production of the inoculation, which has shown a 91.6% efficacy rate in clinical trials. Stelis Biopharma is expected to be able to start supplying the vaccine from the second half of the year. “We are delighted to announce our agreement with Stelis Biopharma for a significant capacity of Sputnik V. The Russian vaccine with efficacy of 91.6% is one of the best vaccines against coronavirus in the world. The significant vaccine volumes, which will be produced jointly with Stelis, will help to widen access to the vaccine on a global scale,” said Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund. RDIF, which is Russia’s sovereign development fund, added that Stelis -- the biopharma unit of global pharmaceutical company Strides -- will work to provide supplies “beyond the initial agreement”. RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev said that the “significant vaccine volumes” produced with Stelis “will help widen access to the vaccine on a global scale”. RDIF said on Friday that 52 countries have approved the use of Russia’s Sputnik V, named after the Soviet-era satellite. Three other India-based companies are manufactured Sputnik V, which was developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow. The companies are Dr Reddy’s laboratories, which is also conducting phase 2/3 bridging studies for the vaccine in India and has applied for emergency use authorisation; Hetero Biopharma, which is likely to manufacture up to 100 million doses annually; and Gland Pharma Ltd, the Indian unit of China’s Fosun Pharma, which is likely to produce nearly 252 million doses. “We are delighted to partner with RDIF to make a substantial contribution towards providing global supply of the Sputnik V vaccine which is one of the most efficacious approved vaccines commercially available. We will also work with RDIF to increase the availability of the vaccine beyond our initial commitments,” said Arun Kumar, founder of Strides group.Sputnik V was initially met with some controversy after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released. But scientists, while releasing the final Phase III data, said its benefit has now been demonstrated.In a comment published alongside the Lancet paper, professors Ian Jones and Polly Roy said: “The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency.“But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-firm-to-make-200mn-sputnik-v-doses-101616177607003.html
19-03-2021||India||Maritime security next on Quad’s agenda, key trilateral meets soon||Members of Quad are moving forward with their agenda for ensuring a “free and open” Indo-Pacific by working with other like-minded countries, with India and Australia set to hold two key trilateral ministerial meetings in New Delhi next month.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and Australian foreign minister Marise Payne will hold separate meetings with their French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian and Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi on the margins of the annual Raisina Dialogue from April 13 to 15, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.These meetings are expected to focus on issues such as maritime security and collaborating on shared challenges across the region, the people said. France is seen as a natural fit for working with Quad as it has 1.5 million citizens on island territories within the Indo-Pacific, and 93% its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of more than 11 million sq km is also within the region.Work on arranging the India-Australia-Indonesia trilateral has been on for more than six months, but the meeting was held up because of Jakarta’s sensitivities, one of the people cited above said. The French foreign minister is among the speakers at Raisina Dialogue, and the Indonesian foreign minister too is expected to attend the event, a second person said.The trilateral meetings will follow close on the heels of the La Pérouse exercise in the Bay of Bengal from April 4 to 7, which will see the French Navy joining the navies of India, Australia, Japan and the US – the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad.India will deploy frontline warships and P-8I maritime patrol aircraft for what is being dubbed as a “Quad-plus France” manoeuvre, and the five countries will showcase their naval strength and commitment to freedom of navigation by practising complex drills.At the same time, work has begun on implementing the Quad Vaccine Partnership, which was seen as the most significant outcome of the first virtual Quad Summit on March 12 and envisages the production of one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 for developing countries. The people said Quad members are keen on production of vaccines beginning at Indian facilities as early as the second quarter of 2021. Under the partnership, vaccines developed by US companies will be made in India with funding from the US and Japan, while Australia will provide “last mile” delivery support with focus on South-east Asia.“A lot depends on India’s manufacturing capacity, given the demands on Indian manufacturers to fulfil both the demands of the domestic inoculation programme and commercial supplies and grants for foreign countries,” the first person cited above said.It is believed the four members of Quad are keen on progress on vaccines before the leaders hold their first in-person meeting. Efforts are currently on to schedule this meeting on the margins of the G7 Summit to be hosted by the UK in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the G7 Summit.Australia was chosen for logistics support for vaccine delivery.The other crucial working group formed during the Quad Summit – the critical and emerging technology working group – will focus on collaboration on issues such as 5G, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and cyber-security, the people said.“We’ve seen how such technologies can be misused during the US presidential elections and the effort will be to prevent such activities,” the first person cited above said.Though the joint statement issued after the Quad Summit made no direct reference to China, the people acknowledged that the impact of China’s assertive actions in the area ranging from the East and South China seas to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) figured prominently in the deliberations by the four leaders. US President Joe Biden set the tone for these discussions with his unusually candid observations on China, the people added.Immediately after the Quad Summit, another person familiar with the deliberations had said that the four leaders discussed India’s military standoff with China along the LAC, and the three other members had a “sympathetic view” towards New Delhi on the issue.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “Quad’s future, which seemed bright after the summit, will partly depend on eventual dynamics between the US and China. It is still early days and the first session of the meeting in Alaska didn’t go well. The outcome is awaited. Within Asean, privately the governments are reportedly happy with the Quad’s vaccine initiative as there is a deficit in access to vaccines and a trust deficit where Chinese vaccines are concerned...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maritime-security-next-on-quad-s-agenda-key-trilateral-meets-soon-101616175746076.html

As the counting of first preferential votes in the two graduates’ constituencies – Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar and Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda, ended in the early hours of Friday, the authorities noticed that nearly six per cent of the votes polled turned out to be invalid. In Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar graduates’ constituency, out of a total number of 3,58,348 votes polled, as many as 21,309 votes were declared invalid. Out of 93 candidates in the fray, only four contestants could get more votes than the invalid votes, while all the remaining 89 candidates got lesser number of votes. “Even Telugu Desam Party’s candidate L Ramana secured only 5,963 votes and rebel Congress candidate G Harshavardhan Reddy got 9,783 votes,” an official of the Hyderabad collectorate involved in the counting of votes said. Similarly, in Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda graduates’ constituency, out of the total number of 3,86,302 votes polled, as many as 21,636 votes were declared invalid. In all, 71 candidates are in fray for this seat, but except four candidates, all the others have polled less than the number of invalid votes. According to the official quoted above, these voters have failed to mark the digits 1, 2, 3 in the boxes provided against the candidates whom they preferred to vote. “Instead, they made tick marks in the boxes or marked their first preferential votes to more than one candidate. Some of them marked the numbers on the names or images of the candidates, instead of in the boxes provided against the names,” he said. Some others wrote their preferences in words, rather than digits, while a few others wrote slogans like Jai Sri Ram, Jai Modi and Jai Telangana and a few others even put forth their demands like: “give us jobs, fill up vacancies.” All such votes were declared invalid. “This is ridiculous. The voters are supposed to be graduates and hence highly educated. How can they behave like illiterate voters? The fact that there is such a huge number of invalid votes indicates that these graduate voters do not have the basic understanding of how to cast their vote,” said political analyst Bhandaru Srinivasa Rao. He felt that too many contestants in the MLC elections might have also led to this confusion among the voters. “The ballot paper was as big as a broadsheet newspaper to accommodate 93 candidates in Hyderabad MLC polls. It could be difficult to identify the candidates of their choice and mark their preferences and that might be the reason for making errors in marking,” Rao said. Former MLC K Nageshwar, who contested as an independent in the present elections again, attributed this to large-scale enrolment of bogus voters by mainstream parties. “However, they did not give proper training to the voters on how to cast their votes. That led to huge number of invalid votes,” he said. The large number of bogus votes also drew criticism on social media. “These so-called graduates who don’t even know how to cast their votes do not deserve government jobs. So, instead of issuing job notifications, it is better the government pays them unemployment allowance,” a netizen commented. Another person observed: “I pity them. Kudos to the teachers who groomed such graduates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/large-number-of-invalid-votes-in-telangana-mlc-polls-baffles-officials-nominees-101616174799728.html

It is the first visit to India by a top official of the Biden administration.In a tweet after his arrival, Secretary Austin said he was thrilled to be in India and the two countries will work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region."Thrilled to be here in India. The breadth of cooperation between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defense partnership, as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region," he said.Earlier in the day, Austin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed America's strong desire to further enhance the strategic partnership between the two countries for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.A PMO release said the Prime Minister welcomed the warm and close relationship between the two countries, which is rooted in shared values of democracy, pluralism and commitment to a rules-based order.PM Modi outlined his vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries and emphasized the important role of bilateral defence cooperation in India-US ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajit-doval-lloyd-austin-discuss-strategic-partnership-defence-cooperation-101616174382661.html
19-03-2021||India||During India visit, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin discusses 'most pressing' challenges facing Indo-Pacific||US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday expressed his country's strong desire to further deepen strategic ties with India to address the "most pressing" challenges facing the Indo-Pacific as he began a three-day visit to the country that is aimed at expanding cooperation with close partners amidst China's growing assertiveness in the region.Austin, who arrived here as part of his three-nation first overseas tour as the Defence Secretary, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed international, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, following which Modi tweeted that India and the US are committed to their strategic partnership that is a "force for global good".The US defence Secretary also held wide-ranging discussions with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and almost all key issues of mutual concerns, including China's aggressive behaviour in the region are learnt to have figured in the deliberations.After the Prime Minister's discussions with Austin, a PMO statement said the US Defence Secretary reiterated Washington's continued commitment towards strengthening the bilateral defence ties and "expressed strong desire" to further enhance the strategic partnership for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond."Pleasure to meet US Sec Def Lloyd Austin today. Conveyed my best wishes to POTUS Joe Biden. India and US are committed to our strategic partnership that is a force for global good," Modi tweeted.Austin's visit is seen as a reflection of the Joe Biden administration's strong commitment to ties with its close Asian allies and partners. Austin visited Japan and South Korea before India."Thrilled to be here in India. The breadth of cooperation between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defense partnership, as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region," the US Defence Secretary tweeted.A readout by the US government said Secretary Austin commended India’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific and growing engagement with like-minded partners across the region to promote shared goals."The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to promote a free and open regional order. Both sides exchanged perspectives on shared challenges confronting the region and committed to further strengthen their broad ranging and robust defence cooperation," it said.Welcoming Austin, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said his visit to India is definitely going to further deepen the cooperation and partnership between two countries."Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow," Singh tweeted.On Saturday, Austin will lay a wreath at National War Memorial in the morning, and will be given a guard of honour at Vigyan Bhavan before his talks with Singh, officials said.Ways to further accelerate India-US strategic ties, boosting cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, China's aggressive behaviour in eastern Ladakh, challenge of terrorism and the Afghan peace process are expected to be focus of the talks between Austin and Singh, people familiar with the US official's visit said.They said India's plan to procure around 30 multi-mission armed Predator drones from the US for the three services at an estimated cost of over USD 3 billion is also expected to figure in the talks.The medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) Predator-B drones, manufactured by US defence major General Atomics, are capable of remaining airborne for around 35 hours and can hunt down targets at land and sea, they said.India's plan to acquire 114 fighter jets at a cost of around USD 18 billion could also figure in the talks as American defence majors --Boeing and Lockheed -Martin-- are eyeing it, the people said.His visit to India came days after the top leadership of the Quad grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia vowed to expand their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.Ahead of Austin's visit, Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote a letter to the US Defence Secretary, urging him to take up with Indian leaders the issue of New Delhi procuring Russian S-400 missile defence system.Though democracy and human rights issues do not come under the domain of the Pentagon, Menendez also urged Austin to raise these concerns with Indian leaders.In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.Recently, the US imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.The visit is also taking place at a time when India and China are looking to achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points in eastern Ladakh after completing withdrawal of troops in the North and South banks of Pangong lake areas.Austin and Singh had a telephonic conversation on January 27.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner".The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides have also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties. The pact provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/during-india-visit-us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-discusses-most-pressing-challenges-facing-indopacific-101616173858506.html
19-03-2021||India||Farm stir: Anti-social forces trying to thwart resolution, says RSS||Bengaluru: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Friday said “anti-national and anti-social forces” were trying to thwart efforts to resolve the standoff between the government and protesting farm unions over the three new farm laws. The RSS’s annual report was released in Bengaluru during a three-day convention of the Akhil Bharatiya Prathinidhi Sabha (ABPS), its highest decision making body of the RSS, that started on Friday.“The problem becomes more serious when anti-national and anti-social forces try to thwart the ongoing efforts towards a solution [farmers’ protest]. The leadership of the present agitation should not allow such a situation to arise,” the RSS said in the report.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.In its report, the RSS said that prolonged agitations were counterproductive for all.“It is not in anyone’s interest for any kind of agitation to be prolonged for a long time.

19-03-2021||India||For how many generations reservations in jobs, education will continue: Supreme Court||For how many generations would reservations in jobs and education continue, the Supreme Court sought to know during the Maratha quota case hearing on Friday and raised concerns over “resultant inequality” in case the overall 50 per cent limit was to be removed.A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan was vehemently told by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Maharashtra, that the Mandal judgement on capping the quota needed a re-look in changed circumstances.He said the courts should leave it to states to fix reservation quotas in view of the changed circumstances and the Mandal judgement was premised on census of 1931.Arguing in favour of the Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas, Rohatgi referred to various aspects of the Mandal judgement, also known as Indra Sawhney case, and said the Centre's decision to grant 10 per cent quota to people from economically weaker section also breached the 50 per cent cap.“If there is no 50 per cent or no limit, as you are suggesting, what is the concept of equality then. We will ultimately have to deal with it. What is your reflection on that... What about the resultant inequality. How many generations will you continue,” observed the bench, which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.Rohatgi said there were many reasons for the re-look of the Mandal judgment which was premised on the census of 1931 and moreover, the population has increased many fold and reached to 135 crore.The bench said 70 years have passed since independence and the states have been carrying on so many beneficial schemes and “can we accept that no development has taken place, that no backward caste has moved forward”.It also observed that the purpose of reviewing the Mandal judgement was that those who have come out from backwardness must be eliminated.“Yes, we have moved forward. But it is not that backward classes have gone down from 50 to 20 per cent. We still have starvation deaths in this country... I am not trying to say that Indra Sawhney is completely wrong, throw it in the dustbin. I am raising issues that 30 years have gone by, the law has changed, the population has grown, backward persons may also have increased,” Rohatgi said.He referred to amendments made in the Constitution and said they are the indicators that the country has not reached “anywhere near the emancipation” it required for its backwards classes.“The fact of the matter is Parliament should know what is going on in the country. If Parliament knows it is more than 50 per cent and has given 10 per cent to a class of economically backward section, no warrant from court should say it cannot go over 50 per cent,” he argued.When a number of states have reservations exceeding 50 per cent and in this situation, it cannot be said that this is not “a burning issue” and does not require a relook after 30 years, he said.The arguments in the case remained inconclusive and would resume on Monday.On Thursday, Attorney General K K Venugopal had told the apex court that the 102nd amendment to the Constitution does not deprive state legislatures to enact law determining the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) and conferring benefits on them.The 102nd Constitution amendment Act of 2018 inserted Articles 338B, which deals with the structure, duties and powers of the National Commission for Backward Class (NCBC), and 342A dealing with power of the President to notify a particular caste as SEBC as also of Parliament to change the list.On Wednesday, the top court was told that Marathas have been dominant “socially and politically” as almost 40 per cent of MPs and MLAs of Maharashtra are from this community and the entire hypothesis that they have been left behind, faced historical injustice is completely flawed.The top court has been hearing a clutch of cases challenging the Bombay High Court verdict which upheld the grant of quota to Marathas in admissions and government jobs in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-how-many-generations-reservations-in-jobs-education-will-continue-supreme-court-101616172304845.html

"Every vaccine doesn't require universal immunisation and all these priority groups whom we are vaccinating today like healthcare staff first and then senior citizens and people aged between 45 and 59 years, it will be extended in the coming days – all these are based on experts' opinion," the health minister said.He also urged people to not have any misconceptions about the two Indian vaccines that are being administered in the country. "There are detailed pre-clinical and clinical trials, which get thoroughly studied by the experts before a vaccine gets the nod, the minister said, adding that "There should not be any misconception regarding the Covid-19 vaccines and the people should avail the facilities given by the government and get themselves vaccinated," he also said.India is currently using two vaccines for the inoculation drive: Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-latest-milestone-india-crosses-4-crore-vaccination-mark-health-ministry-101616170461635.html
19-03-2021||India||Alarmed over Covid-19 surge MHA writes to states, asks for compliance with norms||Alarmed over a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections in the country, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Friday shot off a letter to all states and union territories, asking them to strictly enforce Covid appropriate behaviour, such as wearing of masks, hand hygiene and social distancing among people. The home ministry has also said that the rise in Covid-19 cases is largely due to laxity of people, particularly in crowded places, while asking the states/UTs to follow the Covid-19 guidelines issued by it on January 27 urging people to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. It has also alerted that due precaution must be taken considering the festival season, particularly Holi, is coming up. Over 39,000 cases, the highest since November 28, were reported across the country on Thursday out of which over 25,000 were reported from Maharashtra alone. “After the steady decline in Covid-19 cases for about 5 months, for the last few weeks, the number of Covid-19 cases are showing an increasing trend in several parts of the country. It has been observed that it is largely due to laxity in the observance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by the people, especially in crowded places,” Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said in his letter to states on Friday. “Keeping in view the fresh surge of cases and upcoming festivals, it will be important to ensure compliance of the guidelines and to strictly enforce Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, such as wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing among people,” he added. He urged all the states to take measures for creating awareness among people to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and simultaneously take necessary action for its strict enforcement, so as to fully overcome the pandemic. In its January 27 guidelines, MHA had opened up all economic activity across the country. There are no signs of any sort of lockdown by the Centre as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alarmed-over-covid-19-surge-mha-writes-to-states-asks-for-compliance-with-norms-101616169925732.html

Conveyed my best wishes to @POTUS @JoeBiden.

This year the Jammu and Kashmir government has been making arrangements for six lakh pilgrims to the cave shrine nestled in the South Kashmir Himalayas at a height of 13,000 feet. The 56-day pilgrimage will commence from June 28 and end on August 22. Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45km-long Pahalgam route in Anantnag district or the shorter 14km-long Baltal route in Ganderbal district to the shrine every year. “Like every year, the yatra arrangements are being done. There is a set drill and we know what kind of security is required on the highways, camps, community kitchens and on the twin tracks of Pahalgam and Baltal. The arrangements are being done on the same pattern,” the DGP told reporters at the police training school in Sunjuwan here. He said that all the requisite security arrangements will be put in place “There are no specific threats to the yatra but sticky bombs are indeed a new challenge. It was not there earlier but forces inimical to India including the neighbouring country are always hell bent upon creating disturbance. It is a new thing. It is a small IED with a magnet, which can be easily planted in vehicles and metals. It is a threat but we have our security drills and will take care of them,” he said. Dilbagh Singh’s statement comes a day after CRPF’s Inspector General (Jammu zone) PS Ranipse said that all CRPF units and formations have been briefed about the threat posed by sticky bombs. On the government’s efforts to wean away the youth from terrorism and bring them back to the mainstream, Singh said, “Such efforts are on for the past few years and in 2020 at least three dozen such youth shunned the path of violence on the request of their parents. They are now living a peaceful life.” The DGP said that the process was still on. “Our endeavour is that youth should be weaned away from it and they should be stopped from going astray. After shunning the path of violence they also realize it (futility of gun) and express gratitude to the security forces for saving their lives and bringing them back to the mainstream,” he said. “And, now even during the encounters we give opportunity to the terrorists to surrender. At least a dozen such terrorists surrendered during the encounters last year and we will continue this process,” he added. On anti-insurgency operations, he said that the security forces achieved big successes in Kashmir this year. “In north Kashmir a top commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Gani Khawaja was killed and similarly Jaish commander Sajjad Afghanhi was killed in Shopian. Then two top commanders of Lashkar-e-Mustafa and the TRF-Hidyatullah Malik and Zahoor Ahmad Rather were captured alive in Jammu,” he said. The police chief said that security forces have killed 12 terrorists so far this year and three dozen others belonging to various modules were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-threat-to-amarnath-yatra-but-sticky-bombs-a-new-challenge-j-k-dgp-101616164344705.html

The state also recorded 70 related fatalities in the said timespan which took the death toll to 53,208, according to heath department data.Maharashtra's capital Mumbai recorded 3,063 cases of the infection and 10 related fatalities which pushed the caseload to 3,55,914 and death toll to 11,569, respectively.Also Watch: How India can avoid Lockdown 2.0The number of active cases in the city is 20,140. Mumbai also saw 1,334 people recover from the infection, which took the total recoveries to 3,23,281.The number of cases in Mumbai and Maharashtra have been rising rapidly, worrying the experts who say the state is witnessing a second wave of Covid-19. From the peak of the infection last year, the cases started declining late last year, but a resurgence in March 2021 has alarmed the Centre too.In October 2020, Mumbai recorded 2,848 cases - its highest ever then - but in March this year, the record has been broken already. After recording 2,877 cases on Thursday, the city saw its 24-hour tally cross the 3,000-mark.Maharashtra too recorded 25,833 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, its highest one-day spike since the pandemic began.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said lockdown is an option but he trusts people to follow the norms on their own. Talking to reporters in Nandurbar, Thackeray also appealed people to get vaccinated against the virus without fear.The state government released fresh guidelines on Friday, imposing restrictions on gatherings and putting in place other curbs. As per the new guidelines, drama theatres and auditoriums in Maharashtra have been asked to operate only at 50 per cent capacity. Private offices, except those related to health and other essential services, have also been asked to function only at 50 per cent of their capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-25-681-new-cases-of-covid-19-mumbai-breaks-3000mark-101616163821705.html
19-03-2021||India||US defence secretary Lloyd Austin lands in India; visit to boost security ties||In the first visit by a top Biden administration official, US Defence Secretary Lloyd J Austin arrived in India on Friday on a three-day visit, aimed at further boosting bilateral defence and security ties in the wake of China's growing military assertiveness in the region including in the Indo-Pacific.India is the third stop for Austin during his three-nation first overseas tour as the Defence Secretary, and the visit is seen as a reflection of the Joe Biden administration's strong commitment to its relations with its close allies and partners in the region. The US defence secretary visited Japan and South Korea before India.The US official was received at the Palam airport by senior Indian military officials and diplomats from the American embassy.Ways to further accelerate India-US strategic ties, boosting cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, China's aggressive behaviour in eastern Ladakh, challenge of terrorism and the Afghan peace process are expected to be focus of the talks between the two sides, people familiar with Austin's visit said.They said India's plan to procure around 30 multi-mission armed Predator drones from the US for the three services at an estimated cost of over $3 billion is also expected to figure in the talks.The medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) Predator-B drones, manufactured by US defence major General Atomics, are capable of remaining airborne for around 35 hours and can hunt down targets at land and sea, they said.India's plan to acquire 114 fighter jets at a cost of around $18 billion could also figure in the talks as American defence majors --Boeing and Lockheed -Martin-- are eyeing it, the people said.Secretary Austin is scheduled to meet National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Friday evening while he will have extensive talks with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday.He is also likely to meet External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. Before his departure on Sunday, Austin is likely to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.His visit to India came days after the top leadership of the Quad grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia vowed to expand their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.Ahead of Austin's visit, Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote a letter to the US Defence Secretary, urging him to take up with Indian leaders the issue of New Delhi procuring Russian S-400 missile defence system.Though democracy and human rights issues do not come under the domain of the Pentagon, Menendez also urged Austin to raise these concerns with Indian leaders.In October 2018, India signed a $5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.Recently, the US imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.The visit is also taking place at a time when India and China are looking to achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points in eastern Ladakh after completing withdrawal of troops in the North and South banks of Pangong lake areas.Austin and Singh had a telephonic conversation on January 27.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner".The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides have also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties.The pact provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-lands-in-india-visit-to-boost-security-ties-101616162422783.html
19-03-2021||India||On Pakistan army chief's 'move forward' remark, a comeback from Punjab CM||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday told Pakistan’s army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa to “walk the talk” as the latter made a pitch for peace between the two nations on Thursday saying the onus lies on India to initiate talks for improving bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir.“Bajwa should first control his ISI, and then talk about stability in Indo-Pak relations,” the chief minister said, adding that India cannot afford to go soft with Pakistan till they walk the talk and prove their sincerity with solid actions.Singh’s statement comes a day after Bajwa said it was time for India and Pakistan to "bury the past" and move forward as that would help to "unlock" the potential of South and Central Asia. The Pakistan army chief said that the potential for regional peace and development always remained hostage to the disputes and issues between Pakistan and India - the two "nuclear-armed neighbours". He, however, said that responsibility for a meaningful dialogue rested with India.In a sharp comeback to Bajwa, Singh said, “Infiltration into India from across the border is still happening, Indian soldiers are being killed at the borders every day. They (Pakistan) are dropping arms and heroin into Punjab via drones every other day. Efforts to create trouble in my state continue to take place. All this should stop first, only then we can talk peace.”Pointing to the differences with their country, the chief minister said, “Are they all of the same view as shared by General Bajwa? Are they withdrawing all support to terror groups immediately? Have they asked ISI to back off and leave India alone?”“India is all for peace, all Indians stand for peace, but India cannot compromise on its security and integrity,” he stressed, adding that peace cannot be conditional.Bajwa’s remarks came a month after the militaries of India and Pakistan announced a ceasefire along the de facto border in Kashmir.In response to similar remarks “offering a hand of peace”, India had last month asserted that the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-pakistan-army-chief-s-move-forward-remark-a-comeback-from-punjab-cm-101616162353241.html

The information was shared by Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri on Twitter."There has been a continuous rise in price of ATF (aviation turbine fuel) so it has been decided to increase the lower fare band by 5% keeping the upper fare band unchanged," he tweeted."We may open the sector for 100% operations when daily passenger traffic crosses 3.5 lakhs on 3 occasions in a month," Puri said in the same tweet.There has been a continuous rise in price of ATF so it has been decided to increase the lower fare band by 5% keeping the upper fare band unchanged. We may open the sector for 100% operations when daily passenger traffic crosses 3.5 lakhs on 3 occasions in a month.This is the second time that the government has increased fare limits for domestic airlines. The first hike was introduced in February this year.Except the ATF, India's fuel demand has returned to pre-Covid levels, the chief of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said earlier this week. "ATF may take a quarters time to return to normal, maybe 3-4 months," said IOC chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya.With airlines not operating all flights, ATF sales remain below normal.In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, domestic flight operations were ceased with effect from midnight of March 24, 2020. The operation resumed after two months on May 25, 2020.Last month, the civil aviation ministry said that the number of domestic flights that Indian airlines are permitted to operate will remain at 80 per cent of their pre-Covid levels till March 31 or till the summer schedule begins.Scheduled international commercial flights continue to remain suspended, while overseas flights under air bubble agreements and the Vande Bharat Mission are operational, among others.Meanwhile, India's economy returned to positive growth territory in the fourth quarter of 2020 as its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 0.4 per cent year-on-year after two quarters of contraction. This was after provincial and localised lockdowns were lifted amid a fall in the daily number of new Covid-19 cases.In 2020, India's GDP contracted by 7 per cent, but it is forecast to grow by 9 per cent in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-hikes-lower-fare-band-by-5-may-impact-domestic-flight-ticket-prices-101616162023270.html
19-03-2021||India||Andhra assembly to skip budget session, vote-on-account likely for few months||The Andhra Pradesh government is likely to go in for promulgation of an ordinance for approval of a vote-on-account budget for the initial few months of the 2021-22 financial year, instead of convening the budget session of the assembly. It is mandatory that the approval of the annual budget for the coming financial year and passage of the appropriation bill by the state assembly happens before the closure of the present financial year on March 31. Without the passage of the appropriation bill in the assembly, the state government cannot draw a single rupee from the exchequer after April 1, for spending on implementation of various programmes and even for payment of salaries to government employees. The budget session of the Telangana assembly began on March 15. The Telangana government tabled its annual budget for the financial year 2021-22 on Thursday and is preparing for a debate on it from Saturday. However, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government has not yet taken any decision on convening the budget session of the state assembly, though hardly 12 days are left for the conclusion of the financial year. “We have not taken a call yet on the budget session of the assembly till now, but it is unlikely that the session will be held in the present circumstances,” said senior YSR Congress party leader and government chief whip in the state assembly G Srikanth Reddy. He said holding of the budget session would become inconvenient for not only the government but also the opposition parties in the wake of announcement of the schedule for by-election to the Tirupati parliamentary seat. “We are also insisting on completion of the elections to Zilla Parishad and mandal parishad (block parishad) at the earliest. Amidst the electioneering, it may not be possible to have a full-fledged budget session,” Reddy said. The only option before the Jagan government is to promulgate an ordinance through the Governor under Article 213 (1) of the Constitution of India for the adoption of a vote-on-account budget for appropriation of money and release of approximate budgetary allocations for at least three months. “Instead of hurrying through the budget in a short-duration, we can have a full-fledged budget session of the assembly at a later date and the budget can be passed after a thorough discussion in the House,” the chief whip said. The state cabinet is expected to meet next week to adopt a draft ordinance to pass the vote-on-account for the first three months of the 2021-22 financial year and get it approved by Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichanan. Last year, too, Jagan government could not convene the budget session of the state assembly in early March as it was planning to hold the same in the last week after the completion of elections to urban and rural local bodies. However, the state election commission deferred the elections in the wake of the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic and by the time the government took any decision, the situation turned very serious forcing the Centre to announce a nationwide lockdown. As a result, the government had to go in for promulgation of ordinance for the vote-on-account for three months. In the second week of June, it held a short two-day budget session to adopt the budget. The Governor had to address the joint session of the assembly and council through video conferencing mode in view of Covid-19 restrictions. However, the appropriation bill, which was passed by the assembly, was withheld in the legislative council. Two weeks later, the bill was deemed to have been passed and the Governor gave his assent to the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-assembly-to-skip-budget-session-vote-on-account-likely-for-few-months-101616160984030.html

But I trust people of the state to cooperate (and follow the Covid-19 norms voluntarily) like the last time," he was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereThackeray’s remarks came shortly after the state government issued fresh guidelines restricting private offices and drama halls, theatres and auditoriums to operate at 50% capacity. The heads of government offices have been asked to decide regarding the functionality of their respective workplaces.Pointing to the situation when the pandemic was at its peak last year, Thackeray said that there was nothing to fight the virus with then. “Number of Covid-19 patients had increased in September 2020 as well. But today we have vaccine as a shield,” he said, adding that the priority now is to ensure that everyone is inoculated and urged people to come forward to take the vaccine.On Thursday, Maharashtra logged a single-day spike of 25,833 Covid-19 cases taking the tally to 2,396,340. The toll from the viral disease has gone up to 53,138. This is the sharpest one-day increase so far. On September 11, the state reported the previous highest single-day cases at 24,886.Due to the surge in cases since February, several Maharashtra districts have already been placed under ‘partial’ lockdown. Amid the concernes raised by experts about the "beginning of the second wave" in the state, the Thackeray government has time and again warned the people of a lockdown and urged them to adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.However, at a review meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, Thackeray said that he is not in favour of lockdown but indicated that a strict lockdown might be imposed in some areas of the state as it is a 'majboori' (helplessness)."Do not force us to impose a strict lockdown. Consider this as the last warning. Follow all the rules. Everyone has to realise there is a difference between self-discipline and restrictions," the chief minister warned hotels and restaurants last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-sees-lockdown-as-an-option-amid-covid-19-spike-101616157359262.html

19-03-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination drive to be extended in coming days: Harsh Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said the Covid-19 vaccination drive will be extended in the coming days and asserted that there should not be any misconceptions about the two Indian vaccines being administered in the country.During the Question Hour in Lok Sabha, Vardhan said India has vaccinated 3.5 to 4 crore people so far and side effects of the vaccines has been recorded at 0.000432 per cent. "Every vaccine doesn't require universal immunisation and all these priority groups whom we are vaccinating today like healthcare staff first and then senior citizens and people aged between 45 and 59 years, it will be extended in the coming days – all these are based on experts' opinion.      "Not only Indian experts, but we have also consulted WHO guidelines regarding priority groups," he said. Serum Institute's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin have been currently approved for restricted emergency use in India.Replying to a question by NCP MP Supriya Sule on whether the government is aiming at universal immunisation of Covid-19 vaccine, Vardhan said it is not scientifically necessary to administer the vaccine to each and every person in the country. "Not each and every person in the world will be vaccinated. The prioritisation process is a dynamic process. "The behaviour of the virus is also dynamic. All things are based on scientific facts, scrutiny and vision of the overall scientific and health community," he said.           The minister said under India's present universal immunization programme, free vaccines are provided against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases, including Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, Rubella, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and Meningitis, among others.     Replying to a question by Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu about the fear in people that the Covid-19 vaccine will harm them in the future, Vardhan asserted that taking vaccines is the way to get rid of vaccine-preventable diseases.   "We got victory over polio and chicken pox due to the vaccination," he said.     There are detailed pre-clinical and clinical trials, which get thoroughly studied by the experts before a vaccine gets the nod, the minister said, adding that "There should not be any misconception regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and the people should avail the facilities given by the government and get themselves vaccinated." Vardhan further noted that there is a well-defined group of experts called the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration (NEGVAC)).    "What you are seeing today is the hard work of the people in the ministry and this group, which was set up by the prime minister in August. "Since then, they have been working closely regarding all scientific developments related to this," he said.     The minister also pointed out that the Subject Expert Committee has cleared two Indian vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) after examining data provided by these companies. Data provided by two Indian companies was also examined by the World Health Organisation, he added.Vardhan also informed the House that India would soon launch several more COVID-19 vaccines following their pre-trials and clinical trials phases."There is no single standard method to manufacture vaccines...Indian vaccines fulfil safety, efficacy, and immunological parameters," he said.According to the recommendations of NEGVAC, the vaccination of people aged 60 years and above and those aged between 45 to 59 years with 20 identified comorbidities started in the country from March 1.      Replying to questions on Thalassemia, Vardhan, "Not a single thalassemia patient was deprived of blood during the COVID-19 pandemic period," he noted and said blood is provided free of cost to these patients.Thalassemia major and the severe form of Thalassemia Intermedia (TI) constitute the major burden of disease and both are commonly managed by regular lifelong blood transfusions and iron chelation.     These syndromes are caused by inheritance of abnormal (beta) thalassemia genes from both parents or abnormal beta - thalassemia gene from one parent and abnormal variant haemoglobin gene (HbE, HbD) from the other parent.The minister said in the last one year, 75 medical colleges have been sanctioned by the government."A total of 30,000 Health and Wellness centres were opened under the Ayushman Bharat scheme in the last one year during the Covid-19 pandemic period," he said.Vardhan also said during the last six years 24,000 new post graduate medical seats have been created.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-to-be-extended-in-coming-days-harsh-vardhan-101616156960463.html

After my husband lodged the complaint, they threatened him with dire consequences and now they killed him.” Devi said after hitting Valimiki, the attackers allegedly threatened the passers-by against informing the police or helping him, saying they would face the same fate if they intervened. “My husband...[pleaded for help] but nobody helped him.”Police superintendent Vinayak Verma said Ahmed and his sons have been arrested and booked for the murder.Also Read | Man arrested for murder of parents, 2 other family members in Chhattisgarh“Santram was returning home on Thursday when Rizwan, who was [at the tractor wheel]...hit his bike with the tractor.

A heavy police force was deployed in the area and the gathering of more than four people has been prohibited.Sharma accused police and administration of supporting the encroachers. “Had the administration and police acted timely, Santram would not have been killed.

19-03-2021||India||'India not a dharamshala': Haryana minister says collecting info about Rohingyas||Haryana home minister Anil Vij said on Friday that his government is collecting information about presence of Rohingyas Muslims in the state. Vij's comments came after several reports claimed that the Rohingyas have been gather in Haryana's Mewat district."We are collecting information about them. Action will be taken accordingly. After all, India is not a dharamshala (an inn or small hotel) where anybody can stay where they like. We will look into this," the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, several news reports claimed that Rohingyas have been taking shelter in the Nuh village of Haryana's Mewat district.They have been found in other parts of the country too. On March 6, over 150 Rohingya refugees were sent to a holding centre in Jammu as part of the Jammu & Kashmir administration’s process to identify undocumented immigrants in the Union Territory under the Foreigners Act. The administration has said it will work on their deportation to Myanmar.The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea seeking the release and protection of these refugees.Rohingyas are a minority in Myanmar’s Rakhine, where an intense military crackdown - likened to an ethnic cleansing by the United Nations - has driven hundreds of thousands to flee to countries such as Bangladesh and India.Certain political parties and social organisations have urged the Centre to take immediate steps for the deportation of Rohingyas and Bangladeshis alleging that their presence is a "conspiracy to alter the demographic character" of the region and "a threat to the peace in the region".The issue is a sensitive one for the central government. Last month, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti spoke at the informal UN General Assembly meeting on the situation in Myanmar after the military staged a coup this month. He emphasised the need for an early return of displaced Rohingyas from Bangladesh to Myanmar, saying that India has the highest stake in resolving the issue since it is the only nation that shares a long border with both countries.Tirumurti also urged the international community to ensure that the recent developments in Myanmar do not impede the progress made so far.Myanmar military seized the power on February 1, detaining the country's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The military coup took place at a time when Bangladesh was spearheading a desperate campaign for safe return of some 1.1 million Rohingyas.Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, who fled Myanmar facing military crackdown, often considered as "ethnic cleansing" by many rights groups.Myanmar doesn’t recognise Rohingya as an ethnic group and insists that they are Bangladeshi migrants living illegally in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-a-dharamshala-haryana-minister-says-collecting-info-about-rohingyas-101616154316212.html

19-03-2021||India||Bombay HC allows daughter to challenge validity of father's second marriage||The Bombay High Court has held that a daughter can question in court the validity of her father's second marriage. In a judgement pronounced on Wednesday, a bench of Justices RD Dhanuka and VG Bisht allowed the plea filed by a 66-year-old woman challenging a family court order that held only parties to the marriage could challenge the validity of the marriage.As per the judgement, the woman filed a plea in the family court in 2016, challenging the validity of her late father's second marriage. In the plea, she said her father had remarried after her mother's death in 2003, but it was in 2016, after her father's death, that she realised her father's second wife was yet to finalise her divorce from her previous marriage. Her father's second marriage, therefore, could not be considered as valid, the woman said in her plea.The second wife, however, argued before the family court that the petitioner had no locus standi in the matter as only the two parties to a marriage, that is the husband and the wife, could challenge its validity in court.The HC held that the petitioner discovered the truth about the woman's divorce much after her father's death and that she had approached the family court as soon as she learned of the discrepancy. Since her father was dead, it was for her to bring the discrepancy forward and challenge the validity of such a marriage, the court said.The bench said the family court was wrong in holding that the daughter was barred from questioning the validity of her father's marriage. It sent the plea back to the family court to decide afresh."We cannot concur with the reasoning and conclusion arrived at by the learned Family Court which wrongly dismissed the appellant's petition," the HC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-allows-daughter-to-challenge-validity-of-father-s-second-marriage-101616151493212.html
19-03-2021||India||Sabarimala temple issue: CM Pinarayi Vijayan says everything going on smooth now||With the opposition parties in Kerala continuing to target the ruling LDF on the Sabarimala issue, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday maintained that as of now everything was going on smoothly at the hill shrine and the matter would come up only when the Supreme Court delivers the final verdict.Asking why the party should be worried about it now, he told reporters in Pattambi in Palakkad district if any issue crops up after the final verdict it would be discussed with all sections of society."Now, the matter will come up only when the final verdict is issued by the constitution bench of the apex court. Our stand is that when the final verdict comes out, and if any issue crops up at that time, we will discuss the matter with every section of the society. Why are we worried about it now?" he asked.The state had witnessed widespread violent protests led by a section of devotees led by BJP and other right wing outfits against the state government decision to implement the Supreme Court order allowing entry to women of all ages into the hilltop shrine.He also said the ruling Left front would have more seats in the Assembly after the April 6 elections."There is no doubt that we will get more seats than the last time," Vijayan said in response to a question onthe number of seats expected by the Left Front.Vijayan attacked the BJP and the Congress-led UDF and said the infamous "Co-Le-B alliance" is now a public deal and was an attempt to weaken the Left movement in the state.He also said the Left doesn't need the support of communal parties to gain acceptance among the people and asked "those who want to protect secularism in the country to observe" the Kerala-level alliance of the "Congress-League-BJP (Co-Le-B)".Vijayan was responding to the statements of the lone BJP legislator in Kerala, O Rajagopal, that there were "adjustments" between UDF partners Congress and IUML and his party in past elections in order to defeat the CPI(M).The chief minister said both the BJP and Rajagopal benefited from that alliance and received the Congress votes at Nemom."Now it is public that the Congress had ties with the BJP earlier also. They are trying to forge the same alliance in this election too. People have to be careful. Those who want to protect secularism in the country need to observe these matters carefully," he added.He said, earlier this "adjustment between these parties" was not in the open but now certain UDF candidates have publicly announced that those who voted for BJP last time will vote for them in this election."Now it's not a secret deal but an open adjustment. The people are watching," he said.Asked about Palakkad BJP candidate E Sreedharan's recent comment reported by some media that apart from the Palarivattom project, the state government was not cooperative in developing infrastructure in Kerala, Vijayan said "even experts who join BJP, tend to show that party's traits"."He (Sreedharan) is a major technocrat in our country. Even experts who join BJP, tend to show that party's traits. So he too may have reached a certain point where he would end up saying anything," the Chief Minister said.Referring to the recent decision of the central government to "sell hundreds of public sector undertakings", Vijayan attacked the Congress and the BJP saying "both the parties share the same policy of globalisation and privatisation".He said Congress was the "proponent" of this policy and cited the example of Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor backing the handover of the International Airport in the state capital to Adani Group."Now the BJP-ruled central government has decided to sell around hundred public sector undertakings in the country. Have they (Congress or UDF) raised any objection towards this? No. Because it's the Congress who are the real proponents of this policy."It was decided to privatise the Trivandrum International Airport. The Left government here opposed but the Lok Sabha memberfromThiruvananthapuram supported it. The globalisation policy was initiated by the Congress," Vijayan said.He said Kerala has been opposing the globalisation policy and "implementing an alternate model"."Those who are opposing the globalisation and privatisation including the farmers and others are looking towards Kerala with hope. We have put forward an alternative policy," he said.The lone Communist chief minister saidthe country was keenly observing the steps taken by the Left government to protect secularism in the state and with a "Kerala-level understanding, the Congress, the UDF and the BJP" are trying to weaken the Left movement in the state".He said there are attempts to attack the secular values and the Constitution of the country andpeople rejecting or returning awards are also a form of protest against destroying the secular fabric of the nation."Secularism can be protected only by taking a strong stand against communalism and only the Left parties have been opposing the anti-secular forces. There are conscious efforts to destroy secularism and the Constitution of this country. The country is keenly observing the steps taken by the Left government to protect secularism in the state," he said.Vijayan is touring the districts of the state as part of the election campaigning for the Assembly elections scheduled on April 6.The results will be out on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-temple-issue-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-says-everything-going-on-smooth-now-101616151184710.html

Passenger train operations taken up through Public Private Partnership (PPP) is targeted to bring a total investment of about ₹ 30,000 crore," Goyal said.Replying to a supplementary asked by Jairam Ramesh of the Congress, Goyal said he felt the Opposition member was not able to understand the difference between privatisation and monetisation."When you privatise, you sell off the assets permanently and it no more remains a part of the government ownership. In the railways, the plan to is monetise in terms of how it will generate resources, further investment and growth. The infrastructure of Indian Railways will never be privatised," Goyal said.The Railways Minister said dedicated freight corridors are a separate corporate entity and the railways is supporting them."The Railways is supporting but is not the owner of tracks that the DFC is laying …If we raise funds by leasing them, giving them out to private sector to use in the interim period we are doing a service to the nation," the minister said.The Ministry of Railways is committed towards enhancing the pace of infrastructure development, which is vital for the national economy as a whole, he said.The railways would always be a key economic driver in the strategy of investment-led economic growth, he said.The minister said assets monetisation involves various transaction processes, and the investment expected depends on the outcome of bidding process open to public and private sectors."Therefore, the actual investment expected from private and public sectors cannot be ascertained as of now," he added.Goyal said modern train is the need of the day, and the railways has got historic ₹2.15 lakh crore allotment under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.If a road is built, everyone uses it, similarly if a pipeline is built by GAIL and they only use it, it will be misused, he said."Similarly, if new rail tracks are laid and private people are invited and encouraged to operate there, it will be run by locopilots, there will be caterers, so it will generate employment and not lead to job losses," he said.In reply to a supplementary raised by the leader of the opposition in the Upper House Mallikarjun Kharge about a proposal to merge three divisions of Gulbarga in Karnataka, Goyal said the Railways Board did not find it feasible.He said proposals made by Zonal Managers are sent to the Board for a holistic view with an all-India perspective. He, however, added that he will discuss the issue with Kharge separately.In a reply to another supplementary, he said for seven routes dedicated to semi-high speed passenger corridors, the government is talking to state governments and added that there has been good response from the Uttar Pradesh government which is cooperating on the Delhi-Varanasi route, mostly elevated along the highways.He said under PM Modi's leadership instead of just haphazard announcements, which he alleged used to be the case earlier, committed plans are being made and it is being ensured that the rail infra is augmented in the entire country instead of just a few places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-infra-will-never-be-privatised-assets-to-be-monetised-piyush-goyal-101616148249897.html

But 25-year-old Rajkumar Nayak from Jhalipada village of Kandhamal district instead ended up acting in Malayalam movie Jallikattu, India’s official entry to Oscar this year.Nayak played the role of a Bangladeshi in Jallikattu, a movie revolving around a buffalo that escapes from the local butcher’s farm and runs amok till it is finally captured. “I never dreamt that one day I would act in a movie that was nominated for Oscar awards. It was beyond my imagination,” said Nayak, now a resident of Angamaly town of Kochi in Kerala. Jalikattu was Nayak’s 6th movie in the last 4 years.One of the four sons of a daily labourer in tribal-dominated Kandhamal district, Nayak’s each day was earlier defined by struggle. “After finishing my high school exam in 2012, I enrolled in Netaji Subhas higher secondary school in Tumudibandh. However, my father could no longer pay for my tuition fees and I had to drop out,” said Nayak.In 2012, he left for Angamaly town of Kerala’s Kochi, along with a few of his friends, to work as a waiter in a hotel, where he also washed dishes and learnt cooking. While working at the hotel, he joined a local gym, where he came in contact with Anson Antony, a gym instructor and a supporting actor in Malayalam movies.It was Antony who helped Nayak get the cook’s job at Malayalam director Lijo Jose Pelissery’s house. “The director and his team were very impressed with my cooking. In 2017, director sir (Pellissery) asked whether I could act. I said I had not done it ever but will give it a try. They offered me a small role in the film Ea Ma Yu. I completed the 20 second shot in one take. The director praised me and assured help in building a career in acting,” he said.Thereafter, he signed one film after another. After Ee Ma Yu, he acted in Addu 2, Swatantra Ardharatri, Whal Nachetra and Kadathanadan Katha.Director Pellissery, who directed Jallikattu, said Rajkumar was a wonderful actor. “I know him for the past 3-4 years and he is a wonderful actor and very hardworking. I would love to see Rajkumar in a few Odia films,” he said. Nayak himself wants to get a break in Odia movies.In his native village, Rajkumar’s family as well as fellow villagers are proud of him and wished to see him in Odia films. “People of our village are praising my son. He has made me proud,” said Kamaldei Nayak, his mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-migrant-labourer-from-kandhamal-becomes-actor-in-malayalam-movies-101616146822052.html

19-03-2021||India||Centre urges Delhi HC to restrain WhatsApp from implementing new privacy policy||The central government has urged the Delhi High Court to restrain WhatsApp from implementing its new privacy policy and terms of service, news agencies reported on Friday.The Centre urges Delhi High Court that WhatsApp may be restrained from implementing its new privacy policyThe Centre informed the court that in view of rising concerns over data protection and privacy, it has framed the Data Protection Bill, 2019, to "limit the ability of entities" such as WhatsApp. This, the government reasoned, is necessary for ushering in a "robust regime" on data protection of internet users, LiveLaw reported.The Facebook owned-messaging platform has been facing global criticism recently over its new privacy policy, under which the app could share limited user data with Facebook and its group firms.WhatsApp's privacy policy poses an added challenge for the Indian government. The privacy situation in this country is unlike that in the European Union (EU), where users get more control over how tech platforms handle their personal data, thanks to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even under the new privacy policy, WhatsApp users in the EU get an additional option called "managing and retaining your information", which lets them rectify, erase, or update any private information that the platform controls.Since India lacks a regulatory authority, the country faces a hurdle in policing tech companies over their handling of user data, that is, until the data protection act comes into force.The government had earlier this month sought more time from the court to examine the issue regarding WhatsApp's new privacy policy, which it believes provides 'differential treatment' to Indian users. In the last hearing, the central government had told the Delhi High Court that the issue is a "matter of concern" as the messaging application policy differs for users in the European Union.The Centre has contended that not giving users an option to opt out raises "grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens". Union Minister of State for IT and Communications Sanjay Dhotre informed the Lok Sabha two days ago that the central government has asked the messaging platform to review its privacy policy changes.WhatsApp, for its part, has clarified that the new policy changes nothing for private messages between friends and family as these are end-to-end encrypted and neither Facebook nor WhatsApp can see those texts. It said that only in some specific conditions can WhatsApp read "business messages" and share the data with Facebook to help those businesses with targetted ads and user optimisation on partner platforms.Issues ranging from provocative and inflammatory content to misinformation to data breaches have placed social media companies including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter on the line of fire over the past many months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-urges-delhi-hc-to-restrain-whatsapp-from-implementing-new-privacy-policy-101616144346998.html

I know that you are all public representatives, you can't live in isolation. But at the same time, while dealing with people, meeting them, or going to the constituencies or areas, be careful, follow strictly the advice given by the Health Ministry and Home Ministry, central government, as well as the guidelines issued by the state governments concerned from time to time and see to it that they are implemented," he said.Naidu further said MPs should take interest to see that common people too are guided properly."One of the reasons, as we are seeing, though the severity has come down, but the cases are spreading here and there, is that people in those respective areas are not following the amount of discipline," he said, and added "we should not allow the situation to deteriorate".The Chairman also urged MPs and their family members, who are eligible, to get themselves vaccinated.Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi suggested that asthma and obesity too should be included in the list of comorbidities for vaccination, saying these two have emerged as a major cause of Covid-19 mortality.People of over 45 years with comorbidities are eligible for vaccination, along with senior citizens. Chaturvedi said she was a proponent of vaccine for all so that India could emerge out of Covid-19 sooner rather than later.G V L Narasimha (BJP) talked about the difficulties faced by exporters of spices regarding settlement of payments as some unscrupulous people in some countries create difficulties."So they need at least in those cases where they have genuine difficulties, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Missions concerned in their respective countries should come forward to lend assistance to them by way of settling disputes, as per the local mechanism in their respective countries," he said.The BJP MP suggested that the government should set up a help desk in every Mission, where Indian exporters can go for redressal of their problems related to payments.Sujeet Kumar (BJD) raised the issue of rising cancer cases and demanded lowering of prices of cancer drugs.He said while the Government of India has taken several initiatives for the welfare of cancer patients, there is an urgent and clear need to lower cancer drug prices in the country to keep these life-saving drugs available and affordable to patients belonging to the poor segment of society, especially in this COVID-19 scenario.BJD leader Subhash Chandra Singh demanded the government that major trains should pass through Cuttack and Cuttack Railway station should be upgraded.BJP leader Hardwar Dubey urged the government to protect people working in the tourism sector in Uttar Pradesh as they are affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Congress leader Chhaya Verma expressed concern over delay in sanctioning a processing and cold storage unit for Chhattisgarh where farmers are not getting fair price for their horticultural crops."The state government has written to the Centre for a processing and cold chain unit. But no action has been taken so far and as a result the state has not been able to benefit from the processing units," she said.After the Zero Hour, members made 'Special Mentions' on several issues including fuel price rise and milk adulteration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-careful-follow-covid-19-guidelines-venkaiah-naidu-tells-mps-101616144489626.html

The accident took place at Neerukulla village of Atmakur block on Hyderabad-Bhupalapatnam national highway (NH-163) at around 7.30 am. The seven-seater auto rickshaw was overloaded with 19 people including the driver. “The labourers from Atmakuru block headquarters, were travelling to the Rangapuram village of Duggondi block to harvest red chilli crop,” Atmakur police head constable Venugopal Reddy said. As the auto rickshaw was approaching Neerukulla village crossroads, a van coming from opposition direction at a high speed rammed into it, killing three women on the spot. “The impact of the collision was so intense that the auto rickshaw was badly mangled and the bodies of the deceased were completely mutilated,” the policeman said. On receiving the information from the locals, the police rushed to the spot and took up the rescue operations. “Seven others including the driver, who sustained injuries in the accident, were immediately shifted to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial government hospital for treatment. One of the injured died while undergoing treatment,” Venugopal Reddy said. The deceased were identified as Madishetti Sambalakshmi (65), Palakurti Sarojana (55), Md Mehboobi (50) and Bharati (55). The van was found abandoned at the accident site. It is not known how many people were in the van.State minister for panchayat and rural development Errabelli Dayakar Rao, who also hails from Warangal district, spoke to the police authorities to enquire about the incident. He expressed shock at the death of four women labourers in the accident and asked the district authorities to extend the best possible treatment to the injured. “We shall extend suitable ex gratia to the families of the deceased. I request the people to follow the rules of the road and avoid over-speeding to prevent such ghastly accidents,” the minister said.

19-03-2021||India||Bihar to promote Kesari dal variants with lower levels of neurotoxin||The Bihar government is trying to revive cultivation of grass pea or Kesari dal in two variants, years after the country lifted ban on the cheap and hardy pulse. Kesari dal’s production and sale was banned in the country in 1961 for containing a neurotoxin that causes lathyrism – a disease marked by tremors, muscular weakness, and paraplegia or paralysis affecting the lower half of the body. The ban was lifted in 2016 after reports from Indian Council of Medical Research and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India said its consumption in smaller quantities was safe.Districts of Aurangand, Navada, Jahanabad, Bhojpur, Rohtash, Nalanda and east Champaran are cultivating dal variants with lower levels of the neurotoxin, Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid (ODAP), under a project by the department of biotechnology .Under the project, the two variants – Ratan and Prateek – that were demonstrated in three districts of Bihar resulted in an ODAP content within the permissible limit of 0.1% and led to higher yields. In the two years under the project, the average yield in Gaya, Lakhisarai, and Patna for Ratan was 12.01 quintals per hectare, for Prateek 11.5 quintals per hectare, and for local variants 9.9 quintals per hectare, according to the project’s progress report.Also Read | No proposal to hike PDS prices of food grains under NFSA, says Piyush GoyalThe higher yield and low ODAP content as compared to local variants, and low input needed in general for grass pea, increased farm incomes -- an estimated financial gain of ₹27,500/hectare per season through its cultivation in rice fallows, according to the report. It also addressed the shortage of pulses, provided protein-rich diet to the farmers, and provided feed for livestock.“Earlier the few farmers who did grow grass peas used it for livestock feed and not for their own consumption. Due to the government ban, there was a negative perception among the people about the dal so we had to work hard to explain that the new variants had very low quantities of ODAP. The project grew slowly as the word spread among farmers,” said Dr Chandan Kumar Panda, who is working on the project at Bihar Agriculture University, the institution leading the project in the state. Dr Dutta said that the variants with low ODAP content are likely to have more acceptability among people. In addition, the university also started a seed buy-back policy to develop an effective production chain of quality seeds. This also made growing the variants lucrative for farmer with seeds being bought at the cost of ₹4,200 per quintal. By the end of March 2020, the university had a stock of 150 quintals of seed.Farmers Interest Groups were created for the cultivation and buy-back of the seeds. “Once convinced the new grass pea varieties Ratan and Prateek are safe for human consumption, the farmers agreed to take up cultivation of these varieties and also shared this information with fellow farmers,” the report said.Experts, however, said that the variants were unnecessary as the crops grown in India were already safe for consumption. “The measurement of quantity of ODAP is unnecessary. A person would have to consume 1,100 grams of the pulse every day for three months to possibly get lathyrism, even then it is not a sure shot thing. Once you cook a dal, it expands three times in quantity. Now, tell me who is drinking so much dal? No case of lathyrism has been reported from Bangladesh where there is a very high consumption of Kesari dal,” said Dr Shantilal Kothari, an activist, microbiologist and nutrition expert, who was one of the people who worked to get the ban revoked.Also Read | Adani Group clarifies it does not buy food grains from farmers; only manages storage for FCI“Also, any modified variant is likely to go back to producing the same amount of ODAP, depending on soil and climactic conditions,” he said.Dr Swapan K Dutta, former deputy director general (crop science) at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research said, “The Kesari dal that is currently commercially available does not have high enough ODAP to cause harm to humans and is safe for consumption. The reason for the restrictions at the time (in 1961) was the drought-like conditions leading to higher ODAP production in the crop. In addition, a famine-like situation meant that people ended up having higher quantities of Kesari dal, which is a hardy crop that can survive in a drought, in the absence of anything else.”He added that lifting of the ban had led to reduction in import of pulses. “In 2014 and 15, we were struggling to meet the demand of dal in the country and were importing enormous quantities each day; today we are in a good shape. We still need to produce more pulses so that they become cheap and the protein rich food source is available to all,” said Dr Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-promote-kesari-dal-variants-with-lower-levels-of-neurotoxin-101616144001480.html

According to reports, this new rule will come into effect from March 22, next Monday. The restriction has been announced a day after the city recorded the highest-ever single-day spike with 2,877 fresh cases on Thursday. With 17,153 active cases, the Mumbai district now has the third-highest number of active infections in the country.While several districts of Maharashtra have brought back night curfews, local restrictions, there has been no decision on imposing similar curbs in Mumbai. Mumbai currently has 34 active containment zones and 267 buildings sealed. The authorities have also revealed that the maximum of the new infections reported in the last two months has been from apartments. Between March 17 and 18, the BMC authorities traced 14,979 high-risk contacts, its latest bulletin said. The civic authorities are also penalising night clubs, wedding hall authorities, individuals for flouting rules.As about 95 per cent of the new cases in Maharashtra are asymptomatic, testing and tracking are most important to contain the spread of the infection, the state government said. On Thursday, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held a virtual meeting with divisional commissioners and asked them to ensure that restrictions are not being violated.What are the news rules in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation areas?> No religious/cultural/political gathering allowed> Cinemas (single screen/multiplex) and hotels to operate at 50% capacity> 50 people allowed for weddings & 20 for funerals> All offices, except health & essential, to operate at 50% - work from home advised.> Residential buildings with more than five active Covid-19 patients will be sealed.> Compulsory 7-day institutional quarantine for travellers coming to Mumbai from Brazil.> Hands of citizens instructed to quarantine at home will be stamped.> Marshals appointed to take action against those travelling in local trains without masks.> Regular inspection at halls, wedding venues.> Citizens flouting these rules will be fined, prosecuted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-negative-report-mandatory-to-enter-shopping-malls-in-mumbai-101616141550595.html
19-03-2021||India||ED, Kerala police on collision course over gold smuggling probe||The Kerala police crime branch on Friday lodged a case against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for allegedly trying to implicate chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the gold smuggling case as the state's election draws near.This comes after some of the accused in the case recently alleged that they had been forced to take big names by the ED and two police officers who were escorting the accused gave a statement mentioning that they had overheard the ED officials' threats in this regard. Another police official said that she was a witness to ED officials threatening the main accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh.This move leads to the state police flexing their muscles with the Central agency. The police had received legal advice that they could register a case against a Central agency for threatening, false implications, and other charges. However, legal experts have said that ED officials could not be implicated so easily by the state police.On July 5, 2020, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs had seized 30kg of 24 karat gold worth over ₹14 crore at the Thiruvananthapuram airport which was supposed to be delivered to the UAE Consulate in the city.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe named Swapna Suresh as one of the accused and after further investigation, it was found that CM Pinarayi Vijayan's principal secretary M Sivasankar had links to Suresh. Sivasankar was suspended and eventually removed from his postThe customs department had, on March 5, told the Kerala High Court that CM Vijayan, three of his ministers and the Speaker knew of the gold smuggling activities through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.The chief minister had said that the Trivandrum airport, which was under the Centre's control, was a hub for gold smuggling and asked Union home minister Amit Shah for answers at a public gathering in Kannur on March 9."Trivandrum Airport is completely under the control of the central government. How did Trivandrum airport become a hub for gold smuggling after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power? Amit Shah should answer it. Not Kerala CM but Amit Shah has the responsibility to answer it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-kerala-police-on-collision-course-over-gold-smuggling-probe-101616138226880.html

Addressing an interaction in Lahowal, Dibrugarh in the state, Gandhi also slammed the BJP at the Centre for the decline in democracy, increasing unemployment amongst youth, Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA) and farm laws protest.Click here for complete coverage on assembly electionsReferring to Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in the city of Nagpur, he said one force from Nagpur is trying to control the entire country."You think democracy is declining. Youth is unemployed, farmers are protesting, CAA is there. The question is what is India? People from different cultures, languages, religions make up India. We can't ask the people of Assam to forget their culture, history and language if they come to Delhi. The day we say this, the idea of India ends . One force, born in Nagpur, trying to control the whole country," Gandhi said.During the student interaction ahead of the Assam assembly elections, Gandhi urged the youth to actively participate in politics and fight for the state when they feel the state is being robbed by an outside force. Democracy means the voice of Assam should control Assam, he added."Democracy means the voice of Assam should control Assam. If we don't include students then there can be no democracy. Youth should actively participate in politics and fight for Assam when you feel the state is being robbed. You will have to fight with love not with stones, lathis," said the Wayanad MP.Interacting with one of the students, the Congress leader said the biggest sale the government is doing is that of the agriculture sector. Reiterating his 'hum do hamare do' stance against the Narendra Modi-led BJP government, he said the new farm laws are an attempt to privatise the sector and hand it over to big businesses.Also Read | ‘Every vaccine doesn't require universal immunisation': Harsh Vardhan in LSGandhi also took a dig at the Prime Minister when one of the students said that PM Modi only comes to the state during elections.

19-03-2021||India||East Ladakh stand-off with China on US top official Lloyd Austin’s India agenda||China’s aggression in Ladakh, terrorism in the region and steps to further cement India-US defence ties will be on the top of the agenda when the US defence secretary Lloyd Austin arrives in India this evening for the first in-person engagement between the Modi government and Joe Biden administration, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.“This is Secretary Austin’s first visit abroad after the Quad summit and the first high-level visit by a senior representative of the new US administration. Meetings will be on broad issues, not a detailed exchange of specifics,” said a senior government official.India is the third stop of Austin’s three-nation tour, an effort by the Biden administration to bolster a united front against China which was famously described by Austin as the “pacing threat”.“China … presents the most significant threat going forward because China is ascending,” Austin told the Senate confirmation hearing back in January, underlining that in contrast to Beijing, the threat from Moscow “is in decline”.“Our goal is to make sure that we have the capabilities and the operational plans and concepts to be able to offer credible deterrence to China or anybody else who wants to take on the US.”Austin’s arrival in Delhi coincides with a crucial meeting between top officials of the Biden administration and President Xi Jinping’s China in Alaska. By all accounts, this is expected to be a difficult meeting with Washington determined to red flag its concerns around several issues such as human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan and western Xinjiang region apart from China’s assertiveness in the neighbourhood. These are issues that Xi Jinping’s party believes the Biden administration should steer clear of.US secretary of state Antony Blinken amped the pitch well before the meeting starts, referring to Beijing’s “consistent failure to uphold its commitments” and its “aggressive and authoritarian behaviour” that challenges the stability of the Indo-Pacific region.This is an issue that is also going to be discussed when Austin holds meetings with top Indian leaders.The US defence secretary is scheduled to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after 6pm today to deepen bilateral defence cooperation and further Quad. His formal meeting with his counterpart, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, is slated for tomorrow.The former US Central Command chief will also hold talks with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval; the two sides are expected to discuss ways to deepen bilateral cooperation and counter-terrorism.As the 12th Central Command chief, Secretary Austin is well versed with the threat to global security from radicalization and terrorism after seeing the rise of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He also has first-hand experience of the threat posed by terrorist groups in Pakistan to India.Officials said the Indian side is expected to brief the visiting dignitary about the on-going stand-off with China in the East Ladakh region where the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is still to disengage from Gogra-Hot Springs and Depsang areas.Rather than complete the disengagement from the entire stretch of the Line of Actual Control, Beijing has been going slow on withdrawing troops from the friction points. China wants Delhi to bracket the boundary dispute separately from bilateral ties and resume the economic relationship unmindful of what happened in May 2020 on the north banks of Pangong Tso and elsewhere.The US, which has tracked the East Ladakh stand-off very closely, is quite clear on PLA aggression and has a firm idea about PLA’s capability in the Western Theatre with India. The friction between the two countries in the East Ladakh sector was also discussed when leaders of the four-nation Quad grouping held their first summit and vowed to hold a second in-person meeting later this year.The discussion at Austin’s meetings in Delhi would be much more granular..The two sides are not expected to sign any agreements during Secretary Austin’s visit but they do hope to firm up the roadmap to deepen defence cooperation and intelligence sharing in the Indo-Pacific. This will be done through interoperability exercises and joint training designed to make them the first responders in the vast ocean while the navies of the two other Quad members, Japan and Australia, hold the other fringes. The Quad navies plus France are scheduled to exercise in the Bay of Bengal from April 4-7 under the La Perouse banner.India and the US have robust defence technology cooperation with Washington now willing to offer a number of high-end technologies for manufacture in India under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” rubric.

Not each and every person in the world will be vaccinated. The prioritisation process is a dynamic process. The behaviour of the virus is also dynamic. All things are based on scientific facts, scrutiny and vision of the overall scientific and health community, ” the minister said.“There is a well-defined group of experts called National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration. What you are seeing today is the hard work of the people in the ministry and this group, which was set up by the Prime Minister in August. Since then, they have been working closely with all scientific developments related to this,” the minister said.Under India’s present universal immunization programme, free vaccines are provided against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases, including Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, Rubella, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and Meningitis, etc.Answering another question from Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu over the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, the minister said that vaccines are the way to get rid of vaccine-preventable diseases. There are detailed pre-clinical, clinical trials, which get thoroughly studied by the experts before a vaccine gets the nod.

Efforts were being made to trace them, but the possibility of their death due to infighting cannot be ruled out, they added.The people said the movement of the tigers was last captured on camera in the reserve’s non-tourism zone in March 2020.

That the tigers have gone missing cannot be confirmed in haste, the official added. The official said the tigers may have moved out and gone to Madhya Pradesh. Such movements have been reported earlier too.Also Read | Karnataka registers 37% jump in tiger attacks in 2020-21 from last yearThe official emphasised that there are limited cameras installed in the forest areas and sometimes they do not capture the movement of big cats.

In its editorial on Friday in Saamana, the party mouthpiece, Sena said his transfer does not mean he is guilty.The bomb scare incident outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia in February led to the major shake-up in the city’s police force. On Wednesday (March 17), Param Bir Singh was transferred to a low-key post in Home Guard and senior IPS officer Hemant Nagrale was made the new commissioner, after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze and claimed that there are many other players involved in the case.Watch | 'Param Bir Singh transferred to aid probe in Sachin Waze case': Anil Deshmukh“The government has to do the rejig in police under certain specific circumstances. Param Bir Singh was replaced in the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner, which doesn't mean he is guilty. He took the command of the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner during very difficult times," read the editorial, as reported by news agency ANI. It also took a note of Singh’s commitment towards the fight against Covid-19, as he went to Dharavi, which was a hotbed of infections last year.Broaching the cases of Sushant Singh Rajput and TRP scam, Sena wrote that a lobby in Delhi had grudges against him, following the unearthing of the TRP scam.Seeking justification of an NIA (National Investigation Agency) probe into the case, Sena asked what the terror angle is in this case. "NIA investigates matters related to terrorism. But despite not having any link to terrorism, the agency has been handed over the case. What is the matter? What probe did the NIA do in the Uri attack, the Pathankot attack, and the Pulwama attack? How many criminals have been arrested? This too is a mystery. But 20 gelatin sticks in Mumbai seems to prove to be a big challenge for NIA," it wrote.An explosive-laden SUV was found parked outside Antilia on February 25. Twenty-odd gelatin sticks and a threat letter were found. The SUV was traced to Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran who was found dead soon after the incident – on February 5. Hiran’ wife complained against Waze claiming Waze was forcing Hiran to get arrested in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sena-defends-param-bir-singh-in-saamana-says-delhi-lobby-had-grudges-against-him-101616130448510.html

Another achievement of the Central Government's 'eradicate employment campaign'," he said in a tweet in Hindi.The unnamed news report claimed that a large number of people lost their jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and 71 lakh EPF accounts were closed in nine months.Gandhi has been attacking the government over the handling of the farmers agitation and the pandemic, claiming many people lost their jobs during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-attacks-govt-for-not-paying-tributes-to-farmers-who-lost-lives-during-protest-101616114040738.html
19-03-2021||India||Olive Ridley turtle mortality declines in Odisha this year: Official||The number of deaths of Olive Ridley sea turtles along the Odisha coast has come down this year as the state forest department has taken various measures for the protection of the endangered marine species and their habitats, an official said.Around 2,575 carcasses of Olive Ridleys have been counted in the current year so far, while 6,320 fatalities were reported in the 2019-20 nesting season."The decline in the number of turtle deaths is encouraging as the forest department has been taking measures to protect the marine species," the official said.However, the Orissa High Court has recently directed the state government to enforce a prohibition on fishing activities by trawlers near the mouth of Devi river and along the coast to protect the marine species.Based on a report submitted by a committee, the court observed that there is "incidental killing of turtles due to suffocation in fishing nets or by injuries inflicted by the propellers of the trawlers".The Olive Ridley turtles turn up in millions for mass nesting along the Odisha coast every year.Gahirmatha beach in Kendrapara district is acclaimed as the world's largest-known nesting site for the endangered marine species.Apart from Gahirmatha, turtles turn up at the mouths of Rushikulya and Devi river for mass nesting.Around 7.30 lakh olive ridley turtles had turned up for their annual sojourn of mass nesting in the 2019-20 season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/olive-ridley-turtle-mortality-declines-in-odisha-this-year-official-101616113432305.html
19-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand govt to allow completion of 7 hydel projects||The Centre has decided to allow the completion of seven under-construction hydropower projects in Uttarakhand, a top official in the environment ministry said, indicating the government’s desire to push ahead with these projects despite opposition from activists and local residents, which has resurfaced again in recent weeks following the February 7 flash flood on the Rishi Ganga that claimed at least 72 lives and damaged two projects.The decision has been taken by the ministries of environment, power and Jal Shakti, and will be communicated to the Supreme Court, which is hearing a matter on hydropower projects, this person added on condition of anonymity.“Those hydropower projects which have completed 50% of construction will be allowed to go ahead,” this person said.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, too, tweeted on March 15 his response to a question in Rajya Sabha that sanctioned projects will be allowed to go ahead, but no new projects will be initiated in the upper reaches on Ganga.The projects at Tapovan Vishnugad (520 MW) on Dhauliganga river which was completely destroyed in the February 7 glacier breach; Vishnugad Pipalkoti (444 MW) on Alaknanda river; Tehri Stage II (1000 MW) on Bhagirathi river; Singoli Bhatwari (99 MW) on Mandakini river; Phata-Buyong (76 MW) on Mandakini river; Madhyamaheshwar (15 MW) on Madhmaheshwar Ganga; and Kaliganga II (6 MW) on Kaliganga river all meet this criterion.“Most of the under-construction projects that the Centre plans to go ahead with are located in extremely sensitive areas in the vicinity of the paraglacial zone and are to the north of MCT. These include Tapovan Vishnugad, Vishnugad Pipalkoti, Phata Byung, Singoli Bhatwari, Madhmaheshwar and Kaliganga. Phata Byung was completely buried in the 2013 disaster, Singoli Bhatwari was also destroyed. The Centre should have decommissioned these under-construction projects immediately after the 2013 disaster. The focus should shift to conserving the Himalayas and not making them further vulnerable to disasters by allowing these projects,” said Hemant Dhyani, member of the Supreme Court-appointed expert body to study the environmental impact of hydropower projects.MCT or main central thrust is a geological fault that lies along the Himalayas.Following the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods which killed at least 5,000, the Supreme Court on August 13, 2013 ruled that no new hydroelectric power projects should be set up in the state. In all, 69 projects were envisaged in the region at the time; 24 had been granted environmental clearances, which were also stayed by the apex court.The court sought a detailed assessment of the cumulative impact of hydropower plants in the state. Following the order, a committee headed by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute, submitted a detailed report which warned that glacial retreat in the state, coupled with structures built for hydroelectricity generation and dams, could lead to large-scale disasters downstream.It also underlined that paraglacial zones (above 2,000 metres) and areas north of the main central thrust are extremely vulnerable to landslides, Glacial Lake Overflow Floods, and hence not ideal locations for hydropower projects.Subsequently, the top court, in its order dated January 24, 2015 in Alaknanda Hydro Power Co. Ltd Versus Anuj Joshi & Ors, directed a common policy framework to be created by the ministries of environment, Jal Shakti, and power for implementation of projects in the upper reaches of the Ganga.That process took time.Minutes of a meeting held in the chamber of the principal secretary to the Prime Minister on February 25, 2019 said that no new hydropower project would come up on the Ganga or its tributaries in Uttarakhand, but made an exception for the seven projects under construction where 50% of the work was complete.Now, the ministries are ready to present their conclusion to the court.“This shows that the government is turning a blind eye to recurrent disasters. The only rationale to allow these seven is that the money has already been spent but that doesn’t mean you have to go ahead with faulty and risky propositions,” said Mallika Bhanot, an Uttarakhand based environment activist associated with Ganga Ahvaan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-to-allow-completion-of-7-hydel-projects-101616113075080.html

19-03-2021||India||Mumbai top cop shunted to ensure fair probe: Minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said that former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh was shunted out due to “serious and unpardonable mistakes” committed by some of his colleagues in the commissionerate, in what were his first comments after Wednesday’s high-profile transfer.Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) head Sachin Vaze was removed and arrested recently in connection with the explosives found in a car parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home last month.“The transfer of Mumbai Police commissioner was to ensure the ongoing probe by the National Investigation Agency and the state anti-terrorism squad is not hampered. The decision was taken collectively in the meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” Deshmukh said.While NIA is probing the explosives found in a Scorpio parked outside the Ambani residence, Antilia, on February 25, ATS is investigating the death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who is linked to the Scorpio. “Maharashtra Police has been doing a fantastic job. Its morale is high, but the entire force is made to bear the brunt of the mistakes committed by a few officers. Those officers, be it an API (assistant police inspector) or senior rank officer, will not be spared if found guilty. Singh was the commissioner and the case [of explosives] was under his jurisdiction. Vehicles belonging to the commissionerate were used in the incident. Drivers and colleagues were found to be involved in the case, and so a thorough probe is a must,” he said.NIA has so far seized five vehicles, including a white Innova that belonged to the CIU and was found in the Motor Transport Department of the state police, in Nagpada area, as well as a black Mercedes-Benz parked in the premises of the Azad Maidan police station.Deshmukh denied the claim made by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis who said that CM Uddhav Thackeray recommended Vaze’s reinstatement in the police force. Deshmukh also refuted speculation that his position in the cabinet was under a cloud.“It is a political allegation levelled by Fadnavis. The decision related to the reinstatement of any officer of the rank of API is done at the level of police commissioner. A five-member committee headed by the commissioner, comprising other high-ranking officers at the Commissionerate, take the decision after a review. There was no question of appointing Vaze at the government level. CM or home minister deal with the reinstatement of officers of the rank above additional superintendent of police,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-top-cop-shunted-to-ensure-fair-probe-minister-101616101206750.html
19-03-2021||India||CBI raids in Haryana and Himachal on Mondelez Foods premises||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday raided five locations in Himachal Pradesh and Haryana in connection with a tax case against Mondelez Foods Private Limited (earlier known as Cadbury India Private Limited), people familiar with the matter said.The central agency has filed a case against the company, its former executives and several government officials for alleged misrepresentation of facts to avail area-based tax exemption benefits worth around Rs.241 crore in Baddi town of Himachal Pradesh, officials said.Officials said that a preliminary enquiry (PE) filed by the CBI in 2017 was converted into an FIR following a nod from the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). A PE is the first stage of any investigation by the CBI.According to the FIR filed by the CBI, the 2017 enquiry revealed that the chocolate firm had proposed a manufacturing unit in Baddi in 2007 in order to avail area-based excise and tax exemption. To avail the same, some members of the executive board of the company, along with key managers, collectively manipulated records, engaged intermediaries to route bribes to government officials and covered up evidence, the FIR added.Cadbury officials, the CBI said, “paid bribes, misrepresented facts and manipulated records to fraudulently avail area-based exemption benefits (central excise and income tax) in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, knowing fully well that they were not entitled to avail area-based tax exemption benefits”.Instead of expanding production by creating a unit, Cadbury decided to increase the production capacity in its existing unit and avail tax exemption from May 2005, the FIR said.Mondelez India said it was yet to receive any formal communication in this regard from the authorities.Among those named in the FIR include Cadbury’s then vice president (finance) Vikram Arora, Rajesh Garg (former director, finance) and former director Jaiboy Phillips (then director, supply chain).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-raids-in-haryana-and-himachal-on-mondelez-foods-premises-101616100711443.html

How many more farmers do you want to kill? The Constitution has been amended more than 100 times in the past, so why can it not be done again?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-threatens-to-move-sc-over-farm-laws-101616100379769.html
19-03-2021||India||Patriarchal justice won't do: SC lays down the law||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed all courts in the country to desist from commenting upon the dressing, behaviour, past conduct, morals or chastity of women, or suggest any “compromise formula” while deciding cases of sexual offences, emphasising that “entrenched paternalistic and misogynistic attitudes that are regrettably reflected at times in judicial orders’’ must be forbidden.The court issued a slew of directives, along with a checklist for judges, to eliminate social bias from entering judicial reasoning. A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and S Ravindra Bhat set aside a July 2020 order of the Madhya Pradesh high court asking a molestation case accused to get a rakhi tied on his wrist by the complainant as a condition for bail. The top court held that this order transformed a molester into a brother by judicial mandate and, thus, reflected adversely on the entire justice delivery system.“This is wholly unacceptable and has the effect of diluting and eroding the offence of sexual harassment. The law does not permit or countenance such conduct, where the survivor can potentially be traumatised many times over or be led into some kind of non-voluntary acceptance or be compelled by the circumstances to accept and condone behaviour what is a serious offence,” it said.Writing the judgment for the bench, justice Bhat handed out a checklist for the judges on what must be avoided during judicial proceedings and could never become part of an order, saying the use of reasoning or language which diminishes the offence and trivialises the survivor has to be avoided under all circumstances.“Thus, the following conduct, actions or situations are hereby deemed irrelevant, e.g. to say that the survivor had in the past consented to such or similar acts or that she behaved promiscuously, or by her acts or clothing, provoked the alleged action of the accused, that she behaved in a manner unbecoming of chaste or “Indian” women, or that she had called upon the situation by her behaviour, etc,” the bench said.Bail conditions and orders, the court said, should avoid reflecting stereotypical or patriarchal notions about women and their place in society, besides ensuring no contact between the accused and the complainant as a condition for bail. “In other words, discussion about the dress, behaviour, or past ‘conduct’ or ‘morals’ of the prosecutrix (survivor), should not enter the verdict granting bail,” said the court, adding that judges should show extreme sensitivity in such cases and desist from expressing any stereotype. Justice Bhat listed out 12 examples of stereotypical opinions, including comments on how a “good” woman and a “good” mother should behave in society; being alone at night or wearing certain clothes makes women responsible for being attacked; a woman consuming alcohol, smoking, etc may justify unwelcome advances by men or “has asked for it”; or a suspicion around a sexually active woman in assessing consent in sexual offence cases.The bench clarified that these instances were only illustrations of an attitude, which should never enter judicial orders or be considered relevant while making a judicial decision, and added that the idea was that the “greatest extent of sensitivity is to be displayed in the judicial approach, language and reasoning adopted by the judge”.Underlining that judges had to play a vital role as teachers and thought leaders, the bench directed that courts should not suggest, entertain or encourage any steps towards a compromise between a complainant and the accused to get married, or any other form of settlement between them. Accepting the suggestion by attorney general KK Venugopal and by lawyer Aparna Bhat, who along with eight other women lawyers had challenged the Madhya Pradesh high court order, the apex court also ordered that a module on gender sensitisation be included as part of the foundational training of every judge. It asked the National Judicial Academy to devise, preferably within three months, necessary inputs which have to be made part of training of young judges, as well as form part of judges’ continuing education on gender sensitisation.The bench asked the Bar Council of India to consult subject experts and circulate a paper for discussion with law faculties and colleges and universities in regard to courses that should be taught at the undergraduate level, in the LLB programme, in addition to including topics on sexual offences and gender sensitisation in the syllabus for the All-India Bar Examination.In its 24-page judgment, the bench higlighted that violence against women in India was systematic and was usually underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal social norms and inter- and intra-gender hierarchies.“Women are discriminated against and subordinated not only on the basis of sex, but on other grounds too, such as caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, tradition and other realities. Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence...This silence needs to be broken. In doing so, men, perhaps more than women have a duty and role to play in averting and combating violence against women,” held the court.It regretted that outlaw behaviours such as stalking, shades of verbal and physical assault, and harassment were categorised as minor offences. “Such ‘minor’ crimes are, regrettably not only trivialised or normalised, rather they are even romanticised and therefore, invigorated in popular lore such as cinema. These attitudes – which indulgently view the crime through prisms such as ‘boys will be boys’ and condone them – nevertheless have a lasting and pernicious effect on the survivors,” lamented the bench. The challenges Indian women face are formidable, noted the court. “They include a misogynistic society with entrenched cultural values and beliefs, bias (often sub-conscious) about the stereotypical role of women, social and political structures that are heavily male-centric.” Former additional solicitor general and senior counsel Indira Jaising told HT: “Judges of the high courts and the Supreme Court also need sensitisation. They must practice what they preach. In my opinion, a much deeper exercise of gender audit of all courts needs to be made by a committee of retired judges who have proved their commitment to gender justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patriarchal-justice-won-t-do-sc-lays-down-the-law-101616099547026.html

In a review meeting held on Thursday evening, the MP chief minister instructed the transport department to stop the movement of all kinds of passenger buses to and from Maharashtra from March 20. CM Chouhan also directed officials to make necessary arrangements for inoculating 5 lakh people per day with the Covid-19 vaccine. “The infection is spreading again but we can’t ban economic activities. Precautions are the best way to contain the spread,” Chouhan said.Chouhan said that a large number of labourers will return to their villages and towns during the Holi festival. He asked the district administration to provide employment to them under MNREGA and other schemes so that the labourers could stay in their villages. On Thursday, 917 cases have been recorded in the state. As many as 1778 positive cases have been recorded in Indore in the past one week followed by 1170 cases in Bhopal, 358 in Jabalpur, 185 in Gwalior, 187 in Ujjain, 162 in Ratlam, 147 in Chhindwara, 130 in Burhanpur, 110 in Betul and 92 in Khargone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-bans-movement-of-passenger-buses-to-and-from-maharashtra-101616096297134.html

Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, who was also in charge of the department, moved the Bihar Lokayukta (amendment) Bill, 2021, which proposes to restrict proclivity to file fabricated complaints against public servants. As per the bill, false complaints will lead to punitive action, including imprisonment up to three years and fine, against the compliant. Though many opposition leaders, including Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma and RJD’s Lalit Yadav, said such harsh punishment could discourage whistle-blowers and embolden the corrupt, the amendments were rejected. “It has come to light that fictitious complaints are also being lodged before the Lokayukta, which leads to wastage of time of the institution. As there is no provision in the present Act under which action could be taken against those lodging false complaints, the amendment bill has been necessitated in keeping with such provision in the Lokayukta Act of other states,” says the bill. Another bill is the Bihar taxation disputes resolution bill, 2021, moved by Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds the finance portfolio. It proposes to identify ways for growth in state’s resources affected due to the pandemic. It repeals the Bihar taxation disputes resolution ordinance (second), 2020. “In view of Covid-19 pandemic, which has affected economic activities across the country, it was necessary to bring a new taxation dispute settlement (amendment) bill with some modifications, though a law in this regard was in place since 2015,” he said. The third bill is the Bihar Municipal (amendment) Bill, 2021, which provides greater autonomy to the civic bodies to ensure smooth, transparent and uniform recruitment process on created posts. It also proposes effective curb on encroachment on public roads The fourth bill is the Bihar civil courts bill, 2021. It has been brought to have a separate civil courts bill for Bihar. Earlier, Bihar was also included in the Bengal, Agra and Assam civil courts Act, 1887 enacted during the British rule. “It is a historic day for the Bihar civil courts,” said Bijendra Prasad Yadav. The House also passed the Bihar appropriation excess expenditure (1984-85) bill, 2021 to regulate the excess expenditure of ₹39910 through the consolidated fund on the recommendation of the public accounts committee||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-assembly-clears-5-bills-fake-complaints-to-lokayukta-to-invite-penal-action-101616095577052.html

A family member is among those arrested, said police. On December 21, Balaram Sonkar, his wife Dularibai, son Rohit Sonkar and daughter-in-law Kirti were murdered, while Rohit’s son Durgesh was seriously injured. Durg police said that they have arrested Gangaram Sonkar (35), son of deceased Balaram, and his three associates. “Further investigation in the case is underway,” said a senior police official. An ancestral property dispute among family members has come to fore, said police.“Gangaram had been asking for a passage to get to his 1.5 acre of land through the vegetable field of his mother but she and his brother had refused. There was also an issue of the ownership of a land which was in the possession of Gangaram,” the police press note said. Gangaram had earlier threatened to kill his mother but nobody took it seriously, an official said. Police said that they formed a dozen teams to solve the case and also performed polygraph tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-for-murder-of-parents-2-other-family-members-in-chhattisgarh-101616095157013.html
19-03-2021||India||Relief for migrant workers: ‘One nation, one ration card’ expands to 32 states||The Modi government’s “one nation, one ration card” programme, a digital system aimed at enabling countrywide access to subsidized foodgrains for 80 million migrant workers, is now operational in all 32 states, while four states are in the process of digitizing their networks, data from the food ministry shows.Between August and February, there were 230 million transactions through the digitized system, the data show.The government has also rolled out “Mera Ration”, a mobile app, available to 67% of the population or over 800 million beneficiaries of subsidized grains under the National Food Security Act 2013, food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told HT. The app will show beneficiaries real-time data of ration stocks, their share and nearest fair-price shops from where they can procure cheap grains.The one nation, one ration card system will come as a boon for migrant workers, who could not access their share of cheap foodgrains when they relocated from their native places for work in cities because the system did not allow for it.A migrant worker just needs to present his ration card, which is now seeded with the 12-digit biometric Aadhaar, in digitized ration shops to withdraw subsidised foodgrains, a lifeline for 67% of Indians deemed food-insure.The new digital network does away with the need for a migrant to make a fresh ration card, a cumbersome task, while shifting to faraway cities or another district for work to be able to withdraw grains from the public distribution system (PDS).During the peak pandemic months, the plight of thousands of workers fleeing cities, facing hunger and distress in the aftermath of the coronavirus lockdown, could have been eased had the programme to make subsidized rations portable for migrants been fully operational. The programme hadn’t gained the scale and reach to be a mitigating factor then.According to data from the ministry, West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Assam are yet to operationalize the system or at an advanced stage of implementing it. “The problem with Assam is that Aadhaar penetration is low. Delhi and West Bengal are almost ready with the digital infrastructure,” Pandey said.In 32 states, the scheme is now fully geared for seamless inter-state and even intra-state transactions. Inter-state portability, whereby a migrant draws subsidised food in a state other than his own, ensures in-kind subsidies move with migrants wherever they go.The Economic Survey 2016-17 used some new metrics to give updated data on migration. It suggested an annual inter-state migration flow of close to 9 million from 2011 to 2016 in a “circular” fashion based on data from railways.The first portability trials were done by September 2018 in clusters in six states. By January 2020, 12 states -- Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Maharasthra, Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Jharkhand and Tripura – were in.The system essentially allowed for “state-level portability”, meaning ration-card holders could draw rations from any electronically linked fair price shops within their “district or state”.A novel cohort-based migration metric, a statistical tool developed by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, revealed an annual “inter-state migrant population of about 60 million and an inter-district migration as high as 80 million” between 2001 and 2011. Subramanian had called for full portability of all welfare doles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-relief-for-migrant-workers-one-nation-one-ration-card-expands-to-32-states-101616094437932.html
19-03-2021||India||Hometown residents laud Tamil Nadu CM on infra, rue lack of jobs||Salem: Residents of Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s Siluvampalayam village fondly recall the man riding his motorcycle around town, sourcing jaggery from sugarcane farmers, and selling it at a market in near-by Erode. They say Palaniswami’s personality has not changed much and are happy over the infrastructure he has developed in the village but lament a lack of job opportunities, particularly for educated young people.Palaniswami’s constituency, Edapaddi, named after the biggest town in the region, has good roads, roundabouts shaded by bougainvillea trees, and streetlights amid rolling fields. It also has an arts and sciences college. Palaniswami inaugurated the college in 2014 and made higher education accessible particularly to women such as M Lavanya, 24.Lavanya, an MBA graduate, who belongs to the most backward fisherfolk community, completed her undergraduate and master’s courses from the college as a topper. After campus placement, she moved to Chennai’s Tata Consultancy Services, where she worked for three months before returning home to get married. She later took another job before quitting again to take care of her child. Lavanya now plans to take up a local panchayat office job for ₹4,000 a month. Her husband, a mechanical engineer by training, has been forced to work as a mason. “There is no value for our degree here,” said Lavanya.Lavanya is grateful that she went to the college, where she shifted to from a private college, 20-kilometer away. “In our village, they would not let girls study after class 12. It is only because of this college that our families are allowing us to study,” she said. “The chief minister has done a lot for us here. We see him often when he comes for our sports day or annual day.” Agriculture and textile manufacturing are the prime job-generating sectors in the area where most of the people are from the Gounder community of Palaniswami, or Vanniyars and Nadars.Residents say Palaniswami, who is contesting from Edappadi is expected to win his seat with a higher margin for the fifth time in the April 6 elections. Palaniswami, who joined the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in 1974, was elected to the assembly earlier in 1989, 1991, 2011, and 2016.L Ilaykya, a shopkeeper, said she will vote for the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) like the rest of her family, but added that she still wants Palaniswami to be re-elected from his constituency. “Women have security financially through government schemes, farm loans, and jewellery loans waivers,” said Ilaykya, who belongs to the Nadar caste. “The road infrastructure and lights at night also offer us protection. Even the care at government hospitals is better than private facilities.” M Mani, a farmer, said he too hopes Palaniswami wins so that their village continues to develop. Mani’s brother, K Subramani, who died in 2016, was a DMK panchayat leader. “Since his death, I have been supporting him [Palaniswami],” said Mani, a Gounder. He praised Palaniswami for the farm loan waiver and redirecting surplus water from the Cauvery and added it will work to his advantage. Mani added that the DMK candidate K Sampathkumar also enjoys a good reputation, but the people are more familiar Palaniswami.P Madeshwaran, a tailor and Palaniswami supporter, said they do not require anything for free if basic amenities are met. “If farmers have enough water...there is no requirement for loan waivers,” said Madeshwaran, who farms whenever there is water. Madeshwaran, a Vanniyar, said the 10.5% reservation for the community that Palaniswami announced just before elections would help. “There are two graduates in my family who are weaving cloth along with my wife at home. With this reservation, it will help them get jobs at least in nearby places since there is no job opportunity here.”The college remains the most talked about. It has a sprawling campus with three blocks where arts, sciences, and polytechnic courses are taught to 680 women and 780 men. “The locality is backward, and this college will uplift them,” said the college principal, P Venkateshwaran. “90% of them [students] are from MBC [most backward castes] and 5% from BC [backward castes] and 5% from SC [scheduled castes]. They are the first graduates of their families. The chief minister has focussed on infrastructure and education development.”Palaniswami’s house is located in Siluvampalayam village, around 10-kilometers from Edappadi town, adjacent to that of his brother Govindaraj’s. The houses stand out among the cement-floored modest homes alongside well-laid tar roads, and plantain, and sugarcane farms.Govindaraj, a farmer, said his brother has come up through the ranks. “We always knew he will be in a high position but coming from a small village we never thought he would one day be ...the chief minister,” Govindaraj. He added they are a close-knit family with an elder sister. “Whenever he is in Salem, he comes home. We do not discuss politics...”A Thalli, a neighbour, said the chief minister’s father donated land to them when they worked for him to build a house.But Thali is unhappy. “Yes, he is the chief minister. So what? How has our life changed?” Her son, A Murugan, said he has spoken to the chief minister about the lack of jobs in the area. “He [Palaniswami] is a good man,” said Murugan. “The chief minister has done all sorts of work on the farm. When he says he understands farmers’ plight, it is true. He has a lot of support here. But the lack of jobs is leaving us frustrated.”On a farm nearby, a group of women wished the constituency had an industrial unit where they could work. “We have been working in these farms under the scorching sun for more than 40 years; all for ₹200 a day,” said Arasamani, showing her palms that have bruises and boils. “I do not have any other option. My son is physically and mentally disabled. So, I have to take care of him.”Unemployment is a key poll issue for Sampathkumar, 36, who is making his electoral debut by contesting against Palaniswami. “The chief minister and his family grew but the constituency and even his own party men have not seen growth,” said Sampathkumar. “He could have done so much more here but he only gave good roads on which he travels... I have promised that we will make job opportunities available; provide basic amenities and create a textile park for the weavers.”M Murugan, Edappadi town secretary, insisted the people are very supportive of the government’s initiatives. “It shows the support and faith they have in the chief minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hometown-residents-laud-tamil-nadu-cm-on-infra-rue-lack-of-jobs-101616092696318.html
19-03-2021||India||Austin urged to raise farmers’ stir, Russian S-400 deal on India visit||Washington Robert Menendez, a Democrat heading the powerful US senate committee on foreign relations, has urged defence secretary Lloyd Austin to raise during his India visit a number of issues that could be uncomfortable for his hosts, such as democratic rights and values in the context of farmer protests and arms purchases from Russia such as the S-400 systems.Austin will reach India on Friday for talks with his counterparts and other officials. His stated agenda, as previewed by the Pentagon last week, include “deepening the US-India major defence partnership and advancing cooperation between our countries for a free, prosperous and open Indo-Pacific and Western Indian Ocean Region”.The defence secretary may or may not bring up Menendez’s issues in his meetings in New Delhi, which will be the first India visit by a member of President Joe Biden’s cabinet, but the senior senator’s call for them to be raised points to tough conversations down the road.Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Austin in a letter on Wednesday to raise “democracy and human rights concerns” in the context of the ongoing farmer protests and 2019 enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the abrogation of Article 370.There is growing disquiet among several US lawmakers over the farmer protests and the government response to them.Invoking the Biden administration’s recently released Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, which underscores the importance of “democracy (as) essential to meeting the challenges of our time”, the senator wrote, “We should seek to partner with India to address challenges from China to climate change, but in doing so we cannot let our democratic values fall away.”Menendez also urged the defence secretary to raise US opposition to India’s planned purchase of the S-400 Russian missile defence systems, which, he wrote, “threatens future US-India defence cooperation and puts India at risk of sanctions” under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), a US law that aims to punish Russia for the 2016 election interference by, among other things, scaring away its defence industry clients with the threat of secondary sanctions.India paid an initial amount of $800 million for five S-400s in 2019 and is expected to receive them by the end of the year.CAATSA sanctions typically kick in when the buyer country accepts the delivery of the Russian equipment, as it happened in the case of Turkey.Turkey accepted the delivery of its first S-400s in July 2019, and the US cut it out next week from the F-35 programme to develop what are said to be the world’s most advanced fighter jets. A fuller range of sanctions was imposed by the Trump administration in December 2020.India hopes to get a waiver from CAATSA sanctions, but US officials have warned against presuming it and have also said that among other things the Russian missile defence systems could impede India’s inter-operability with American defence hardware and could imperil future arms transfers||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/austin-urged-to-raise-farmers-stir-russian-s-400-deal-on-india-visit-101616092516310.html

They then put four or five handkerchiefs in his mouth and covered his entire face with a scarf,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity.“The murderer might have used chloroform to make Hiran unconscious or might have used some other means, because Hiran’s face was covered by number of handkerchiefs and was covered by a mask. Perhaps, he was later (after becoming unconscious) thrown into the water,” the official added.The result of a test submitted by a forensic team at the JJ Hospital on Wednesday confirmed the presence of diatoms in Hiran’s body. Diatoms are single-celled algae and this test is usually conducted to detect their presence in the body to indicate drowning. The report was sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) in Madhuban, Haryana to seek a second opinion.Though the JJ Hospital report suggests that Hiran was alive when he was thrown into the creek, some ATS investigators have raised doubts regarding this line of inquiry.Another car seizedNIA on Thursday seized another luxury car allegedly used by suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, PTI reported. The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado was found parked outside Vaze’s residence in Saket area of adjoining Thane, an agency official said.NIA previously seized a black Mercedes-Benz GLC 220D 4Matic from a parking area of the Azad Maidan police station, which was reportedly used by Vaze. They recovered ₹5 lakh in cash, a note-counting machine, vehicle registration plates and some clothes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bizman-hiran-s-body-had-injuries-on-head-neck-says-ats-officer-101616092396203.html
19-03-2021||India||Don’t object to Rhea bail, disagree with some HC observations: NCB to SC||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday said that it did not object to the bail granted to actor Rhea Chakraborty in a drugs-related case, submitting in the Supreme Court that its objections were to certain observations made by the Bombay high court in its bail order.Arguing for an appeal against the bail order, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general SV Raju appeared for the NCB.“We are not here on the grant of bail. But there are certain observations made by the high court in the order regarding the applicability of the NDPS Act that could make the law unworkable,” Mehta told a bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.But the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said the NCB could not challenge the observations made in the facts of that case. “You cannot file a petition challenging the observations. You can only challenge the order. The observations are prima facie. The observations are made in the facts of the case,” the bench said.The comments from the court prompted Mehta to seek permission to amend the NCB’s petition. “Let this matter be heard next week. We will amend the petition and challenge the high court order,” he said. The bench then adjourned the matter.Rhea, arrested in a case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 7 last year. Dismissing the NCB’s allegations that she financed or supported drug trafficking, the HC said, “She is not part of drug dealers.” There was no evidence to show she forwarded the drugs allegedly procured by her to somebody else to earn monetary or other benefits, the court added.Rajput, 34, was found dead at his flat in Mumbai on June 14 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-object-to-rhea-bail-disagree-with-some-hc-observations-ncb-to-sc-101616092216801.html
19-03-2021||India||India to analyse age-specific death rates in vaccinated people||The national Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee has taken up an exercise to compare age-specific death rates in the inoculated population with the estimated death rate in the same population group that was not immunised against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), people aware of the matter said on Thursday.The World Health Organization (WHO) defines AEFI as any untoward medical event that follows vaccination and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.The AEFI analysis will be being done in the age groups of 20-40, 40-50, 50-60, and 60 years and above.“This is a massive exercise that was started today (Thursday) morning to put people’s minds at ease regarding Covid-19 vaccines. Even though no deaths post vaccinations have been causally linked to vaccines in our review, we are trying to analyse deaths in people who were given Covid-19 vaccination differently. The data is being analysed to know if there are more deaths taking place in the population group that’s given vaccine than in the same age group that’s not given vaccine but die due to other reasons,” said a senior member of the committee, requesting not to be identified.The central government began a review of AEFI data from across the country last week after some countries in the European Union temporarily suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as a precautionary measure based on reports of rare blood clotting events in people receiving the vaccine.“This is being done to overcome any vaccine hesitancy among the masses,” said Dr NK Arora, member, National Covid Task Force, and national AEFI committee.In India, the Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as Covishield, one of the two vaccines approved for use. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which it has co-developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is the other vaccine approved for use.India launched the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16, 2021, and since then, the country has administered at least 36 million vaccine doses.As India immunises a large number of children annually under its national immunisation programme, there is a dedicated AEFI secretariat functional in the country which looks at vaccine-related adverse events.“Only a few countries in the world have this kind of secretariat with a specialised task force; so we will be making use of these technical experts to do the required analysis. If the death rate is more than it should be, it is a cause for concern but if it is the same or lower, then people will understand that it is not Covid-19 vaccines that are causing deaths. This is being done purely for the ease and comfort of people,” the first person quoted above said.The experts will collect all cause mortality data of different age groups from 2018-19 before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country for comparison with mortality data in the vaccinated group.The results are expected to be out in a few days. Prima facie review of 71 deaths in people having received Covid-19 vaccines does not link any of the deaths to the shots.Public health experts are of the opinion that this exercise would help in building vaccine confidence.“It will be good to have this kind of data at the population level,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.WHO, in its latest statement, has recommended that vaccinations should continue. “WHO is in regular contact with the European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccine safety. The WHO COVID-19 Subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine. Once that review is completed, WHO will immediately communicate the findings to the public. At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue,” the WHO statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-analyse-age-specific-death-rates-in-vaccinated-people-101616092098400.html

Maha logs highest single-day cases||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 25,833 new Covid-19 cases while the state capital, Mumbai logged 2,877 new infections, the highest one-day spike ever since the outbreak of the virus in March last year. The previous highest in Maharashtra was 24,886 in September 11 last year while in Mumbai, the previous highest was 2,848 cases on October 7 last year.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray informed that the Center has given a green signal to 134 private hospitals to start vaccination in their premises and asked the authorities to chalk out a plan to vaccinate 3 lakh people daily.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said though it is the peak, one more week is needed to assess the situation.“We need to assess whether the figures come down or go upwards from here. This will require at least a week time. We have,however, managed to reduce the number of deaths from the peak of 350 to 60. Even this needs to be curtailed further,” said Lahane.He said that the cases have also increased due to the increase in the number of daily testing.The government has scaled up testing as was evident as 1,21,335 people were tested in the last 24 hours and 119, 973 before that.The total number of deaths in Maharashtra has now reached to a total of 53,138.Dr Ameet Mandot, who runs the Gut Clinic at Parel, blamed both the citizens as well as authorities for this peak.“The citizens have become very casual and there is no seriousness shown by them in adhering to Covid-19 norms. In addition, the authorities are failing to enforce rules as we are witnessing crowded marriage halls, functions sans social distancing and revellers in pubs dancing away without any masks. There seems to be no effort by the authorities to curb this,” said Mandot.Thackeray in his review meeting on Thursday to assess the Covid-19 spread asked the doctors to keep a watch on the various strains of Covid-19 virus and guide the government in suggesting ways to bring the situation under control.He also ordered the authorities to complete the vaccinations of the priority group within the next three four months.Out of the total 1,66,353 active cases in the state, Pune continues to lead the state with 35,539 active cases followed by Nagpur with 24,209 active cases, Mumbai and Thane take the third and fourth position with 17,153 and 15,548 active cases respectively||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bigger-than-1st-wave-maha-logs-highest-single-day-cases-101616091496782.html

He added that the government welcomes dissent on social media, which has nearly 1.4 billion users in India.“The issue is not the use of social media, it is the abuse of social media,” he said. “Any attempt to create imperialism of the internet by a few companies is not acceptable.”The new guidelines have been welcomed by industry body IAMAI, but critics have said it may lead to over regulation of content. Large social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter are yet to officially comment on the rules. The guidelines cover social media intermediaries such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. They also cover digital new media outfits and over the top content providers, such as Netflix and Hotstar.The government notified three-tier self-regulatory guidelines on February 26. Intermediaries have within 30 to 90 days to comply with the same. Significant social media intermediaries, who have over five million users, have to appoint a compliance officer. At the apex of the grievance redress system is an interministerial committee that will be headed by an official from the ministry of information and broadcasting.“The guidelines are very clear when it comes content that has to be taken down,” Prasad said. “It is 36 hours, when it comes to content regarding the unity, safety and security of India. We have added the dignity of women.”The 36-hour timeline already exists under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, which grants the government power to take emergency action against such content. The minister drew the attention of the House to a debate in 2018, wherein Parliament debated issues revolving around fake news and safety of women. “A commitment was taken from me as the minister to strengthen the provisions around the same,” Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/content-offending-women-s-dignity-to-be-removed-in-24-hrs-prasad-101616091496186.html

19-03-2021||India||The inside story of why Indira Gandhi called the 1977 elections||During his video interaction with Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi on March 2, 2021, Kaushik Basu, former chief economist of the World Bank and currently professor of International Studies and Economics at Cornell University, described his conversation with former President Pranab Mukherjee about Prime Minister Indira Gandhi calling for elections in January 1977.Basu recounted: “I asked Pranab Mukherjee whether it was hubris, the arrogance of an authoritarian leader that she would win? Or was it that she was beginning to have self doubts?” Basu added that Mukherjee told him: “Actually I have direct conversational evidence. She began to think she would lose. But she wanted to put it to the test and have a fair election, even if she would lose. Having made a huge mistake, she wanted to rectify that and bring back democracy”.Almost all the popularly believed notions about why Indira Gandhi unexpectedly called for elections are incorrect.In the second week of November 1976 itself, she told her principal secretary Professor PN Dhar and my father, HY Sharada Prasad, who was her information advisor: “I am going to end the Emergency and call for elections. I know that I will lose, but this is something which I absolutely need to do”.Also Read | Congress built sub-standard buildings: Puri on Central Vista criticismBut till she made her announcement on All India Radio on January 18, 1977, she took great care to ensure that no one in the Congress had the slightest inkling at all. She was especially careful that her son Sanjay Gandhi was kept in the dark; he came to know only from her radio broadcast, and he had an angry showdown with her.It is commonly believed that Indira Gandhi called for elections because the Intelligence Bureau told her that she would win 330 seats. However, she had told PN Dhar and my father in mid-November 1976: “The intelligence agencies will tell me what they think I want to hear. But I know that I am going to lose, even though the IB is telling me that I will win 330 seats. However, it is absolutely necessary for me to call for elections.”A couple of weeks earlier, Michael MacKintosh Foot, who was then United Kingdom’s Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, obliquely hintedto my father that Indira Gandhi would call for elections even though she knew she would lose. Foot, who regarded himself as being Indira Gandhi’s elder brother, and who had the courage to speak frankly with her, spent several days in India in October 1976. He told her to release political prisoners, end press censorship, and he told her several harsh truths about Sanjay Gandhi’s sterilisation programs.She heard Foot patiently, but made no commitments about ending the Emergency. Instead she elaborated on the reasons why she was compelled to declare the Emergency, strongly defended the family planning programme, and firmly told Foot that his good friend, George Fernandes, would have to stand trial on terrorism and treason charges. Foot then spent several hours emphasising Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideals.In spite of being rebuffed by someone with whom he shared a close sibling-like relationship, Foot wrote to my father soon after he returned to UK: “...Crosland (CAR Crosland was UK’s Foreign Secretary) told me that Indira would never call another democratic election, when I was certain that she would do exactly that even if her own hopes of winning were to be confounded…”On February 2, 1977, when Jagjivan Ram and Hemavati Nandan Bahuguna defected, she told my father: “It is all over now. I am sure to lose the elections”. She had a grudging admiration for the wily Bahuguna’s uncanny ability to anticipate changing political trends and always place himself on the winning side. She told my father, “Now that Bahuguna has abandoned me, I will be wiped out in Uttar Pradesh”. And she cryptically added: “It will be a relief if I lose, an absolute relief”.But even then, she did not lose her sense of humour. The day Jagjivan Ram defected was also the day that the Indian cricket team won a consolation test match against Tony Greig’s visiting MCC team, having already lost the test series. She remarked: “As usual, the Indian press has no news sense. The correct priority of the headlines should be—India wins test, Jagjivan Ram defects.”Further, on February 13-14 1977, Indira Gandhi told her good friend, US Senator Charles Percy, that she would lose the elections badly, and that she was worried about her son Sanjay Gandhi.After March 1977, several people tried to take credit for Indira Gandhi’s ending the Emergency. But their claims are not credible.Her friend, the cultural czarina Pupul Jayakar, claimed that her guru, the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurthi, was responsible, because Indira Gandhi had told Krishnamurthi on October 28, 1976 : “I am riding on the back of a tiger. I do not mind the tiger killing me. But I do not know how to get off its back”. Jiddu Krishnamurthi replied to Indira Gandhi that if she thought deeply enough about her situation, she herself would obtain the answer. Jayakar claims that it was this exchange with Jiddu Krishnamurthi which persuaded Indira Gandhi to “end the Emergency, no matter what the consequences would be for her.” Attributing a cause-and-effect to this vague generalised response of Krishnamurthi seems far fetched.The followers of the Shankaracharya of Kanchi, especially Subramanian Swamy, too claimed after March 1977 that his refusal to speak to her was instrumental in Indira Gandhi’s ending the Emergency. This is inaccurate. She had very high regard for the Kanchi Shankaracharya. The day she called on him, he was observing a vow of silence. My father had accompanied her. She and the Shankaracharya sat opposite each other, communing in total silence for three hours. As they departed from Kanchi, Indira Gandhi told my father: “I am at peace now. I put all my questions to him, and received the answers I wanted. I am now clear about what I should do”. Indira Gandhi added to my father: “Does one need mere words to communicate?” There was no question at all of the Kanchi Shankaracharya snubbing her; rather they had a deep telepathic communication in total silence.Neither PN Dhar nor my father disclosed the reasons why Indira Gandhi called for elections, and it is not clear if they came to know of her reasons at all. PN Dhar stated later: “Was her decision to hold elections a calculated risk—or was it something else? There may never be a conclusive answer. I believe she was not comfortable with the Emergency, and wanted desperately to get out of it, somehow, anyhow”.To me, it could be that Indira Gandhi lifted the Emergency because she was more the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru than she was the mother of Sanjay Gandhi.Ravi Visvesvaraya Sharada Prasad, an alumnus of Carnegie Mellon and Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, is a technology consultant and defence analyst.

19-03-2021||India||Haryana passes recovery of damage to property Bill amid Opposition protest||Amid loud protests by the opposition, the Haryana assembly on Thursday passed the Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property During Disturbance of Public Order Bill. The Bill provides for recovery of damages to properties caused by persons during agitations, including riots and violent disorder.It also provides for constitution of a claims tribunal to determine the liability, assess the damage and award compensation.Even as Speaker Gian Chand Gupta went through the process to pass the Bill by a voice vote in the assembly, the Congress MLAs assembled in the well of the House, raising slogans, waving copies and seeking the withdrawal of the Bill.Earlier, home minister Anil Vij, who introduced the Bill, tried to allay speculation that it was being brought in view of the ongoing farmers’ protest. “People protest peacefully. But what if someone damages public property?” he said.Bid to suppress farmers’ protest: Cong When Congress MLA Raghuvir Singh Kadian said this bill raised suspicion about its necessity and the intent of the government. “It is something similar to the three central farm laws and it has been brought in such a situation that it raises suspicion. The word instigator used in the Bill strengthens our view that it is a vindictive piece of legislation in the offing. Withhold this Bill and refer it to a select committee,” he said.Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the Bill talks about “deterrence in the minds of people”. “This is being done to scare people from protesting. Peaceful protest is every citizen’s right. There are already legal provisions pertaining to damage caused to property. What about the responsibility of the police in not being able to control law and order?” Hooda said.Congress MLA Kiran Choudhry said the perception is that this law is being brought to suppress the farmers’ agitation. “The government first brought a resolution to condemn those who boycott them and now this Bill has been tabled. This is a draconian law having sweeping powers to frame innocent people,” she said.Vij, however, said all such theories were the products of the minds of Congress MLAs. “The enactment of this law was on our mind well before the farmers’ protest. Should we allow people’s homes to burn? Are you with the rioters or against them? This Bill has been brought on public demand,” he said.Hooda, however, replied that they support the farmers and peaceful protesters. “Why cases have been registered against farmers when the home minister himself said they haven’t done anything? Please withdraw this Bill,” he said.Ensures fixing of civil liability: CM Chief minister ML Khattar said protecting property is the duty of the state government. “We will continue to do it?” he said. The chief minister clarified that the existing provision in the Indian Penal Code pertained to fixing criminal liability but this law only ensures fixing of civil liability.Independent MLA Sombir Sangwan said the IPC already provided for punishment for rioting and damaging public property. “This law is not required enacted, and it will be misused. Remember, the farmers’ agitation will not end by this law,” Sangwan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-passes-recovery-of-damage-to-public-property-bill-amid-oppn-protest-101616064916676.html
19-03-2021||India||Government announces details of vehicle scrappage policy||Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Thursday announced the details for the country’s long-awaited vehicle scrapping policy in Parliament, explaining that the absence of a fitness certificate will mean an automatic cancellation of registration for commercial vehicles that turn 15, and that the registration of a private vehicle will be for 20 years, with renewal requiring proof of fitness. The minister added that the government plans to incentivise owners of old vehicles to scrap these through registered scrap centres.The policy, which also recommends the mandatory scrapping of all government vehicles over 15 years old, applies only to four-wheeled vehicles.India has 17 lakh medium and heavy commercial vehicles that are older than 15 years without any valid fitness certificate, 51 lakh light motor vehicles older than 20 years and 34 lakh light motor vehicles older than 15 years, according to the transport ministry. The average age of commercial vehicles is over 10 years and the private ones, 10-15 years.The move is expected to reduce pollution, create job opportunities, through the registered scrapping centres, and boost demand for new vehicles.“It is proposed that commercial vehicles be deregistered after 15 years in case of failure to get the fitness certificate. As a disincentive measure, increased fees for fitness certificate and fitness test may be applicable for commercial vehicles 15 year onwards from the date of initial registration,” Gadkari said in Lok Sabha.“It is proposed that private vehicles be deregistered after 20 years if found unfit or in case of a failure to renew registration certificate. As a disincentive measure, increased re-registration fees will be applicable for private vehicles 15 years onwards from the date of initial registration,” he added.“It is being proposed that all vehicles of the Central Government, State Government, Municipal Corporation, Panchayats, State Transport Undertakings, Public Sector Undertakings and autonomous bodies with the Union and State Governments may be de-registered and scrapped after 15 years from the date of registration,” Gadkari said.“Indian automobile industry has already upgraded to one of the most advanced emission standards. While new vehicles will be least polluting, vehicles which are old creates enormous pollution with least safety standards will now be eligible for scrappage thus making roads safer and air cleaner. The guidelines and advice announced today are in the right direction and now, the State Governments and OEMs have to do their part to make it a success. Scrappage value of vehicle in range of 4-6% of the ex-showroom price, rebate of upto 25% for PV and 15% for CV by State Governments on Road Tax, 5% discount from OEM’s on new vehicle and registration fee being waived off will definitely help to excite the customer and motivate him to scrap his old vehicle. It will also revive the ailing CV segment and in turn will boost State exchequer’s revenue on sale of new vehicles,” said Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) president Vinkesh Gulati.“We welcome the announcement made by Ministry of Transport and it’s a good mix of both - incentives for those who opt to scrap their old vehicles and an additional burden for those who would like to continue with their old vehicles. This fine balance should help in driving old vehicles out of road leading to reduction in pollution levels and driving demand for new vehicles across all the segments. This announcement will also lead to creation for more scrapyards in the country and effective recovery of waste from old vehicles” said Rajeev Singh, Partner and Automotive Leader, Deloitte India.India’s long-pending voluntary vehicle scrapping policy for phasing out of old vehicles considered to be more polluting has been in the works since 2016, but was announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget for 2021-22. The policy of scrapping old, polluting and fuel-guzzling vehicles is an attempt to reduce pollution and road congestion . It was sent to the Cabinet Secretariat to be put up before the cabinet for its approval in February 2020.The transport ministry will, in the next few weeks, publish draft notifications and seek public comments within a period of 30 days, the ministry said.Gadkari said that the scrapping policy will lead to new investment of around Rs10,000 crore and create 35,000 jobs. The minister said the policy will cover an estimated 5.1 million light motor vehicles (LMV; mostly cars) that are above 20 years of age, while another 3.4 million LMVs are above 15 years. It will also cover 1.7 million medium and heavy motor vehicles (trucks, buses, commercial vans), that are above 15 years, and currently without valid fitness certificates.“The scheme shall provide strong incentives to owners of old vehicles to scrap old and unfit vehicles through registered scrapping centres, which shall provide the owners with a scrapping certificate,” Gadkari said.Some of the incentives are: scrap value for the old vehicle given by the scrapping centre, expected to be 4-6% of the price of a new vehicle; a potential road- tax rebate of up to 25% for new personal vehicles and up to 15% for new commercial vehicles from the states; and a potential discount of 5% offered by auto companies against the scrapping certificate, the policy said.At a press briefing later on Thursday, Gadkari said he has requested the Union finance minister and states to give concession in the Goods & Services Tax on the purchase of new vehicles for those scrapping older vehicles. He also said that vintage cars will be kept out of the scrapping policy.The policy also states that registration fees may also be waived for purchase of new vehicle against the scrapping certificate.“The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will promote setting up of Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facilities (RVSFs) across India and will encourage public and private participation for opening up of such centres. Efforts are also being made to set up integrated scrapping facilities across India. Some of the identified places include Alang in Gujarat, where it is being planned to develop a highly specialized centre for scrapping among many other potential centres, where different scrapping technologies can be synergised ,” Gadkari said.Alang is a global centre for ship breaking.The minister also said Centre will promote the creation of Automated Fitness Centres on a Public Private Partnership model by state government, the private sector and automobile companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-provide-tax-incentives-against-vehicle-scrappage-gadkari-101616057294684.html
19-03-2021||India||Delhi high court seeks Centre's stand on plea against new WhatsApp privacy policy||The Delhi high court on Wednesday issued notice to Centre and Facebook-owned WhatsApp Inc on a plea seeking direction to provide with an option to opt out of sharing their personal data with Facebook. The petition is against the new policy announced by WhatsApp which mandates sharing of personal data.The notice was issued by a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh. The high court has sought to know Centre's stand on the issue by March.The petitioners, Seema Singh and Meghan, have contended that the new privacy policy indicates the "fissures" in Indian data protection and privacy laws.Also Read: Delhi HC says ‘not mandatory to download WhatsApp on mobile’The new privacy policy was announced by WhatsApp on January 4. It includes mandatory sharing of data with the parent company. The decision to share data was first floated in 2016, post WhatsApp’s acquisition by Facebook, but until last week, users already on the platform before the acquisition had the choice of not sharing that data. That choice no longer exists.The move has faced massive backlash globally - especially in WhatsApp’s biggest market India where it has 400 million users - with a surge being reported in other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.Faced with user protests, WhatsApp started posting status messages in India about its commitment towards maintaining privacy of its users. The company said that the backlash is due to misperceptions about the upcoming changes to its privacy policy.The status messages read "One thing that isn't new is our commitment to your privacy," along with a reminder that "WhatsApp can't read or listen to your personal conversations as they're end-to-end encrypted."A plea has also been filed in the Supreme Court seeking guidelines to safeguard the personal data and privacy of Indian WhatsApp users.The plea stated that the 2021 Policy of WhatsApp is highly invasive and has been unilaterally forced upon Indian internet users. It requested the top court to direct WhatsApp to provide the same standard of privacy protections to its Indian users as it is providing to users in the European Region.WhatsApp has, meanwhile, moved back the implementation of its updated privacy policy till May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-seeks-centre-s-stand-on-plea-against-new-whatsapp-privacy-policy-101612335489001.html
19-03-2021||Today's||Five ways to beat the second wave of Covid-19||That there is a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic on is now certain. The seven-day average of daily cases on Thursday night was 29,330, 167% higher than its post-first wave peak low; and the seven-day average of daily deaths, 151, 71% higher. Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh are all seeing a resurgence in cases. And despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s exhortations and warnings, in the course of a meeting with chief ministers on Wednesday, no one really seems to care. The second wave, if left uncontrolled, could surpass the peak of the first wave, as the experience of other countries shows. The fact that it is raging at a time when new variants of the coronavirus disease, including the dangerous P1 variant that is wreaking havoc in Brazil, have all been sequenced in India, is cause for concern. The situation now is far more dire than it was exactly a year ago, when India started thinking about a lockdown, and finally implemented one at four hours notice on March 25, 2020. Given this context, what should India’s response be? One, a nation-wide lockdown is out of the question for two reasons — its impact on a still-fledgling economic recovery would be catastrophic; and after a year of living with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is clear that other measures can achieve the same result as a hard lockdown. Two, what should those measures be? There is, of course, the usual Covid-safety protocol of masking, social distancing, and sanitising. This is now being honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Most people do not wear masks; many, who do so, wear them improperly, as chin guards. Restaurants, perhaps delighted at the prospect of being allowed to operate after what has been many long hard months for them, are paying little attention to social distancing. And people, tired of isolation and quarantines, are socialising with a vengeance, and holidaying as if the end of the world is nigh (it could be, if they continue to do so). Most tourist and pilgrimage destinations in India are witnessing huge crowds — and the state of Uttarakhand has allowed the Kumbh Mela to go on without adequate Covid-safety protocols (one of the first moves of its new chief minister was to do away with negative Covid-test reports for visitors to the event, which happens once in 12 years, a requirement put in place by his predecessor). It is time for the Union home ministry to issue a set of guidelines, and it is time for the states to follow these (tightening them, if needed, but not diluting them). The guidelines should mandate masking, social distancing, limit capacity in restaurants, hotels, malls and multiplexes, place restrictions on religious, social, and cultural events, and, perhaps, even bar inter-state travel.Three, it’s time for Mumbai, and perhaps even the rest of Maharashtra, to lock down for two weeks. The numbers in India’s commercial capital, and one of its most important states, require this. Between March 1 and March 18, the number of cases in the state has risen 135%. On the basis of Thursday night’s numbers (from the HT dashboard), Maharashtra accounts for 65% of all Covid-19 cases in the country. The lockdown needs to be accompanied by aggressive testing, efficient contact tracing, and mandatory quarantining. The Centre and the state also have to work together to launch a large (and fast) vaccination drive in Maharashtra. Four, as Hindustan Times has repeatedly called for, it is time for the Union health ministry and the drug regulator to approve more vaccines. If the latter could approve Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on the basis of belief and not hard evidence — as expected by many, the evidence followed, and showed the vaccine to be highly effective, but vaccines should always be approved on the basis of science, not belief — there’s no reason for it to drag its feet over the Sputnik vaccine, or the Novavax one, which will be made in India by the Serum Institute of India. And once approved, it should allow their sales in the open market. Five, again, as Hindustan Times has repeatedly suggested, the health ministry should open up vaccination for all, and perhaps focus on the 50 cities with a population in excess of a million in the country. It is clear that Covid-19 affects urban populations disproportionately, and even today, the hotspots (and the emerging hotspots) are all in urban areas. This, combined with vaccine hesitancy in rural areas, makes a good case for the drive to focus on cities first and the hinterland later. It is perhaps time to review the sequencing of the vaccination drive. Complacency over the end of the first wave, misplaced confidence about the vaccination, and fatigue over Covid-safety protocols have brought us here — but smart and fast action, based on science and data, can lead us out. sukumar.ranganathan@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/five-ways-to-beat-the-second-wave-of-covid19-101616169745792.html
19-03-2021||Today's||China’s hostility, India’s resilience shaped Quad||The churn in the Indo-Pacific is no longer beneath the surface. It is visible, palpable and ready to emerge into something rather substantive. Most of the actors are now ready to make overt moves and are no longer reticent in trying to shape the wider canvas. There is a widespread recognition that this is an inflection point in the geostrategic space, now widely called the Indo-Pacific. Those who were challenging the very nomenclature of the region a few months ago are having to acknowledge that try as they might, there is no going back on the new idiom and grammar that is now beginning to reconfigure the world around them.Last week, leaders of Quad countries — India, the United States (US), Japan and Australia — met at the summit level and, in their very first joint statement, underlined their commitment “to promoting a free, open rules-based order, rooted in international law to advance security and prosperity and counter threats to both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond” as well as supporting “the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, and territorial integrity”. Beyond that, this week has seen US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, visiting Japan, South Korea and, now, India to boost military cooperation with American allies and partners, and foster “credible deterrence” against China.China, of course, has taken note and has attacked those nations trying to form “enclosed small cliques”, describing it as “the sure way to destroy the international order”. Beijing has targeted “certain countries” for being “keen to exaggerate and hype up the so-called ‘China threat’ to sow discord among regional countries, especially to disrupt their relations with China”. It was not long ago, in March 2018, that China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, had referred to the Quad grouping as nothing more than “sea foam on the Pacific and Indian oceans” that would eventually dissipate.But dissipate it did not; instead, as China’s own foreign policy became ever more irresponsible and short-sighted, the once shaky foundations of Quad gained strength to a point where it emerged as the preferred option for the first multilateral engagement of a new US administration within less than two months in office. When the Chinese foreign policy establishment looks back at recent history, it can justifiably be proud of its accomplishment in sowing the seeds of a new regional security architecture. Indo-Pacific would have remained a concept in think-tank reports and Quad would have been nothing more than a trial balloon of 2007 had it not been for China’s belligerence and aggression towards its neighbours, so creatively displayed and operationalised over the last decade.The agenda of Quad, as outlined during last week’s summit, is quite expansive and stands on its own merits, without the crutches of the China threat. The leaders have been creative and realistic at the same time as they seek to leverage each other’s core strengths in being able to offer an alternative regional governance paradigm to the smaller states in the Indo-Pacific. The main regional constraint so far has not been China’s rise per se, but the unwillingness of other major regional players to do their bit in offering credible alternatives. It was not that China was a playing a great strategic game, it was that others were conceding defeat without even making an effort. And that’s what’s being rectified now and it will have serious consequences — for China, for smaller states and for the region at large.China claims it cannot be contained and it is right. A power like China certainly cannot be contained; its rise and fall will be determined by its own actions. China’s recent actions have generated a backlash in the region and beyond, which the Communist Party of China will find rather difficult to navigate. What other powers are trying to do now is to set the terms of engagement so that a rising China does not remain inimical to their interests. All states, major and minor, will continue to remain engaged with China, but the battle is over who sets the terms of this engagement.And it is here that India’s role has been central in galvanising this response. Even before the ongoing border crisis ushered in a paradigm shift in India’s China policy, New Delhi was not shy of walking alone, if need be, in challenging China on the predatory aspects of its policies such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It walked a lonely path with even its friends advising that shunning BRI could have consequences. But New Delhi was eventually successful in making its critique of China’s infrastructure plans widely accepted and mainstream. The Indo-Pacific construct and its viability was also sold to the world by India’s insistence that only when the two oceans are viewed as part of a single unified maritime space, can a coherent regional balance of power can be envisioned. Most significant, perhaps, was India standing up to China on the border issue, underscoring to the wider region, which has been suffering under the onslaught of Chinese aggression, that giving in to a bullying power is not the only option available.Just as without Chinese belligerence, a substantive Quad would have remained a distant dream, without a pro-active India, this grouping would not have been able to move so far, so fast. As a new geopolitical order takes shape in the Indo-Pacific, India and China will continue to be at the centre of this emerging order. And New Delhi would do well to remember that the game has only just begun.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College, London, and director of studies, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/chinas-hostility-india-s-resilience-shaped-quad-101616169272665.html
19-03-2021||Today's||The core issue is representation||Travel concessions for women, a salary for “housewives”, LPG cylinders, government job reservations, even free washing machines. Doesn’t take a genius to spot the signs of an election at a time when women voters can no longer be ignored.And yet, despite the sops, one fact remains impossibly hard to dislodge — the low number of women contestants.Of the 291 candidates fielded by Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress, 50 are women. That’s an unprecedented 17% women contesting — lower than the 41% the party had put up for the 2019 general elections — but leagues ahead of Kerala, where just 9% of candidates are women, resulting in Kerala Mahila Congress chief Lathika Subash’s protest tonsure. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has 12 women candidates out of 85; the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 15 out of 115.In Tamil Nadu, only 14 of the 171 candidates announced so far by the AIADMK and 12 of the 173 by the DMK are women. In Assam, 19 of 223 candidates announced (as of March 8) are women. This, by any yardstick, is pathetic.Calling it a “travesty of democracy”, Tara Krishnaswamy, co-founder of Shakti, an organisation aimed at increasing women’s political representation, said that states that do well on gender indices, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, for instance, have historically been stingy when it comes to putting up women candidates. “Parties committed to social justice have been extremely patriarchal in their set-up. Investing in women’s leadership is seen as a threat to male power.”The demand for 33% reservation of seats in the assemblies and in Parliament gets a great deal of lip service in party manifestos. This humbug is both tired and dated. When we are half the population, why settle for anything less in the legislature? The issue is representation. Men cannot continue to decide on policies that affect women, whether it’s a revamped abortion bill, passed this week, or changes in the juvenile justice law.But more than representation, there is also women’s right to occupy space.When we think of public spaces, we tend to restrict our imaginations to parks, streets and public transport. But public space also includes Parliament and assemblies. It includes the higher judiciary, labour force, higher education, the corner office, sport.In each of these spaces, women are missing. The recent retirement of Justice Indu Malhotra leaves just one woman judge in the Supreme Court and fewer than 6% women judges in the higher judiciary.The question of who owns public spaces gains urgency at a time when the pandemic has pushed women indoors, with disastrous consequences — a spike in domestic violence, girls being pulled out of schools, a surge in child marriage and an even more precipitous drop in labour force participation.Who can quarrel with free washing machines, except to point out that it reiterates a belief in what male-dominated parties hold to be woman’s true place? Someone should tell them, it’s not behind the spin cycle. It’s in the House. And it’s time women voters delivered that message.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-core-issue-is-representation-101616168005164.html
19-03-2021||Editorials||A message to Washington||India has bought, and will stick to its purchase of the S-400 missile defence systems from Russia . This is based on India’s military needs; it has been decided at the highest levels of India’s political leadership, taking into account all variables; it is a commitment to Moscow, which, notwithstanding recent differences, has been an old friend of India; and it is in keeping with New Delhi’s sovereign right to ensure its national security. Even as India and the United States (US), rightly, work towards deepening the strategic partnership, this message must be clearly conveyed to Washington — during the ongoing visit of secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin.The US has a problem with Russia (for some genuine reasons and some apprehensions which are a vestige of a Cold War mindset), and the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) is meant to, among other things, deter Russia’s defence industry clients with the threat of secondary sanctions. Washington has imposed sanctions on Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally, for its purchase of the S-400 systems. And the Joe Biden administration has not yet made clear whether it will waive off sanctions in the case of India or proceed with it. On the eve of Mr Austin’s visit, the Senate foreign relations committee chair, Robert Menendez, asserted that India’s purchase will be a “sanctionable” transaction.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted after meeting Mr Austin, the bilateral partnership is a “force for good”. Mr Austin’s visit itself is a sign of growing convergence. But Washington should know its decision on CAATSA will play a role in shaping the overall momentum of ties. There remains a substantial segment of opinion in India — in government, defence forces and the strategic community — which is wary of Washington, especially given the baggage of history. But three successive prime ministers — Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi — have shown courage in boosting strategic ties with the US. Mr Modi’s government has also signed foundational defence pacts and moved forward with Quad. India too benefits from this, but so does the US. Does Washington want to dilute this growing strategic trust with New Delhi by implementing its sanctions framework or will it prioritise the big picture of deepening ties to address the “most pressing challenge facing the Indo Pacific region”, as Mr Austin put it, and waive off sanctions? The US must decide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-warning-for-washington-101616167345167.html
