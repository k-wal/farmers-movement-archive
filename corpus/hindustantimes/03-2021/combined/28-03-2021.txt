28-03-2021||News||Time for a real round of reforms in the bureaucracy. The last one didn’t work||Nearly 20 years after the recommendation of the Kargil Review Committee on higher defence management, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to create the post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) during his August 15, 2019, Independence Day speech from the Red Fort. The decision was not so simple as many within the defence establishment were opposed to the idea of concentrating military decision-making in one person. Yet, PM Modi followed the letter and spirit of the 1999 Kargil Committee and appointed General Bipin Rawat as the first CDS for three years on January 1, 2020. He was also made Secretary of the newly-created Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and tasked with delivering on military reforms through transparent need-based hardware acquisition and creation of theatre commands for better synergy among the land, air and sea-based forces. The idea was to cut through bureaucratic red-tape and speed up decision-making in the defence ministry. The kind of red-tape that led the government to hold back approvals to let troops posted in Siachen get access to snow scooters. It was eventually approved, but only after former defence minister George Fernandes ordered the two babus who had blocked the purchase to visit Siachen to see firsthand why the scooters were needed.PM Modi too has tried, and sometimes succeeded in cutting through the bureaucratic chaff. But the Indian babudom continues to be driven by process rather than the outcome. Many ministers say they find their bureaucrats behaving like the permanent opposition, determined to tire out the political executives who come to power on a five-year tenure as against the 30 years that the officials spend in the higher civil services.Nothing makes this point starker than the fact that it took more than one year for the government’s human resource manager, the department of personnel and training, to make key appointments to the department of military affairs. CDS Gen Rawat worked around the slow-moving bureaucracy by getting military officers to officiate as additional and joint secretaries in the interim period. All this happened at a time when India nearly came to war with China over its aggression in East Ladakh.There are many other horror stories about the Indian bureaucracy including those from the scientific community. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari and railways minister Piyush Goyal have alluded to some when they appeared to vent their frustration in public. But the public rebuke is unlikely to lead to any change in the system.That is why as the government prepares for yet another Civil Services Day on April 21, 2021, it perhaps is time for PM Modi to appoint the third administrative reforms commission to institute cutting-edge reforms in the Indian bureaucracy to ensure timely delivery and implementation. And this time, he should make sure that the recommendations are actually implemented - and not just on paper like the second administrative reforms. It should not matter that the recommendations don't suit powerful civil services such as the Indian Administrative Service if these are in the public interest.The bureaucracy must shed its British imperial past as officers sometimes function as part of an occupying power without any awareness of the position on the ground. The chasm between the common man and the bureaucracy, despite having a 24X7 Prime Minister, has not reduced as the babus are more interested in keeping the file perfect. While a permanent civil service cadre may have the advantage of order and continuity, babus in this age of artificial intelligence and multi-formatted information generally have inadequate domain knowledge of their areas of work, resist infusion of fresh blood and ideas to guide them in their emerging roles and have inadequate communication or communication with the Indian youth. This can also be said about their supervisors or cabinet ministers, who may lack sectoral knowledge for better oversight and accountability.This is why it is time for the Modi government to separate the wheat from the chaff by incentivising deserving senior officials through an alternative fast-track career progression channel. This will also lower the age profile of the top officials. The government should also consider promotions to higher levels, that is additional secretary or secretary-level posts from a pool of four to five batches together and not on a year-by-year basis as is done now. This will give the government a larger pool of officials to make their selection. Perhaps, appointments at additional secretary or secretary-level could also be offered on a contract basis for five to ten years with compensation for premature separation or termination on each side. This will ensure accountability in terms of delivery on the ground.While the government has inducted officers through lateral entry at joint secretary levels or below, this should be encouraged at an additional secretary or secretary-level as a laggard top official will ensure that the lateral entrant has no work. India should have a new result-oriented bureaucracy when the nation celebrates the 75th year of Independence next year as the present architecture needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The time for tinkering is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/time-for-administrative-reforms-to-shake-the-babus-out-of-stupor-101616921398005.html
28-03-2021||Other||In poll year, Punjab’s power utility takes U-turn on tariff revision; seeks 20-32% reduction||Sensing that power tariff will be a major poll issue in next year’s state assembly polls, the Punjab government has asked the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to seek reduction in rates for domestic consumers, and that too, a whopping 32% or one-third of the present charges. This is a U-turn from PSPCL’s December stance, when it had approached the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) for a 9% hike. Now, under government pressure, it has asked the regulator to decrease tariff. In the latest state cabinet meeting, ministers had objected to the ‘high tariff’ on electricity, an issue that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already raised in Punjab, claiming that their Delhi model was superior. In its revised Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) petition, the PSPCL is claiming a deficit of ₹3,003 crore on current tariff for the next fiscal, but has not asked for tariff hike. The overall cumulative revenue gap at the end of 2021-22 is projected at ₹9,807 crore. In the revised petition, for domestic consumers up to 2 KW load, PSPCL has sought reduction of tariff for first 100 units from ₹4.49 to ₹3.2, a reduction of 32% from previous proposed tariff. There is reduction for domestic consumers ranging between 20% and 32%. The PSPCL, adopting the AAP government style, will recover this amount by imposing hike on industrial and non-domestic consumers. “The retail tariff approved in tariff order for 2020-21 doesn’t meet total revenue requirement for 2021-22, including past revenue gaps. The recovery of total revenue gaps in a single year would increase existing tariff substantially, this would lead to tariff shock for consumers. PSPCL doesn’t intend to give tariff shock to its consumers and we propose to recover ₹9,807 crore over the next 2-5 years,” reads the revised PSPCL proposal that HT has accessed. All-India Power Engineers Association Spokesman VK Gupta claimed that the PSPCL management was working under pressure. “On one side it is admitting that there is revenue requirement over last year’s tariff, but now it has asked for no revision. In power subsidy, it is short of almost ₹7,000 crore and is still not asking for recovery from power bills.”HT made repeated attempts to contact PSPCL chairman and managing director A Venu Prasad, but could not connect with him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-poll-year-punjab-s-power-utility-takes-u-turn-on-tariff-revision-seeks-20-32-reduction-101616955703524.html
28-03-2021||Dehradun||With Mahakumbh nearing, Uttarakhand reports highest daily Covid-19 cases this year||Uttarakhand on Sunday reported 366 new Covid-19 cases, the highest number of daily cases this year so far. Previously, the highest number of single-day cases was registered on January 1, 2021, when the state had reported 361 cases. The fresh cases have taken the state’s tally of total cases to 99,881. Given the state had reported 27 fresh cases on March 1, this is a significant surge in Covid-19 infections in the state just within a month. The surge has been reported at a time when the state government has issued notification for the one- month long Mahakumbh fair in Haridwar. The mega event will begin on April 1 and nearly 3-5 crore pilgrims are expected to attend the religious fair. There are serious concerns that Mahakumbh can emerge as a Covid-19 super-spreader. Out of 99,881 who have tested positive for Covid-19 so far in the state, a total of 95,025 have recovered successfully, taking the recovery rate in the state to 95.146 per cent. The positivity rate in the state now stands at 3.68.05 per cent while the case fatality rate stands at 1.71 per cent. Also read: ‘Covid under control’ - Uttarakhand govt as virus cluster emerges in RishikeshThere are 1,660 active cases in the state now, including 494 in Haridwar district. So far, 1,709 Covid-19 positive people have died in the state. On Sunday, however, there was no Covid-19 death reported in the state. On Sunday, 42 Covid-19 positive people recovered and were discharged from hospitals in different districts of the state with a maximum, 40, from Dehradun district. According to the state health bulletin issued on Sunday, a maximum of 167 cases were reported from Dehradun district, followed by 59 fresh cases in Haridwar and 54 in Tehri Garhwal district. Chamoli and Champawat districts didn’t report any fresh case on Sunday. Dehradun district has so far reported the maximum number of Covid-19 positive cases (30,823), followed by Haridwar (14,947), Nainital (13,107) and US Nagar (11,749). The state health department has so far tested 27.14 lakh people of which results of over 6,300 are pending. However, despite a surge in cases, on Sunday, only 7,627 samples from across the 13 districts were sent for testing, including 2,791 from Haridwar district. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank called Social Development for Communities, who has been analysing Covid-19 data in the hill state, said, 366 cases in a day is the highest so far this year. “The rising cases in the state is a matter of serious concern “In the past one week ending March 27, the state has reported over 1000 active cases after seven weeks and 1,000 plus positive cases after nine weeks. There is a need to increase testing and become more cautious given the surge in Covid-19 cases again. Samples sent for testing on Sunday were just over 7,600. This has to change and testing has to be increased manifold,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/with-mahakumbh-nearing-uttarakhand-reports-highest-daily-covid-19-cases-this-year-101616954503440.html
28-03-2021||Noida||Noida: RT-PCR samples of vaccinated healthcare workers taken to analyse post-jab infection||NOIDA: To analyse the chances of people testing positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease post-vaccination, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has taken the RT-PCR samples of as many as 311 doctors and paramedics, who have taken both doses of vaccines, from three private hospitals on Saturday. The reports of the tests, however, are expected by Monday evening. District magistrate Suhas LY said: “As the standard genetic RT-PCR tests are considered the golden standard for Covid-19 tests, it will be the most accurate detector of infectious cases after the vaccination, if any. The results will also be a useful tool for mass screening programs in the district,” he said.“The district has achieved its target of inoculating 65,048 persons belonging to the senior citizen category and people over 45 years having co-morbidities. For the coming month, we have doubled the target as the government has allowed everyone over 45 years for vaccination from April 1,” he said.Echoing similar views, chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was preferred instead of the rapid antigen tests due to their accuracy. “Antigen tests can give results within minutes and are cheaper than genetic RT-PCR tests. But they’re not as sensitive as RT-PCR tests and can miss cases where people have low levels of the virus in their system. On an average, we are conducting 4,000 tests every day, which will be increased to 7,000 tests per day,” he said. The CMO further said that in the current situation, early and timely tracking of new cases is the main focus of the health department. “At present, most of the infected patients are under home quarantine,” he said. Ohri also said that out of the 400-odd random testing in bordering areas of Ashok Nagar, bus stands and metro stations in Botanical Garden since Thursday, no one was found Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-rt-pcr-samples-of-vaccinated-healthcare-workers-taken-to-analyse-post-jab-infection-101616953062877.html
28-03-2021||Gurugram||MCG, Gurugram health dept to start ops to curb spread of dengue, malaria in 10 days: Officials||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), and the district health department have increased anti-larvae and fumigation operations following a surge in the dengue cases since 2020. Several heads of these departments have given formal training to about 110 officials from the MCG and the health department for the operations in the past two days.We want to kick-start the operations within the next 10 days, said the officials.According to the officials, the health department is changing its strategy this year, and will recommend hospitals to carry out malaria and dengue tests for patients displaying common vector-borne symptoms such as high fever so that early diagnosis can help in taking preventive measures at the earliest.“The cases were much higher in 2020 as compared to 2019. We don’t want the trend to continue in 2021 and want to turn it around. So, we are starting preventive measures in advance. We aim to start taking anti-vector-borne measures on the ground within the next 10 days,” said Dr Ram Prakash Rai, district epidemiologist.Usually, the MCG and health department start such operations during May-end, before the pre-monsoon showers. About 51 dengue cases and four malaria cases were reported in 2020, and 22 dengue cases and 15 malaria cases in 2019.“Apart from keeping a check in the dengue cases, we also want to follow preventive measures taken last year. The lowest number of malaria cases have been reported in the past five years. The strategies for dengue and malaria are different, so we will make arrangements accordingly,” said Rai.Meanwhile, no chikungunya cases have been reported in Gurugram since 2018.Malaria is caused by mosquitoes that breed in dirty water, while dengue is caused by mosquitoes that breed in cleaner water. “We will identify areas where accumulation of water is common, especially during the monsoon season, and allocate our resources accordingly,” Rai added.Following the coronavirus-imposed national lockdown in 2020, the MCG and the district health department officials, too, took conventional measures like anti-larvae and fumigation operations to curb the spread of dengue and malaria, and put kerosene in collected water pools, introduced gambusia fish that feed on mosquito larvae in water bodies on large-scale in July.Based on the cases reported in 2020, the MCG officials are mapping areas — such as Wazirabad village — where the highest number of cases were reported and deputing more officials in such areas. “We will have a clearer idea of the areas from where cases have emerged through mapping. It is likely that localised accumulation of rainwater and drainage overflow are prevalent there, which lead to mosquito breeding. Once we identify the locations, we will depute more teams to those areas with hand-held fogging machines, and gambusia fish among others,” said a senior MCG official. In 2020, the MCG and the health department officials had found larvae from over 1,600 houses. Following which two new hatcheries were created for breeding gambusia fish in Wazirabad and Pataudi last year. Prior to this, the city had one gambusia hatchery in the district malaria office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-gurugram-health-dept-to-start-ops-to-curb-spread-of-dengue-malaria-in-10-daysofficials-101616953003400.html

The authority started seeking proposals for the project, which will be undertaken as a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, on Friday.According to the GMDA, interested agencies, companies or NGOs have to send proposals for the project, as development partners under the CSR Initiative, within April 12.As per the project description uploaded on the website, the GMDA is planning to develop Nagar Van (Urban Forests) at Sikanderpur or Chakkarpur Aravallis as per the guidelines of Nagar Van Yojana of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India. “It will provide a healthy living environment to the residents of Gurugram, thus contributing to the development of a green, clean, healthy and sustainable city,” it said.Subash Yadav, divisional forest officer and head of urban environment division, GMDA, said, “We already have a biodiversity park, but we do not have an urban forest which is more accessible to the public. This park will focus on public utilities like a space for sitting, recreation, an interpretation centre for learning about plant species, and development of water bodies for groundwater recharge among others. We are planning to develop the forest over a 100-hectare area near Sikanderpur.”According to the Nagar Van scheme, the Gurugram authority is likely to carry out activities like fencing the area, establishing and maintaining wood blocks with emphasis on locally appropriate tree or shrub species, theme-based plantations like Smriti Van, Rashi/Nakshatra Vatika, and arboretum.The officials asserted that Gurugram needs an urban forest to work on issues like decreasing water table and improving air quality among others.“As the population is increasing, so is the pressure on natural resources. The demand for development of green spaces as per growing population is also increasing. The urban forest on the borders of the national capital in Sikander Ghosi and Chakkarpur will be an expansion of the already developed Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Nathupur, and will act as green lungs for the residents of the national capital region. It will also act as the centre of biodiversity conservation, recreation, water conservation (as recycled water is proposed for plantation activities), eco-tourism, and public awareness,” said a senior GMDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gmda-seeks-proposals-to-work-on-a-nagar-van-101616953002831.html

As per the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) weekly forecast, the temperature is likely to soar further on Monday and touch 39 degrees Celsius. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 17.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday. According to the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 39 degrees Celsius and 22 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Monday. A clear sky will also prevail on Monday, as per the forecast. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that while the temperature is likely to rise till Monday, it will dip again from March 30 (Tuesday) on account of strong winds. As per the IMD’s official bulletin, dust-raising strong surface winds (with speeds reaching 30-40 kmph) are likely over Haryana between March 30 and April 1. The city’s air quality entered the poor zone on Sunday, with the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin recording a value of 214. The air quality worsened from Saturday’s AQI reading of 183 that was in the moderate category. Experts attributed the deterioration in air quality to slower wind speeds that were not effective in the dispersion of pollutants. The concentration of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 204.02 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Sunday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 276.92µg/m³ on Sunday. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in the moderate to the poor category on Monday. The air quality is likely to be in the moderate category on Tuesday and subsequently, the air quality is likely to remain in the moderate to poor category over the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mercury-soars-to-38-7-c-to-rise-further-101616952944091.html

28-03-2021||Kolkata||‘Make fool of BJP on April Fool’s day, we’d play Holi on May 2’: Mamata Banerjee||With just four days to go before West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee takes on BJPs heavyweight candidate Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram in East Midnapore, the TMC supremo urged voters to make a fool of the BJP on April 1, also known as April Fool’s Day, and said that she would play Holi on May 2 when the results are declared. “April 1 is April Fool’s Day. Make a fool of them on April 1 and we would play Holi on May 2 with many colours like green and red,” said Banerjee while addressing a program on Dol Yatra in Nandigram. This was Banerjee’s first rally in Nandigram after she filed her nomination on March 10. The TMC supremo had to be rushed back to Kolkata after she sustained injuries on March 10. The chief minister and top TMC leaders had earlier alleged that it was a deliberate attack and a conspiracy to kill her. The BJP had then said that Banerjee had insulted the people of Nandigram. “Four to five people pushed me. People of Nandigram have no fault. I am not blaming anyone. I am grateful to the person who helped me with a pack of ice after I was injured,” she added. As the BJP has mounted an attack on Mamata trying to project her as an outsider in Nandigram, she tried to focus on her ‘bhoomikanya’ image. Also read: To Amit Shah’s BJP win in Phase 1 claim, Mamata hurls outsider barb“I would like to tell those who are underestimating me and tagging me as an outsider that I am bhoomikanya (daughter of the soil). I am your daughter now. This is my constituency and I am here to stay here for the next four to five days. I will leave only after the elections are held on April 1 and then come back later,” she added. The TMC supremo also said that she could have won by 50,000 votes had she contested from Bhabanipur, her traditional seat and home turf. “Do you think that I didn’t have a seat to contest? I would have won by a margin of 50,000 votes had I contested from Bhabanipur. I am the daughter of Bengal and could have contested from any seat and won. But I came to Nandigram to salute the soil,” she said.The chief minister mounted a veiled attack on her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari, who has vowed to defeat her by 50,000 votes, and his father Sisir Adhikari, who was recently seen at a rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite being a TMP MP. “I later came to know that police could not have entered Nandigram (in 2007) without the permission of the father and the son. I challenge this. Even I run a government and had gathered information later,” she said while referring to the police firing in Nandigram in 2007 in which 14 persons lost their lives. “Everyone knows what happened in Nandigram. People of Nandigram would give their response on April 1. Where was she when the Nandigram incident took place? It was I who brought her to Nandigram. Mamata Banerjee would have come to power had there been no Nandigram or Singur. If she has the guts and she comes from a decent family she should come in front of me and tell me on my face and I would reply,” Sisir Adhikari said.“No matter what drama she plays with a broken leg or a broken hand, I will defeat the Begum,” Suvendu Adhikari said while addressing a rally at Sagar island in South 24 Parganas. Banerjee also took on Union home minister Amit Shah who had told the media in Delhi that in the first phase, the BJP would win more than 26 out of 30 seats in Bengal.“I believe that after winning 26 seats in the first phase in Bengal, it will be very easy for us to win over 200 seats overall. The party workers and I have full faith in this,” Shah said in Delhi. “How can the Union home minister say that they would win 26 seats? Did he enter the EVMs or have rigged the machines? When the machines are opened (on counting day) you will see that there would be a game and everything would become zero. There would be only grass and flower (symbol of TMC),” she added. Earlier in the day, TMC MP Derek O’Brien had said that Shah was making such statements to boost the morale of the BJP workers. “Shah is a dhopbaaj (liar),” he added. Meanwhile, in Kolkata, the TMC sent a letter to the ECI alleging that the poll panel’s order of relaxing the rules for the appointment of polling agents was “arbitrary, motivated and biased”. The TMC urged the poll panel to withdraw the order. This comes a day after the TMC had released an audio clip in which the BJP’s vice president Mukul Roy could be purportedly heard telling another party leader Sisir Bajoria that they must approach the commission to get the rule relaxed. On Saturday, Bajoria had said that it is no secret as the BJP had given an official letter to the ECI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/make-fool-of-bjp-on-april-fool-s-day-we-d-play-holi-on-may-2-mamata-banerjee-101616951684015.html

28-03-2021||Noida||Two Greater Noida authority officials among four arrested for cattle deaths||Noida: The Ecotech 3 police arrested four persons, including two officials of the Greater Noida authority, on Saturday in connection with the deaths of cattle at Kanha Gaushala in Jalpura. The issue had come to fore on March 25 after a video of starving or dead cattle went viral on social media. Several animal rights activists rushed to the shelter with fodder and medical aid. Activists alleged that the officials arranged food and medicines only after “being exposed”. Activists who had visited the cow shelter — which is run by the Greater Noida authority — had alleged that starvation and absence of proper medical facilities were the main reasons behind the deaths. They had also alleged that at least 20 bovines died between March 24 and 25, and that dozens had died earlier and were buried in a nearby field. However, authority officials claimed that only six bovines had died due to injuries, or due to polythene consumption.The animals were buried without an autopsy as the deaths were not suspicious, the authority officials had said.Following the circulation of the video, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had acknowledged the matter. Based on a complaint filed by Shiv Prakash Shukla, officer on special duty of the authority, a case was registered at the Ecotech 3 police station against a private supervisor and compounder of the shelter. The authority also named a vet and an engineer, in-charge of the shelter, of the authority in the case filed under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 201, 409, 429, 34 and 120B, and relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.The arrested persons were identified as Sheetal Prakash Tiwari, supervisor, Satendra Kumar, compounder, Dr. Prem chand, vet, and Ramesh Chandra, engineer.“We have taken necessary action, and all suspects named in the case have been apprehended,” said Bhubnesh Kumar Sharma, station house officer, Ecotech 3 police station.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, said, “We have removed the contractors in question, and they won’t be taking care of the bovine shelter now. We have formed a committee to probe the matter and directed the staff to improve the condition of the shelter at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-greater-noida-authority-officials-among-four-arrested-for-cattle-deaths-101616951023397.html
28-03-2021||Noida||Guard’s murder at cash firm: Former security manager arrested||Noida: A 33-year-old former security manager of a cash and logistics company in Sector 2 was arrested on Saturday night in connection with the killing of a security guard of the company more than a month ago. The suspect had also worked in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) as an assistant commandant, police said, adding that he was fired by the Noida company in September last year. The incident had taken place on February 9 when Uttam Kesharwani, the security guard, was shot dead by a masked intruder in a robbery bid at the cash management company. The incident was caught in CCTV cameras, police said. “Teams had been formed to look into the case. We had obtained the data of former employees of the company as the case from the very beginning suggested the involvement of someone familiar with the layout of the premises,” said Kumar Rannvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Police have identified the suspect as Arun Gehlot, a resident of Delhi’s Najafgarh. He was nabbed by Sector 20 police from near the Rajnigandha underpass, police said, adding that the revolver used in the crime was also recovered from him.“During the struggle of the suspect with the security guard, his mask had come undone.

The contract was signed in the presence of Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar at New Delhi on Friday. The NCAP is a long-term and time-bound national level strategy to tackle air pollution across the country in a comprehensive manner. It has targets to achieve 20% to 30% reduction in particulate matter concentration by 2024 with 2017 as the base year. As part of the programme, 132 cities have signed MoUs with expert institutions for executing planned action in a time-bound manner to tackle air pollution. Both Ghaziabad and Noida are also on the list of non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh having high levels of air pollution. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said abatement plans, comprising short-term and long-term measures, have been prepared to tackle air pollution. “The IIT experts will help the two cities with technical support and identify sources and methods required for tackling pollution. The action plans are all ready. The experts will help the authorities in prioritising the measures which can be taken up swiftly and also in a cost-effective manner. We hope officials start discussions so that some measures can be prioritized and implemented before winter,” said Dr Sagnik Dey, assistant professor from IIT- Delhi, who will be coordinating with the officials of the two cities. “Now that the MoUs have been signed, we will start with implementation of our air pollution abatement plan,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida, who was present when the MoUs were signed. UPPCB officials from Ghaziabad said they, along with officials of the municipal corporation, will hold discussions with IIT experts. “The experts from IIT Delhi will provide technical expertise and also help us fine tune our air-pollution abatement plan. We are expecting to implement the plan before winter,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. A corpus of ₹60.5 crore has been provided to the Ghaziabad municipal corporation from the 15th Finance Commission exclusively for implementing measures and raising the infrastructure to reduce air pollution. M S Tanwar, commissioner of Ghaziabad municipal corporation, said the civic administration has formed an air- quality management cell and a city-level monitoring cell to implement the measures chalked out in the abatement plan and monitor the air quality. “Apart from the two cells, IIT-Delhi will be our technical partner in implementing the air pollution abatement plan. We are committed to procure infrastructure with the funds made available to us for air pollution abatement measures and hope that they are implemented before the graded response action plan comes into effect,” said Tanwar. As part of the air pollution abatement plan, the Ghaziabad municipal corporation has proposed redevelopment of 200 parks, development of city forest, roadside paving, besides purchasing jetting machines and anti-smog guns. Conversion of diesel vehicles to CNG and installation of 30 air-purifiers at major markets across the city are among the other measures that will be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/iitdelhi-to-help-ghaziabad-noida-tackle-air-pollution-101616950782823.html

SMA is a genetic disorder causing loss of specialised nerve cells, which causes weakness and wasting (atrophy) in the muscles, making movement impossible.Dr Renu Suthar, associate professor of paediatrics neurology at the department of neurology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, said that the muscle weakness usually worsens with age and it is a lethal disease found in one out of 10,000 babies. “SMA mostly affects babies and children at a young age. In type-1 of the disease, the patient doesn’t live for more than one or two years. Children with type-2 and 3 live up to teenage years and adulthood, however, they are confined to wheelchair,” Dr Suthar said.  “He got infected with multiple diseases at an early age and we took him to PGIMER and later to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi. In 2005, doctors confirmed the disease, but global research was in a very early stage at that time. Since then, he is on wheelchair and completely depends on me even for basic needs,” Sushila said. She was also representing Gurugram-based Cure SMA Foundation of India, as its Ambala coordinator. She said that there are more than 25 patients in the state battling this disease. Archana Panda, co-founder of the foundation said, “Now, there is treatment available for the disease in foreign countries and we want that the government should help us in avail of it through an economic model and arrangement of funds. Out of more than 25 patients in the state, most are from economically-challenged backgrounds.”Last month, a six-month-old baby girl from Mumbai, Teera Kamat, needed medication to treat the disease costing ₹16 crore. Taxes amounting to ₹6 crore was rebated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the parents got the amount crowdfunded.Dr Suthar said that there are three life-saving medicines for the disease approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but none of them are available in India. She said that only one has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (medication) which goes on for a lifetime.Bhardwaj said the issue will be forwarded before VIj for an early redressal.

As many as 3,03,475 active cases and 23,14,579 recoveries have been recorded so far, while the number of people who have died of the disease went up to 54,073.Mumbai, one of the cities with the highest rate of infection in the state, reported 6,123 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest rise in a day since the pandemic began in March last year, taking the caseload to 3,91,751.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/be-prepared-to-impose-restrictions-similar-to-lockdown-if-maharashtra-cm-101616933490300.html
28-03-2021||Other||‘Kerala challenging federal structure by turning against ED’: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday came down heavily on the Left front government in Kerala for announcing a judicial inquiry against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials probing the sensational gold smuggling case. Addressing newsmen in the state capital, Singh said the government’s move was shocking and it will weaken the federal structure of the country. “It is an unfortunate development. How can a state government initiate probe against central agencies? It is against the federal structure of the country,” he said, reminding the government that central agencies came to the state after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government had announced a judicial commission on Friday to probe the ED alleging the central agency was planning to implicate the CM in the gold smuggling case and portray the government in a bad light. “This is 100 per cent against the federal structure of the country. Instead of turning against the ED, it should have co-operated with the ongoing investigation to unravel the truth,” he said. Later he carried out a roadshow in Varkala (Kollam) and addressed several meetings for April 6 assembly election. But CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who is camping in the state for the last few days, criticised the defence minister. “He has no idea about either the constitution or federal structure. How can a central agency carry out an investigation in the state without taking the government into confidence?” he asked. The gold smuggling case has become the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the state governments. Last week, the Kerala police filed a case against ED officials for allegedly forcing Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the smuggling case, to give a statement against the CM. On Friday, the government had ordered a judicial inquiry against the central agency for allegedly trying to implicate the CM in the case. But the agency has rejected the allegations. The smuggling case came to light in July last year after customs seized 30 kilograms of yellow metal from the UAE consulate in the state capital. Now, at least five central agencies are probing smuggling and money laundering cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-challenging-federal-structure-by-turning-against-ed-rajnath-singh-101616931822904.html

No one should play spoilsport when the three-party government is functioning properly," the deputy chief minister said.He further said Sharad Pawar, being head of the NCP, takes all decisions including allotment of cabinet berths to the party leaders.A similar method is being followed by the Congress and Shiv Sena, Ajit Pawar said."It should be respected instead of making any unwarranted comments," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-one-should-play-spoilsport-in-coalition-govt-ajit-pawar-101616925246143.html

Earlier they used to be protected, but since they are exposed to several of these events, the risk has also gone up considerably," Dr Giridhara R Babu Professor and Head Life course Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India told PTI.Also a member of the state Covid-19 technical advisory committee, the epidemiologist said, children in many cases may also be spreaders among family members."...children going to schools or indulging in outdoor activities on contracting the virus from others, there is a high possibility of them spreading to others, like family members, friends," he added.Officials also point out that children are also easily vulnerable as it is difficult for them to maintain physical distance and wearing masks for long.Though most children below the age of ten may not be going to school for now, they are likely to come in contact with other kids who are vulnerable during outdoor activities like in the playground or parks, they said."As one of the measures to control the spread among children, we have recommended closure of schools for students other than those who have public exams", Babu said, adding, "we have even recommended that they should be passed to the next grade without examination, but the government has to take a decision."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/over-470-children-below-10-years-infected-with-covid-19-in-bengaluru-since-mar-1-101616923456930.html

Whose favourite was he?” he said asking who gave so much power to him. Vaze is the prime accused in the Antilia bomb scare case and is also facing investigation in Thane-based businessman Manuskh Hiran’s death- whose SUV, laden with gelatin sticks, was found near Antilia- which is industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence.Raut also said that a home minister should speak less and facing cameras and ordering enquiries is not his job. “The (home minister’s) job is not only for accepting salutes but for giving a strong leadership. How can one forget that strong leadership requires honesty,” the Sena leader added.Meanwhile, NCP leader and Maharashtra minority development minister Nawab Malik on Sunday reacted to Raut’s editorial piece by saying that the shortcomings brought forward in the article should be taken in a positive manner. “There should have been strictness in handling the department (police) as some officers were acting as per their own will,” Malik told ANI.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/whose-favourite-was-vaze-asks-raut-calls-deshmukh-accidental-home-minister-101616922282171.html

28-03-2021||Bangalore||Siddaramaiah takes dig at Karnataka govt, police over Jarkiholi CD row||Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka Assembly Siddaramaiah on Sunday took a dig at state government and police department over the alleged CD case row in which Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ramesh Jarkiholi is accused of sexual harassment.Taking to Twitter, the former Karnataka Chief Minister said: "The police department and state government are responsible for pledging the pride of Karnataka in front of the whole country in the CD case. It is shameful that police could not trace the CD victim even after 20 days."He also said that the CD case is turning into a political blame game with new developments each day. It can reach a logical conclusion only when the victim reaches out to the police and give her version, the Congress leader said."The victim in the CD is constantly releasing her statements to the media through videos, reaching out to her parents and interacting with her lawyers. But the police are unable to track her. What does this mean? Is the police playing to the tune of the state government?" Siddaramaiah said.He also urged state Home minister Basavaraj Bommai to raise his concern over the matter."The videos released by the victim clearly show that the girl does not have confidence on both, the state government and the police department. It looks like she is of the opinion that police are involved in the conspiracy against her. Home minister BS Bommai should address this concern," he said.He also added: "This CD case is a classic example for the breakdown of administrative and police machinery in the state under the BJP government. What does it mean when police says that they are unable to trace the girl? Is she like Vijay Mallya or Nirav Modi hiding abroad?"A case was registered on March 2 against Ramesh Jarkiholi for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman after a purported sex tape surfaced showing him in a compromising position with a woman.Following the allegations, Jarkiholi resigned on March 3. He had denied allegations that he had sexually exploited a woman in return for a government job, saying that the scandal was a conspiracy against him and that the CD was "fake".Six ministers in the BS Yediyurappa government had on March 5 moved a Bengaluru court seeking a stay against media outlets from publishing or broadcasting anything defamatory against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/siddaramaiah-takes-dig-at-karnataka-govt-police-over-jarkiholi-cd-row-101616922073915.html
28-03-2021||Delhi||Denizens plan to shift gears from ‘super spreader areas’ to shop indoors, stay safe||With Delhi government declaring malls, movie theatres, metros and religious places as super spreaders, denizens plan to be more vigilant with their choices such as opting for online shopping more, binging on OTT instead of going to the theatre for the present, and even travelling to work via bicycle than public transport. And while some are sulking at the thought of getting gift cards and not actual gifts, being safe is the right choice in the present scenario, isn’t it? Cinema hall? No, halt. Switch on OTT insteadMalls have dropped down in the list of go-to places for Delhi-based MBA student, Aniket Sircar, who loves to hang out and shop. But, online shopping has taken over the coveted spot. “And guess what, it’s only my thumb and fingers that feel a little sore instead of my feet after going around aisles,” he says, adding, “I recently visited a cinema hall to watch one of the latest flicks. But, after this news of malls being super spreaders, I don't think I’ll be catching the next one at the hall, and will just binge watch my fave shows or movies on OTT platforms. The new normal still consists of binging on OTT platforms as movie halls do pose a threat of spreading the virus since they are mostly closed and allow aerosol droplets to move around when people sneeze or cough. Call me sceptical, but I don’t want to be in a place that’s a super spreader for coronavirus, whether big or small.”Cycle your way to social distancing! When it comes to travelling within the city, be it to hang out or for work, denizens are again thinking of switching their choice of transport. “For commuting, Delhi Metro has always been my budget friendly mode to travel long distances without getting caught in the heatwave and also ditching traffic. Unfortunately, I may have to switch to cabs now as people are bent on ignoring the guidelines set by the metro authorities,” adds Sircar. Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder, Raahgiri Foundation, says this is the time to revive one’s love for cycling in all practicality. “Cycle is one mode that automatically drives (with) the social distancing norms. Cycling to work, cycling to shopping or cycling with family is the safest mode of commute. The best part is that I was practising it even before the Covid,” says Bhatt. Be safe, and then nothing to worry Although some say they will from now ditch the crowded malls and market and shop online, but not everyone seems to harness the Covid phobia! Donna Xavier, a final year Delhi-based student of Law, says, “There are certain limitations to shopping online. But, if we keep sitting inside, it’d just be depressing. I can’t skip socialising just because there is Covid, and miss going to the malls or theatre. Therefore, the best solution would be to take all precautions and carry on with life as it is.”And Ankrish Khanna, a corporate professional, says he’s all set to again shift his hang out spots to homes of friends and relatives. “I’m just going to go and meet friends at their respective houses. I won’t stay in either because my mental health doesn’t allow me, and I’m sick of staying home. And while I’ll be working from home, I’ll drive my own car, and that’s safe enough.”Happy birthday, akele akele “Lagta hai iss bar bhi birthday akele he manana padega, aur gift card aayenge instead of actual gifts,” says Shubham Vaish, a Delhi-based theatre actor, recalling how there was a lockdown last year around the same time, just before his birthday. “But friends to come to my house, I wonder if they would have been to these places that have been marked super spreader. Like I won’t be travelling by Metro, but what about others who visit me? Bahut duvidha hai!”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/denizens-plan-to-shift-gears-from-super-spreader-areas-to-shop-indoors-stay-safe-101616921388626.html

Safety norms are set, mandatory sanitisation is being done, and colourful dustbins are stationed to discourage people from littering around. Delhi Zoo, which was closed for almost one year, is prepping to spring back in action from April 1, and Delhiites are overjoyed. Murals depicting brow-antlered deer, selfie spots depicting wildlife, await visitors after the hiatus. “Delhi Zoo has completed 61 years. It’s catering to the need of educating people in the field of nature and nature conservation. From last one year we’ve been focusing on animal welfare, health and hygiene issues. We were taking care of enrichment of enclosures, their food and giving them a feast. We decided that since we have come out of the bird flu time, now the time has come to open the zoo in slots, allowing limited people for a limited period of four hours. We have revamped our website and online booking will open soon,” Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park, Delhi.The authorities recently joined hands with Delhi Street Art (DSA), wherein over 70 volunteers painted over 40 dustbins over last weekend. “These bins were outside the building, at the entry point, and were ugly looking and untidy,” adds, Pandey, and Yogesh Saini, founder, DSA, says, adding, “The monkey mural (wearing a mask) is a humorous take on an otherwise serious topic and we hope will be an image that will stay with the visitors long after they’ve gone back from this wonderful venue...Now that the reopening is imminent, Covid-19 precautions will still be in place and artworks that we have created, will remind the visitors to not to let their guard down and continue to wear masks and maintain social distancing!”And residents waiting for the Zoo to reopen say they will visit even if it means wearing layers of masks and gloves! “Zoo opening soon already gave me chills,” says Hanisha Dua, a Delhi University graduate, adding, “It would be the same for so many us, and why not? I mean things are trying to get back to ‘new normal’ and we cannot wait for this place to serve us again with it’s lush greenery, chirping birds, beautiful animals there. I want to be around the people who share the same zeal as me when at Zoo and looking at all aspects of it, making this abode a pleasant one!”“Having a mask on is not enough, but wearing it consistently and properly, covering the nose and mouth is what I have to be cautious of, this goes a long way in serving precautions for others too. Sanitiser will be in my pocket at all times. Carrying my own meal and water would be an added option, but the sanitization happening at the Zoo has made me relaxed in that sense, I can be reliable here. I absolutely would be at a distance from others, making sure there is no crowd,”adds Dua.Arita Bharadwaj, a homemaker, who painted dustbins for the visitors, says, “People are going to love the art here, and especially kids when it opens. We’ve painted dustbins today depicting nature, and steps depicting an elephant. They’re going to conduct activities for kids here, too.

The probe will be done by a judicial commission and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has started the process to form the panel, people aware of the development said."In the last Cabinet meeting, I had asked the chief minister to investigate the allegations levelled against me by former Mumbai Police commissioner. He has agreed to it and the probe will be done by a retired high court judge. The truth in the entire matter will come before the people," Deshmukh said at the Nagpur airport.Former top cop Param Bir Singh, who was recently removed from his post, has claimed the state home minister indulged in extortion. Singh has claimed that Deshmukh met Sachin Vaze, arrested in connection with Mukesh Ambani bomb scare probe, in February and asked him to collect ₹100 crore a month from restaurants and bars in Mumbai.The minister, however, has denied the allegations and said that he was in home quarantine after he tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the period stated in Singh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Deshmukh has alleged that the former Mumbai police commissioner made the claims to save himself as his role in the Ambani bomb scare case was becoming clear.“We need concurrence of a retired judge who will probe the charges levelled against the home minister, which may take a few days,” said a MVA minister, on condition of anonymity after the meeting of senior ministers at Thackeray residence on Wednesday, where they decided to form a commission to probe Singh’s allegations.The commission is likely to be formed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, which will give it powers to summon anyone for deposition, seek documents, and conduct hearings.The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has repeatedly demanded that the home minister resign. He has also claimed that this is not the first time that Deshmukh has been named in a corruption case and pointed to the alleged illegal transfer of IPS officers in the state. Fadnavis said that a report was submitted to the government in this regard but no action was taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/truth-will-come-out-anil-deshmukh-on-corruption-probe-by-retired-hc-judge-101616917778631.html

Officials from the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said the firefighting system, including sprinklers, were not functioning. A notice for non-compliance of fire safety norms was issued to the mall in November 2020, they added.“It is not a case of negligence. There were serious lapses in terms of safety compliance. The biggest lapse is that the mall did not have fire permission. They have also violated the terms and conditions on the basis of which the BMC had given them a part NOC (no objection certificate). That is why we have booked the owners of the mall, hospital management, and the administrator, on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and are further investigating the case,” said deputy police commissioner Prashant Kadam.“The hospital had obtained permission to run a nursing home on October 1, 2020. Since January 2021, the facility has been functioning as a Covid centre.

28-03-2021||Delhi||No possibility of a lockdown in Delhi, says Jain||State health minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said that there was “no possibility” of enforcing another lockdown in the Capital and that people will have to “learn to live with” Covid-19 at a time when the city is recording a spike in daily new coronavirus infections, which are at their highest levels since mid-December.“There is no possibility of another lockdown in Delhi as of now. A lockdown had been implemented once and it was thought that since the incubation period for the virus was 14 days, if all activity was stopped for 21 days, the transmission would stop. The lockdown was extended again and again, but the virus did not stop. So, lockdown is not the solution,” said Jain in a press interaction on Saturday.Instead, he said, the city’s residents have to follow precautions to stem the spread of the viral outbreak and that “experts have been saying that one must not believe we would get rid of the virus any time soon and we have to learn to live with it”.Also read | Amid surging Covid-19 cases, Delhi issues fresh restrictions. Details hereExperts have repeatedly called for restrictions such as curtailing “non-essential” activities and large gatherings in the city, especially with the upcoming Holi festival on March 29, along with ensuring social distancing measures are followed.“I believe people have to exercise restraint themselves. They already know what to do, but have not been following the measures of late. During Holi, people should avoid going to others’ homes to wish them and do it over the phone instead. If they have to go somewhere, they must wear a mask and avoid hugging others or applying gulal,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Jain added, “In order to stop the increase in the number of cases, we have increased the rate of testing with around 85,000 to 90,000 tests being conducted each day. This is five times more than the country’s average. Isolation and contact tracing is also being done. For every positive case, over 30 contacts are traced and asked to remain in quarantine in order to contain it as fast as possible.”The Aam Aadmi Party leader also said that the Delhi administration has, since Monday, begun conducting random tests at railway stations and airports to prevent infections being imported in from other countries and cities.Also read | Delhi records 1,558 new Covid-19 cases, highest in over 3 monthsSpeaking of the state government’s preparedness, Jain said there was adequate availability of hospital beds to manage the current surge in cases.Jain also said that vaccination levels in the city are likely to increase from April 1, when the countrywide eligibility criteria is relaxed to include all adults above the age of 45.Currently, only those above the age of 60, and those between ages 45-59 with specific comorbid conditions can get the vaccine shots.Experts say the city’s vaccination drive has to be scaled up to curb the spread of Covid-19. The drive has so far been slower than planned, with 31,504 jabs administered on average each day through the week.On Saturday, 33,571 people were administered the first dose of the vaccine, and 4,163 were given their second shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-possibility-of-a-lockdown-in-delhi-says-jain-101616883285076.html
28-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt issues SOP for protection of interfaith couples; sets up 'special cell', 24-hr helpline||The Delhi government has issued a standard operating procedure (SoP) for the protection of inter-faith and inter-caste couples from harassment and threats and directed setting up of 'special cells', headed by deputy commissioners of police, to look into such matters.According to the SOP, the government will provide accommodation in its 'safe house' to those couples whose relationship is being opposed by their families or the local community or khaps.The government said the existing 181 toll-free women helpline of the Delhi Commission for Women will serve as a round-the-clock helpline to receive from inter-faith and inter-caste married couples complaints of threat and harassment and provide necessary assistance."The telecallers trained to handle distress calls and already aware about available services can provide necessary assistance/advice to the couple in distress. If required, they can be further trained to handle such calls," stated the SOP issued by the social welfare department.It stated that after hearing the couple, the DCP of the area concerned, who will perform as head of the 'special cell', will bring the entire facts to the knowledge of the district magistrate and convey their requirement for stay in 'safe house'.Earlier this week, violence had erupted at southeast Delhi's Harijan Basti in allegedly connection with an inter-faith marriage. The Delhi Police has arrested several persons for their alleged involvement in the incident."Adequate security shall be provided to the couple in form of PSO (protective service officer) and the 'safe house' will also be secured by the DCP of the area concerned."The couple shall be briefed about the threat to them and in no case they be exposed till the issue is resolved," the department said in SOP.In case the couple doesn't want to stay in the 'safe house', the special cell will provide protection to them in accordance with the threat perception at their place of stay.If preliminary enquiry ascertains the authenticity of threats, the DCP concerned will direct an ACP or sub-division police officer to register an FIR against those threatening the couple.According to the social welfare department, the government has established 'Safe House' at a state-run residential area in north Delhi's Kingsway Camp which can accommodate maximum three couples.It said in March 2018, the Supreme Court had directed the state to create 'special cell' in every district comprising the superintendent of police, the district social welfare officers and others to receive petition or complaints of harassment and threats to inter-caste and inter-faith couples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-issues-sop-for-protection-of-interfaith-couples-sets-up-special-cell-24-hr-helpline-101616879222486.html

Therefore, keeping in view the health of visitors, employees and animals, the zoo will be closed on Sundays,” said M Sudhagar, zoo field director. Besides, the zoo will also remain closed on Mondays, as is already the practice.Last year, after the pandemic broke out, the zoo was closed on March 16 and reopened only in December, causing losses to mount to nearly ₹4 crore. Even after the zoo was reopened, the number of daily visitors was capped at 2,700. Also, to ensure social distancing, zoo authorities had started online booking and staggered entry through shifts, but the high footfall defeated these efforts. The zoo is spread over 505 acres and is home to around 1,500 animals and birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-surge-chhatbir-zoo-to-remain-closed-on-sundays-101616879080107.html

28-03-2021||Chandigarh||Sexual harassment at work: Panels can be altered sans violation of law, says HC||The constitution of committees constituted at workplaces to deal with complaints of sexual harassment can be changed if the situation warrants, but not in violation of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, a Punjab and Haryana high court bench has held. HC has dismissed a plea against constitution of a committee by Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Patiala, which was challenged on the ground that it has to be presided over by a professor,as per the University Grants Commission (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal of Sexual Harassment of Women Employees and Students in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2015. But, in the law varsity’s committee, an associate professor has been appointed as committee head. HC found that an associate professor has been appointed as chairman, since there is no woman faculty member in the rank of professor. Therefore, the constitution of the committee cannot be declared bad. It is an undisputed fact that it is a small university and there is no women faculty member in the rank of professor, it added. It may be noted that the 2013 law is a Parliamentary Act and holds supremacy after the Constitution of India, the bench observed, adding that the UGC’s regulations are framed in exercise of the legislative powers conferred upon the executive body and are hence, referred as delegated/subordinate legislation. “Therefore, these regulations cannot supersede the parent/Parliamentary Act which is made by the legislature itself,” the bench said, rejecting the argument that 2013 law is a general legislation, whereas the UGC’s regulations are specific legislation and therefore, have to prevail over the 2013 law. “This court expresses its inability to accept the argument, particularly when the Parliamentary Act is applicable across the board and is a special Act enacted to deal with complaints of sexual harassment of women at workplace. The UGC’s regulations are to be read in consonance with the Act.In case of any repugnancy, it is the Parliamentary Act which has to prevail. Still further, once a field is occupied by a Parliamentary Act, the regulations, if any, framed by way of subordinate legislation, cannot supersede or overwrite the provision of the Act,” the bench said. To an argument that two contractual employees have been appointed as members in the nine-member committee, the court observed that there is no prohibition in the Act or regulations to include contractual employees in the committee. Out of the two contractual employees, one is a medical officer and the other is an assistant librarian, it said. The court also found that it is not mandatory that one member has to be from a non-governmental organisation or association. One member can either be from non-government organisations or associations committed to the cause of womenor a person familiar with issues relating to sexual harassment, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sexual-harassment-at-work-panels-can-be-altered-sans-violation-of-law-says-hc-101616878599979.html

He recently achieved a milestone when he completed the Everest Base Camp expedition at a height of 5,364 metres and 17,598 feet in Nepal in 10 days amid difficult conditions.“Everest Base Camp expedition is a dry run for Mount Everest. So I decided to go for it. The last two days were very challenging due to extreme weather. The oxygen level was very low at -10 degree temperature. The wind speed was averagely 40-60 km/hour. Due to the high altitude, I faced two sleepless nights and headache,” said the 39-year-old, who did mountaineering at Triund in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, in October 2020.“I really enjoyed my stint in Triund and wanted to do something more challenging,” added Kumar, who works as a sales manager in an IT company.The journey for the expedition started from Kathmandu to Lukla by a small aircraft. Lukla is at a height of 2,850 metre and the average temperature there is around -2 to -5 degrees.Kumar covered 98-100km in 10 days: “I had rice, dal and boiled potatoes to maintain my carbohydrate levels. I also carried chocolates, biscuits and some homemade stuff to maintain energy levels as one doesn’t get anything from Gorak Shep to the Everest Base Camp. I practised yoga daily to maintain mental and physical health. Milkha Singh is my inspiration. At 91, he is fit and runs daily. My ultimate aim is to climb Mount Everest, however, I will need a lot of funds to achieve that goal,” shared Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drawing-inspiration-from-milkha-singh-panchkula-mountaineer-makes-it-to-everest-base-camp-101616878481558.html

No FIR was registered against the driver and only a daily diary entry of the incident was recorded.The claimant had filed a plea under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act and was awarded a compensation of ₹1.09 lakh in 2013. However, the decision was challenged by the insurance firm in high court. In 2015, the high court found that her plea was not maintainable under Section 163A as her income was above the ceiling of ₹40,000 per year.The claimant filed another plea under Section 166 of the MV Act and was awarded ₹3 lakh compensation after it was found that the car that had hit her was being driven rashly. This decision was again challenged before the high court.The court said that simultaneous proceedings under different sections of the MV Act could not be undertaken. The remedy provided under Section 163A was on the basis of no-fault liability and had been inserted to cater to a claimant earning less than ₹40,000 per year, the court said, adding that there was no bar upon the claimant to file a petition under Section 166 of the MV Act.Had the claimant taken advantage of the relief amount passed on the petition under Section 163A and had then filed a petition under Section 166, the appellant would be right in contending the latter order, the court said. That not being the case, the contention of the firm was rejected. The court added that though no FIR was registered, the claimant did not state anywhere that there was no rash/negligent driving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-upholds-3-lakh-compensation-to-chandigarh-woman-injured-in-mishap-101616878242982.html

As there are no deans, I do not know when my RDC will be conducted.”Problems in thesis submissionA number of research scholars of PU who have completed their PhD thesis are not able to submit it.“Just because I need a document for submission which is approved by the dean, I am not able to submit my PhD thesis that I have been trying to submit for the last one month. In the absence of faculty deans, the university should look for some other alternative so that our work does not suffer,” said a research scholar.PU dean of research, professor Rajesh Gill, confirmed that the research scholars and even some faculty members were facing problems: “We are extending all possible help to the scholars, but in the cases where the deans’ authorisation or approval is needed, we cannot help.”However, PU’s official spokesperson Renuka Salwan said, “This issue has already been taken care of and is under active consideration. Students are not affected and their interests are protected in the best possible manner.”PUTA president Mritunjay Kumar said, “The governing body of PU should be constituted immediately otherwise the situation can worsen in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-absence-of-deans-research-scholars-of-panjab-university-suffer-101616877999841.html
28-03-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination drive losing steam in Chandigarh||The vaccination drive against Covid-19 is losing steam in Chandigarh, with the response by eligible people gradually waning, official data shows. While initially senior citizens and those with specific comorbidities turned up in enthusiastic numbers, reaching 8,065 in a week since March 1, their turnout has dropped by 30%, with only 5,646 coming forward last week. Overall, the number of beneficiaries, also including healthcare and frontline workers, rose to over 12,000 in the second week of March from 995 in the week after January 16, when the vaccination drive was rolled out nationwide. But, thereafter, the response has decreased by 35%, with only 8,182 people getting vaccinated last week (see graphic). Over two months into the drive, the turnout of health and frontline workers remains discouraging. While 29,722 health employees had registered initially, only 51% got the jab, while frontline workers fared a tad better, with 58% of the 25,173 registered beneficiaries receiving the shot. According to experts, the local administration needs to strategically plan outreach programmes to encourage more people to get inoculated. “The misinformation around the vaccine is decreasing. Earlier, people were concerned that it may have adverse side-effects, but those worries have been allayed with hardly any such cases being reported. But, people still need a push to come forward to take the jab by micro-planning the vaccination drive,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and School of Public Health at Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). “We need to learn from previous experiences of polio immunisation programmes by going into the community, so that every person in the population is touched,” he said. Dr GD Puri, chairman of the Covid-19 management committee and head of anaesthesia department at PGIMER, said, “It is important that people understand the worth of the vaccine and safety precautions, as it will help reduce the need for hospitalisation and also bring down the fatality rate.” Misinformation about the vaccine in the public remained a challenge, said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT Health department. “The vaccination process is really smooth for the targeted groups. One just needs to turn up with the Aadhaar card at any of the private and government facilities offering the vaccine. Anyone having queries can call or visit the health department,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-drive-losing-steam-in-chandigarh-101616877942100.html
28-03-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Sagar Sarhadi’s denunciation of barriers lives on||For many, the first reaction on hearing of the passing away of writer and director Sagar Sarhadi (1933-2021) this week was surprise that he had still been alive all these years. Many thought that he had passed away several decades ago. Such is the exceedingly short memory of the glitz and glamour of the film world where there is a constant tussle to make news and money. For this refugee boy, Ganga Sagar Talwar, born in Baffla village near Abbottabad, it was a happy life exploring the hills, bathing in the river, learning Urdu in school and at times helping his liquor contractor father in the shop. It was a big village home with plenty of grains. But it all came to an end and the family fled during the Partition. In an interview, a couple of years ago, he had said: “There was a lot of anger inside me at forces that drove people away from their homes and made them refugees. That angst never really left me.” Moving on with life It was this displacement and anger that made him question the world and turn to writing to resolve this chaos around him. Dismayed by the communal politics and violence in the name of religion, he turned to the leftist ideology.After completing his schooling in old Delhi where the family lived in a small house in Mori gate, he moved to Mumbai where his brother had found work. As a first-year student in Khalsa College, Mumbai, Sarhadi was greatly enamoured by poet Gulzar’s resounding voice, in which he would recite couplets of Mir and Ghalib. Realizing that he was not well-versed in literature, he started reading furiously and this was a habit he adhered to till the very end. In the final year of college, he moved to St. Xavier’s to hone his skills in English so that he could read the world classics that were easily available then in English translation. In his youth, he allied himself with the Indian Progressive Writers Union and as a regular at their meetings he came into contact with some of the well-known Urdu writers of the time such as Sajjad Zaheer, Kaifi Azmi, Ismat Chughtai and others. Sarhadi emerged as a talented writer of short fiction and a playwright who staged his pro-people’s plays. Praising his contribution to literature and cinema, poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar said: “Sagar Sarhadi a veteran theatre and film writer who wrote films like Kabhie Kabhie , Noori and directed Baazaar has passed away. My heartfelt condolences to the late bachelor’s nephew Ramesh Talwar”. Pen name for a new world The story of his pen name for the changed world is an interesting one. Sarhadi was to recall later, “I did away with Ganga and retained the Sagar. The reason for adding Sarhadi was to retain the identity of the Suba Sarhad that was home for me.” It was with this name that he emerged as a writer choosing theatre as a medium for reaching out with his social messages. The first film that Sarhadi wrote dialogues for was Basu Bhattacharya’s offbeat venture ‘Anubhav’ featuring Sanjeev Kumar, released in 1971. A few years later Sarhadi’s nephew, filmmaker Ramesh Talwar, who was then assistant director to Yash Chopra, invited the latter to see his uncle’s play ‘Mirza Sahiban’ based on a dilemma of an Indo-Pak war. Yash was so impressed by the soulful and terse dialogues of the play that he offered his next film to Sarhadi for screenplay and dialogues. The film was the multi-starrer Kabhie Kabhie with Amitabh Bachchan, Rakhee, Shashi Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, which proved to be a blockbuster winning as many as 24 awards and the lone Filmfare award to Sarhadi for its classic romantic dialogues. The films that followed with the unmistakable Sarhadi touch included Noorie(1979), Silsila (1981), Chandni (1989), Rang (1993) and Hrithik Roshan’s first film Kaho Na Pyar Hai (2000). The cult classic film BazaarSarhadi was hailed as the master of romance but the writer in him yearned for something more meaningful. And this happened with the cult classic film Bazaar (1982), in which Sarhadi chose to don the director’s cap. It was also Sarhadi’s first introduction to the city of Chandigarh when he came here for its trial run in KC Cinema, long demolished now.A director had arrived telling a heart-wrenching story of the plight of young girls in the lost splendour of the Nawabi city of Hyderabad, who were golden hens for poor homes and married to ageing Arabs for money. Starring Naseeruddin Shah, Smita Patil, Farooq Sheikh and Supriya Pathak, it stood its ground amid the new wave films of Shyam Benegal and Govind Nihalani. Sarhadi picked the best of Urdu ghazals for the film, including Mir Taki Mir, Makhdoom Mohinuddin and others and Khyayyam’s soulful musical score was to subvert the romance of the Urdu ghazal in the face of sad social reality. The film is still looked back with love. A greater acquaintance was made with Sarhadi through the film scriptwriter Amrik Gill, a friend from the Punjab University days in the mid-seventies. Amrik worked with Sarhadi in ‘Tere Shehar Mein’ and ‘Agla Mausam’ that were never released and ‘Chausar’ (2005), in which he had given the lead role to Nawazuddin Siddiqui in his days of struggle. Remembering him, Gill says: “I learned much working with Sarhadi,whose was a rare talent amidst the commerce of Bollywood. Even the one Bazaar he made makes him immortal and he will be remembered for all times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundaboutsagar-sarhadi-s-denunciation-of-barriers-lives-on-101616877940217.html
28-03-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: A serendipitous lesson in contentment||I had always been moved by the plight of a shabbily clad limping man who worked as a maali (gardener) in our neighbourhood. Though not a trained gardener, he could be seen wielding his khurpi (trowel), working in lawns and tending to flower beds in the locality. However, after lockdown was imposed, I did not see him for months together. It was only recently, when I was walking down to a nearby park, that I saw him working in a neighbour’s lawn. I stopped to catch-up and learnt that the poor fellow had lost his livelihood during the Covid-induced lockdown and had to return to his village. The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown has been a big blow to everyone, but workers in the informal sector have been among the worst-affected. The restrictions have somewhat relaxed but the pandemic seems to be here to stay and the ordeal of part-time workers continues as they have not been able to regain all their work. With honest curiosity and an intention to help the poor man, I asked him if his earnings were enough to meet his expenses. His composure surprised me as he raised five fingers to suggest he was able to make ₹5,000. He looked content, but I felt distressed. I wondered how he was managing with his meagre earnings. After all there was rent to pay, money to be transferred to his folks in the village. “What about your food expenses?” I asked, concerned. His answer left me stumped. With a glee apparent on his face, he shared his secret: three food packets comprising chapattis, pickle and a seasonal vegetable — his breakfast, lunch and dinner for ₹10 per meal, courtesy the Chandigarh administration with support of the Red Cross Society. ‘Content is a feast without end’I could not help be amazed at how satisfied he was. The satisfaction I saw on the face of a man getting just two (nay three) squares a meal, reminded me of a proverb from Judaism: all the days of poor person are wretched but contentment is a feast without end. I realised that a simple meal was no less than a treat for the poor fellow. Introspecting, I came to a rude realisation that we keep hankering after more and more riches and acquisitions and yet remain disgruntled and here was a man who had absolutely nothing, no possessions to his name but for a rickety cycle, and yet he was content. Without a trace of envy, jealousy, ambition or greed, he was facing the hardships of life head-on. ‘Discontent makes rich men poor’Ironically, I had stopped to extend help to the poor man, not knowing that I would be the one receiving a lesson in contentment from him. The serenity on his face, despite physical and economic challenges, was enough to remind me of the virtues of ‘santosh dhan’ —contentment is wealth, an asset in itself. Benjamin Franklin rightly says, “Content makes poor men rich; discontent makes rich men poor.” The writer is a retired associate professor at MCMDAV College, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-a-serendipitous-lesson-in-contentment-101616877459787.html
28-03-2021||Chandigarh||Wild Buzz: Return of colour||Oft mistaken as a hummingbird by adoring householders, this purple pixie of our gardens is currently revelling in a new, waltzing wardrobe. The male purple sunbird has also found his Elvis Presley voice, which had been stilled by icy winter. In February, as the weather warmed, the male commenced his forays to exposed perches such as electricity poles from where he excitedly belted out his songs of yearning that went ‘cheewit-cheewit-cheewit’, thus heralding the breeding season. The dowdy female would listen quietly to her suitor’s arias while she diligently sucked nectar and gobbled insects in anticipation of the maternal burden.Last winter, the male in eclipse or non-breeding plumage was drab and coloured like the olive and yellow female but distinguished by a black, necktie-like stripe running down his wintering chest and a hangover of black and purple on the wings. As spring came and flowers unfurled like lips offering sweet nectar, the necktie filled out and the male was blushed over by dark colours highlighted by a filigree of purple iridescence. How could a female miss this swashbuckling colour spot so vividly described by Dr Salim Ali: “The breeding male raises and lowers his wings displaying the brilliant yellow and scarlet tufts of feathers under the ‘armpits’ (or the male’s pectoral tufts).”Holi hai bhai, Holi haiLarge carpenter bees can be seen visiting lush, flowering gardens across the tricity. These bees burrow deep into petals while seeking pollen and nectar and come off smeared with pollen like hues of Holi rubbed liberally onto humans in festive joy.These pollinators evoke both fear and fascination but, in truth, despite their loud buzzing sounds and intimidating look, they are next to harmless. The female bee seldom uses her sting. The carpenter bee is coy and wary and prefers to buzz off when approached by humans.Unlike honey bees, carpenter bees neither make honey nor do they live in hives. Often mixed with bumblebees, carpenter bees differ from the former as they do not have hairy abdomens. Carpenter bees nest by drilling holes in dead wood, bamboo or structural timbers. Their carpenter sounds can be mistaken for birds performing similar functions so much so that these bees have come to be quaintly known as ‘woodpecker bees’! Their nests are used to store nectar and pollen for the brood and for winter hibernation. Over 500 species of carpenter bees are found across the globe. They are solitary in their nesting habits, though in some species the female will co-habit a nest with her sisters and daughters. With a flourish of sounds, wheeling aerobatics and a dazzle of metallic blue, green and purple, the carpenter bee announces its arrival in spring’s carnival. The sounds of these large bees so charmed the acoustic imagination of Russian composer N Rimsky-Korsakov that he wrote the orchestral interlude ‘Flight of the bumble bee’ in 1899-1900. The flurry and dizzying pace of the interlude’s notes evoke the bee’s seemingly chaotic and varying flight movements. A popular ‘distraction’ in the rarefied repertoire of the European classical tradition, the interlude is a ‘must hear’ for lovers of music and of creatures less glitzy than tigers!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wild-buzz-return-of-colour-101616877281267.html
28-03-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays:The delusive world of influencers||The great delusion of life itself has bamboozled mankind for aeons. So besotted do we become with our own illusionary little worlds that we never ponder over the bigger questions of life. Why did we take birth in the first place? Why will we have to suddenly leave one day, with no time to pack our bags?And to add to our collective confusion, nowadays we have a battery of social media influencers trying to sway our minds us even more. The vice-like grip of social media upon our consciousness is unrelenting, and only a very balanced mind can remain aloof to its compelling magnetism. We tend to spend every spare moment, and very often our busy moments too, browsing through the latest posts, images, videos and messages on social media channels.The impact and influence of such posts and their creators upon our minds is already the subject of study of many a researcher, and has at times been referred to by this columnist too. People such as socialite Kim Kardashian and her sisters may have displayed no great talent to the world at large, but their social media fan following is legendary, and no laughing matter at all. But to dive deeper into the subject, let us examine the success of a few trendsetters who might well be small town simpletons, but are setting the internet afire with their ‘earth shaking’ posts.Kanan Gill is a ‘deluxe’ comedian, for instance, with half a million Instagram followers, while Kusha Kapila, a digital ‘creator’ has thrice as many followers. The latter often takes up serious issues with nonchalant ease and drives home her point almost effortlessly. And quite wittily, she declares that she is ‘kabhi authentic, kabhi synthetic’!Kenny Sebastian, a stand-up comedian, has a million followers on Instagram, and regularly tickles the funny bone of his audiences without batting an eyelid. Dolly Singh, with an even larger following, creates hilarious videos and spreads cheer with every post.All of them have undoubtedly scaled dizzying social media heights and struck gold in many ways by dint of sheer perseverance and ingenuity, but only because the world is consuming their posts almost hungrily. They have cracked the code of being genuinely and refreshingly different from a plethora of also-rans who are way behind them in the distance.The key to the zippy world of these influencers is their ultra-creative approach and mass appeal based on their ability to make common people feel connected to them. They are nowhere near as popular as mega stars Virat Kohli or Deepika Padukone, but have carved out a niche for themselves, in whatever manner.The upside is that they entertain and even inform the general populace who follow them almost blindly. The downside is, however, that youngsters across the land delude themselves into thinking that they will one day be just like them.Thus, legions of school-going or college-going youngsters are attempting to ape these social media ‘stars’ by attempting to highlight their own talents. Humour, food, fashion, wellness, music, dance, glamour, wit, sarcasm and naughtiness all qualify as popular realms wherein a social media influencer can hope to make a mark. The name of the game is to have enough followers to make advertising brands sit up and take notice, or to be paid for their popularity by giants like Google themselves.Health influencers like YouTube celebrity Vivek Mittal the “Fit Tuber” protagonist with five million subscribers are, on the other hand, doing a yeoman’s service to society by dispelling several myths about diet, fitness and health. The key, as always, is the discernment with which the consumer, the viewer, digests the fare dished out by these influencers. To be taken in inordinately by any influencer and to allow him or her to impact the mind and even the heart is by no means a good idea for anyone, young or old. But to be entertained and even advised by those who are genuinely talented or well informed is to make judicious use of their influence.The world is, after all, more delusive than it has ever been. And we need to be more sensible than we have ever been!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-the-delusive-world-of-influencers-101616876379742.html
28-03-2021||Other||HP high court orders probe against teacher couple for tampering with records||The Himachal Pradesh high court, while disposing of a transfer petition, directed the education department to initiate an inquiry against a government school teacher and her husband for misconduct, and imposed a penalty of ₹50,000 on her for “abusing the process of the court”. The teacher, who is the petitioner in the case, had challenged the transfer order dated December 14, 2020, of the respondent to Government High School, Jol, under the control of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhali, where she had joined on the said date after being relieved from Government High School, Draman (Kangra). However, during the course of hearing, it was revealed that on December 14, 2020, the principal of GSSS, Bhali, was on official duty and in his absence, the petitioner, along with her husband, had entered his office without permission, and marked the attendance in the Teachers’ Attendance Register herself. The petitioner had candidly admitted before the court that she had herself made the joining report and the noting portion, regarding her joining service as TGT Arts, was appended by her husband in the joining report. The division bench, comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Chander Bhusan Barowalia, observed that the conduct of the petitioner and her husband is unbecoming of a teacher and therefore they deserve to be charge-sheeted for their misconduct. The court also observed that the petitioner had not come to the court with clean hands and had filed a false claim to gain unfair advantage and abused the process of the court. The court observed that it is a lamentable state of affairs when teachers, who are considered as equal to God, fall from the highest pedestal to the lowest level by caring for their self-interest alone and not of the pupil(s). The court also observed that it is the educational institutions which are the future hope of this country. These lay the seed for the foundation of morality, ethics and discipline. If there is any erosion or descending by those who control the activities, all expectations and hopes are destroyed. Teachers, in our perspective, are of character, honesty, simplicity and dedication, but both the petitioner and her husband who happen to be the teachers in government school, have not done justice to their roles as ideal teachers, the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hp-high-court-orders-probe-against-teacher-couple-for-tampering-with-records-101616875959722.html

The Hotels and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRWAI), a body of hotels, said the move will be devastating for their sector.“It is like a lockdown for us. Hotels currently don’t have business in the afternoon as workplaces are either closed or operating with limited staff. This rule will serve as a death knell for us,” said Pradeep Shetty, senior vice-president, HRWAI.The Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association (AHAR) said it was not feasible to conduct business by closing at 8.00pm.“We will see more hotels shutting operations in the coming days, and there will be huge layoffs in this sector. Hotels on rent will be forced to leave their premises due to lack of viability,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR.The Kosmic Group of Hotels, which has four outlets in the city, said it is planning to keep its establishments closed during the night curfew. “It makes no business sense [to keep establishments open], as consumers tend to arrive after 8.00pm. It’s better to close down till the situation normalises,” said Romi Chadha, owner, Kosmic Group of Hotels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bans-gatherings-shuts-malls-eateries-between-8pm-and-7am-101616875784199.html

As many as 2,972 people got infected with the virus from March 1 to 26, as against 1,935 total cases in February – which was the lowest monthly total since June 2020. As against 21 deaths in February, March has already recorded 27 deaths so far.Majority of the increase this month has taken place in Kashmir which contributed to 2,379 of the total 2, 972 cases till March 26. The most affected district in the new wave is again capital Srinagar which has 767 active cases of the Kashmir’s total 1, 269 active cases.“The increase in cases is there but it is not a sharp increase like in Maharashtra. Nevertheless our Covid-19 facilities and infrastructure are intact and we are ready for everything,” said director health, Kashmir, Mushtaq Ahmad Rather.The overall active cases in Jammu and Kashmir have doubled in March to reach 1,681 on March 26 from 823 by the end of February.

28-03-2021||Other||India, Pak must move beyond secret talks, resolve issues through open dialogue: Omar||National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah on Saturday welcomed thawing of ties between India and Pakistan but stated that a lot of ground was still to be covered. He said that the two countries should move beyond secret talks and indulge in open dialogue.The former chief minister said that he won’t go into whether this was because of compulsion or sincerity on anyone’s part.“Whatever it is, it is good. We have always said that the friendship between these two countries is not only for the betterment of J&K but the whole of South Asia,” he said on the sidelines of a party function in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.Last month, Indian and Pakistan’s militaries agreed to strictly observe a ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC). Earlier this month Pakistan’s army chief general Qamar Javed Bajwa said it was time for India and Pakistan to ‘bury the past’ and move forward as that would help to ‘unlock’ the potential of South and Central Asia.“It is good that the two countries are now taking friendship instead of threatening each other but still a lot has to be covered,” said Abdullah.The turn in India-Pakistan relations comes around one-and-a-half years after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was revoked by the central government and the region split into two Union territories.Abdullah said that they have come to know about secret talks between the two countries. “We have heard that there have been secret talks. We want them to talk to each other openly across the table on all issues. The issues are plenty including J&K and all other issues. We want a solution to all issues through dialogue,” he said.Earlier this week, the moderate Hurriyat Conference faction led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also welcomed India and Pakistan’s agreement to adhere to ceasefire on the Line of Control and stated that the subsequent statements and actions indicated a ‘positive shift’ in the relations between the neighbours.The Hurriyat said it welcomes the shift towards good neighbourly relations between the two countries, which was the first step in the direction of a meaningful dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir conflict.On being asked about the Enforcement Directorate’s summons to PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, Abdullah said that they have experienced these things in the past 6-8 years.“From J&K to Tamil Nadu, Assam to Gujarat, neither Mehbooba Mufti is first leader (to be summoned by Enforcement Directorate) nor would she be last. Unfortunately for the past 6-8 years we experienced that one has to bear the brunt of these agencies on opposing the central government. Wherever these actions are taking place they will be faced strongly,” he said. In J&K, he said that it was the work of the UT government to reassure people and bring them into confidence. “But unfortunately here we still are into governor’s rule. It is the duty of the LG and his officers to bring people here into confidence and assure them about their betterment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/india-pak-must-move-beyond-secret-talks-resolve-issues-through-open-dialogue-omar-101616875239650.html
28-03-2021||Other||Amarnath Yatra registration to start from April 1||The registration of pilgrims for the annual Amarnath Yatra is going to commence on April 1 for both the routes of Baltal and Chandanwari through 446 designated Bank branches of Punjab National Bank (316), Jammu and Kashmir Bank (90) and YES Bank (40), across the country, said officials. This year’s 56 day Yatra shall commence simultaneously on both the routes from June 28 and culminate on August 22—on the festival of Raksha Bandhan. This year the government has been making arrangements for six lakh pilgrims. Chief executive officer, Amarnath Shrine Board, Nitishwar Kumar has informed that the step-by-step procedure, application form and state-wise list of bank branches with complete addresses are available at the shrine board’s website. He said that to keep a check on fraudulent health certificates, only such certificates which are issued by doctors and medical institutes authorised by the state government / UT administrations concerned shall be accepted at the registered bank branches. For Yatra 2021, only those health certificates which have been issued after March 15 shall be valid. The steps which yatris need to follow in order to register for the Yatra, have been put on the Board’s website www.shriamarnathjishrine.com. It contains relevant information on how to reach the base camps, fee for yatra registration, tariff for ponies, palanquin and porters. The CEO further informed that persons under the age of 13 years or above the age of 75 years and women who are more than six weeks pregnant would not be registered for this year’s yatra. The CEO also informed that the Yatra Permits would be different for each day of the week and route, with a different colour coding for each day to facilitate the police personnel deployed at the Access Control Gates at Baltal and Chandanwari to regulate the Yatra for the relevant date and route. In this context, he cautioned the intending pilgrims against undertaking this arduous yatra without securing a Yatra Permit and the required compulsory health certificate. Kumar stressed that for ensuring effective security arrangements along the difficult tracks, only those yatris who are in possession of a Yatra Permit which is valid for a specified date and route, will be allowed to proceed beyond the base camps, and cross the entry gates at Domel and Chandanwari. Yatris who propose to travel by helicopter do not require advance registration as their helicopter tickets shall suffice for this purpose. However, they shall be required to produce the Compulsory Health Certificate (CHC) in the prescribed format issued by an authorised doctor, before they are allowed to travel by helicopter. Jammu DC calls for enhancing Yatri Niwas accommodation capacity to 5,000 Jammu deputy commissioner Anshul Garg on Saturday convened a meeting with the senior officers of various departments to review the arrangements being put in place here at Bhagwati Nagar Yatri Niwas for comfortable stay of pilgrims during Amarnathji Yatra. Yatri Niwas is the main base camp here at Jammu from where pilgrims embark on their journey towards Srinagar and then to Pahalgam and Baltal to undertake the trek to cave shrine nestled at a height of 13,000 feet in South Kashmir Himalayas. Garg reviewed the status of the available facilities like power, drinking water, sanitation, transport, security, barricading, mobile toilets, clock rooms, langar arrangements, parking facility, PAS and related services. The officers apprised him that Yatri Niwas has 13 halls with the capacity of catering to around 1, 500 yatris at a time with attached bathrooms and other facilities. Garg emphasized upon the officers to increase the per day accommodation capacity from current two thousand to five thousand. Regarding this, Garg was informed that a hall of 7000 sq ft having a capacity of accommodating 500 yatris would be constructed at an estimated cost of 174 lakhs by the Tourism department. He directed the concerned officers to gear up men and machinery to ensure adequate arrangements for the comfortable stay and onward journey of Yatris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amarnath-yatra-registration-to-start-from-april-1-101616874939682.html

28-03-2021||Chandigarh||As Ludhiana resigns to a subdued Holi, shopkeepers report 80% dip in sales||With fresh restrictions imposed on public celebrations of Holi in Punjab, shopkeepers across the city who had stocked their shops with a multitude of colours — organic and otherwise —and an assortment of paraphernalia such as water guns and balloons ahead of the festival of colours reported an 80% dip in sales. The shopkeepers said that with one day to go for the festival, sales had still not picked up. Forlorn stalls stocked with a wide array of colours can be seen at markets in Daresi, Ghumar Mandi, Jawahar Nagar. Shopkeepers say the footfall is significantly lower than previous years as cartoon-embossed water guns, priced between ₹50 to ₹400 to cater to children of all social strata, patiently wait for the traditional horde of children to gather around and clamour for these novel goodies. Nominal increase in price There has been a nominal increase in the price of products —colour packs of 50g and 1kg will cost ₹30, they were previously priced ₹25 and ₹60, respectively. The 10-kg pack will cost ₹700. A shopkeeper, who requested anonymity, said after the commissioner of police banned all gatherings at hotels, restaurants and malls due to a surge in virus cases, few customers turned up to purchase products. Sunil Kumar, who owns a toy shop in Daresi, said, “I have been in this business for 20 years and every year a people throng to purchase colours and water guns before the festival. However, the pandemic and sudden spike in cases has severely affected our business. Only two customers have shown up since morning, if this continues, I will not be able to clear my stock. I had purchased a variety of water guns made in India, and herbal colours but there are no customers.” Another shopkeeper, Gurjinder Singh of Jawahar Nagar, said, “We had stocked up on water guns, vibrant colours, and coloured smoke but over the last week, we are only able to sell merchandise worth ₹5,000, though we bought products worth ₹40,000. I had hired two additional employees to handle the rush before Holi but with few customers coming up, I will find it difficult to even pay their salaries.”Holi parties no longer all the rage Ishneet Sharma, a resident of Punjab Mata Nagar, said, “I attend Holi parties every year but this year due to an increase in virus cases, I will stay at home and celebrate the festival with my family. My friends plan to have a get together but I have decided to stay home and stay safe.”Despite surging cases, many residents were seen ignoring safety protocols, including social distancing and wearing masks, in markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/as-ludhiana-resigns-to-a-subdued-holi-shopkeepers-report-80-dip-in-sales-101616874219663.html

The review plea of the university was rejected by assistant commissioner, provident fund, Ashwani Kumar Barik earlier this month after re-assessing the records and the BFUHS was asked to deposit the pending amount immediately.BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said that the university has deposited ₹6 crore employer’s share to the PF. “There is no irregularity or negligence in depositing provident fund of employees,” he added.The EPFO also ordered the university to deposit the penalty and interest imposed on the total default amount due to the delay in deposit. Following this, the university had filed a plea to re-check the amount of employers’ share to PF.BFUHS registrar Ruhee Dugg said the EPFO officer has calculated the amount of provident fund of the contractual employees to be paid by the university. “We had filed a review application to reassess the records as it could not be that much amount. However, it was not considered. Now, we have filed an appeal to re-check the order to confirm the due amount to be paid by the university. This assessment was conducted in January and we have objected whatever has been calculated,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/review-plea-rejected-epfo-recovers-rs-6-cr-employer-s-share-from-bfuhs-101616874159695.html

The farmers held a protest outside the PWD rest house on the Bathinda road near the district administration complex and raised slogans against three agriculture laws and the central government.Barnala block chief of BKU Ugrahan Balour Singh said that the BJP government introduced ‘black laws’ and farmers opposed these controversial laws.Bansal alleged that the Capt Amarinder Singh government has failed to fulfil its pre-poll promises but the Modi government wanted to double the farmers’ income.

However, only 1,500 residents have enrolled their dogs over the last nine months. While pets can be registered for a ₹400 annual fee, the civic body will impose a ₹4,000 fine on owners of all unregistered pets after March 31. No cat owners have shown up for registration so far. With the pet registration drive garnering a tepid response, the civic body had extended the last date to register pets by three months. However, as the second deadline draws to a close, the drive has yet again fallen short of the MC’s expectations. The task is all the more daunting for authorities as the MC does not have a count of pets in the city.The drive had commenced in June 2020 and residents had been initially asked to register their pets till December 31. After residents said they were facing difficulty in registering pets over the MC’s website mcludhiana.gov.in, the MC also commenced offline registration through suvidha kendras.MC’s senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “The civic body has received a good response with around 1,500 residents registering their pets. If any pet is caught without registration, the MC will impose a ₹4,000 fine, besides an additional ₹100 fine per day for the time the pet remains in our custody.”To register their pets, residents can either go to the MC’s zonal offices or visit mcludhiana.gov.in and fill in necessary details. Registered pets will receive a brass token, to be tied around the pet’s neck. Residents have to collect the tokens from MC’s Zone-A office (MC headquarters) near Mata Rani Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/as-pet-registration-deadline-approaches-only-1-500-owners-comply-in-ludhiana-101616873800571.html
28-03-2021||Chandigarh||BJP’s Abohar legislator thrashed, clothes torn by farmers in Malout||Protesting against agriculture laws, activists of farmer unions allegedly manhandled BJP legislator from Abohar Arun Narang and tore his clothes at Malout town in Muktsar district on Saturday afternoon. Narang reached Malout to address a press conference at BJP’s office. However, farmer unions had laid siege outside the office to hold protest against the three farms laws imposed by the BJP-led central government.Farmers gheraoed Narang when he reached outside the BJP office in his car. They also blackened his car with ink. The farmers allegedly attacked him and tore his clothes, when police personnel and BJP workers were trying to rush him inside a shop. Later, police took him to a safer place through the back door of the shop.BKU (Sidhupur) district president Sukhdev Singh said they had already announced that if any political leader will visit Muktsar district, they will strongly protest against him. “We do not support the incident of tearing clothes of the MLA, but it’s difficult to control a large number of people,” he added.He said that they will continue to protest like this against political leaders in future as well. During the ongoing farmers protest against agri laws, a number of senior BJP leaders including state chief Ashwani Sharma has faced strong protest from the farmers in the past few months.Police have registered an FIR against Lakhan Pal Sharma, Sukhdev Singh, Nirmal Singh, Nanak Singh, Kulwinder Singh Danewala, Rajinder Singh, Avtar Singh and 300 unidentified persons under Sections 307,353,186,188,332,342,506,148 and 149 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Malout police station.Terming the incident an attack on democracy, Narang said: “The stalemate on farm laws is to be resolved in Delhi, attacking me will not help them. The democracy is at its worse in Punjab as an elected representative is not safe, this is a failure of state government,” he added.After the incident Narang was admitted to the Abohar government hospital, where three-member board of doctors inspected him. Narang has only sustained minor injuries.Jakhar condemns attack Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar has strongly condemned the attack on Arun Narang in Malout saying such unlawful behaviour has no place in a democracy. He said that farmer protests will be weakened with incidents like these. In a statement, Jakhar, while terming the attack as highly unfortunate, said everyone should be allowed to present his views and every citizen should respect each other’s right to speak. No law and order in PunjabJALANDHAR: Former state BJP president, Manoranjan Kalia also condemned the attack on Narang and demanded imposition of President’s rule in Punjab. “Despite police presence, Narang was not only thrashed but his clothes were torn. If an elected representative is not safe, how can a common man feel safe in the state? The law and order has totally collapsed in Punjab,” he said.Meanwhile, BJP national general secretary Tarun chugh demanded the CM’s for his failure to maintain law and order in Punjab.Sukhbir seeks impartial probeChandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) termed the violent attack on Narang as deplorable and demanded an impartial inquiry into the incident to fix responsibility for the failure of the state police in protecting the dignity of an elected representative. The SAD chief appealed to everyone to exercise restraint to ensure the peace and communal harmony of the state was not disturbed. He also castigated the state police for failing to do its duty even as he maintained the Congress government had failed miserably as far as maintaining law and order was concerned. Sukhbir said violence did not have any place in civilized society and that such acts would only serve to weaken the farmers’ agitation. Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and school education minister Vijay Inder Singla also condemned attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjps-abohar-legislator-thrashed-clothes-torn-by-farmers-in-malout-101616873799478.html

The process is expected to be completed in three days after Holi.“We shall get the additional stock of 19.76 lakh vaccine doses by April 1. We have a current stock of about nine lakh doses,” said Dr Ajai Ghai, state immunisation officer.From the state-level depots, the vaccines will be distributed to 1300 cold chain points in 75 districts. Each district has a central and a local cold chain point identified to feed vaccination centres each day when the inoculation takes place.Uttar Pradesh has already received 74 lakh doses of the vaccines so far and over 56 lakh doses have been administered. The recipients include over 10 lakh people who have got their second dose as well.The number of vaccination centres will be increased from the current level of about 4500. Soon, the health and wellness centres (HWCs) in the state will also start giving the Covid jabs.“As the vaccination for all the people of 45 years and above starts, the number of beneficiaries will go up. We expect an increase in the rush for vaccination.

28-03-2021||Other||Migrants steel themselves to brave the odds||At around this time last year, migrant workers had shaken the conscience of the nation as fear of the unknown compelled them to walk miles — hungry and thirsty with blisters on their feet — to somehow reach home.They had been caught unawares when the lockdown was announced due to Covid-19 and there was a complete shutdown of all possible transport services.One year down the line, a majority of the migrants who had returned to the metros for work are better prepared – both physically and mentally. The rising coronavirus cases or the fear of lockdown does not disturb them enough to think of going back home now. Rather, they are ready to stay put, albeit with some preparation.In fact, the nightmare they went through about 12 months ago has given them the strength and wherewithal to brave the looming crisis as mounting Covid cases create a scare of another lockdown in some parts of the country. But this time, they are making arrangements and not rushing back home.Employed in low-paying menial jobs, many of the workers have stored food supplies, medicine and rent for a month to 50 days’ time.“Corona se kachu dar nahin hain bas lockdown ke chinta rahat hai (I am not afraid of contracting the coronavirus infection, but worry about the possibility of a lockdown),” said Harender Yadav, a migrant worker from Ballia district in UP who drives an auto-rickshaw in Thane, Maharashtra.Maharashtra has reported the maximum increase in fresh Covid-19 cases recently.Harender and over 40 other auto drivers, all belonging to various districts of Uttar Pradesh, live together in rented shanties in the Thane East area.“We hear about rising Covid-19 infection and the talk of a a possible lockdown every day (in Maharashtra). Some of us have already stored some food and rent in case a lockdown is announced. The others are also doing whatever they can to get by in the lockdown,” Yadav said.Almost a year ago, Yadav and other migrants left Thane amid the lockdown and drove their auto-rickshaws carrying their families back to their villages in UP. Many others returned in special trains, on trucks, rented vehicles or on foot.According to UP government data, over 35 lakh migrant workers travelled back to UP in a reverse migration during the lockdown last year. A majority of them belonged to districts in the less developed eastern Uttar Pradesh. Over half of the migrant labourers were found to be unskilled in a survey done by the government. This was also reflected in a spike in daily employment under MNREGA that went up by a record 57 lakh per day from an average of nine lakh per day before the lockdown.“Because of the limited skill sets of these workers and severe decline in jobs even in the unorganised sector, most of the migrant labourers who came to UP during lockdown had to return to their place of employment soon after the lockdown restrictions were removed,” said Brijesh Prasad Tiwari, a former economic advisor to the state government.“It is estimated that over 80 to 90% of these migrant workers returned.”“We remained in our villages for around six months almost till Diwali before returning here and starting work,” said Dinesh Kumar Singh, a mason from UP’s Mau district who lives close to Harender’s shanty in Thane.“I didn’t bring my wife and two children along when I returned. I have stored rice and pulses enough for a month and kept aside ₹5000 for rent in case a lockdown is announced,” he added.The migrants have made these arrangements despite their extreme financial constraints to avoid their biggest fear of losing work and returning home.While coming home last year, many of them planned to stay back and never return to the cities again. One of them was Kuldeep Pal, a helper at a garment factory in Jamnagar, Gujarat. He hitched a ride behind a truck cramped with labourers to go back home during the lockdown, pledging to never return again.“Socha to nahin tha par majboori thi (I never thought of returning, but conditions at home forced me to come back here). I tried to get a job in UP for over five months but failed. I was left with no other option but to return,” Kuldeep recalled.Kuldeep and five other migrant workers from his district who share a single room have pooled in ₹4,000 each to manage food and other expenses in case of a lockdown.“Almost every labourer who came back has made some arrangement. Nobody is ready for the hardship we faced while returning home last year,” Pal added.Along with the perilous journey back, the migrants expressed fear of the economic backlash they suffered because of the lockdown.“All of us are in debt. Some of us have to pay the pending EMIs on our autos, others have to return the money borrowed during lockdown. The money has not been returned till date due to loss of earnings. People are working from home. They don’t require us to take them to offices anymore,” said Harender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/migrants-steel-themselves-to-brave-the-odds-101616873498946.html

The attack left him and his co-passenger seriously injured. Behura has been moved to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack city.Behura was known for his RTI activism in the district and had become an eyesore of several influential people due to his RTI applications that uncovered several irregularities in government schemes. After receiving information, the police reached the spot and sent the injured to the hospital.Earlier in January this year, Odisha Lokayukta had asked the vigilance department to probe whether Biju Janata Dal MLA Pranab Balbantray and other government officials conspired to blow up an irrigation embankment with dynamites that inundated 4,000 hectares of standing paddy crop in seven gram panchayats of Jajpur district after Behura lodged a complaint.In his complaint, Behura had alleged that during the construction work of the embankment, the MLA in collusion with a junior engineer took a huge amount of money from the contractor following which the contractor used sub-standard material in the construction work. He alleged that to cover up the sub-standard work, the MLA and the engineer hired miscreants to cause breaches in the embankment by using dynamites to give an impression that the embankment was washed away because of the strong current of floodwater.BJP state general secretary Lekhashree Samantsinghar condemned the attack on Sarbeswar Behura and sought the DGP’s intervention to arrest the culprits.In February last year, Ranjan Kumar Das, a 35-year-old RTI activist of Kendrapara district, known for filing multiple RTI applications into several irregularities, was found dead in suspicious circumstances about 2 kilometres from his home. Das’s body was recovered with multiple injuries on the face, along with his motorcycle, in a ditch by the road.In December 2019, a 48-year-old RTI activist of Kandhamal district was shot dead by unidentified persons in front of his home. RTI activist Abhimanyu Panda was standing in front of his home when two bike-borne miscreants came and fired a bullet at him.Pradeep Pradhan, leading RTI activist and convener of Odisha Soochana Adhikar Abhiyan, a forum of RTI activists, said RTI activists in Odisha are facing harassment and threats to family members over their RTI applications. “In the last 5 years, at least 40 RTI activists in the state have been attacked after their vested interests were exposed by the RTI activists. The RTI activists are harassed, tortured and mercilessly beaten up by powerful people as police do not take action on their complaints. Despite several complaints to higher authorities for an immediate investigation into FIRs lodged by RTI activists and ensuring their protection, the state government has not taken any steps in this regard,” said Pradhan.In 2017, Suresh Lenka, an RTI activist from Jagatsinghpur district faced a brutal attack after his RTI applications revealed that ₹1 lakh was allegedly misappropriated by the local Sarpanch and Panchayat Executive officer from NREGA fund. His RTI activism also uncovered huge irregularities in the distribution of houses under Biju Pucca Yojana and Indira Awas Yojana.In January 2015, Krupasindhu Sahu, an RTI activist of Nachhinga village in Cuttack district was murdered allegedly for procuring information that exposed corruption and financial misappropriation in the Bringing 2nd Green Revolution in East India (BGREI) funds. Sahu was killed a month after the murder of another RTI activist Ganesh Chandra Panda from Rangeilunda village of Ganjam district, over exposing corruption in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-rti-activist-bjp-leader-critical-after-bomb-attack-101616872539938.html

In the 2017-18 Union Budget, it announced the revival of 50 airports/airstrips at the cost of ₹4, 500 crore. Again on February 1, 2020, while presenting the budget, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the construction of 100 more airports under the central government’s regional connectivity scheme, Udey Desh ka Aam Naagarik (UDAN), by 2025. This announcement came a day before India reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Kerala. While the government had started screening passengers from China/Honk Kong at Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai airports from January 18, 2020 itself, by March, the procedure was extended to passengers from all the other countries across every airport.As per the latest data made available, India’s domestic passenger traffic dipped to a seven-year low to 61 million in 2020, while the international passenger volume declined by 90.56% in the March-December period of last year as compared to previous years. As per DGCA report issued on March 17, February saw 7.8 million domestic fliers, which is 36.71% less as compared to the same period last year.The decline in the passenger traffic has raised questions over the government’s ambitious airport expansion plans, though the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) believes that its plans remain on track.“The government’s airports’ expansion plan is a well-thought idea for future travel, and seems to be in the right direction. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, airlines are currently running into losses, which was unexpected. This could cause a delay in the actual implementation of these plans,” said a former Airports Authority of India (AAI) board member, on the condition of anonymity.The pandemic has hit the aviation sector globally due to visa and travel curbs, and this has led to some airlines going out of business, while others are heavily trimming their operations. In India too, while the commercial passenger flight services on domestic routes were allowed from May 25 after a two-month halt, commercial passenger flights on international routes remain suspended till date since March 23 last year. This has, in turn, impacted the airports’ business and lower passenger traffic has not only squeezed their aeronautical revenue but also non-aero revenue.Though domestic travel has gradually started picking up, the international traffic amid the ongoing restrictions is expected to take at least two years to get back to the pre-Covid times. Passenger traffic at Asia-Pacific airports, according to the international airports body Airports Council International (ACI), is expected to return to the pre-Covid levels by 2023.“The aviation industry has almost recovered, as people have started travelling by flights. Domestic flights are flying with over 90% load. Looking at the growing domestic travel, the government will come up with around 20-25 greenfield airports by this year,” said additional director general and MoCA spokesperson Rajeev Jain.“Air connectivity across the country is essential, and the government is ahead of its plans to construct/revive airports/airstrips,” Jain added.According to ACI, the recovery path in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East regions will be slow and uncertain, with a diverse demand recovery pattern. However, as per Asia-Pacific forecasts for 2020-2040, over the next 20 years, these two regions will be the fastest-growing globally, with the total passenger traffic expected to grow fast at a compound growth rate of 4.7% and 5.2%, respectively.According to ACI Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Philippines and China are among the top 10 fastest-growing countries by compound growth rate – from 2019 to 2040 – with over 50 million passengers.ACI’s forecast, related to the recovery of passenger traffic, is under the baseline scenario, the global traffic is expected to recover to 2019 levels in 2024, mainly driven by the recovery of domestic passenger traffic, but slightly dampened by a slower recovery of international travel (globally, domestic traffic accounted for 58% of the total passenger traffic in 2019).Domestic passenger traffic is expected to reach 2019 levels in the second half of 2023. With governments introducing more restrictive steps, creating new lockdowns and travel restrictions, it is going to severely hamper efforts to resume the pre-pandemic operations. ACI also said that in the long run, it is predicted that the global traffic may take up to two decades to return to previously projected levels (pre-Covid-19 forecast). A structural change (traffic never returning to pre-Covid-level) is also a possibility.While the government is setting up goals for regional travel, the pandemic has brought in an unimaginable financial crisis in the sector.In mid-January, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri minister said that the government had set a target of operationalising 100 unserved and under-served airports, besides starting at least 1000 air routes under the UDAN scheme, launched about four years ago, with a budget of ₹4,500 crore.“The air traffic will bounce back in a year, after the vaccines prove successful. Although the idea of coming up with new airports is good and a much-needed one, the government should slow down its pace, as coming up with new airports is practically not feasible this year,” said VP Aggarwal, former chairman, AAI.Pitching for connecting UDAN flights to the main city airports for better accessibility and reliability, Aggarwal said, “Sometimes airlines book slots, conduct inaugural flights and are not then able to fly as per schedule.” The country needs airports like Jewar and Navi Mumbai for better connectivity to the new/smaller airports to operate in the regional connectivity scheme, he added. According to MoCA, as many as 56 airports have been upgraded and over 700 air routes awarded, of which 311 routes have already commenced under the UDAN scheme.“While the government has laid down an ambitious target of 100 airports/ airstrips by 2025, the level of achievement would depend upon their ability to mobilise resources through monetisation of the existing ones (in tier-2/3 cities as announced in the Union Budget) as well as the interest of private sector in participating in public-private partnership projects, which in turn are also linked to their ability to mobilise finances,” said Anupama Arora, vice-president and sector head for corporate ratings, ICRA Limited.Overall, given the under penetrated air traffic market in India and the evidence of steady passenger traffic growth between financial year 2010-11 and financial year 2019-20, the growth prospects for aviation infrastructure in the long- term remains healthy, as the sector grapples with dampened traffic in the near-term on account of the pandemic, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/airport-expansion-plans-experts-say-pandemic-hit-sector-needs-to-revive-for-idea-to-take-off-101616872299572.html

A team of seven doctors, including Dr Jasmeen Chautala (daughter in-law of former Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala), is supervising the medical facilities at the hospital.The hospital was inaugurated here on March 24 by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait.Arjun Chautala, INLD leader and son of Abhay Chautala, said that they have started quarantine and isolation facilities for Covid-19 infected farmers at this makeshift Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal Kisan Hospital.“We have provided 40-bed facilities and 10 more beds will be added by this week. A team of seven doctors, including a general physician, a dentist orthopaedic and cardio experts, are treating the farmers. Three wards have been set-up, two for men and one for women. A special ward has been set up for women where gynaecologists are also available. My wife, Dr Jasmeen, is looking after the entire medical process along with six other doctors, all of whom are working free of cost. The team of doctors is from our medical wing and have come forward to help the farmers voluntarily until the farm laws are repealed,” Arjun said.Jhajjar principal medical officer Dr Sanjay Dahiya said that less than 20 farmers have received the Covid-19 vaccine jab by Friday.“Farmers want to receive the vaccine shot but are waiting for their leaders’ consent. They are appearing to get other medical aides but don’t want to talk about vaccination. Some farmers even said that there is no Covid-19. We are making all efforts to appraise them and give them the vaccine shots,” the Jhajjar PMO added.One being asked about less farmers receiving the jab at Tikri border, INLD leader Arjun Chautala said they have asked the local health department to provide them vaccine shots and are planning to organise vaccination awareness camps at Tikri.“We are not underestimating the virus and will start a vaccination drive at our hospital after receiving the vaccine shots,” he added.Joginder Nain, head of Ghanshi Ram Nain faction of BKU, said that there is no Covid-19 and farmers will not go for vaccination.“Our immunity is tough and none of us got infected. Government is creating fear of rise in Covid-19 cases to cause panic,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/inld-starts-40-bed-quarantine-facility-near-tikri-border-101616871879265.html

28-03-2021||Other||Andhra govt changes exam pattern in Autonomous colleges||Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to change the examination pattern in autonomous undergraduate and post-graduate colleges by cancelling the existing system which allowed these colleges to set their own question papers for various degree and PG courses. The colleges will now have to follow the examination papers prepared by the universities under whose purview they are located. The evaluation of answer papers would also be done by the respective universities. This was decided at a high-level meeting convened by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy at his camp office in Amaravati on Friday. State education minister Adimulapu Suresh said there were in all 109 autonomous colleges under the purview of various universities. These colleges design their own syllabus for various courses, prepare question papers on their own and conduct examinations for students as per their own schedule, while the degrees are awarded by their respective universities. “It has come to our notice that some of these colleges had been indulging in large scale irregularities in the conduct of examinations, taking advantage of their autonomous status while enjoying the concessions being given by the government like fee reimbursement scheme,” the minister said. Stating that such irregularities had resulted in poor quality of education in these colleges, Suresh said the government has decided to act tough with these autonomous colleges and take stringent action against them, if they didn’t mend their ways. “As part of reforming the system in these autonomous colleges, the state government has decided to conduct an academic audit in these colleges and evaluate their academic standards. In the first step, we have decided to do away with the present system of allowing them to prepare question papers on their own for various courses,” he said. Hereafter, these autonomous colleges would have to follow the examination papers prepared by the universities, which would also take up evaluation of answer sheets. “We shall take up the issue of these autonomous colleges with the University Grants Commission, the nodal agency to grant autonomy for the colleges,” he said. The minister said since education was a concurrent subject, the state government has every right to take decisions with regard to autonomous colleges. “They cannot take decisions according to their own will. If anybody wants to go to court challenging the government’s decision, they can go. We are ready to counter their move,” he said. At the review meeting, the chief minister instructed that all the autonomous engineering colleges would follow the same question papers set by Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) for non-autonomous colleges in the state. The JNTU itself would take up the evaluation of the answer papers. “These steps are being taken to prevent malpractices in the exams and improve the educational standards in the colleges, so that the engineering graduates would get better job opportunities,” Jagan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-govt-changes-exam-pattern-in-autonomous-colleges-101616871638865.html
28-03-2021||Other||German botanist who made B’luru bloom all year through||Bengaluru: It’s March and Bengaluru has been transformed into a ‘pink city’, with flowers like Tabebuias and Jacarandas seen in full bloom across parks and streets, providing the much-needed joy after a dull year marred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Christened as Garden City, Bengaluru, is dotted with varieties of flowers throughout the year and this amazing feat is widely attributed to contributions from erstwhile rulers, government officials and most importantly a German botanist. Interestingly, the story of how Bengaluru eventually got the Garden City tag dates back to 1760, when erstwhile ruler Hyder Ali commissioned the development of Lal Bagh, which was inspired from the Mughal Gardens in Delhi. Though commissioned by Hyder Ali, the garden was eventually completed by Tipu Sultan. According to the horticulture department, Lal Bagh is home to a tree planted by Tipu himself.The development was taken over by the British after their conquest of the city, but it was a German horticulturist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel who changed the way the city looks today. In 1908, the Maharaja of Mysore offered Krumbiegel the job of redesigning Lal Bagh after witnessing his work in Baroda. In his book `The City Beautiful’, TP Issar, former chief secretary of Karnataka and chairman of the Urban Arts Commission wrote that Krumbiegel worked not only in developing Lal Bagh but several other gardens in the city as well. “Many of the lines and clusters of Cassias, Gulmohars, Tabebuias and Bougainvillea, which we see today, are enduring manifestations of Krumbiegel’s dreams of a blossoming Bangalore,” he wrote. Between1908 and 1932, Krumbiegel introduced several species of flowers including Tabebuias, which are native to tropical America. Krumbiegel also introduced a system called ‘serial planting’ to ensure that all streets in Bengaluru would be planted with seasonally-flowering trees so that the city would bloom all year through. “He planned the trees in such a way that Bombax Ceiba will bloom in January, Pongams in February, Pink Tabebuias and Purple Jacarandas in March, Cassia Javanica in April, Scarlet Gulmohar in May, Pink Bauhinias in June, Rain Tree in July, Colvillea Racemosa in August, Golden Cassia in September, Amherstia in October and November, and fragrant white Millingtonia in December,” says author Shobha Narayan. Interestingly, the man who changed Bengaluru’s face was imprisoned by the British Army and was deported back to Germany. However, the Maharajah of Mysore managed to get him out both the times, according to records. Krumbiegel stayed on in the city as a consulting architect and advisor in horticulture and town planning till his death in 1956. Over the years, several more trees were added by the city administration. However, according to activists, this tree cover is slowly getting lost. Vijay Nishant, an environmentalist, who is also known as the tree doctor, said that during his surveys he found that the recent development work has changed the ecosystem in the city. “We were used to trees blooming throughout the year in the 1990s but now, it has changed drastically. We are seeing more of certain flowers. We are conducting a survey, which we hope will shed some light on which trees needs to be planted to balance this change,” he said. At the same time, Harini Nagendra, a Bengaluru based ecologist, said that there is a need for variety in trees planted in the newly developed areas in Bengaluru. “If you compare with other cities, we have always had a wide variety of trees and flowers, many of them were exotic flowers brought from abroad thanks to Krumbiegel. But in the new areas that are developing, there are just two or three varieties of trees that are planted. This needs to be looked at,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/german-botanist-who-made-b-luru-bloom-all-year-through-101616871579280.html

Any breach of protocols will attract strict action, they warned.The appeal comes in the backdrop of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on March 23already having banned Holi festivities in the city in view of the rising number of Covid cases.Talking to reporters, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said both the district administrations and the police have constituted a number of teams to crackdown on those violating the orders of DDMA.The DDMA, which is headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and has chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as its vice-chairperson, on Tuesday had prohibited celebrations and gatherings in public places in view of the upcoming festival, while asking officials to start random Covid-19 tests for passengers entering the Capital from airports, railway stations and inter-state bus terminals.Also read | No possibility of a lockdown in Delhi, says JainA day before Holi festivities are scheduled to begin in the city, health minister Jain on Saturday reiterated that residents must stay indoors so as to avoid coming in contact with people.“I would like to appeal to one and all that we must celebrate the festival within our homes. If 50 people meet and out of them even two are Covid positive, then that becomes a risk for everyone involved. Such events must be avoided,” he said.The minister further said the government was creating a number of teams that will keep a watch against public gatherings on Holi. “District magistrates (DMs) and the police are creating district wise teams. Strict penal action will be taken against violators,” Jain said.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, public places will also include grounds and clubs inside residential apartments.“No gatherings or celebrations are allowed at such places as well.

The policemen returned fire and killed one assailant, who was later identified as Ravi Malik, while another suspect, Ankesh, sustained two gunshot wounds to his abdomen.CCTV footage and statements of eyewitnesses, who identified Fajja from a set of pictures shown to them, confirmed that Fajja had escaped on a motorcycle, the police said on Saturday. Police are yet to catch the gangster or his accomplices who were involved in his escape plot.“Fajja rode the motorcycle, while his accomplice, who had come to release him along with the others, rode pillion. The associate, whose identity we are trying to establish, fired three bullets in the air to disperse the crowd near the hospital gate,” a police officer associated with the investigation said, requesting anonymity.The police said CCTV footage of the escape route showed that the two fled towards Nand Nagri in east Delhi. They were last spotted on a CCTV camera in Nand Nagri chowk.“Prime facie, it appears that the assailants had planned everything in advance and had also done extensive reconnaissance of the escape routes,” said a second investigator, who also asked not to be named.Fajja belongs to Gogi’s gang, which recently joined hands with a gang led by Sandeep, alias Kala Jatheri, and the police suspect the involvement of both the groups in Fajja’s escape.Malik, who died in the gunfight, belonged to Haryana’s Jind and had links with a key member of Jatheri’s gang who was recently arrested from Rajasthan’s Jaipur, the second investigator said.When Fajja was arrested from Gurugram in March 2020, he carried a reward of ₹2 lakh on his arrest. He is involved in several cases of murder, extortion and robbery, among others.Interrogations of the injured suspect Ankesh, who hails from Delhi’s Mundka, revealed that he his handler directed him to meet two men at a hotel in north-west Delhi. “Ankesh claims that he was not given the names of those men but only their physical and attire descriptions. He denies knowing Malik or meeting him before.

Abolishing the power of an elected government is against the spirit of democracy. Earlier, the SC had clearly ruled that the elected government is the real head of Delhi.“Also read | Rajasthan govt to roll out health insurance coverage scheme on May 1The CM further said, “Modi government wants to run the country in a fascist manner. Electoral malpractices, horse trading of elected MLAs, and when failing in both, it resorts to passing such a dictatorial bill on the strength of its majority in Parliament. This is how the Modi government rules.”He said the Modi government can abolish the powers of the state government by bringing such laws if the BJP loses the elections in any state. “This dictatorial decision of the Modi government should be opposed at the national level by rising above the party line,” Gehlot said.He further said while in opposition, the BJP used to demand more rights by giving full statehood status to Delhi, but now they have brought such a law. The Prime Minister advocates cooperative federalism but in reality, the NDA government is imposing decisions on state governments by introducing bills like the GNCTD, Gehlot said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal thanked Gehlot for his stand on the GNCTD Bill.“Thank you Gehlot for supporting the people of Delhi against the unconstitutional bill of the Centre. The constitution and democracy of the Indian Republic are paramount.

They have all been booked under section 304A of the Indian Penal Code for causing death due to negligence and under section 9 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavenger and Their Rehabilitation Act.Also read | “The banquet hall was run by a firm where Jimmy Arora is a director. Preliminary enquiry has revealed that Rahul, knew one of the labourers, Lokesh Kumar. It was Lokesh who had brought along Prem Chand, as they both lived in Trilokpuri and had known each other. We have also invoked the SC/ST Act in the case,” the DCP said.Both Lokesh and Prem Chand died from asphyxiation on Thursday night after they entered the septic tank of the Pearl Grand Emperor banquet hall to clean it. The duo had been promised a sum of ₹1,500 each for the job.Lokesh’s brother-in-law, Deepak Kumar, said he knew Rahul. “Rahul was a distant relative of Lokesh. They were cousins and belonged to the same village in Uttar Pradesh. Rahul often used to call Lokesh for catering work and other jobs at the banquet hall and at other places. It was on his pursuance that the two entered the tank on Thursday. Though they were inexperienced, they had been threatened of a wage cut if they did not clean the tank. All the arrested men are responsible for my brother-in-law’s death and they must be punished,” said Deepak, who is a sanitation worker.Following the news of the death of the two labourers, members of Delhi sanitation workers unions and family members and relatives of the deceased had gathered outside the banquet hall on Friday and staged a protest demanding immediate arrest of the owner and the housekeeping manager.The chairman of the union, Sanjay Gehlot, who had visited Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital — where the two bodies were kept for autopsy — on Friday said that despite the government providing machines to clean septic tanks and sewers, people still use labourers, as it is a cheaper option. “It is cruelty. The workers were not given any safety equipment or protective gear. We demand adequate compensation for the families of the two men. Those responsible must be brought to justice,” Gehlot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/septic-tank-deaths-four-of-ghazipur-banquet-hall-arrested-101616868459762.html
28-03-2021||Kolkata||CM Banerjee says ‘scrap PM’s visa’ after Modi’s Matua temple visit in Bangladesh||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Dalit Matua community’s most sacred temple at Orakandi in Bangladesh on Saturday created a stir in West Bengal amid the first-phase assembly polls. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged that the PM violated the election code of conduct by wooing a community that is important in the local elections. His visa and passport should be scrapped, she demanded.Banerjee, while addressing a rally in West Midnapore district, cited the example of Bangladeshi movie star Ferdous Ahmed whose visa was cancelled by the Ministry of Home Affairs for attending a Trinamool Congress (TMC) rally at Raigunj in north Bengal before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He was blacklisted too.Modi, who is on a two-day trip to Bangladesh, met the Matua community members at Orakandi in Gopalganj where their most sacred temple is located. He said he received great affection from the community in West Bengal, especially from Binapani Devi, the community’s head who died in 2019, during his visit to the Matua headquarters at Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas district.The Matuas are part of the larger Dalit Namasudra community. Originally from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), most of the Namasudras came to India during the partition and after the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 to escape religious persecution. The Namasudras can influence the results of the ongoing elections in around 80 of Bengal’s 294 seats. In 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wrested two Lok Sabha seats where the Namasudras are present in large numbers. The party won 18 of the state’s 42 seats that year.“I was waiting for this opportunity for many years. When I visited Bangladesh in 2015, I had expressed my desire to visit Orakandi,” Modi said in his speech on Saturday and announced that India will upgrade one middle school and set up a primary school in Orakandi.A couple of hours later, Banerjee flared up at her rally in Kharagpur town.“When elections are on, he (Modi) has gone to Bangladesh and making a speech on West Bengal. This is totally a violation of the election code of conduct. Law cannot be discriminative. A film star named Ferdous came here during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He went to one of our rallies to express his best wishes. The BJP moved the Bangladesh government. The Indian government cancelled his visa so that he cannot come here anymore,” she said.“You scrap a Bangladeshi actor’s visa for attending a rally. What action is being taken when a Prime Minister is visiting a foreign country after the polls are notified and talking about people who matter in the elections here? You went to the US and held a meeting in support of Trump. Your visa and passport were not cancelled. When elections are on you have gone to Bangladeshi to tell lies to a certain section of people for votes. Why shouldn’t your visa and passport be cancelled?” said Banerjee.“We will complain to the Election Commission of India. How can a foreign country play a role in the internal matters of another country? Rules apply to us but not to you. What has Bangladesh got to do with elections in Kharagpur? Sometimes you allege that Mamata has brought all the infiltrators from Bangladesh and now you have gone to Bangladesh to market yourself. Who is right and who is wrong? We will go to any extent to get an answer,” said Banerjee.In April 2019, The Union home ministry cancelled the visa of Ahmed who triggered a controversy after being seen campaigning for TMC candidate from Raiganj, Kanaia Lal Agarwal, in north Bengal. He was asked to leave India for violating visa norms. The actor was also blacklisted which barred him from applying for an Indian visa in the future.The People’s Representative Act 1951, which governs how elections are conducted in India, does not expressly deal with foreign nationals campaigning for a party but visa rules forbid foreigners from participating in political activities in India. Ahmed was in India on a business visa.Reacting to Banerjee’s allegation, BJP’s Bengal unit vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “The chief minister needs to study law. Ahmed violated Indian law while the Prime Minister is visiting Bangladesh to strengthen bilateral relations. He did not violate any law by addressing the Matua community.”In 2019, the BJP wrested the Bongaon Lok Sabha seat in North 24 Parganas by fielding Binapani Devi’s grandson Shantanu Thakur against his aunt and the then sitting TMC MP Mamata Bala Thakur. The BJP also won the Ranaghat seat in Nadia where the Hindu Dalit community comprises a sizeable section of the population.In his Orakandi speech, Modi referred to Shantanu Thakur who has demanded immediate implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act in West Bengal. The BJP has promised in its Bengal election manifesto but has remained silent on the issue in Assam where polls are also being held.Kolkata based professor of economics and political analyst Sarthak Roychaudhury said, “Modi’s Bangladesh visit is a strategic one. While he could have easily visited the famous Kali temple in Dhaka, he went to the Jashoreshwari temple which has an old connection with the Matua community. Also, he talked of participating in a struggle in support of the Bangladesh Liberation War. It seems he wants to strengthen ties with Bangladesh in view of the situation in Myanmar, the Rohingya problem and India’s relation with China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cm-banerjee-says-scrap-pm-s-visa-after-modi-s-matua-temple-visit-in-bangladesh-101616866359089.html
28-03-2021||Other||Tricity Buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||Chandigarh SSP milks bucketful of publicity A picture and video of Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal milking a buffalo is doing the rounds on social media and winning him praise. Chahal, who comes from a family of farmers from Ujhana village in Jind district of Haryana, shared the picture on Friday on Facebook in which he’s seen milking a buffalo. He captioned it: “No matter where life takes you, never forget where you come from.” Back home, Chahal would help his father, Sadhu Ram, who is a farmer, and his mother, a homemaker, with household chores. He takes pride in his rural roots. By Saturday, the picture got over 38,000 likes and more than 4,000 people commented on it, appreciating the officer. The picture has also been doing the rounds on WhatsApp groups and has become the talking point in police circles. Now, that’s virtually milking a bucketful of publicity. Strictly by the book, we’re in Chandigarh With the spike in Covid-19 infections in Chandigarh and a push from the Centre to tighten curbs, the UT administration is looking to increase testing. It’s even roped in the private sector for expanding the testing capacity. But, that hasn’t help scale up the testing significantly. “People are not coming forward to give samples then how can testing be increased?” says a senior UT official, requesting anonymity. But can’t the administration follow the Mohali practice where people are being tested if they don’t wear a mask in public. “That’s illegal. Under which law are people being forced to give samples. We can’t follow this in the Union Territory, where we go by the book. Testing has to be voluntarily. It can’t be meted out as a punishment,” the official says. Mohali civil surgeon injects hope for Covid vaccination The response to the ongoing vaccination drive against Covid-19 in Mohali district has been poor, prompting civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur to reach out to residents on social media and FM radio. Appealing to people to give up their hesitancy and get vaccinated, Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur reiterates on air that the vaccine is safe. “It will save your life from the virus,” she says. Ever since the vaccination drive began, only 58% of health workers in the district have taken the vaccine. The response of senior citizens in the second phase has not been encouraging either. Now, all eyes are on the third phase beginning from April 1 when people above 45 years will be eligible to take the shot. Green warriors see red over fairy lights on trees Chandigarh is home to tree-lined avenues and many a resident is proud of City Beautiful’s green heritage. But our green warriors were up in arms last week when trees in front of Panjab University’s Night Food Street opposite PGI were seen wrapped in fairy lights. The Greening Chandigarh Action Plan bars such decoration as the fairy lights chained around tree barks can mess with the flowering cycle and affects birds, too. City-based environmentalist LR Budaniya said, “I got in touch with the municipal corporation authorities, who got the lights removed the next day. Some parts of the city, including Sector 22, have put up such decoration, which is harmful for trees. Awareness is needed.” The MC authorities said no challans were issued. Former syndicate members continue to grace PU website Even though the term of the Panjab University syndicate ended on December 31, the official website of the varsity reflects the names of last year’s members under the heading, Syndicate for the year 2020. No fresh syndicate elections were held in the absence of a senate, the apex governing body of the university. It’s time the university website’s updated.

28-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: ACP Nangare, Dharavi’s Covid hero dies of cardiac arrest||Ramesh Nangare, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sakinaka division, who was praised for his good work and excellent management for containing the spread of Covid-19 in Dharavi, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday morning, two days after he took the second dose of accident for Covid-19.Senior police officers said the health department has ruled out any link of his death with his vaccination.The 1989 batch police officer, Nangare was recently posted with the Sakinaka division. A police officer said on Wednesday he completed his day’s duty and stayed back for the night duty. In the night, he felt discomfort and therefore returned to his Gorai home at 5am. Around 10am he suffered a heart attack. His family members then rushed him to a hospital where he breathed his last.Nangare is survived by wife, two sons and a daughter.“The doctors have opined that he died of cardiac arrest. For now, there nothing to link his death to the vaccine. His family has also not complained of anything,” said Dr Maheshwar Reddy, deputy commissioner of police of zone 10.His colleagues and seniors remember Nangare for his extraordinary work for controlling the spread of Covid-19 in Dharavi, which was a Covid hot spot until recently. At the relevant time, Nangare was posted there as senior police inspector at Dharavi police station.Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Niyati Thaker Dave, who was zonal DCP for the Dharavi area at the time, and is now on central deputation, said Nangare was an outstanding, fearless and dedicated officer.“He has played a pivotal role in strict enforcement of lockdown rules, distribution of masks, sanitisers and food grains to Dharavi residents during the pandemic. He walked through the lanes and raised awareness about Covid. He handled the migrants’ issue during the pandemic and also became an inspiration for his colleagues and subordinates. He was featured in NatGeo’s documentary for his outstanding work to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the densely populated slum pocket. His death is a huge loss to the police department,” Dave added.Additional commissioner of police Viresh Prabhu said Nangare was one of the most dedicated and bravest officers. During the peak of the Covid pandemic, Nangare would always be seen either addressing the public and spreading awareness about Covid-19. He singlehandedly managed the Covid-19 situation in Dharavi and would not go home for days, as he always kept his duty at the top of his priority list. He was a well-disciplined officer and was very fit physically. News of his untimely demise is devastating,” Prabhu added.ACP Kailash Awhad, a close friend and colleague of Nangare, said, “Everyone in our families is in deep shock due to his untimely and unfortunate death.”Nangare, who was to retire in 2024, was honoured by Governor BS Koshyari and home minister Anil Deshmukh for his outstanding work as a Covid warrior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-acp-nangare-dharavi-s-covid-hero-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-101615485754878.html
28-03-2021||World||Tugs, dredgers struggle to free container ship Evergiven blocking Suez Canal||Suez Canal salvage teams were alternating between dredging and tugging on Sunday to dislodge a massive container ship blocking the busy waterway, while two sources said efforts had been complicated by rock under the ship's bow.Dredgers working to dislodge the stranded vessel have so far shifted 27,000 cubic metres of sand, to a depth of 18 metres (19.7 yards), and efforts would continue around the clock according to wind conditions and tides, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said in a statement.Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has ordered preparations for the possible removal of some of the ship's 18,300 containers, SCA Chairman Osama Rabie told Egypt's Extra News.Any operation to lighten the ship's load would not start before Monday, an SCA source said, as salvage teams try to take advantage of high tides before they recede next week to manoeuvre the ship free.The 400-metre (430-yard) long Ever Given became jammed diagonally across a southern section of the canal in high winds more than five days ago, halting shipping traffic in one of the world's busiest waterways.At least 369 boats are waiting to transit the canal, Rabie said, including dozens of container ships, bulk carriers, oil tankers and liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vessels.Shippers affected by the blockage may be offered discounts, Rabie said, adding that he believed investigations would show the canal was not responsible for grounding the Ever Given, one of the world's biggest container ships.Rescue workers from the SCA and a team from Dutch firm Smit Salvage have been weighing how much tugging power they can use on the ship without risking damage, and whether some cargo will need to be removed by crane in order to re-float it.Experts have warned that such a process could be complex and lengthy. Rabie said he hoped it would not be necessary, but that Egypt would take up offers of international assistance if it did switch to that strategy.A ballast tank at the bow of the ship has been damaged, and the vessel will have to be inspected once it is freed, two people familiar with the salvage operation said.'POSITIVE INDICATORS'"There are positive indicators from yesterday and the day before yesterday," Rabie told Egyptian state TV."The rudder was not moving and it is now moving, the propeller is working now, there was no water underneath the bow, and now there is water under it, and yesterday there was a 4-metre deviation in the bow and the stern."However, two SCA sources told Reuters that a mass of rock had been found at the bow of the ship, complicating salvage efforts.From the dredging done so far it was still unclear whether the ship was stuck on soft sand, compact sand or clay, which will determine how easily it may shift free, said one official involved in the salvage operation.Two more powerful tugs are expected to arrive by Monday. "We believe that is what you are going to need in terms of horse power ... to have a decent attempt, a decent chance of trying to float her," the official said."We're dividing the day into two halves, 12 hours for dredgers and 12 hours for tugs, because not all times are suitable for tugs due to the tide," said Rabie, adding that 14 tug boats in total were being deployed.About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the Suez Canal, which is a key source of foreign currency revenues for Egypt. The current stoppage is costing the canal $14-15 million daily.Shipping rates for oil product tankers nearly doubled after the ship became stranded, and the blockage has disrupted global supply chains, threatening costly delays for companies already dealing with Covid-19 restrictions.If the blockage drags on, shippers may decide to reroute their cargoes around the Cape of Good Hope, adding about two weeks to journeys and extra fuel costs.The SCA has said it can accelerate convoys through the canal once the Ever Given is freed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tugs-dredgers-struggle-to-free-container-ship-evergiven-blocking-suez-canal-101616953737814.html
28-03-2021||World||Paris doctors warn of catastrophic overload of virus cases||Critical care doctors in Paris say surging coronavirus infections could soon overwhelm their ability to care for the sick in the French capital's hospitals, possibly forcing them to choose which patients they have the resources to save.The sobering warnings were delivered Sunday in newspaper opinions signed by dozens of Paris-region doctors. They came as French President Emmanuel Macron has been vigorously defending his decision not to completely lockdown France again as he did last year. Since January, Macron’s government has instead imposed a nationwide overnight curfew and followed that with a grab-bag of other restrictions.But with infections soaring and hospitals increasingly running short of intensive-care beds, doctors have been stepping up the pressure for a full French lockdown.Writing in Le Journal du Dimanche, 41 Paris-region hospital doctors said: “We have never known such a situation, even during the worst (terror) attacks” that targeted the French capital, notably assaults by Islamic State extremists in 2015 that killed 130 people and filled Paris emergency wards with the wounded.The doctors predicted that softer new restrictions imposed this month on Paris and some other regions won't quickly bring the resurgent epidemic under control. They warned that hospital resources won't be able to keep pace with needs, forcing them to practice “catastrophe medicine" in the coming weeks as cases peak.“We already know that our capacity to offer care will be overwhelmed," they wrote. “We will be obliged to triage patients in order to save as many lives as possible. This triage will concern all patients, with and without Covid, in particular for adult patients' access to critical care.”Another group of nine critical-care doctors writing in the newspaper Le Monde also warned that intensive care units in Paris may have to refuse patients.“The current situation is tending toward prioritization, also called ‘triage,’” they wrote. “When just one ICU bed is available but two patients could benefit from it, it consists of deciding which of them will be admitted (and will perhaps survive) and which will not be admitted (and will quite probably die). This is where we are heading.”They also accused Macron's government of hypocrisy “by compelling health care workers to decide which patient should live and which should die, without stating so clearly.”Macron remains adamant that not locking France down again this year, like some other European countries, was sound government policy, even as more than 2,000 deaths per week push the country ever closer to the milestone of 100,000 people lost to the pandemic. The country now counts more than 94,600 virus-related deaths.“We were right not to implement a lockdown in France at the end of January because we didn’t have the explosion of cases that every model predicted,” Macron said last week. “There won’t be a mea culpa from me. I don’t have remorse and won’t acknowledge failure.”Macron's administration has been hoping to outrace the resurgent outbreak with its vaccination campaign, an ambition that appears increasingly unrealistic as hospitals struggle. After a sluggish start in December, France's inoculation drive stepped up this weekend with the start of injections for healthy people aged 70 and above.More than 7.7 million people — close to 15% of all French adults — have had at least one jab of either the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines. The government says the pace will continue to pick up, with France expecting to get nearly 3 million additional Pfizer doses this week.The European Union's vaccine czar, Thierry Breton, told French radio RTL on Sunday that the bloc will deliver 420 million vaccine doses to its member countries by July 15.“The vaccines are coming,” he said.Breton also unveiled a mock-up of a proposed EU health certificate that could allow the bloc’s residents to cross its internal borders more easily. The certificate shows if people have been vaccinated, tested negative for coronavirus or recovered from it. He said the certificate would be optional and could be available by mid-June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-doctors-warn-of-catastrophic-overload-of-virus-cases-101616951200091.html

Facebook said it followed guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) that there is currently no medication that can cure the virus.In a statement on Sunday, Venezuela's information ministry said Facebook was going after "content geared toward combating the pandemic" and described Carvativir as a retroviral of "national production and engineering.""We are witnessing a digital totalitarianism exercised by supranational companies who want to impose their law on the countries of the world," the ministry said.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Venezuelan doctors have warned that Carvativir's effect on coronavirus has not been established. The treatment is derived from thyme, an herb that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine.Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse since taking office in 2013 and is labeled a dictator by Washington and many other Western nations, said in a tweet on Sunday that he would broadcast his daily coronavirus briefing on the Facebook account of his wife, first lady Cilia Flores.The South American country has reported 155,663 cases of the novel coronavirus and 1,555 deaths. Those figures are below the levels of many regional peers, but the political opposition says the true number of cases is likely far higher due to a lack of testing.

28-03-2021||World||China signs 25-year deal with Iran in challenge to US||China and Iran signed an overarching deal aimed at charting the course of their economic, political and trade relations over the next 25 years.The Chinese government plans to invest in Iran and buy oil from the Islamic Republic, further straining ties with the U.S. already frayed by China’s imports of covertly-shipped Iranian crude.The “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” agreement, signed in Tehran on Saturday by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, has been in the works since 2016, when President Xi Jinping became the first Chinese leader to visit the Iranian capital in over a decade.Beijing’s alliance with Tehran is a challenge to U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration as it sets about trying to rally allies against China, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said is the world’s “greatest geopolitical test.”“The document can elevate bilateral ties to a new strategic level,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a televised interview. The deal focuses on boosting private-sector collaboration and Iran’s role in Xi’s flagship infrastructure and investment program, the Belt and Road Initiative, he said.However, the pact drew criticism from many Iranians on social media who accused President Hassan Rouhani’s government of “selling” Iran to China, prompting several of his aides to defend the deal on Twitter.A draft copy of the accord that surfaced on media last year showed plans for long-term supply of Iranian crude to China as well as investment in oil, gas, petrochemical, renewables and nuclear energy infrastructure.Lured by the prospect of cheaper prices, China has already increased its imports of Iranian oil to around 1 million barrels a day, eroding U.S. leverage as it prepares to enter stalled talks with Tehran to revive a nuclear deal.The Biden administration has indicated that it’s open to reengaging with Iran after then-President Donald Trump abandoned the accord nearly three years ago and reimposed economic sanctions, but the two sides have yet to even agree to meet. Iran exported around 2.5 million barrels of oil a day before American penalties resumed.Iran’s closer integration with China may help shore up its economy against the impact of the U.S. sanctions, while sending a clear signal to the White House of Tehran’s intentions. Wang Yi, who arrived in Tehran on Friday, also met with Rouhani to discuss the nuclear deal.In a televised speech, Rouhani raised the prospect of restrictions being eased before the end of his second and final term as president in early August.“We’re ready for the lifting of sanctions,” he said on Saturday. “If obstacles are removed, all or at least some sanctions can be lifted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-signs-25-year-deal-with-iran-in-challenge-to-us-101616950965451.html

28-03-2021||World||White House says it's working on access to migrant centers||White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined to provide a specific date for when the media will get access to Border Patrol facilities temporarily holding thousands of migrant children seeking to live in the United States, but said Sunday the Biden administration was committed to transparency and “we’re working to get that done as soon as we can.”More than 16,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody as of Thursday, including about 5,000 in substandard Customs and Border Protection facilities.Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been calling on the administration to open the facilities to the cameras, asserting that the current policy is designed to keep the public from “fully realizing” what is happening at the border.Republican officials are also blaming the Biden administration for actions they say are leading more people from Central America to seek entry into the United States. “It’s not a crisis, it’s a complete loss of sovereignty down there,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said.Graham recently visited the border and said he saw a facility designed to hold 80 children with about 1,000 in it. He called on the administration to turn away every unaccompanied minor after testing them for “human trafficking abuses.”“If you don’t, we’ll have 150,000 a month by this summer,” Graham said Sunday.U.S. authorities reported encounters with more than 100,000 migrants on the southern border in February, the highest since a four-month streak in 2019.Encounters have averaged about 5,000 people per day throughout March, which would be about a 50% increase over February if those figures hold for the entire month.White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said the surge was cyclical.“They’re not the result of one administration’s policies or another administration’s policies. They’re the result of, for example, weather disasters in the region. They’re the result of people fleeing poverty and violence,” Bedingfield said. “So we saw spikes in 2014. We saw them in 2019 when the Trump administration had perhaps the cruelest imaginable policies in place, family separation to try to deter people from coming, and they still came.”The Biden administration continued to emphasize on the Sunday talk shows that the U.S.-Mexico border “remains closed” and that the majority of adults are being turned away. But Psaki said the administration was not going to force children to go back on a treacherous journey.“They are fleeing challenging economic circumstances, hurricanes, prosecution in some scenarios,' she said. “It does not mean that they get to stay in the United States. It means their cases are adjudicated and we want to treat them humanely, make sure they are in a safe place while their cases are adjudicated. That’s what we’re talking about here.”Former President Donald Trump expanded and fortified border walls while championing “zero tolerance” policies that made it more difficult to seek U.S. asylum and led to some immigrant parents being separated from their children.Under federal law, children arriving at the border without parents should be transferred within three days from U.S. Border Patrol custody to long-term facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services until they can be released to family members or sponsors.Psaki said the administration is committed to transparency and providing access to those temporary Border Patrol facilities as soon as it can.“We are mindful of the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic. We want to keep these kids safe, keep the staff safe,” Psaki said.Psaki and Graham spoke on “Fox News Sunday,” while Bedingfield was interviewed on ABC's “The Week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-it-s-working-on-access-to-migrant-centers-101616950331623.html

28-03-2021||World||US census data delay scrambles plans for state redistricting||Stymied by delayed census data needed for redistricting, some states are considering postponing their 2022 primaries or turning to other population estimates to start the once-a-decade task of redrawing voting districts used for US House and state legislative elections.The US Census Bureau was supposed to provide redistricting data to the states by March 31, but after setbacks from the pandemic, it won't be ready until mid- to late August and might not be available in an easy-to-use format until Sept. 30. That's later than the legal deadlines to complete redistricting in some states and could mean less time for court challenges, candidate filing and ballot creation.The delay has sent states scrambling to adapt. Some face the decision to sidestep their constitutional deadlines or draw stopgap maps that might not fully reflect population shifts in the past decade.“States that have done the exact same thing for decades in a row now have to look for alternatives,” said Wendy Underhill, director of elections and redistricting at the National Conference of State Legislatures.In many states, redistricting is done by lawmakers subject to a gubernatorial veto. A growing number will use independent or bipartisan commissions, but Republicans will have ultimate control over redistricting in more than twice as many states as Democrats. Political control allows officials to draw districts that make it easier for their candidates to win future elections — something Republicans did more effectively than Democrats after the 2010 census.Although the census is typically used for redistricting, only about half the states have laws or constitutional provisions explicitly requiring them to use census data, according to the NCSL.In Oregon, the state constitution requires lawmakers to draw legislative districts “according to population” by July 1. If they fail to do so, then the secretary of state is to complete maps by Aug. 15.Democratic legislative leaders cited “constitutional turmoil” caused by late census data in asking the state Supreme Court to extend redistricting deadlines until three months after the figures are received. But Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, a Democrat, contends that could trigger a chain reaction that could delay the state’s May 2022 primaries.“The resulting cost, confusion, and instability to Oregon’s electoral process could be staggering,” Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum argued in a court filing on Fagan’s behalf.Fagan suggests the Legislature could use population estimates from Portland State University to draft maps by the constitutional deadline and revise them during a likely legal challenge as the 2020 census data becomes available. Officials at the university's Population Research Center told The Associated Press that their statewide estimates were off by just 0.2% — fewer than 8,000 people — during the 2010 census.The Oklahoma Constitution requires the Legislature to redraw its districts within 90 working days of starting its regular session. With the clock ticking, lawmakers have decided to use population estimates from 2015 to 2019 to redraw legislative maps. After the 2020 census data is released, the Legislature may reconvene in a special session if adjustments are needed.“There’s an awful lot you can do with the data that are already available to start on a rough sketch” for redistricting, said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who specializes in redistricting.But relying on anything other than 2020 census data for the final maps poses a “substantial legal risk,” Levitt said.Lawsuits over redistricting are a near certainty in many states as political parties angle to get preferential maps. A decade ago, courts twice delayed the Texas primaries because of legal challenges to the maps drawn by the Republican-led Legislature.Candidate filing for Texas’ March 1 primary is scheduled to run from mid-November to mid-December. But Republican Rep. Phil King is sponsoring legislation that would allow the governor, lieutenant governor and House speaker to agree to delay the primaries to as late as July 1.If census data isn't received until September, "it gets pretty tight,” King said. “This is just a safety net in case we have to back it up a little bit.”North Carolina’s top elections administrator wants lawmakers to postpone November municipal elections and March 2022 primaries. But Key Republican lawmakers say it's too soon to know whether that's necessary. Only about 60 of the hundreds of municipalities will need to redraw wards or districts.“There are elections that are affected by the census and there’s elections that aren’t,” said Republican Sen. Warren Daniel, co-chairman of the Senate Redistricting and Elections Committee. “Personally, I think we should distinguish between the two in terms of what our action is.”The California Supreme Court already has pushed back the deadline for the state’s redistricting commission to finalize new maps from Aug. 15 to Dec. 15.But that was on the assumption census data would be available by July 31. For every day the data is delayed beyond that, the court has automatically extended the deadline by an equal amount. That means it could bump up against California's mid-February deadline for candidates to submit petitions for the 2022 primaries.“Things are going to have to change,” said Paul Mitchell, a redistricting consultant based in Sacramento. “It would be impossible for them to collect signatures when they don’t know what the lines are."It’s not just potential candidates who are affected by the delayed census data. Election administrators need time to align new districts into voting precincts so each voter gets a ballot listing the correct candidates. And officials need to get that done early enough to mail ballots to military and overseas voters at least 45 days before an election.“All these things, they’re all asking for time, and it’s all just getting crazy compressed because of this late census data,” Mitchell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-census-data-delay-scrambles-plans-for-state-redistricting-101616940745741.html

It registered its highest number of new cases since the end of last year on Thursday, although deaths remain at a relatively low level."It will take a bit longer before everyone is fully vaccinated, but maybe five million people will be fully vaccinated by the end of the first half of the year, June 30," vaccine coordinator Richard Bergstrom told Swedish Television."It will take maybe a couple of weeks into July before everyone has had two shots," he said.Bergstrom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sweden, with a total population of 10 million, has so far vaccinated over a million people with one dose and 450,000 people with two doses.The country has more than 13,000 deaths from COVID-19. Sweden's death rate per capita is many times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than in several European countries that opted for lockdowns.A compilation of European excess mortality data on Wednesday showed Sweden had a lower increase in deaths than most European countries in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-says-will-not-meet-vaccine-target-due-to-delay-in-deliveries-101616939982782.html

Campos Mello, an award-winning reporter who works for the Brazilian daily newspaper Folha de S Paulo, hailed the court’s decision as a "victory for all of us women". “Judge asks Bolsonaro to compensate Folha reporter for moral damages - Judge found that the president is guilty of carrying out sexual offences against Patrícia Campos Mello - the first instance of such a decision. It is a victory for all of us women,” she tweeted in Portuguese.Justiça condena Bolsonaro a indenizar repórter da Folha por danos morais - Juíza considerou que presidente é culpado por realizar ofensas de cunho sexual contra Patrícia Campos Mello - decisão, em primeira instância, é vitória pra todas nós, mulheres https://t.co/8wYgYgW8FdThe Journalists against Harassment group said that the ruling was a “great day” for women reporters. “Great day for women journalists. Great day for professional journalism,” the group said in a tweet.Case against BolsonaroBolsonaro, the right-wing president who has been in office since 2019 and has a Trump-like disregard for journalists, said in February that Campos Mello had offered sex to a source in exchange for negative information about him. The Folha newspaper for which Campos Mello works said in its report that the president had said that Mello “wanted a scoop" at "any price against me". This was in response to a series of investigative reports that Campos Mello had written about a group that was using the social media platform WhatsApp for Bolsonaro’s 2018 presidential campaign. Campos Mello brought legal action against Bolsanaro for his comments. The judge said that Bolsonaro’s remarks damaged the journalist’s honour and asked the president to pay 20,000 reais ($3,500) in damages.Not the first win for Campos MelloThis is the second win for Campos Mello within three months as in January she had won an almost identical case against Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo, who is a member of the parliament in Brazil's lower house of Congress.She had filed a case against Eduardo, who had suggested in a YouTube video last May that the reporter had ‘tried to seduce’ a source for damaging information against his father.

28-03-2021||World||New York lawmakers agree to legalize recreational marijuana||New York is poised the join the growing number of states that have legalized marijuana after state lawmakers reached a late-night deal to allow sales of the drug for recreational use.Democrats who now wield a veto-proof majority in the state Legislature have made passing it a priority this year, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration has estimated legalization could eventually bring the state about $350 million annually.“My goal in carrying this legislation has always been to end the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana prohibition that has taken such a toll on communities of color across our state, and to use the economic windfall of legalization to help heal and repair those same communities,” Sen. Liz Krueger, Senate sponsor of the bill and chair of the Senate’s finance committee, said.At least 14 other states already allow residents to buy marijuana for recreational and not just medical use, but New York’s past efforts to pass marijuana legalization have failed in recent years.The legislation would allow recreational marijuana sales to adults over the age of 21, and set up a licensing process for the delivery of cannabis products to customers. Individual New Yorkers could grow up to three mature and three immature plants for personal consumption, and local governments could opt out of retail sales.The legislation would take effect immediately if passed, though sales wouldn’t start until New York sets up rules and a proposed cannabis board. Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes estimated Friday it could take 18 months to two years for sales to start.Adam Goers, a vice president of Columbia Care, a New York medical marijuana provider that’s interested in getting into the recreational market, said New York’s proposed system would “ensure newcomers have a crack at the marketplace” alongside the state’s existing medical marijuana providers.“There’s a big pie in which a lot of different folks are going to be able to be a part of it,” Goers said.New York would set a 9% sales tax on cannabis, plus an additional 4% tax split between the county and local government. It would also impose an additional tax based on the level of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, ranging from 0.5 cents per milligram for flower to 3 cents per milligram for edibles.New York would eliminate penalties for possession of less than three ounces of cannabis, and automatically expunge records of people with past convictions for marijuana-related offenses that would no longer be criminalized. That’s a step beyond a 2019 law that expunged many past convictions for marijuana possession and reduced the penalty for possessing small amounts.And New York would provide loans, grants and incubator programs to encourage participation in the cannabis industry by people from minority communities, as well as small farmers, women and disabled veterans.Proponents have said the move could create thousands of jobs and begin to address the racial injustice of a decades-long drug war that disproportionately targeted minority and poor communities.“Police, prosecutors, child services and ICE have used criminalization as a weapon against them, and the impact this bill will have on the lives of our oversurveiled clients cannot be overstated,” Alice Fontier, managing director of Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, said in a statement Saturday.New York's Legal Aid Society also hailed the agreement. “This landmark legislation brings justice to New York State by ending prohibition, expunging conviction records that have curtailed the opportunities of countless predominately young Black and Latinx New Yorkers, and delivers economic justice to ensure that communities who have suffered the brunt of aggressive and disparate marijuana enforcement are first in line to reap the economic gain,” the group said in a news release Sunday.Melissa Moore, the Drug Policy Alliance’s director for New York state, said the bill "really puts a nail in the coffin of the drug war that’s been so devastating to communities across New York, and puts in place comprehensive policies that are really grounded in community reinvestment.”Cuomo has pointed to growing acceptance of legalization in the Northeast, including in Massachusetts, Maine and most recently, New Jersey.Past efforts to legalize recreational use have been hurt by a lack of support from suburban Democrats, disagreements over how to distribute marijuana sales tax revenue and questions over how to address drivers suspected of driving high.It also has run into opposition from law enforcement, school and community advocates, who warn legalization would further strain a health care system already overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic and send mixed messages to young people.“We are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the serious crisis of youth vaping and the continuing opioid epidemic, this harmful legislation is counterintuitive,” said an open letter signed by the Medical Society of the State of NY, New York State Parent Teacher Association, New York Sheriff’s Association and several other organizations March 11.New York officials plan to launch an education and prevention campaign aimed at reducing the risk of cannabis among school-aged children, and schools could get grants for anti-vaping and drug prevention and awareness programs.And the state will also launch a study due by Dec. 31, 2022, that examines the extent that cannabis impairs driving, and whether it depends on factors like time and metabolism.“One of the things that no country in the world has and everybody wants is a way to quickly and easily figure out if someone’s high or impaired on cannabis,” University of Buffalo psychologist and professor of community health and health behavior R. Lorraine Collins said. “Research is being done to find systems that can do that. But I think those efforts will not come to fruition for awhile.”The bill also sets aside revenues to cover the costs of everything from regulating marijuana, to substance abuse prevention.State police could also get funding to hire and train more so-called “drug recognition experts.”But there’s no evidence that drug recognition experts can tell whether someone is high or not, according to Collins, who was appointed to Cuomo’s 2018 working group tasked with drafting cannabis regulations.“I think it’s very important that we approach that challenge using science and research and not wishes or unsubstantiated claims,” Collins said.Collins pointed to a 2020 report from the American Civil Liberties Union that found that Blacks are almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession compared to Whites, based on FBI statistics.“Every New Yorker should be concerned about how these laws will be implemented or how those ways of examining drivers will be implemented in different communities,” Collins said. “It’s not likely to be equal.”The bill allows cities, towns and villages to opt out of allowing adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries or on-site consumption licenses by passing a local law by Dec. 31, 2021 or nine months after the effective date of the legislation. They cannot opt out of legalization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-lawmakers-agree-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana-101616947074632.html

The program is critical to plans to reopen an economy that had its deepest contraction last year for more than three centuries.Dowden said the government is on track to offer first doses of a vaccine to all over 50s by the middle of April and to the rest of the adult population by the end of July. There is also no danger of people unable to get their second dose of the same jab within 12 weeks, he said.The culture secretary spoke as the government prepares to relax some lockdown restrictions on Monday. People will be able to meet outdoors in greater numbers and outdoor sports facilities such as tennis and basketball courts will be permitted to reopen. The aim is to remove remaining restrictions on social contact from June 21.Britain and the EU are in talks to resolve a standoff over vaccine sharing as the bloc attempts to get its own immunization program back on track. Last week, the two sides indicated progress in defusing the spat.“We continue to have constructive discussions with the EU,” Dowden said. “Our position is very clear. The EU should not be engaging in blocking exports” and contracts should be honored, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expects-to-receive-first-moderna-vaccines-in-coming-weeks-101616932514454.html

Some 3,043 patients were in a critical condition, while 595,929 recovered so far. The positivity rate was noted at 10.44 per cent.Earlier, Umar warned Saturday that tough restrictions would be rolled out if people failed to observe the SoPs and the cases continued to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-impose-fresh-restrictions-on-social-gatherings-to-control-surge-in-cases-101616944762947.html
28-03-2021||World||Thousands flee to Thailand after Myanmar Army's air strikes on villages: Report||Nearly 3,000 villagers from Myanmar's southeastern Karen state escaped to Thailand on Sunday after the army conducted air attacks on an area held by an ethnic group, Sky News reported citing the local media reports.This comes after Karen National Union (KNU), the ethnic group that controls the southeastern region, said three villagers lost their lives, while eight sustained injuries following an attack by fighter jets on Kawthoolei (Karen state)."Today the Burma Army continued its airstrikes in 5 areas in Lu Thaw Township, Mu Traw District. There is reason to believe that the soldiers responsible will launch this airstrike again in the villages along the Salween River, Mae Nu Hta, Kho Kay including Ei Htu Hta internally displaced person (IDP) camp," tweeted Karen Women Organisation, working in refugee camps on the Thai border.As Myanmar's military celebrated Armed Forces Day with a parade in the country's capital, Naypyitaw, soldiers and police suppressed protesters during what has resulted in the highest daily death toll since demonstrations began last month.United States Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and his counterparts from various countries on Saturday (local time) condemned the deadly use of force by Myanmar Armed Forces against unarmed protesters.Chief of Defense from various countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Denmark, Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the US condemned the bloodshed in Myanmar by the armed forces and associated security services.Responding to the deadly attacks, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement said, "The continuing military crackdown...is unacceptable and demands a firm, unified and resolute international response"."The military celebrated Armed Forces Day by committing mass murder against the people it should be defending", tweeted Tom Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.On February 1, following a general election in which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won by a landslide, the military seized control of the country and declared a year-long state of emergency.As Suu Kyi remains in detention at an unknown location, protesters have taken to the streets.In addition to imposing curfews and other restrictions, security forces have used water cannon, rubber bullets and live ammunition to try to disperse the demonstrators, according to news reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-flee-to-thailand-after-myanmar-army-s-air-strikes-on-villages-report-101616944362372.html
28-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Pace of daily deaths in US slows down, UK relaxes lockdown||As the global cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crossed the 127 million mark, the United States continues to remain the worst affected country by the viral infection, followed by Brazil, Mexico, India and the United Kingdom. The global death toll has reached 2,791,555 and the number of recoveries has reached 102, 697,755, according to data collated by Worldometer. The cases recorded in the US reached 30,917,339 and the death toll in the country mounted to 562,013, Worldometer data showed on Sunday. There are 23,348,512 Americans who have recovered from the viral disease till now.The United Kingdom which is the fifth worst-affected country by the coronavirus pandemic has 4,329,180 Covid-19 cases and 126,573 deaths, according to Worldometer. The recoveries in the country stand at 3,787,312.Here’s a look at the pandemic situation in both countries:USThe US added 758 deaths from Covid-19 on Saturday, which was the fewest since Monday, and new infections in the country also declined to the lowest in three days and stood at 63,000. The new infections were only a fraction of peaks of more than 300,000 daily cases that were reported in the country in late December and early January.Vaccinations in the country have picked up and about 75 per cent of the population is expected to be inoculated in the next four months, according to a report in Bloomberg. More than 140 million vaccines have been administered in the country so far according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data showed that of the total vaccines administered in the country, 15.1 per cent have been fully vaccinated and 27.6 per cent have received at least one dose of the vaccine.United KingdomThe UK reported 4,715 new Covid-19 cases and 58 related deaths, according to official figures released on Saturday. Nearly 30 million people in Britain have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to official figures. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said that the country is on the "roadmap to freedom" from the virus, but warned about the impact of Europe's third wave of infections on Britain.The country is also set to replace its strict lockdown with a message to “stay local”. From Monday, people will be allowed to meet in groups of six, outdoors and can resume outdoor sports such as basketball, tennis and golf. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also be taking similar steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pace-of-daily-deaths-in-us-slows-down-uk-relaxes-lockdown-101616943515943.html
28-03-2021||World||UK variant hunters lead global race to stay ahead of Covid||On March 4, 2020, when there were just 84 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the U.K., professor Sharon Peacock recognized that the country needed to expand its capacity to analyze the genetic makeup of the virus.The Cambridge University microbiologist understood that genomic sequencing would be crucial in tracking the disease, controlling outbreaks and developing vaccines. So she began working with colleagues around the country to put together a plan. Within a month, the government had provided 20 million pounds ($28 million) to fund their work.The initiative helped make Britain a world leader in rapidly analyzing the genetic material from large numbers of Covid-19 infections, generating more than 40% of the genomic sequences identified to date. These days, their top priority is finding new variants that are more dangerous or resistant to vaccines, information that is critical to helping researchers modify the vaccines or develop new ones to combat the ever-changing virus.“They've shown the world how you do this,” said Dr. Eric Topol, chair of innovative medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego, California.Genomic sequencing is essentially the process of mapping the unique genetic makeup of individual organisms — in this case the virus that causes Covid-19. While the technique is used by researchers to study everything from cancer to outbreaks of food poisoning and the flu virus, this is the first time authorities are using it to provide real-time surveillance of a global pandemic.Peacock, 62, heads Britain’s sequencing effort as executive director and chair of the Covid-19 UK Genomics Consortium, known as COG-UK, the group she helped create a year ago.During the first week of this month, COG-UK sequenced 13,171 viruses, up from 260 during its first 12 days of operation in March last year.Behind that growth is a system that links the science of genomic sequencing with the resources of Britain's national health care system.Positive Covid-19 tests from hospitals and community testing programs around the country are sent to a network of 17 laboratories, where scientists extract the genetic material from each swab and analyze it to identify that virus’ unique genetic code. The sequences are then cross-referenced with public health data to better understand how, where and why Covid-19 is spreading.When mutations in the virus correspond with an otherwise unexplained increase in cases, that’s a clue that a new variant of concern is circulating.The importance of genomic sequencing became obvious late last year as the number of new infections began to spike in southeastern England. When cases continued to rise despite tough local restrictions, public health officials went to work to find out why.Combing through data from genome sequencing, scientists identified a new variant that included a number of mutations that made it easier for the virus to hop from one person to another. Armed with this information, Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a national lockdown, scrapping a strategy of local restrictions that had failed to contain the new variant.The scientific sleuthing is crucial, but it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. Researchers must sift through the genetic sequences from thousands of harmless variants to find the rare dangerous ones, Peacock said.“It’s vital so that we can understand what variants are circulating, both in the United Kingdom and around the world, and therefore the implications of that on vaccine development and the way that we may have to adapt vaccines,” she said.The effort is a worldwide collaboration, with more than 120 countries submitting sequences to GISAID, a data-sharing hub originally created to track influenza viruses.Iceland, Australia, New Zealand and Denmark actually sequence a higher percentage of their Covid-19 cases than Britain, and Denmark does the work faster. But COG-UK’S work, combined with Britain’s size and high number of cases, have made it the world leader in sequencing Covid-19. The U.K. has submitted 379,294 of the almost 898,000 sequences in the GISAID database.That work is paying dividends even for advanced countries like Denmark, where scientists use tools developed in Britain to analyze their own data, said Mads Albertsen, a professor at Denmark’s Aalborg University who is part of the country’s genomic sequencing effort.“What the U.K. has just done by far best is the whole setup,” Albertsen said. “They have many more researchers and a much more professional structure around how to use the data.”The U.S. is also trying to learn from Britain as the Biden administration reverses the anti-science policies of his predecessor that slowed the country’s sequencing efforts, said Topol. Representatives from COG-UK took part in a recent call with American researchers and the Rockefeller Foundation aimed at building capacity in the United States.“To Peacock and the crew’s credit, they didn’t just stop at sequence,” Topol said. “They organized labs to do this other work, which is actually very intensive lab assessment. And then there’s the epidemiologic assessment, too. So everything has to fire on every cylinder, you know. It’s like a car with 12 cylinders. They all have to fire to move.”The U.K.'s sequencing success was built on the foundation of ground-breaking genetic science in Britain, stretching back to the work of James Watson, Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, who were credited with discovering the chemical structure of DNA. Other British scientists developed early sequencing techniques and later new technology that slashed the time and cost of sequencing.That success attracted investment, such as the Wellcome Trust’s 1992 decision to create the Sanger Centre to help map the human genome, further expanding the pool of expertise in Britain. And Britain’s National Health Service provided a wealth of data for researchers to study.Yet colleagues say Peacock personally deserves much of the credit for COG-UK's success, though she prefers to highlight the work of others.A ferociously good organizer, she glued the nation’s DNA detectives together through goodwill and chatrooms. Part of the trick was persuading eminent scientists to put aside their egos and academic rivalries to work together to help fight the pandemic, said Andrew Page, an expert in computer analysis of pathogen genomics who is working with COG-UK.Peacock's work on the project has earned her the moniker of variant-hunter-in-chief. But she prefers a simpler term.“I consider myself, first and foremost, a scientist that’s doing their best to try and help both the population in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to control the pandemic,’’ she said. “Perhaps there’s a better phrase for that, but scientist will do it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-variant-hunters-lead-global-race-to-stay-ahead-of-covid-101616943045465.html
28-03-2021||World||Suez Canal: Egypt president orders to prepare for ‘third scenario’ | All you need to know||After multiple failed attempts to refloat the giant container ship, Ever Given, stuck sideways in the Suez Canal, the head of the canal authority on Sunday said that the officials were preparing for the ‘third scenario’, according to The Washington Post. Osama Rabie, the chairperson of the Suez Canal Authority, reportedly told Egyptian television that President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi has ordered to prepare for the unloading of the Ever Given cargo carrier.While dredgers continue to vacuum up sand from underneath the vessel, two additional tugboats, the Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magna, have been called in to help the tugboats already there attempting to nudge the skyscraper-sized container ship. Leth Agencies, the canal's service provider, tweeted Sunday morning that the tidal conditions didn't help the overnight attempts of refloating Ever Given.Rabei had earlier expressed hope that dredging could free the ship without removing its cargo, however, added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.” Under the third scenario, some of the 18,000 containers will be unloaded from the 200,000-ton container ship which is disrupting a global shipping network. Rabie reportedly told the Egyptian channel that the unloading would require special equipment and the president authorised obtaining it as dredging continues.“His excellency has ordered that we should not wait for the failure of the first and second scenarios to start thinking about implementing the third one," Rabie was quoted by the Post as saying.Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, technical manager of Even Given which oversees the ship’s crew and maintenance, on Saturday announced that “significant progress” was made the previous night to free the vessel’s rudder from sediment. The company said in a statement that initial investigations rule out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.A top pilot with the canal authority told Associated Press that two attempts have been planned for Sunday to free the vessel. “Sunday is very critical. It will determine the next step, which highly likely involves at least the partial offloading of the vessel.” the pilot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-what-is-third-scenario-egypt-president-has-ordered-to-prepare-for-101616941871817.html

I took a thermometer... my temperature was normal," he told the state Rossiya 1 TV channel.He said he also had an uncomfortable feeling on the site of the injection.Putin did not reveal which of three Russian vaccines he had taken, saying only the doctor who inoculated him knows that.The Kremlin announced Putin's decision to get immunised against the coronavirus in December and the president said the delay was due to a need to combine it with other vaccines he planned to receive.Putin said that all three Russian vaccines, the most well-known and widely-available of which is Sputnik V, were almost equal.Nearly two-thirds of Russians are not willing to receive the Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Center, as of March 1, with most respondents citing side effects as the main reason.Russia started its vaccination campaign against the coronavirus in December. Last Monday Putin said that 4.3 million out of 144 million Russians had so far got two shots of a vaccine.Russia has registered over 4.5 million coronavirus infections to date.Putin said he expected Russia to reach herd immunity and lift pandemic-related restrictions by the end of summer.Herd immunity refers to a situation where enough people in a population have immunity to an infection to be able to effectively stop the disease from spreading.With the new coronavirus outbreak, some scientists hope that herd immunity would kick in when between 50% and 70% of a population is immune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-putin-felt-minor-side-effects-from-covid-19-vaccine-101616942183786.html
28-03-2021||World||Covid-19 fight stalls in early hot spots New York and New Jersey||A year after becoming a global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, New York and New Jersey are back atop the list of US states with the highest rates of infection.Even as the vaccination campaign has ramped up, the number of new infections in New Jersey has crept up by 37% in a little more than a month, to about 23,600 every seven days. About 50,000 people per week in New York are testing positive for the virus, a number that hasn’t much changed since mid-February.The two states now rank No. 1 and 2 in new infections per capita. New Jersey has been reporting about 647 new cases for every 100,000 residents over the past 14 days. New York has averaged 548.Neither state is experiencing anything like what they saw last spring, when hospitals — and morgues — were overflowing. And like the rest of the country, both are in a much better place than in January, at the peak of the pandemic's winter spike.But the lack of improvement or even backsliding in recent weeks has raised concerns that the states are opening too quickly and people are letting down their guard too much, just as potentially more contagious variants of the virus are circulating more widely.“When we’re seeing leveling off of cases or increase, that’s when it’s a time to rethink policies,” said Roy Gulick, chief of the infectious diseases division at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center.In February, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo allowed the state's largest stadiums to host sporting events and concerts again, albeit at only 10% of normal capacity. New York City movie theaters have been allowed to reopen. Restaurants can now operate at 50% capacity in New York City and 75% capacity elsewhere in the state. Indoor fitness classes have resumed, too.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has led a similar reopening, with the state's restaurants also allowed to operate at half capacity and barbers, salons and other personal care businesses resuming trade.That's happened in other parts of the country, too.Utah, Alabama, Arkansas and Indiana will end mask mandates in early April, joining states including Arizona, Texas, Mississippi, Montana and Iowa that have eliminated face covering requirements in recent weeks. Some states are allowing businesses to operate at full capacity.But in Illinois, the state public health director on Friday emphasized the need to keep wearing masks and socially distancing amid an increase in cases and hospitalizations. The single-day total of confirmed and probable cases of the illness topped 3,000 Friday for the first time in seven weeks, and hospitalizations have jumped 15% in the past five days.Murphy said in recent days that he is hitting pause on further loosening of the rules because of New Jersey's resurgence.The number of people hospitalized with the virus in New York has plateaued around 4,600 since mid-March. New Jersey hospitals are reporting about 2,200 virus patients — up by roughly 300 in the past couple of weeks.“They’re spreading more quickly and our vaccination rates are improving every week, but they are certainly not where we want them to be,” said Bruce Farber, chief of infectious diseases and public health and epidemiology for Northwell Health.Experts cite several potential factors, including the spread of potentially more contagious variants in the densely populated region.“Is there something different that’s happening in this part of the country compared to some other parts of the country?” asked Dr. Ed Lifshitz, the medical director of New Jersey’s communicable disease service within the state Health Department. “And the answer is probably yes.”New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has questioned whether Cuomo is easing restrictions “for political reasons," despite cause for concern. The governor is facing calls for his resignation over sexual harassment allegations.But then de Blasio himself announced that 80,000 more city employees would no longer work from home, starting in May.New York City's Public Advocate Jumaane Williams urged New York to pause reopening plans.“I ask the governor to stick to the science, trust the experts, and pause the planned reopenings now, before they take effect and more are infected,” Williams said.Experts worry the public is getting the message that increased vaccination means the state is in the clear, even though only a fraction of the public has completed a full course. Vaccines lessen the risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19, but scientists are still studying how well they prevent the spread of the virus.“To allow larger groups to gather, to give the message to the public that we’re over the worst and that we can go back to normal is a mistake,” Farber said.Stony Brook University professor and neuroepidemiologist Sean Clouston said growth in new cases is concentrated in younger people, who can't get vaccinated in New York unless they have specific health conditions or certain jobs. He said their infection rates could drop once they’re eligible, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-fight-stalls-in-early-hot-spots-new-york-and-new-jersey-101616942214564.html

Bild newspaper on Sunday reported that such an emergency meeting may decide on stricter limits to check the spread of the virus.Merkel last week made a rare public apology after she was forced to abandon a five-day hard lockdown over Easter just 33 hours after announcing it, throwing her government’s management of the pandemic further into disarray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rising-covid-19-cases-might-force-germany-into-a-harder-lockdown-101616940186279.html
28-03-2021||World||World Bank re-engages with Sudan following arrears clearance||The World Bank will shortly begin the process of allocating some $2 billion in grants to Sudan, a bank official said, representing the country's return to the international financial system after decades of isolation.Priority areas for the funds will be defined following meetings early next month, and allocations would take into account a peace deal signed last year, Ousmane Dione, World Bank country director for Sudan, said.The peace agreement, signed between the transitional government and several of the groups that fought ousted president Omar al-Bashir across the country, entails extensive development spending.In a statement on Friday, Sudan's cabinet had highlighted agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education as priority areas for investment."Making sure that those resources are being spent where they can contribute to reducing the gap between the centre and the periphery is extremely important," Dione told Reuters in an interview on Saturday.While Sudan's government is expected to "take the driver's seat" for those projects, they could include partnerships with the private sector where advantageous, he added.The World Bank's International Development Agency (IDA) committed on Friday to providing the $2 billion across the coming two years, purely in the form of grants.The new funding was made possible by the clearance of Sudan's arrears to the bank, which was facilitated by a $1.15 billion bridge loan from the United States, which the World Bank has repaid."What Sudan is currently liable for is to make sure the country doesn't fall back into arrears to IDA," said Dione, adding that the country carried no liability for the bridge loan. Some $215 million in direct budget support was allocated to Sudan to cushion the fiscal burden on government, he said.The government ruling following Bashir's ouster has made painful economic reforms including the reduction of energy subsidies and a currency devaluation, as the country implements an IMF-monitored programme amidst an economic crisis.Under Bashir, Sudan's ability to attract foreign lending and investment dried up, and it accumulated external debt estimated at $50 billion by the IMF.Sudan hopes to embark on a debt relief process in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-re-engages-with-sudan-following-arrears-clearance-101616936689722.html

28-03-2021||World||Before the Ever Given: A look at the crises that closed Suez||Since it opened in 1869, Egypt’s Suez Canal has been a source of national pride and a focus of international conflict. It is one of the world’s great maritime shortcuts, connecting the Red and Mediterranean Seas through a narrow passage that chops thousands of miles off most east-west shipping voyages.Now, a different sort of crisis has thrust the Suez Canal into the global spotlight. A skyscraper-sized container ship called the Ever Given got stuck sideways across the waterway last week. The obstruction has halted canal traffic — valued at over $9 billion a day — disrupting a global shipping network already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of ships waiting to cross the canal have piled up in a colossal traffic jam. With the vessel's bow still firmly lodged in the eastern bank, other shippers are opting to take the long route around the Cape of Good Hope.Nearly 19,000 vessels passed through the Suez Canal last year, carrying over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the world’s oil. While its shutdown this week is historic, the canal is no stranger to disruption. Here’s a look at some major incidents that have closed or threatened the bottleneck in the past.THE “SUEZ CRISIS”In 1956, Egypt’s then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal. The seizure, celebrated by Egyptians as a defiant break from European imperialism, prompted Britain, France and Israel to intervene militarily and occupy the canal zone.As fighting raged, sunken ships sealed off the canal for months. The United States and the Soviet Union, which openly opposed the invasion, ultimately forced the three countries to withdraw. Egypt was able to reopen the canal in March 1957, in what was seen across the region as a victory for pan-Arab nationalism.THE 1967 MIDEAST WARA decade later, at the outbreak of the 1967 Mideast war, Egypt closed the canal to international shipping as Israeli forces struck again at the canal zone and entrenched in the Sinai Peninsula. This time, the canal was shut for eight years. Accumulating mines, bombshells and sunken vessels, the waterway became a fortified trench in the war. It was only after peace talks with Israel that Nasser's successor, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, reopened the waterway in 1975.During the closure, over a dozen cargo ships were stranded midway through the canal in the Great Bitter Lake. The closed canal cost the world $1.7 billion in lost trade and increased shipping costs and Egypt $250 million in lost toll revenues annually, according to a U.N. study.The shutdown forced Europe-bound vessels to avoid Suez by rounding the southern tip of Africa, encouraging shippers to find economies of scale by developing increasingly large supertankers — a trend that, ironically, led ships to swell to the size of the stranded Ever Given.A TARGET FOR MILITANT ATTACKSThe canal divides mainland Egypt from the restive Sinai Peninsula, where the Egyptian military has been fighting a yearslong insurgency led by a local affiliate of the Islamic State group. The violence has threatened to spill over and disrupt global trade. In the summer of 2013, a Sinai-based militant group called the Furqan Brigades attacked two vessels in the waterway with rocket-propelled grenades, causing slight damage. Despite repeated vows to target the waterway, Egyptian militants so far have failed to impact maritime traffic there.OTHER SHIPS HAVE RUN AGROUNDGroundings of vessels previously have closed the narrow waterway, which can be difficult to navigate when there’s poor visibility. The first reported accident occurred in 1937, when high winds and rain squalls caused the U.K.-owned passenger liner Viceroy of India to ram into the bank and halt marine traffic for a day. Over the century, several other freighters have crashed or briefly shut down the waterway for up to three days, including a Greek-owned oil tanker in 1954, a Russian tanker in 2004 and a container ship that broke down in 2018 and triggered a multi-ship collision.In all cases, however, the groundings were swiftly resolved. Never before has a ship become wedged athwart the width of the canal, like the Ever Given.THE EVER GIVENThe giant 400-meter-long (quarter-mile-long) Ever Given, a Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship that hauls cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck last Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal. The ship's operators insist it crashed into the bank because of strong winds and a sandstorm, but the circumstances of the grounding remain unclear. Egyptian authorities suggested Saturday that human error may have been a factor.A squadron of tugs and diggers continued their struggle to free the Ever Given on Sunday. But without any significant progress, authorities may be forced to offload the vessel's containers — an operation that could take days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/before-the-ever-given-a-look-at-the-crises-that-closed-suez-101616937534667.html

The Vatican, a sovereign city-state surrounded by Rome, has applied similar measures.Nearly everyone who took part in the Mass, except the pope and the choir, wore masks.The Vatican re-created the traditional Palm Sunday service, albeit on a much smaller scale, with the 84-year-old pope and the cardinals processing to the altar holding palm fronds.Palm Sunday commemorates the day the gospels say Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was hailed by the people, only to be crucified five days later.During the Mass, the pope had a pronounced limp. He suffers from sciatica, which causes pain in his legs when it flares up.In his homily during the Mass, televised and streamed worldwide, Francis encouraged people to keep their faith from growing dull from habit and to let themselves be amazed by God and by good."With the grace of amazement we come to realise that in welcoming the dismissed and discarded, in drawing close to those ill-treated by life, we are loving Jesus.

There’s always a day or two like this (of pollution or dust) each month," said Mr. Fan, 39, who did not wish to disclose his full name.Beijing's official air quality index reached a maximum level of 500 on Sunday morning, with floating particles known as PM10 surpassing 2,000 micrograms per cubic metre in some districts.Readings of smaller PM2.5 particles were above 300 micrograms per cubic metre, far higher than China's standard of 35 micrograms.PM2.5 particles are especially harmful because they are very tiny and can enter the bloodstream, while PM10 is a larger particle that can enter the lungs.The China Meteorological Administration issued a yellow alert on Friday, warning that a sandstorm was spreading from Mongolia into northern Chinese provinces including Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Liaoning and Hebei, which surrounds Beijing.The meteorological office said the recent sandstorms to hit Beijing originated from Mongolia, where relatively warmer temperature this spring and reduced rain resulted in larger areas of bare earth, creating favorable conditions for sandstorms.Beijing might face more sandstorms in April due to the unfavorable weather this year, the meteorological office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-enveloped-in-hazardous-sandstorm-second-time-in-two-weeks-101616934333360.html

With the accord, the UAE will become the first Gulf state to set up a coronavirus vaccine production facility, boosting its efforts to become a supply hub to the Middle East and beyond.The company, also known as Julphar, said it signed the agreement with Abu Dhabi’s G42 Medications Trading. G42, which describes itself as an artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm, had helped roll out trials of the Sinopharm vaccine in the country.The state-backed Sinopharm vaccine was approved in the UAE last year after local late-stage trials showed it was 86% effective in preventing infections -- the country has since overseen one of the world’s fastest inoculation drives, with most people having received the Chinese vaccine.The Sinopharm vaccine can be transported and stored at normal refrigerated temperatures, making it a candidate for vaccination programs in the developing world. The company’s annual production capacity for Covid vaccines is set to reach 3 billion doses, its chairman Yu Qingming said this month, without giving a time frame.While the UAE has approved vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc as well as Russia’s Sputnik V, its inoculation program hinged on Sinopharm given early availability and the potential to produce the shots locally -- key to the UAE’s aspirations of becoming a supply hub.In November, Abu Dhabi launched the Hope Consortium, a logistics grouping with the capacity to distribute more than six billion vaccine doses. The consortium includes the emirate’s Department of Health, Etihad Cargo, Abu Dhabi Ports Group, Rafed and SkyCell.In neighboring Dubai, companies including Emirates airline, ports operator DP World and Dubai Airports have also formed an alliance to move two billion doses of vaccines around the world this year, focusing on emerging markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-picks-uae-as-regional-production-hub-for-sinopharm-vaccine-shot-101616933643147.html

The center-left Social Democrats placed third, with 17%, according to the poll of 1,447 voters with a margin of error of up to 3 percentage points.“The situation is very serious,” Markus Soeder, the governor of Bavaria and a possible contender to succeed Merkel in September, told Bild am Sonntag. “The corona numbers are rising and the Union’s ratings are falling.”The grouping of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and Soeder’s Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, which won almost 33% of the vote in 2017, has been hit by a scandal over lawmakers’ allegedly profiting from mask procurement deals and frustration over Germany’s sluggish coronavirus vaccination campaign.By Friday, just over 10% of the population had received at least one shot of Covid-19 vaccine, while 4.5 % had received both doses.Meanwhile, Germany’s disease control agency reported 17,176 newly confirmed cases and 90 deaths over the past day.“A mood for change is arising in the country,” Soeder was quoted as saying. “The Union needs to show that it’s still got strength and ideas, and isn’t exhausted and worn out.”Soeder is trying to position himself ahead of Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, in the race to lead the Union bloc into the Sept. 26 election.Merkel has said she won't run for a fifth term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chancellor-merkel-s-bloc-dips-in-polls-6-months-before-german-vote-101616932647824.html

The country has inoculated 65,000 medical personnel, people age 80 and over, and schoolteachers so far.Albania, which has a population of 2.8 million, has signed contracts for a total of about 2.5 million vaccine doses from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac. The government is continuing to work on securing new vaccine contracts so the entire population can be fully vaccinated by early 2022.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Edi Rama went to Turkey and brought back the 192,000 Sinovac doses. The remainder of the 500,000 Sinovac doses Albania is due to receive will come in two months.Rama also said Sinovac would build a factory in Albania to produce different vaccines.Albania aims to give at least 10,000 shots a day and to complete 500,000 jabs by June, Health Minister Ogerta Manastirliu said.“This process will not stop and our ambitious plan of vaccination aims that in 14 months we complete it (for the entire population) and achieve immunization,” the minister said.The government aims to make the country ready to welcome tourists this summer. In the years before the virus outbreak, tourism became a significant industry in the country’s economy.“I believe that this tourist season will be more relaxed as a result of the attacks against the chain of infections,” Rama told journalists after touring the vaccination center at the square.Foreign tourists coming to Albania won't be required to show proof that they've been inoculated with a coronavirus vaccine.Albania has registered more than 123,000 coronavirus cases and 2,204 confirmed deaths as of Saturday, according to health authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/albania-starts-mass-covid-vaccinations-before-tourist-season-101616932083500.html

When to watch in India||The moon will be at its fullest and brightest on Sunday night in the eastern sky, appearing opposite the Sun in Earth-based longitude. The moon will appear full for about three days, from Saturday morning through Monday night into early Tuesday morning. According to Nasa’s solar system exploration website, this full moon is also called the Worm Moon, the Paschal Moon, the Holi Festival Moon, the Shab-e-Barat Moon, and, by some definitions, a Supermoon.Why is it called Worm Moon?For centuries, people around the world have been naming the full moon after nature’s cues, and the Old Farmer's Almanac, which began publishing Moon names for each month of the year, has named it the Worm Moon. The earthworms start to appear at the beginning of spring due to summer heat underground, allowing birds to feast. As India celebrates Holi during this period, in the Hindu month of Phalguna and the start of spring, the full moon corresponds with this festival.Astrologer Richard Nolle coined the term ‘Supermoon’, which refers to either a new or full moon that occurs when it is within 90% of perigee, its closest approach to Earth. A supermoon can appear as much as 14% larger and 30% brighter than normal, depending on the time of year.Dr Daniel Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, told Daily Mail that supermoons encourage people to go out thinking the moon will be much larger than normal. He said that in reality, “supermoons are never huge at all so don't get fooled in thinking that you can see it being larger than usual”.Worm Moon time in India and the USIn India, the moonrise is expected to occur at around 6.36pm IST on Sunday, March 28, and the Earth’s natural satellite is expected to set at 7.02am on Monday morning, according to Time and Date. It will be at its fullest at 12.18am IST on Monday. In the US, the full Moon will be on Sunday afternoon at 2.48pm EDT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/super-worm-moon-to-glow-in-the-sky-on-sunday-when-to-watch-in-india-101616930705789.html
28-03-2021||World||Did Covid-19 stress, uncertainty stall anti-smoking push?||A year after Covid-19 upended life for millions of Americans, there are troubling signs that the coronavirus may have also slowed progress against another deadly health threat: smoking.Fewer smokers called quit-smoking hotlines last year and some smoked more, contributing to an unusual bump in cigarette sales — all in the middle of the stress, anxiety and uncertainty from the pandemic.“It’s hard for folks to quit using tobacco in the best of times, so what happens when life is suddenly turned upside down?” said Jen Cash, who oversees Minnesota’s anti-tobacco programs.Researchers are already concerned about Covid-19's impact on cancer screenings and opioid overdoses as many Americans were cut off from routine care and examinations. But services to help smokers quit -- delivered via phone and online -- would seem well-positioned to withstand the disruptions of the pandemic. The programs help with devising a plan and often provide free nicotine gums and patches.Yet, calls to states routed through a national hotline fell 27% last year to about 500,000 — the biggest drop in a decade, according to the North American Quitline Consortium. In a recent report, the coalition of anti-smoking counselors cited the pandemic and the drop in public awareness messaging."It's really disturbing to see that the quit line calls have gone down so much because they’re exactly what I hoped would be going up,” said Dr. Nancy Rigotti of Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the report.In a separate survey of 1,000 adult smokers, Rigotti and her colleagues found about a third reported smoking more during the first six months of the pandemic.Alli Comstock of Los Angeles had been smoke-free for seven years when she lost her child care job last March because of the pandemic. Facing her first long-term stretch of unemployment, she started smoking again, out of a combination of boredom and anxiety.“It just felt like something else to do and it made me feel calmer,” said Comstock, 32, adding that she knows cigarettes, which contain the stimulant nicotine, don't help relieve anxiety.Comstock eventually quit again after months of feeling like “we were in a time when it didn't matter.”“In November, I realized it did matter and that I was a smoker, and I didn't want to be that,” she said.Research has linked other traumatic events to relapses among ex-smokers, including after the 9/11 attacks.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it’s too early to gauge the pandemic’s impact on smoking rates. In a statement, the CDC noted that although cigarette sales spiked around the first lockdowns last March, they have since fallen back to earlier levels. That suggests the rise was mainly smokers stocking up on cigarettes.The US smoking rate has held steady at around 14% in recent years after a decades-long decline from over 40% in the 1960s. Smoking, which can cause cancer, strokes and heart attacks, is blamed for about 480,000 annual deaths.Because smoking overlaps with many other forms of addiction, the data on quit attempts is being closely watched by doctors who treat people who abuse drugs and alcohol, many of whom also suffer from depression and anxiety.Dr. Brian Hurley of Los Angeles County's health department says those with addictions are less likely to recover if they continue to smoke. Last year’s drop in hotline calls suggests “a maelstrom of worse outcomes" said Hurley, a board member of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.Quitting, though, is notoriously difficult with just 7% succeeding, according to CDC figures. Many smokers are referred to quit-smoking hotlines at their annual checkup. Those appointments largely stopped last spring along with most other non-essential care.Still, last year’s data on quit-smoking calls includes glints of positive news. Smokers who called Minnesota’s hotline reported smoking more, but also said they were more motivated to quit because of Covid-19. That mirrored national data showing smokers are aware that smoking can make them more vulnerable to serious illness from a coronavirus infection.Experts seeking to explain last year's trends also point to a drop in anti-smoking advertising campaigns from public health departments. In many cases, those promotions were replaced by messages about masking, social distancing and hand-washing.The CDC recently resumed its national “Tips from Smokers” advertising campaign and is conducting its annual surveys of tobacco use among adults and teenagers, the definitive snapshot of US smoking and vaping.Prior to the virus outbreak, much of the focus was on the alarming rise in electronic cigarette use among high schoolers and middle schoolers. Survey data conducted before classrooms closed showed teen vaping was already falling compared to 2019, following new flavor bans and raising the legal age to buy them.With teenagers unable to attend school or regularly socialize with their friends, researchers speculate the pandemic may have further slowed the social spread of vaping.“I have a feeling it may have had a positive effect on teen vaping, but a negative effect for adult smoking,” said Rigotti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-covid-19-stress-uncertainty-stall-anti-smoking-push-101616931475622.html

He was arrested as he returned to Russia from Germany in January, where he had been recovering from what doctors said was a nerve agent poisoning.The 44-year old opposition politician has said in a statement that his request for treatment by a civilian doctor had been rejected and that he was being woken up by a guard every hour during the night in a deliberate attempt to undermine his health.Members of a local Public Monitoring Commission, a semi-official body with access to Russian prisons, visited Navalny in his penal colony 100 km (60 miles) east of Moscow on Friday."From a conversation (with Navalny) we learned that he feels pain in his leg and he asked for help in getting injections of Diclofenac to reduce pain. He is still able to walk," said Vyacheslav Kulikov, the head of the commission, in an online statement.A spokeswoman for a regional department of Russia's prison authority declined any immediate comment.Diclofenac is a medicine that reduces inflammation and pain and is used to treat problems with joints, muscles and bones, information on Britain's National Health Service website said.Navalny has said that his only treatment was two Ibuprofen pills per day and his diagnosis was unclear.The commission did not say if Navalny received the painkiller injections he asked for."We... made sure that his request had been recorded officially," Kulikov said.Navalny's lawyer Vadim Kobzev, who visited the politician the day before the public monitors, said he was not aware of his request for the painkiller injection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-navalny-currently-in-jail-asks-for-painkiller-injections-101616930850357.html

"People, including us, run away as they opened fire."Two people were killed in firing on protests on Sunday in separate incidents elsewhere, witnesses and news reports said. One person was killed when troops opened fire overnight on a group of protesters near the capital Naypyitaw, Myanmar Now news reported.Also Read: Myanmar forces kill 114 people on deadliest daySo far on Sunday there were no reports of large-scale protests in Yangon or in the country's second city, Mandalay, which bore the brunt of the casualties on Saturday, Myanmar's Armed Forces Day. Funerals were held in many places.At least six children between the ages of 10 and 16 were among those killed on Saturday, according to news reports and witnesses.The bloodshed drew renewed Western condemnation. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Myanmar said the army was carrying out "mass murder" and called on the world to isolate the junta and halt its access to weapons.Foreign criticism and sanctions imposed by some Western nations have failed so far to sway the military leaders, as have almost daily protests around the country since the junta took power and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi."We salute our heroes who sacrificed lives during this revolution and We Must Win This REVOLUTION," one of the main protest groups, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities (GSCN), posted on Facebook.Saturday also brought some of the heaviest fighting since the coup between the army and the ethnic armed groups that control swathes of the country.Military jets had killed at least three people in a raid on a village controlled by an armed group from the Karen minority, a civil society group said on Sunday, after the Karen National Union faction earlier said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people. The air strikes sent villagers fleeing into the jungle.Fighting erupted on Sunday between another armed group, the Kachin Independence Army, and the military in the jade-mining area of Hpakant in the north. The Kachin forces attacked a police station and the military responded with an aerial assault, Kachinwaves media reported.There were no reports of casualties.A junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment on the killings or the fighting.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta leader, said during a parade to mark Armed Forces Day that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.'RINGING HOLLOW'Saturday's dead included 40 people in Mandalay and at least 27 in Yangon, Myanmar Now said. The casualties took the overall number of civilians reported killed since the coup to more than 440.Countries including the United States, Britain and the European Union strongly condemned the violence.Also Read: Myanmar army launches air strikes in Karen state, group saysU.N. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said it was time for the world to take action - if not through the UN Security Council then through an international emergency summit. He said the junta should be cut off from funding, such as oil and gas revenues, and from access to weapons."Words of condemnation or concern are frankly ringing hollow to the people of Myanmar while the military junta commits mass murder against them," he said in a statement.U.N. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu and U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet called the killings "shameful, cowardly, brutal actions of the military and police, who have been filmed shooting at protesters as they flee, and who have not even spared young children".The top military officer from the United States and nearly a dozen of his counterparts said in a statement that a professional military must follow international standards for conduct "and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves".The military took power saying that November elections won by Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the country's election commission. Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also in custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/troops-fire-at-funeral-of-144-killed-in-myanmar-on-bloodiest-day-since-coup-101616929358971.html

The villagers from that area said two dead and two injured," a spokesperson for civil society group Karen Peace Support Network said, adding that communication was difficult in the remote region and there could be more casualties.A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls seeking comment.The reported air assault is the most significant attack for years in the region. The KNU had signed a ceasefire agreement in 2015 but tensions surged after the military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government on Feb.1.Earlier on Saturday, the KNU said Brigade 5 forces overran an army base, killing 10 soldiers including a lieutenant-colonel, as the junta celebrated its annual Armed Forces Day with a parade in the capital, Naypyitaw.The KNU says it has been sheltering hundreds of people who have fled central Myanmar amid mounting violence in recent weeks.

There are 352 cargo vessels -- either moving or stationary -- within the waiting areas of Port Said Anchorage, Great Bitter Lake and South Suez Anchorage, the firm said.Syrian oil supplies delayed Syria’s oil ministry said the stranded ship has delayed the arrival of a tanker carrying fuel to the country. The government is rationing supplies as a result. “Waiting for the return of normal movement of navigation via the Suez Canal may take an unknown time,” it said.HMM to divert 3 ships around Africa HMM Co. will divert three container ships around Cape of Good Hope this week because of the Suez Canal blockage, a spokesman at South Korea’s biggest shipping company said Sunday.Two of the vessels, which can each carry 24,000 20-foot containers, are headed to Europe and the third to Asia.Ship Moved Slightly; Refloating Ops Halted Tugs working to refloat the Ever Given managed to shift the stricken container ship 29 meters (32 yards) on Saturday, and dredgers succeeded earlier in freeing the propellers from the sediment that’s glued the vessel to the bank of the Suez Canal since Tuesday.Dredging work will continue until 4 p.m. local time Sunday, at which point the refloating operations will resume, Inchcape Shipping Services said. Another two tugs are set to arrive, adding to the 11 currently on site, according to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, technical manager for the vessel.The Ever Given’s charterer said it could take at least a couple of days of dredging before enough mud and sand is cleared to attempt a refloat on a high tide. Meanwhile, the rescue team said it would start lifting containers off the vessel to lighten its load.Ship’s Propeller Is Free, More Tugs on WayEleven tugs worked throughout Saturday alongside the dredging operations which removed sand and mud from around the port side of the bow, according to a statement from Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the vessel’s technical manager. Another two tugs are set to arrive Sunday.The vessel’s rudder has been released from the sediment.Initial investigations have ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding, according to the statement.CMA CGM Diverts Two Vessels French shipping company CMA CGM Group has diverted two vessels, the Leo and the Attila, around the Cape of Good Hope, according to the firm’s web site.The Leo is en route from Charleston, South Carolina, to Port Klang, Malaysia. The Attila is plying a route from Kingston, Jamaica, to Singapore, according to shipping data.The company has 10 ships stuck in or near the canal, plus another nine partner vessels.Pumping Water Into Sand Could Work The Ever Given could be freed by pumping water into the sand beneath the vessel, the emeritus professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh told The Scotsman newspaper.“I would give it a 50/50 chance of working,” Professor Stephen Salter said.Ever Given Moves Slightly, Egypt Today Reports The ship has moved 30 meters northward, according to a tweet by Egypt Today Magazine, adding that this suggests the reflotation process will work.Line of Ships Grows Longer The number of ships waiting to enter the Suez Canal is lengthening as the waterway remains blocked. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows there are 429 vessels queued up Saturday, compared with around 100 at the start of the blockage.Bulk carriers typically hauling commodities such as grains, coal and iron ore account for the biggest share of the vessels stuck in and around the canal. The data also indicate as many as 14 vessels that could be carrying thousands of livestock.Canal Chief Sounds Optimistic Note The latest efforts to free the vessel have begun to pay off, and new attempts to refloat it could begin Saturday or Sunday, Suez Canal Authority chief Osama Rabie told reporters.Declining to lay out a timeline for when the operation could be completed, Rabie said 10 tug boats are on site. There are currently more than 320 ships waiting to move, and authorities are working to provide them with all necessary services.The canal is taking a revenue hit of as much as $14 million a day from the blockage, Rabie said.Excavation Could Take Days Excavation will take at least two to three days of digging to reach the required depth for the stranded ship to refloat, charterer Evergreen Line said in a statement dated March 26.Maersk Diverts 14 Container Ships South of Africa Logistics company AP Moller-Maersk A/S has diverted 14 vessel around the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, to avoid the Suez canal. The number of rerouted ships is up from 12 yesterday and the company said it expects the number to increase.“For every day the canal remains blocked, the ripple effects on global capacity and equipment continues to increase,” Maersk said in a statement.Dredging Set to ResumeTugs are connecting up to resume reflotation operations, according to Inchcape Shipping Service. Dredgers are currently working and there are some divers around the Ever Given vessel.Egyptian Prime Minister Comments In the first public comment from an Egyptian government official on the incident, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the country was racing against time to restore movement to the facility vital to the entire world and was keen to complete the work as soon as possible.Livestock Vessels Stranded Several vessels laden with livestock and containers en route to Jordan are stranded near the Suez Canal, Captain George Dahdal, Representative of Jordan Navigation Syndicate, said by phone. Seven vessels loaded with 92,000 livestock that were supposed to arrive to Aqaba on March 21 are stranded. Other vessels loaded with containers including food and other commodities are still stuck due to the traffic jam, Dahdal said.Qatar Airways Gets Air Freight Queries Qatar Airways, one of the world’s largest cargo airlines, said shippers stuck in the canal were sending queries as a precautionary measure. The airline expects “to see firmer interest in the coming days if the situation remains the same,” a spokesperson for the company said in response to questions from Bloomberg.Timing Couldn’t be Worse, Moody’s SaysThe canal’s temporary closure might affect 10%-15% of world container throughput, Moody’s Investors Service estimated earlier this week. Under normal circumstances, the temporary delays in global supply chains would not be a “big issue,” it said. However, a global shortage in container capacity and low service reliability has made supply chains highly vulnerable to external shocks despite high consumer demand, its analysts said.“The timing of this event could not have been worse,” analysts including Daniel Harlid wrote in a March 25 report.Insurers May Be on Hook for Millions There were potentially thousands of insurance policies taken out on the steel boxes stacked high on Ever Given. They could result in millions of dollars in payouts.The blockage is set to unleash a flood of claims by everyone affected, from those in the shipping industry to those in the commodities business.

28-03-2021||World||UK eases lockdown but nervously eyes European virus surge||Britain is taking another small step out of lockdown as it looks nervously at a new virus surge inundating its European neighbors.With U.K. coronavirus vaccination rates outstripping those of European Union nations, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is easing the stark “stay at home” message that has curtailed everyday life — and kept the virus in check — for almost three months.From Monday, it will be replaced in England with a message to stay local. People will be allowed to meet in groups of six outdoors and can resume outdoor sports such as basketball, tennis and golf.The other parts of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are taking broadly similar steps. In Wales, thousands of people poured onto beaches and beauty spots on Saturday, after the authorities lifted travel restrictions that have been in place since December.Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service in England, urged people to continue to follow the rules and limit contact with others, saying the easing “does not mean job done.”“We’ve made enormous progress that we need to build on and not squander the gains we’ve made,” he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.The stringent restrictions in business and social life imposed during three lockdowns in the past year have had broad public support, though they have alarmed some lawmakers in Johnson’s Conservative Party, who argue that the economic, democratic and human costs outweigh the benefits.Most nonessential businesses remain closed, along with pubs, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theaters, museums and sports stadiums. Millions of workers have been furloughed, with the government paying the bulk of their wages.The U.K. has recorded more than 126,000 Covid-19 deaths, the highest toll in Europe.While many European nations are seeing a new surge in the pandemic, Britain is counting on a rapid mass-vaccination program to help it end lockdown. Nearly 30 million people, accounting for 56% of all adults, have received a first dose of vaccine so far.Under the government’s “road map” to lifting lockdown, shops, hairdressers and outdoor dining in England are to reopen on April 12, followed by indoor venues on May 17. Remaining restrictions are to end June 21, if the country isn't facing a new virus surge.Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, said it was vital that people who had received a vaccine shot remained cautious.“It’s really important that people who are vaccinated can remember that they aren’t completely protected,” he told the BBC.“They’re protected against severe disease, hospitalization and death, but they might not be protected against infection after one dose, it takes three or four weeks for the vaccine effects to kick in, and they could potentially still transmit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eases-lockdown-but-nervously-eyes-european-virus-surge-101616929586124.html
28-03-2021||World||In Photos: How the world observed Earth Hour this year||Earth Hour, observed every year by millions of people across the planet on the last Saturday in March, was celebrated on March 27 this year. The annual tradition of turning off lights for one hour between 8.30pm to 9.30 pm was followed once again to spread awareness about sustainability and climate change. The tradition was started by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in 2007 when the international non-governmental organisation encouraged 2.2 million people to turn off their lights for an hour. This year the organisation invited people from across the world to share the must-watch videos on social media in order to raise awareness. "This year, we invite you to spread the same message and re-create the same unmissable sight online by taking part in our first-ever Earth Hour Virtual Spotlight," WWF said in a statement.Earth Hour has become a worldwide event and global landmarks have also switched off electric lights for an hour.

That was just weeks after the Covid-19 outbreak erupted in Italy, which was the first country in the West to be hit by the pandemic.Only about 120 faithful, including nuns and a few families, attended and were socially-distanced. They wore protective masks as did participants in the procession of 30 red-robed cardinals, but Francis was maskless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-crowds-at-holy-week-ceremonies-due-to-covid-19-crisis-101616927913052.html
28-03-2021||World||Bangladesh violence spreads after PM Modi visit, attacks on Hindu temples, train||Hundreds of members of a hardline Islamist group attacked Hindu temples and a train in eastern Bangladesh on Sunday, police and a local journalist said, as violence spread across the country in the wake of a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.At least 10 protesters were killed in clashes with police during demonstrations organised by Islamist groups against the Indian leader's visit, and violence raged on after his departure as anger swelled over the deaths.Modi arrived in Dhaka on Friday to mark the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's nationhood, and he left on Saturday after gifting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina some 1.2 million Covid-19 vaccine shots.The Islamist groups accuse Modi of discriminating against minority Muslims in Hindu-majority India and violence escalated rapidly during his visit.On Friday, dozens of people were injured in the densely-populated capital Dhaka as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. Thousands of Islamist activists marched down the streets of Chittagong and Dhaka on Saturday in protest.On Sunday, activists with the Hefazat-e-Islam group attacked a train in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria, resulting in ten people being injured."They attacked the train and damaged its engine room and almost all the coaches," one police official told Reuters, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.“Brahmanbaria is burning. Various government offices were set on fire indiscriminately. Even the press club was attacked and many injured, including the press club president. We are in extreme fear and feeling really helpless,” Javed Rahim, a journalist in the Brahmanbaria town, told Reuters by phone.Several Hindu temples in the town were also attacked, he said.Islamist activists allegedly also set alight two buses in the western district of Rajshahi on Sunday, while hundreds of protesters clashed with police in Narayanganj, pelting them with stones, police said.Protesters used timber and sand bags to block roads, as police retaliated with rubber bullets and tear gas, leaving dozens injured in Narayanganj, just outside the capital, Dhaka.The protests sparked by Modi's visit have since flared into wider demonstrations against police killings, and the Hefazat-e-Islam enforced a nationwide strike on Sunday."Police opened fire on our peaceful supporters," Hefazat-e-Islam’s organising secretary Azizul Haque told a rally in Chittagong on Saturday. "We will not let the blood of our brothers go in vain."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-spreads-after-pm-modi-visit-attacks-on-hindu-temples-train-101616924882038.html
28-03-2021||World||Indonesia president condemns 'act of terrorism' after church attack wounds 14||Two suspected suicide bombers attacked a Catholic church in the Indonesian city of Makassar on Sunday, wounding fourteen people on the first day of the Easter Holy Week, officials said.The congregation was concluding their mass inside the church on the island of Sulawesi when the attackers detonated at least one device outside, police said. The two suspects were the only fatalities."I strongly condemn this act of terrorism and I have ordered the police chief to thoroughly investigate the perpetrators' networks and tear down the networks to their roots," President Joko Widodo said in an online broadcast following the attack.Authorities were looking into which radical networks the bombers came from and whether the attack was linked to recent arrests of suspected militants, national police spokesman Argo Yuwono said.In January, a counter-terrorism unit raided a militant hideout in Makassar and killed two men suspected by police of involvement in twin bombings at a Philippine church in 2019 that killed more than 20 people.Jokowi, as the president is widely known, urged people to remain calm and said everybody could worship "without fear".Father Wilhemus Tulak, a priest at the church, told Indonesian media that a suspected bomber tried to enter the church grounds on a motorbike, but had been stopped by a security guard.Security camera footage showed a blast that blew flame, smoke and debris into the middle of the road.Ansyaad Mbai, former chief of the National Counterterrorism Agency, said the perpetrators were likely part of the same group responsible for a bombing in Jolo, the Philippines, in 2020."They want to show that they still exist and use this to propagate their group and recruit new members," he said.Police blamed the Islamic State-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah group for suicide attacks in 2018 on churches and a police post in the city of Surabaya that killed over 30 people.Makassar, Sulawesi's biggest city, reflects the religious makeup of Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country with a substantial Christian minority and followers of other religions."Whatever the motive is, this act isn't justified by any religion because it harms not just one person but others, too," Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, Indonesia's religious affairs minister, said in a statement.Gomar Gultom, head of the Indonesian Council of Churches, described the attack as a "cruel incident" as Christians were celebrating Palm Sunday, and urged people to remain calm and trust the authorities.Indonesia's deadliest Islamist militant attack took place on the tourist island of Bali in 2002, when bombers killed 202 people, most of them foreign tourists.In subsequent years, security forces in Indonesia scored some major successes in tackling militancy, but more recently there has been a resurgence of militant violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-president-condemns-church-attack-as-terrorism-101616922520142.html
28-03-2021||World||Chinese digital art mocks Western criticism of labour conditions in Xinjiang||A digital illustration by a prominent Chinese propaganda artist mocking Western governments, media and businesses critical of labour conditions in Xinjiang has gone viral on China's social media.The digital art by the artist who goes by the name Wuheqilin, referring to a one-horned Chinese mythical beast, shows two figures with white pointed hoods interviewing a scarecrow in a field of cotton and Black slaves.One of the journalists holds up a microphone with a logo that looks similar to "BBC News".At the bottom of the illustration reads: "Can you tell us what unfair treatment you have suffered, Miss Scarecrow?""I've been sexually assaulted and abused," a placard next to the scarecrow says.Steadying the cross on which the scarecrow is held is a hooded figure wearing a Minneapolis police uniform, an apparent reference to the police officer who pressed his knee on the neck of a dying George Floyd last year.Western governments and rights groups have accused authorities in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, drawing fierce denials from Beijing, who says the camps are vocational training centres that help combat religious extremism.Earlier this year, BBC reported that women in the camps had been subject to rape, sexual abuse and torture.The Chinese foreign ministry said at the time that the BBC report was "without factual basis" and the people interviewed by the BBC have been "proved multiple times" to be "actors disseminating false information".Last week, Swedish clothing retailer H&M faced a public backlash in China when social media users circulated a statement the company made last year announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.Chinese celebrity endorsers have since dropped several foreign retail labels including Nike.The assault on Western brands followed coordinated sanctions by the United States, the European Union, Canada and Britain on Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which Washington has said have amounted to genocide.In Wuheqilin's illustration, which has garnered 1 million "likes", the blood-red letters "HM" can be seen carved onto the trunk of a tree, while in the background is a black antique cotton scale that looks similar to Nike's swoosh logo.Entitled "Blood Cotton Initiative", the illustration also refers to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), an international group that promotes sustainable cotton production which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, citing human rights concerns.Nike, H&M and a number of Western brands are BCI members.Wuheqilin, who has 2 million followers on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo, in December published a digitally manipulated image of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child, drawing the fury of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.Wuheqilin declined to comment when reached by Reuters.Nike, H&M and BCI did not immediately comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-digital-art-mocks-western-criticism-of-labour-conditions-in-xinjiang-101616923141152.html
28-03-2021||World||'We've made friends with it already': Villagers on ship blocking Suez Canal||Villagers on the banks of the Suez Canal are getting used to their unusual new neighbor. It’s 400 meters long, carries about $1 billion and nobody knows when it’ll leave.Towering above the low-rise red-brick homes, grazing buffalo and green farmland dotted with palm trees, the Ever Given stands like a monument to globalization marooned amid a typically Egyptian rural scene. And since the ship’s grounding last week brought one of the world’s busiest trade routes to a halt, residents have had rare front-row seats to an event whose outcome is key to the global economy.“We’ve never had a ship stuck around here for a very long time,” said a local woman who asked to be called Fatma and has spent her life within earshot of the shipping horns. She gestured to the hulking Ever Given, in whose spotlights the local children have been playing hide-and-seek at night. “We’ve made friends with it already!”As dredgers, tug boats and teams of engineers race to dislodge the ship, the inhabitants of the agricultural hinterlands north of Suez city are basking in the novelty. While some take selfies with the behemoth in the background or wave to the crew, others like Fatma daydream about what it was transporting to world markets.“I need to get a bedroom and a saloon for my new house; I want it French-style!” she chuckled, casting a wistful look at the vessel laden with potentially thousands of red, blue and green containers.The ships plying the waterway may come from all corners of the Earth, but for locals the 120-mile channel linking the Red Sea and Mediterranean that opened in 1869 is a source of Egyptian pride. As far back as the early second millennium BC, Pharaoh Senusret III is said to have established a predecessor connecting the seas using branches of the Nile River.President Gamal Abdel-Nasser nationalized the canal in 1956, wresting it back from eight decades of British control and sparking an invasion by Israeli, British and France forces that failed, cementing his status as an inspirational Arab leader. Current head of state Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi oversaw an $8 billion expansion that opened in 2015 and sought to boost traffic and revenue.With that initiative came stepped-up security. A fence erected in 2014 has blocked villagers from the canal’s edge, otherwise they say they might have befriended their temporary neighbors. Years ago when ships ran aground, villagers remember crew-members tossing sodas ashore to children.For people like Mohammed Awad, 39, who was born in Ismailia, another of the canal’s three cities along with Port Said, the conduit has been a way of life for generations. He grew up fishing in the canal with his father, and his grandfather worked on a dredger that removed the wreckage of ships sunk during the 1973 Yom Kippur conflict with Israel.The canal had been shut from 1967, when Arab countries and Israel fought the Six Day War, and was only re-opened in 1975. That was the last major closure, until now.Like all those living by the canal interviewed for this story, Awad recalls the strong winds and sandstorm that turned the sky yellow and cut visibility on the day the Ever Given ran aground.It’s an accident the state-run Suez Canal Authority says is losing it as much as $14 million a day. The canal generated $5.6 billion for the government last year, around 10% of its total revenue. Until a lengthy press briefing Saturday, authorities had released limited information about the event and access to the site remains heavily restricted.“I panicked when I first heard about the ship,” Awad said. “I know how important the canal is to all of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weve-made-friends-with-it-already-villagers-on-ship-blocking-suez-canal-101616922368823.html
28-03-2021||World||Myanmar protests continue a day after more than 100 killed||Protesters in Myanmar returned to the streets Sunday to press their demands for a return to democracy, just a day after security forces killed more than 100 people in the bloodiest day since last month's military coup.Protests were held in Yangon and Mandalay, the country’s two biggest cities, as well as elsewhere. Some of the demonstrations were again met with police force.At least 114 people were killed Saturday as security forces cracked down on protests against the Feb. 1 coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, according to the online news service Myanmar Now. The reported fatalities included several children under 16 years old.Similar tallies of the death toll were issued by other Myanmar media and researchers, far exceeding the previous highest death toll on March 14. The number of killings since the coup is now more than 420, according to multiple counts.The coup reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule and has again made Myanmar the focus of international scrutiny.The Saturday killings by police and soldiers took place throughout the country as Myanmar’s military celebrated the annual Armed Forces Day holiday with a parade in the country’s capital, Naypyitaw.The bloodshed quickly drew international condemnation, both from diplomatic missions within Myanmar and from abroad.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was shocked by the killings of civilians, including children.“The continuing military crackdown is unacceptable and demands a firm, unified & resolute international response,” he wrote on Twitter.In the United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet that his country was “horrified by the bloodshed perpetrated by Burmese security forces, showing that the junta will sacrifice the lives of the people to serve the few.”The military chiefs of 12 nations issued a joint statement condemning the use of force against unarmed people.“A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting — not harming — the people it serves,” it said. “We urge the Myanmar Armed Forces to cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions."The statement was issued by the defense chiefs of Australia, Canada, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.The human rights group Amnesty International revived criticism that the international community was not doing enough to end the state violence in Myanmar.“U.N. Security Council member states’ continued refusal to meaningfully act against this never-ending horror is contemptible,” said Ming Yu Hah, the organization’s deputy regional director for campaigns.The Security Council has condemned the violence but not advocated concerted action against the junta, such as a ban on selling it arms. China and Russia are both major arms suppliers to Myanmar’s military as well as politically sympathetic, and as members of the council would almost certainly veto any such move.In recent days the junta has portrayed the demonstrators as the ones perpetrating violence for their sporadic use of Molotov cocktails. On Saturday, some protesters in Yangon were seen carrying bows and arrows. It has said its use of force has been justified to stop what it has called rioting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-continue-a-day-after-more-than-100-killed-101616922461160.html
28-03-2021||World||NATO chief raises serious concern about China's military investment||North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) chief Jens Stoltenberg has raised serious concern about China's heavy investment in military equipment, claiming it will have a direct consequence on our security.According to The Standard (Hong Kong), Jens Stoltenberg at a media conference after the commencement of NATO said, "the military alliance does not regard China as an adversary, but of course, the rise of China has direct consequences for our security.""China is investing heavily in military equipment, including nuclear-capable missiles," Stoltenberg added."More importantly, China is a country that doesn't share our values. We see that in the way they deal with democratic protests in Hong Kong, how they suppress minorities in their own country, the Uyghurs, and also how they actually try to undermine the international rules-based order," Stoltenberg further added.Earlier this month, Stoltenberg called for the United States and European Union to quickly repair their alliance if they are to deal with the bullying of countries all 'over the world by China.He described China's behaviour as undermining the rule of law and he welcomed President Joe Biden's clear commitment to "rebuilding alliances and strengthening NATO".NATO, a military alliance between 30 European and North American countries, enduring a tough four years when former President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the group, claiming that European members were not paying their way.The NATO chief said that Europe is not big enough, the United States is not big enough. But together Brussels and Washington represent 50 per cent of the world's GDP and 50 per cent of the world's military market."So if you're concerned about the rise of China, the military and economic strength of China, that makes it even more important that we stand together, Europe and North America in NATO," Stoltenberg said.In December, in its report 'NATO 2030 - United for a New Era report', it said that the organisation must devote more time, political resources, and action to counter the security challenges posed by China. It also recommended a special unit within the Joint Intelligence and Security Division (JISD) to monitor Russia-China cooperation impacting Euro-Atlantic security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-raises-serious-concern-about-china-s-military-investment-101616921719625.html

When will the booster be given? The answer should be based on the results of future phase III clinical studies," Zhang said.Antibodies triggered by two Covid-19 vaccine products from Sinopharm both have "pretty good" neutralising effect on variants found in Britain and South Africa, Zhang told a news conference, citing results from lab tests using blood samples taken from clinical trial participants.Lab testing was ongoing for variants found in Brazil and Zimbabwe, Zhang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinopharm-needs-trial-results-to-decide-if-covid-19-vaccine-needs-booster-shot-101616920410093.html

28-03-2021||World||2 tugboats speed to Egypt's Suez Canal as shippers avoid it||Two additional tugboats sped Sunday to Egypt's Suez Canal to aid efforts to free a skyscraper-sized container ship wedged for days across the crucial waterway, even as major shippers increasingly divert their boats out of fear the vessel may take even longer to free.The massive Ever Given, a Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal. In the time since, authorities have been unable to remove the vessel and traffic through the canal — valued at over $9 billion a day — has been halted, further disrupting a global shipping network already strained by the coronavirus pandemic.The Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magno, called in to help tugboats already there, reached the Red Sea near the city of Suez early Sunday, satellite data from MarineTraffic.com showed. The tugboats will nudge the 400-meter-long (quarter-mile-long) Ever Given as dredgers continue to vacuum up sand from underneath the vessel and mud caked to its port side, said Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which manages the Ever Given.Workers planned to make two attempts Sunday to free the vessel coinciding with high tides, a top pilot with the canal authority said.“Sunday is very critical," the pilot said. “It will determine the next step, which highly likely involves at least the partial offloading of the vessel.”Taking containers off the ship likely would add even more days to the canal's closure, something authorities have been desperately trying to avoid. It also would require a crane and other equipment that have yet to arrive.The pilot spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.On Saturday, the head of the Suez Canal Authority told journalists that strong winds were “not the only cause” for the Ever Given running aground, appearing to push back against conflicting assessments offered by others. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei said an investigation was ongoing but did not rule out human or technical error.Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement maintains that their “initial investigations rule out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.” However, at least one initial report suggested a “blackout” struck the hulking vessel carrying some 20,000 containers at the time of the incident.Rabei said he remained hopeful that dredging could free the ship without having to resort to removing its cargo, but added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.”Asked about when they expected to free the vessel and reopen the canal, he said: “I can’t say because I do not know.”Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the company that owns the vessel, said it was considering removing containers if other refloating efforts failed.The Ever Given is wedged about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the canal's Red Sea entrance near the city of Suez.A prolonged closure of the crucial waterway would cause delays in the global shipment chain. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal. The closure could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Already, Syria has begun rationing the distribution of fuel in the war-torn country amid concerns of delays of shipments arriving amid the blockage.As of early Sunday, over 320 ships waited to travel through the Suez, either to the Mediterranean or the Red Sea, according to canal services firm Leth Agencies. Dozens of others still listed their destination as the canal, though shippers increasingly appear to be avoiding the passage.The world’s biggest shipping company, Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk, warned its customers that it would take anywhere from three to six days to clear the backlog of vessels at the canal. Already, the firm and its partners have 22 ships waiting there.“The current number (of) redirected Maersk and partner vessels is 14 and expected to rise as we assess the salvage efforts along with network capacity and fuel on our vessels currently en route to Suez,” the shipper said.Mediterranean Shipping Co., the world's second-largest, said it already had rerouted at least 11 ships around Africa's Cape of Good Hope to avoid the canal. It turned back two other ships and said it expected “some missed sailings as a result of this incident.”“MSC expects this incident to have a very significant impact on the movement of containerized goods, disrupting supply chains beyond the existing challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-tugboats-speed-to-egypt-s-suez-canal-as-shippers-avoid-it-101616917135468.html

28-03-2021||World||Expelled from Ubured States at night, migrants from Mexico weigh next steps||In one of Mexico's most notorious cities for organized crime, migrants are expelled from the United States throughout the night, exhausted from the journey, disillusioned about not getting a chance to seek asylum and at a crossroads about where to go next.Marisela Ramirez, who was returned to Reynosa about 4 a.m. Thursday, brought her 14-year-old son and left five other children — one only 8 months old — in Guatemala because she couldn't afford to pay smugglers more money. Now, facing another agonizing choice, she leaned toward sending her son across the border alone to settle with a sister in Missouri, aware that the United States is allowing unaccompanied children to pursue asylum.“We're in God's hands,” Ramirez, 30, said in a barren park with dying grass and a large gazebo in the center that serves as shelter for migrants.Lesdny Suyapa Castillo, 35, said through tears that she would return to Honduras with her 8-year-old daughter, who lay under the gazebo breathing heavily with her eyes partly open and flies circling her face. After not getting paid for three months' work as a nurse in Honduras during the pandemic, she wants steady work in the US to send an older daughter to medical school. A friend in New York encouraged her to try again.“I would love to go, but a mother doesn't want to see her child in this condition,” she said after being dropped in Reynosa at 10 p.m.The decisions unfold amid what Border Patrol officials say is an extraordinarily high 30-day average of 5,000 daily encounters with migrants. Children traveling alone are allowed to remain in the US to pursue asylum while nearly all single adults are expelled to Mexico under pandemic-era rules that deny them a chance to seek humanitarian protection.Families with children younger than 7 are being allowed to remain in the US to pursue asylum, according to a Border Patrol official speaking to reporters Friday on condition of anonymity. Others in families — only 300 out of 2,200 on Thursday — are expelled.Reynosa, a city of 700,000 people, is where many migrants are returned after being expelled from Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The Border Patrol has said the vast majority of migrants are expelled to Mexico after less than two hours in the United States to limit the spread of Covid-19, which means many arrive when it's dark.In normal times, migrants are returned to Mexico under bilateral agreements that limit deportations to daytime hours and the largest crossings. But under pandemic authority, Mexicans and citizens of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras can be expelled to Mexico throughout the night and in smaller towns.Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott acknowledged in an interview last year that agreements limiting hours and locations for deportations are suspended “on paper” but said US authorities try to accommodate wishes of Mexican officials. The US also coordinates with nongovernmental organizations.“I would never sit here and look at you and say Tijuana is not dangerous, Juarez is not dangerous, Tamaulipas (state) is not dangerous,” Scott said. “However, a lot of it is like any other US city. There are certain US cities that there are pockets of it that are very dangerous and there are pockets of it that aren’t.”Tamaulipas, which includes Reynosa, is among five Mexican states that the US State Department says American citizens shouldn't visit. A US travel advisory says heavily armed criminal groups patrol Reynosa in marked and unmarked vehicles.More than 100 fathers, mothers and children who were expelled overnight waited in a plaza outside the Mexican border crossing at sunrise Saturday, many bitter about the experience and scared to venture into the city. Several said they left Central American in the past two months because they could finally afford it, but information about President Joe Biden's more immigrant-friendly policies contributed to their decisions. Some reported paying smugglers as much as $10,000 a person to reach US soil.Michel Maeco, who sold his land in Guatemala to pay smugglers $35,000 to bring his family of five, including children aged 15, 11 and 7, said he was going home after a 25-day journey. He left Guatemala after hearing “on the news” that Biden would allow families to enter the United States.Maeco's family was expelled to the streets of Reynosa at 3 a.m. Saturday.“Supposedly (Biden) was going to help migrants, but I see nothing,” said Maeco, 36.A Honduran woman who declined to give her name said she left two months ago because her home was destroyed in Tropical Storm Eta and she heard Biden would “open the border” for 100 days — unaware that the president's 100-day moratorium on deportations, suspended by courts, doesn't cover new arrivals. She planned to send her 9-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son across alone to live with their aunt in Alabama while she returns to Honduras.Underscoring the dangers, the Border Patrol said Friday that a 9-year-old Mexican girl died crossing the Rio Grande near the city of Eagle Pass.Mexico's migrant protection agency, Grupos Beta, persuaded many overnight arrivals to be bused to a distant shelter. Crowds at the nearby park had thinned from a few hundred migrants days earlier.Felicia Rangel, founder of the Sidewalk School, which gives educational opportunities to asylum-seeking children in Mexican border cities, sees the makings of a squalid migrant camp like in nearby Matamoros, which recently closed.“If they get a foothold in this gazebo, this is going to turn into an encampment,” she said as a church distributed chicken soup, bread and water to migrants for breakfast. “They do not want another encampment in their country.”Martin Vasquez is among the migrants staying for now. The 19-year-old was expelled after being separated from his 12-year-old brother, who was considered an unaccompanied child and will almost certainly be released to a grandfather in Florida. He said he was inclined to return to Guatemala, where he worked for a moving company, but wanted to wait a while “to see what the news says.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expelled-from-ubured-states-at-night-migrants-from-mexico-weigh-next-steps-101616913372508.html

The participants included families with children.However, they were confronted by a group of about 100 protesters shouting slogans against the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The protesters blocked the route that the car rally was to take, delaying the event for nearly three hours.Organisers of the celebration said some of the protesters also carried Khalistan flags, while the pro-Khalistan group Shirmani Akali Dal Amritsar (Canada) sent out a message saying the “rally was to demonise the farmers’ protest in India”.However, organisers of the Tiranga Yatra, who asked not be named, said their event had no political motive or agenda. “This was an expression of solidarity in the community as we haven’t been able to gather together to celebrate our festivals for over a year due to Covid-19,” an organiser said. She added that permission to hold the event and the car rally was taken weeks earlier from the city and police.Another organiser said while the rally was originally scheduled to commence at 1pm, it only began three hours later as the route the cars were to take was blocked by the protesters.Police cordoned off the protesters from the event participants but it took that much time to clear the area for the rally to proceed. The rally featured nearly 250 vehicles, flying both the Indian and Canadian flags, and lasted for about an hour.“We have been separated for a year and we were looking forward to being together but these nearly 100 protesters spoilt the day for some of us,” an organiser said.Recent car rallies by the Indo-Canadian community have been similarly disrupted, in some cases resulting in instances of violence. Incidents of assault and harassment were captured on video during a Tiranga-Maple Rally in the Greater Toronto Area on February 28, which resulted in the arrest of two persons, including Jodhveer Dhaliwal, brother-in-law of New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh.A Tiranga Yatra in Metro Vancouver on February 7, to celebrate Republic Day, resulted in protests outside the office of two of the organisers and also threats and intimidating phone calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-opposing-farm-laws-disrupt-holi-celebration-in-canadian-city-101616913402008.html
28-03-2021||World||Explained: Why US, Brazil witnessing surge in infection among youth||In the United States, several states including Florida and Michigan are reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases. However, this time the surge is not in people from the vulnerable section but in people under the age of 30 years old, an age group which was said to be at lesser risk of severe Covid-19, news agency Bloomberg reported citing data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Brazil, the second country after the US to have the highest death toll, is also witnessing a rise in the deaths among young people due to the Covid-19. It is also seeing an increase in the hospitalisation of younger patients, according to the data by the country's health ministry.In March, about 2,030 Brazilians aged 30 to 39 died from Covid-19. Among those in their 40s, there have been 4,150 fatalities in March, up from 1,823 in January, and for those 20-29, deaths jumped to 505 from 242, the government data showed. While patients above 60 and older continue to dominate hospital admissions, the share of those under 50 has risen to 15 per cent from 10 per cent last year.The situation is not limited to the US and Brazil only. In Canada as well, doctors are seeing an increase in hospitalisation of young Canadians with more severe complications from Covid-19, according to local media reports. A similar situation is being witnessed by Israel as well, where infections were recently plateauing despite the country’s world-leading immunisation program. It turned out that cases among young people were surging, even as infections dropped in the 50-and-older crowd.Why is it happening?So far, no research has emerged which could paint the exact picture of why the countries are witnessing this trend. However, experts have attributed the surge to the negligence in following the Covid-19 protocol. Throughout 2020, local and regional restrictions hampered social activities. This changed when authorities started loosening the lockdowns and holiday seasons. People gathered in groups and flocked back to the restaurants and bars; crowded the country’s beaches and attended live concerts, football matches.The second reason is said to be a delay in informing medics in case the person is infected with the Covid-19. For example, in Brazil, authorities have noticed that younger patients wait longer to seek health care and are sicker when they arrive, Bloomberg reported.The third reason speculated to be the young people at the last of the vaccination priority list. In many countries where the vaccination drive is underway, authorities are inoculating people most-at risk of severe Covid-19. This has also led to an increase in numbers.Covid-19 situation in IndiaThere is an onset of the second wave in India with the number of daily cases now hovering around 60,000. It had dropped to less than 10,000 in the first week of February after which the cases started to rise again. According to the figures provided by the Union health ministry, the country has a total of 11.97 million cases as of Sunday morning. While the death toll stands at 161,552.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-us-brazil-witnessing-surge-in-infection-among-youngs-101616911428301.html
28-03-2021||World||6 days on, Suez Canal still blocked: What we know so far||The Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest waterways, continued to remain blocked as a giant container ship is stuck sideways in it hindering global shipping and trade for the sixth day on Sunday.The 400 metre (430 yard) long Ever Given, which is wedged diagonally across a southern section of the canal, moved slightly as efforts underway to dislodge it allowed its stern and rudder to move, the head of the canal authority told news agency Reuters."We expect that at any time the ship could slide and move from the spot it is in," Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chairman Osama Rabie was quoted as saying by Reuters. He added that water had started running underneath the ship.About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the canal and hundreds of vessels are waiting to pass once the blockage is cleared, the agency reported.Here’s what we know so far about the Suez Canal blockage:*The MV Ever Given, which is longer than four football fields, has been wedged diagonally across the canal since Tuesday, blocking it in both directions.*Rabie on Saturday pointed to the possibility of "technical or human errors" behind the grounding of a huge container ship, which has led to a backlog of over 300 vessels, according to news agency AFP. "Strong winds and weather factors" were not solely responsible, he said adding, there "may have been technical or human errors".*On being asked by when the vessel may be removed, the Suez canal chief told AFP on Saturday, “We could finish today or tomorrow (Sunday), depending on the ship's responsiveness" to tides.*Dredgers removed some 20,000 tonnes of sand from around the ship’s bow by Friday, Reuters said and quoted a Dutch firm that is carrying out efforts to move the vessel that it could be freed by the start of next week if heavier tugboats, dredging and a high tide succeed in dislodging it.*Following the logjam, over 320 ships carrying billions of dollars-worth of cargo are now stalled at either end of the vital shipping lane linking Asia to Europe, according to AFP. Rabie told the agency that Egypt is suffering a loss of some $12-14 million in revenue from the canal for each day it is closed.*An expert cited by AFP said, "If they don't manage to dislodge it during that high tide, the next high tide is not there for another couple of weeks, and that becomes problematic." Plamen Natzkoff, an expert at VesselsValue added that the stakes are too high for it to take months.*Shipping rates for oil product tankers have nearly doubled after the stranding of the vessel and disrupted global supply chains threaten costly delays for companies already dealing with Covid-19 restrictions, Reuters said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-days-on-suez-canal-still-blocked-what-we-know-so-far-101616903531092.html

28-03-2021||World||Covid-19 keeps spreading death where vaccines haven’t reached||If you’re living in Israel, the US or the UK, where vaccination programs are rolling out with remarkable speed, glimpses of a post-pandemic future are starting to appear: Schools have mostly reopened, family gatherings are being planned and summer vacations may be just over the horizon.But move away from this handful of rich countries, and a darker reality emerges: The virus is still rampaging around most of the planet, and uneven vaccine distribution poses a major public risk as variants emerge.Since mid-March, Covid-19 deaths have started trending upward again worldwide even as the numbers improved in the U.S. and U.K., according to Johns Hopkins University data. Last week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the unequal supply of vaccines “is not just a moral outrage, it is also economically and epidemiologically self defeating.”Worldwide, half a billion vaccine doses have been administered, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. While shots have been given in some 140 countries, the vast majority have gone to developed nations that secured early doses by the hundreds of millions. That disparity risks prolonging the pandemic, even for places currently leading the vaccination race.“We need to try to bridge the gap between the vaccine haves and vaccine have-nots to really meet the goals that we’re seeking to achieve in ending this pandemic and getting our economies running again,” Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview.Covax, a facility that aims to distribute doses equitably around the globe, has started delivering shots to lower-income countries like Ivory Coast and Ghana, but the WHO has said more needs to be done.Here’s a look at how vaccine disparities and a resurgent virus are playing out in half-a-dozen countries.IsraelIsrael’s economy has mostly reopened now that half the country is fully vaccinated and new cases are plunging.People are flocking back to the restaurants and bars that survived the pandemic, crowding the country’s beaches and enjoying live concerts and football matches in the early days of spring.Israel is still closed to foreign tourists out of concern the spread of variants could undermine its vaccination program. Still, some hotels say they’re fully booked for the Passover holiday, which will be celebrated without new restrictions on movement. That’s a switch from last year, when lockdowns were imposed over the period to avoid a spike in cases.UKThe U.K. remains in a lockdown, but the government’s roadmap to reopening the economy has offered a pathway to normality for a population that’s being vaccinated faster than any of its European neighbors.The country recently passed the milestone of giving a first dose to more than half its adults. It set a daily record on March 20, inoculating almost 1.3% of the population on a single day. Hospitalizations also fell by more than a fifth from the week before, bringing some relief to the National Health Service.Schools have reopened and some employees are starting to return to offices in London’s financial districts, but residents won’t be able to eat at restaurants or buy non-essential goods in stores for another two weeks. Still, the government hopes to remove all lockdown restrictions, including allowing nightclubs to reopen, by June 21.USThe daily death toll has fallen steadily since mid-February as states pushed to speed vaccinations and balanced medical concerns with protests by anti-lockdown groups.Yet disparities remain. While New Mexico has given at least one dose to over a third of its population, Georgia has just managed a fifth. The inequities are also present among racial groups: in 16 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., less than 10% of the Hispanic population has been vaccinated as of Wednesday -- a milestone most states reached with White populations weeks ago. Still, more than a quarter of Americans have received their first vaccine dose.Restaurants in New York City -- once the pandemic’s American epicenter -- can now operate at 50% capacity indoors, with many diners taking advantage of covered sidewalk seating in Manhattan. The city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has announced plans for a vaccination center on Broadway to inoculate theater-industry workers in preparation for a planned re-opening in September.BrazilAbout a year after the virus first arrived and two months after vaccinations began, Brazil is going through its worst stretch of the pandemic yet.The vast Latin American nation reported 3,650 deaths on Friday, its highest daily toll. On Wednesday, it became just the second country after the U.S. to record 300,000 fatalities. Since starting inoculations in mid-January, just 6% of the population has received a dose. The crisis has prompted neighbors to close borders, impose travel bans and require forced quarantines.President Jair Bolsonaro, who long downplayed the coronavirus, has now promised to speed up vaccination efforts. The pathogen’s resurgence follows months of relatively lax rules, which included New Year’s celebrations and clandestine parties around the Carnival season in Rio de Janeiro. The upswing also coincided with the growing dominance of a more contagious strain discovered in the northern city of Manaus.IndiaIndia, a vaccine-making colossus key to supplying much of the world with low-cost shots, has struggled to immunize itself. Now the country of almost 1.4 billion is slowing exports to keep more doses at home after new infections climbed six-fold since February to more than 60,000 a day.This week, the government expanded the rollout to everyone over the age of 45 and has allowed its huge network of private hospitals to charge a subsidized rate for the vaccines. Those moves have boosted immunization rates and may help Prime Minister Narendra Modi reach a target of inoculating 300 million Indians by August.While India has been reluctant to reimpose lockdowns after a costly shutdown last year did little to halt the spread of the virus, there are increasing concerns that tighter restrictions may be needed.ItalyA year after it became Europe’s first virus hotspot, Italy has again been forced to impose a costly lockdown.In the nation with the highest death toll in the European Union, daily fatalities have been climbing since the start of the month as a highly contagious strain spreads across the country. Prime Minister Mario Draghi has been pressing the EU to lean on pharmaceutical companies to respect vaccine delivery commitments while warning that Italy will block exports by firms that breach contracts.A general has been appointed as a new virus czar to speed up the vaccine rollout and make sure that all Italian regions keep up the pace.

Myanmar's military has so far ignored criticism of its violent crackdown on dissent.While the draft statement did not explicitly condemn the Feb. 1 coup, which ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, it said that a professional military must follow international standards for conduct "and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves."It said the country's military must "cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions."Myanmar's military has said it took power because November elections won by Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the country's election commission. Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her National League for Democracy party are also in custody.The deaths on Saturday, Myanmar's annual Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945, would take the number of civilians reported killed since the coup to more than 440.New U.S. and European sanctions this week increased external pressure on the junta. But Myanmar's generals have enjoyed some support from Russia and China, both veto-holding members of the U.N. Security Council that could block any potential U.N. action.Russia's deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin attended a parade in Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw on Saturday, having met senior junta leaders a day earlier.Diplomats said eight countries - Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand - sent representatives to the Armed Forces Day parade, but Russia was the only one to send a minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-military-officers-from-us-allies-to-condemn-violence-by-myanmar-security-forces-101616895536119.html
28-03-2021||World||5,000 gather in Barcelona after Covid-19 screen for non-distanced rock concert||If one overlooked the white face masks dotting the tightly packed crowd of music lovers, it was almost like pre-pandemic times in Barcelona's Palau Sant Jordi concert hall Saturday night.Five thousand rock fans enjoyed a real-as-can-be concert after passing a same-day coronavirus screening, to test its effectiveness in preventing outbreaks of the virus at large cultural events.The only rule inside the show was the strict use of the high-quality face masks provided by the concert organizers.“We were able to evade reality for a while," said 40-year-old Jose Parejo. "We were inside our small concert bubble. And we were even able to remember back in time when things like this one were normal. Things that nowadays aren’t that normal, sadly.”The show by Spanish rock group Love of Lesbian had the special permission of Spanish health authorities. While the rest of the country was limited to gatherings of no more than four people in closed spaces, the concertgoers were able to mix freely.The musicians were also swept up in the moment.“It’s been a year and half since we last set foot on a scenario as a band," singer Santi Balmes told the crowd. "This is so. ... some of the musicians are crying over here."Ticket buyers chose between three venues in Barcelona where they could take a quick antigen test on Saturday morning. Those with negative results got a code on their cellphones validating their tickets for the 7 p.m. show.People with heart disease, cancer, or those who have been in contact with someone infected by Covid-19 in recent weeks were asked not to sign up.Organizers said it was the first commercial event with an audience that big held in Europe during the pandemic.The show was sold out. The tickets, ranging from 23-28 euros ($27-33), included the cost of the test and the face mask that was obligatory except when eating or drinking in designated areas.The concert was backed by local authorities and by experts of Barcelona’s The Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, which also organized a case study around a smaller concert of 500 people in December. They said that the results of that preliminary case study showed that pre-screening with antigen tests and the use of face masks succeeded in preventing infections inside the concert despite there being no social distancing rules.“This is another small step toward being able to hold concerts and cultural events” during the pandemic, said Dr. Boris Revollo, the virologist involved in the design of the health protocols.In addition to being 10 times larger than the concert in December, this time there was no control group maintained outside the concert hall.Instead, concertgoers agreed public health authorities can inform Revollo’s team if they come down with the coronavirus in the weeks after the concert. With that information, Revollo’s team will do an analysis of infection rates among the 5,000 concertgoers compared with that of the general population to see if there are any discrepancies that could point to contagion at the concert.For 37-year-old Gerard Munne, it was a release.“A sensation of freedom, being able to feel the warmth of the people," he said. "(It was) yesterday’s normality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5000-gather-in-barcelona-after-covid-19-screen-for-non-distanced-rock-concert-101616895608192.html
28-03-2021||World||Germany must suppress Covid-19 now or risk losing control, says Merkel aide||Germany must bring down coronavirus infections in the next few weeks or risk new virus mutations that are resistant to vaccines, and should impose night-time curfews in regions with high caseloads, said a top aide to Chancellor Angela Merkel."We are in the most dangerous phase of the pandemic," Merkel's chief of staff Helge Braun told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. "The next few weeks will determine whether we can foreseeably get the pandemic under control."If the number of infections rises rapidly again there is a growing danger that the next virus mutation will become resistant to the vaccine, Braun said."Then we would need new vaccines, then we would have to start vaccinating all over again," he added.After a popular backlash and legal hurdles, Merkel was forced to ditch plans for an extended Easter holiday intended to try to break a third wave of Covid-19, but Braun said it remained imperative to reduce the number of infections.In regions where the number of cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days is more than 100, he spoke out in favour of additional curbs. "That's where regional curfews in the evening and at night can help, because we have the highest infection rates at meetings in people's homes," he saidCoronavirus infections have risen sharply in Germany in recent weeks, driven by a more transmissible variant of the virus and moves to ease some restrictions.On Saturday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 20,472, while the reported death toll rose by 157, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.Braun said he expected the infection situation to ease in May, helped by the impact of vaccinations and the onset of warmer weather. "By Whitsun (May 23) we will see the first positive effects - provided the situation doesn't get out of hand by then."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-must-suppress-covid-19-now-or-risk-losing-control-says-merkel-aide-101616895288092.html
28-03-2021||World||Ship blocking Suez Canal moves slightly, unclear when it will refloat||Efforts to dislodge a giant container ship blocking the Suez Canal have allowed its stern and rudder to move, but it remains unclear when the vessel will be refloated, the head of the canal authority said on Saturday.The 400 metre (430 yard) long Ever Given became wedged diagonally across a southern section of the canal amid high winds early on Tuesday, blocking one of the world's busiest waterways.A combination of dredging material from around the ship and pulling and pushing the vessel with tugboats made minor progress in dislodging the ship on Saturday, two SCA sources said. One source said there had been some movement at the bow of the ship.Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Chairman Osama Rabie told local TV that water had started running underneath the ship. "We expect that at any time the ship could slide and move from the spot it is in," he told a press conference earlier.About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the canal and hundreds of vessels are waiting to pass once the blockage has been cleared.Rabie said he hoped it would not be necessary to remove some of the 18,300 containers on board to lighten the ship's load, but strong tides and winds were complicating efforts to free it."The ship's stern began (on Friday) to move towards Suez, and that was a positive sign until 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) at night, but the tide fell significantly and we stopped," Rabie told journalists in Suez.Dredgers removed some 20,000 tonnes of sand from around its bow by Friday. A Dutch firm working to free the vessel said it could be freed by the start of next week if heavier tugboats, dredging and a high tide succeed in dislodging it.Tugging attempts restarted on Saturday afternoon and further efforts were planned for Sunday, SCA sources said, though they added more sand may need to be removed from around the ship to free it.A shipping agent in Port Said said the SCA had notified agencies to prepare for the possible entry of new ships into the canal, while a shipping source said the SCA had outlined a plan for the rapid transit of 133 vessels once the Ever Given was freed.HEAVY TUGBOATSThe head of Boskalis, parent company of Dutch firm Smit Salvage which has been brought in to help the SCA, said heavy tugboats with a combined capacity of 400 tonnes would arrive sometime this weekend."We aim to get it done after the weekend, but everything will have to work out exactly right for that," Boskalis Chief Executive Peter Berdowski told Dutch TV programme Nieuwsuur late on Friday.Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on Saturday thanked foreign partners for offers to help refloat the ship.Shipping rates for oil product tankers nearly doubled after the ship became stranded, and the blockage has disrupted global supply chains, threatening costly delays for companies already dealing with COVID-19 restrictions.If the blockage drags on, shippers may decide to reroute their cargoes around the Cape of Good Hope, adding about two weeks to journeys and extra fuel costs. Rabie said the ships that are waiting were free to reroute, but none had yet done so.He said 321 vessels were waiting to enter or continue their transit through the canal. Those included dozens of container ships, bulk carriers and liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vessels, according to a shipping source.Fourteen tugs have so far been involved in efforts to refloat the Ever Given, although Boskalis and Smit Salvage have warned that using too much force to tug the ship could damage it.Berdowski said a land crane could lighten the Ever Given's load by removing containers, though experts have warned that such a process could be complex and lengthy."If we don't succeed in getting it loose next week, we will have to remove some 600 containers from the bow to reduce the weight," he said. "That will set us back days at least, because where to leave all those containers will be quite a puzzle."Rabie said empty container ships with cranes could offload cargo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ship-blocking-suez-canal-moves-slightly-unclear-when-it-will-refloat-101616894743569.html

No details were provided.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said "multiple victims" were stabbed inside and outside the North Vancouver Library and that one suspect was in custody.It "appears this was a lone suspect," the RCMP said on Twitter, adding that it was still looking for "potential additional victims."Amy Robertson of B.C. Emergency Health Services said six people were taken to the hospital and that she was unable to release details on their condition, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported earlier."We were driving up ... and there was a woman right beside her car with a 7-year-old boy, multiple stab wounds and bleeding profusely ... She said it was a random stabber who was running down the street," a witness who gave his name as Steve told Canada's Global News.North Vancouver is a mostly quiet and wealthy suburb with about 85,000 people on the north side of Burrard Inlet, Vancouver's primary port. In 2019, North Vancouver was ranked 10th on Maclean's magazine list of the richest Canadian communities with an average household net worth of nearly C$2 million.Two bridges and a foot ferry connect North Vancouver to the city of Vancouver. North Vancouver is also a popular destination for hiking and skiing, with part of the North Shore mountain range within its boundaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-wounded-in-stabbing-incident-in-north-vancouver-library-suspect-held-101616894476467.html
28-03-2021||World||2 dead, 3 arrested in Virginia Beach shootings, say police||Overnight shootings near the Atlantic oceanfront in Virginia Beach left two people dead and eight wounded in a scene described by authorities on Saturday as “very chaotic.”A woman who died was likely an innocent bystander, authorities said, while the other person was killed by a police officer whose body camera was not activated at the time.Three men ranging in age from 18 to 22 have been arrested and face charges that include felonious assault and reckless handling of a firearm, Virginia Beach police said in a statement on Saturday.The first shooting occurred shortly after 11 pm Friday along an outdoor strip of hotels, clubs and restaurants that were densely packed with people on one of the first warm days of the year.Witness Akereia Drayton said Saturday that she was coming out of a club on Friday night after the shooting ended and saw “mass chaos” and many people running.“People were literally falling over themselves,” Drayton said.Investigators believe the first shooting stemmed from a fight involving a group of people, police said.“Several individuals produced firearms and began shooting at each other, resulting in numerous people being wounded,” the police department statement said.Officers patrolling the area quickly responded, police said. But more gunfire followed several minutes later.Police said they found a female bystander about a block away who died of her injuries from a second shooting incident. Investigators believe the woman's death was not related to the initial shooting.At around the same time, police said that a uniformed officer in that area “encountered an armed citizen” and fatally shot him.A firearm was found “in the vicinity” of the shooting, Virginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate said during a news conference Saturday night. The man was later identified as Donovon W. Lynch, 25, of Virginia Beach.Neudigate said the officer who killed Lynch was wearing a body camera but, “for unknown reasons,” it was not activated.“We would like to provide the community answers. At this point we do not have them,” the police chief said.A Virginia Beach police officer was also struck by a vehicle, authorities said. He was treated for his injuries and released from the hospital.“We have a very chaotic incident, a very chaotic night,” Neudigate said.A total of 10 people were wounded by gunfire, including the two who died, according to police.Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital said four people wounded in the gunfire remained in the hospital on Saturday. All four of them were in good condition, a hospital spokeswoman said in an email.Three men were charged in the initial shooting incident, police said. They were identified as Ahmon Jahree Adams, 22, of neighboring Chesapeake, Virginia; Nyquez Tyyon Baker, 18, of Virginia Beach; and Devon Maurice Dorsey Jr., 20, of Virginia Beach.Police said they are being held in a jail in Virginia Beach. It's unclear if they've hired attorneys, who could be contacted for comment on their behalf.The bystander who died in the second shooting incident was Deshayla E. Harris, 28, of the nearby city of Norfolk, police said. No arrests have been made in connection with her death.The officer who killed has been placed on administrative leave, police said. He has been with the department for five years and is assigned to its special operations division.Lynch's father told WAVY-TV that his son was “a father’s dream.”Adrian Montgomery, a security guard who works at one of the oceanfront hotels, said the initial shooting occurred in an outdoor area where a lot of young people hang out and “try to talk to girls.”Montgomery said a woman told a man that she didn't want his phone number, which led to an altercation between that man and another man.An exchange of gunfire between the two men followed, Montgomery said, before more shots were fired between people who were friends with each of the respective shooters.“At that point, it just became a shooting gallery,” Montgomery said. “Whoever had a gun and felt threatened fired ... (They) were pulling out guns like they're cellphones.”Montgomery, 31, said the people he saw get shot appeared to be innocent bystanders. One of them was his 17-year-old nephew who had to have surgery.Montgomery added that the Virginia Beach oceanfront, which includes a boardwalk, was packed with people who were shoulder-to-shoulder on a warm, but tension-filled spring night.“There was no wiggle room,” Montgomery said. “When you have no wiggle room, somebody is going to step on somebody. And somebody is going to try to be Mr. Tough Guy.”Police on Saturday were still processing the crime scene, which included two full blocks that mostly make up a city-owned parking lot.Bill Feis, who lives a few houses away from the parking lot, said he was in bed and could hear people talking loudly before the shooting, which he said “sounded like someone threw a package of firecrackers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-dead-3-arrested-in-virginia-beach-shootings-say-police-101616894030937.html

28-03-2021||World||No timeline given for extracting wedged ship from Suez Canal||A giant container ship remained stuck sideways in Egypt’s Suez Canal for a fifth day Saturday, as authorities made new attempts to free the vessel and reopen a crucial waterway whose blockage is disrupting global shipping and trade.Meanwhile, the head of the Suez Canal Authority said strong winds were “not the only cause” for the Ever Given running aground on Tuesday, appearing to push back against conflicting assessments offered by others. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei told a news conference Saturday that an investigation was ongoing but did not rule out human or technical error.The massive Ever Given, a Panama-flagged ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about six kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez.Rabei said he could not predict when the ship might be dislodged. A Dutch salvage firm is attempting to refloat the vessel with tugboats and dredgers, taking advantage of high tides.Rabei said he remained hopeful that dredging could free the ship without having to resort to removing its cargo, but added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.”Asked about when they expected to free the vessel and reopen the canal, he said: "I can’t say because I do not know.”Shoei Kisen, the company that owns the vessel, said it was considering removing containers if other refloating efforts failed.Two attempts to free the vessel failed Saturday, according to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the ship's management company, and a canal services provider, Leth agencies, despite hopes that a high tide might give the vesslela boost.Bernhard Schulte had said earlier that “significant progress” was made late Friday at the ship’s stern where its rudder was released from sediment.It said around a dozen tugboats were working Saturday alongside dredging operations that were removing sand and mud from around the left side of the vessel’s bow.Some 9,000 tons of ballast water had been already removed from the vessel, the canal chairman said.Since the blockage began, a maritime traffic jam had grown to more than 320 vessels waiting on both ends of the Suez Canal and in the Great Bitter Lake in the middle of the waterway.Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired to extract the Ever Given said Friday said the company hoped to pull the container ship free within days using a combination of heavy tugboats, dredging and high tides.He told the Dutch current affairs show Nieuwsuur on Friday night that the front of the ship is stuck in sandy clay, but the rear “has not been completely pushed into the clay and that is positive because you can use the rear end to pull it free.”“The combination of the (tug) boats we will have there, more ground dredged away and the high tide, we hope that will be enough to get the ship free somewhere early next week,” he said.If that doesn’t work, the company will remove hundreds of containers from the front of the ship to lighten it, effectively lifting the ship to make it easier to pull free, Berdowski said.A crane was already on its way that can lift the containers off the ship, he said. Bernhard Schulte also confirmed that a Dutch and an Italian tugboat were scheduled to arrive in Egypt on Sunday.Egypt Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly called the ship's predicament "a very extraordinary incident,” in his first public comments on the blockage.The Suez Canal Authority organized the first media trip Saturday to the site where the vessel was stuck. From a distance, a flotilla of tugboats and other salvage equipment appeared minuscule compared to the vessel, a reminder of the scale of effort needed to reopen the canal.Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said Friday that its initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure. However, Rabei seemed to be pushing back against that assessment Saturday, saying that all possibilities, including human and technical errors, were being investigated.A prolonged closure of the crucial waterway would cause delays in the global shipment chain. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal. The closure could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East.Some vessels began changing course and dozens of ships were still en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv.It remained unclear how long the blockage would last. Even after reopening the canal that links factories in Asia to consumers in Europe, the waiting containers are likely to arrive at busy ports, forcing them to face additional delays before offloading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-timeline-given-for-extracting-wedged-ship-from-suez-canal-101616892862172.html
28-03-2021||World||Taiwan, US coastguard agreement aims to counter China's expansion: Analyst||A new pact signed by Taiwan and the United States on coast guard cooperation aims at countering China's expansion, said a Taiwanese analyst.According to Taiwan News, Su Tzu-yun, a senior analyst at Taiwan's Institute of National Defense and Security Research, said that the new pact between Washington and Taipei symbolises the clarification of America's strategy in the Indo-Pacific.Taiwan and the United States signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a Coast Guard Working Group (CGWG) in Washington DC on Thursday.The pact seems to be in response to the Chinese coast guard law, which allows the country's coast guard to fire at any foreign vessels in the waters "under China's jurisdiction".Su said that with the passing of its Coast Guard Law in late January, Beijing is attempting to strengthen its control over surrounding waters and the disputed islands in the South China Sea.Chinese coastguard ships have played a leading role in asserting China's maritime claims, including in fishing disputes off Indonesia's Natuna Islands and the stand-off with Vietnam over Vanguard Bank.In terms of organization, the Chinese Coast Guard is under command of the People's Armed Police, charged with integrating internal stability, border defence, and coastal defence. It is actually a "party police force," CNA cited Su as saying.China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, something which is contested heavily by several countries in the region.As per the report, some parts of the waters that fall within Manila's exclusive economic zone were renamed West Philippine Sea by the Philippine government.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region.Beijing's rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-us-coastguard-agreement-aims-to-counter-china-s-expansion-analyst-101616892497961.html
28-03-2021||World||Over 100 killed in deadliest day since Myanmar coup||As Myanmar's military celebrated the annual Armed Forces Day holiday with a parade Saturday in the country's capital, soldiers and police elsewhere reportedly killed dozens of people as they suppressed protests in the deadliest bloodletting since last month's coup.The online news site Myanmar Now reported late Saturday that the death toll had reached 114. A count issued by an independent researcher in Yangon who has been compiling near-real time death tolls put the total at 107, spread over more than two dozen cities and towns.Both numbers are higher than all estimates for the previous high on March 14, which ranged in counts from 74 to 90.Figures collected by the researcher, who asked not to be named for his security, have generally tallied with the counts issued at the end of each day by the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, which documents deaths and arrests and is widely seen as a definitive source. The Associated Press is unable to independently confirm the death tolls.The killings quickly drew international condemnation, with multiple diplomatic missions to Myanmar releasing statements that mentioned the killing of civilians Saturday, including children.“This 76th Myanmar armed forces day will stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour,” the European Union's delegation to Myanmar said on Twitter. “The killing of unarmed civilians, including children, are indefensible acts."In the United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the violence.“We are horrified by the bloodshed perpetrated by Burmese security forces, showing that the junta will sacrifice the lives of the people to serve the few,” he said in a tweet. “I send my deepest condolences to the victims' families. The courageous people of Burma reject the military's reign of terror.”The death toll in Myanmar has been steadily rising as authorities grow more forceful with their suppression of opposition to the February 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule.Up through Friday, the Association of Political Prisoners had verified 328 people killed in the post-coup crackdown.Junta chief Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing did not directly refer to the protest movement when he gave his nationally televised Armed Forces Day speech before thousands of soldiers in Naypyitaw. He referred only to “terrorism which can be harmful to state tranquility and social security,” and called it unacceptable.This year's event was seen as a flashpoint for violence, with demonstrators threatening to double down on their public opposition to the coup with more and bigger demonstrations. The protesters refer to the holiday by its original name, Resistance Day, which marks the beginning of a revolt against Japanese occupation in World War 2.State television MRTV on Friday night showed an announcement urging young people — who have been at the forefront of the protests and prominent among the casualties — to learn a lesson from those killed during demonstrations about the danger of being shot in the head or back.The warning was widely taken as a threat because a great number of the fatalities among protesters have come from being shot in the head, suggesting they have been targeted for death. The announcement suggested that some young people were taking part in protesting as if it was a game, and urged their parents and friends to talk them out of participating.In recent days the junta has portrayed the demonstrators as the ones perpetrating violence for their sporadic use of Molotov cocktails. On Saturday, some protesters in Yangon were seen carrying bows and arrows. In contrast, security forces have used live ammunition for weeks against what have still been overwhelmingly unarmed and peaceful crowds.The US Embassy said shots were fired Saturday at its cultural center in Yangon, though no one was injured.The military government does not issue regular casualty counts, and when it has released figures, the totals have been a fraction of what independent parties such as the UN have reported. It has said its use of force has been justified to stop what it has called rioting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-killed-in-deadliest-day-since-myanmar-coup-101616891267895.html
28-03-2021||World||Ship could be afloat by Sunday night: Official||Egypt’s Suez Canal chief said on Saturday that “technical or human errors” could be behind the grounding of a huge container ship blocking the vital waterway, causing a backlog of over 300 vessels.Osama Rabie, head of the Suez Canal Authority, told reporters in Suez that the ship could possibly be afloat again by Sunday night. The crisis has crippled global supply chains, forcing companies to consider the expensive option of re-routing vessels around the southern tip of Africa.Officials had previously blamed 40-knot gusts and a sandstorm that impeded visibility, but Rabie said on Saturday that “strong winds and weather factors were not the main reasons for the ship’s grounding -- there may have been technical or human errors”.But he sounded an optimistic note when asked when the vessel might be freed.“We could finish today or tomorrow (Saturday or Sunday), depending on the ship’s responsiveness” to tides, he said.The canal chief’s timeline echoed comments on Friday by the ship’s owners, but the parent company of the salvage firm was less optimistic.Yukito Higaki, president of Japanese firm Shoei Kisen which owns the vessel, told local media on Friday that the ship could be freed from the canal bed by late Saturday.But the executive director of Royal Boskalis, parent company of Smit Salvage which is in charge of the salvage operation, suggested the ship could be afloat again “at the start of next week”.“We are already in the process of installing a crane on land,” Peter Berdowski told a public television chat-show late on Friday.“That will allow us to eventually remove all the containers from the foredeck, which could involve hundreds of containers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ship-could-be-afloat-by-sunday-night-official-101616890331628.html
28-03-2021||World||Myanmar forces kill 114 people on deadliest day||Myanmar security forces killed 114 people, including some children, in a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on Saturday, the bloodiest day of violence since last month’s military coup, news reports and witnesses said.The killings, which took place on Armed Forces Day, drew strong renewed criticism from Western countries. British foreign minister Dominic Raab said the killing of unarmed civilians and children marked a new low, while the EU delegation to Myanmar said Saturday would “forever stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour”.Military jets also launched air strikes on a village in territory controlled by an armed group from the Karen ethnic minority and at least two people were killed, a civil society group said.Also read | US embassy in Myanmar blasts junta for 'murdering unarmed civilians'Earlier, the Karen National Union said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people - including a lieutenant-colonel - and losing one of its own fighters as tensions with the military surged after years of relative peace.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta leader, said during a parade to mark Armed Forces Day that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Demonstrators turned out on Saturday in Yangon, Mandalay and other towns, as they have done almost daily since the Februar 1 coup that ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Myanmar Now news portal said 114 people were killed across the country in crackdowns on the protests.At least 40 people, including a 13-year-old girl, were killed in Mandalay, and at least 27 people were killed in Yangon, Myanmar Now said. A boy as young as five was earlier reported among the dead in Mandalay but there were conflicting reports later that he may have survived. Another 13-year-old was among the dead in the central Sagaing region.“Today is a day of shame for the armed forces,” Dr Sasa, a spokesman for CRPH, an anti-junta group set up by deposed lawmakers, told an online forum. A military spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment on the killings by security forces, the air strikes or the insurgent attack on its post.“They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes,” said Thu Ya Zaw in the central town of Myingyan, where at least two protesters were killed.“We will keep protesting regardless... We must fight until the junta falls.”The deaths on Saturday would take the number of civilians reported killed since the coup to over 440.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-forces-kill-114-people-on-deadliest-day-101616889704261.html

28-03-2021||World||Suez canal blockage: When a desert wind blew USD 10 billion of global trade off course||The forecast for Tuesday, March 23, showed wind gusts of more than 40 miles per hour and sand storms sweeping through northern Egypt. Indeed, such weather is common in the Sinai desert at this time of year.The Suez Canal—one of the most critical, yet precarious waterways on the planet—remained open. Ships were starting to form the daily convoy as the gusts picked up. One of the world’s biggest container vessels, the Ever Given, joined it. The decision would reverberate globally within hours.By 7:40 a.m. local time, the megaship—loaded with containers that would stretch more than 120 kilometers (75 miles) end to end and carrying everything from frozen fish to furniture—was stuck. Its grounding would not only lay bare the intricacies of navigating a man-made trench of water in a vessel the size of the Eiffel Tower, but also the fragility of a global network of markets and economies that takes for granted the flow of goods through it.Based on tracking data and dozens of interviews with people in the industry, what’s known is that the Ever Given started heading through the 300 meter-wide canal while at least one other ship decided to hold off due to the high winds. The Ever Given also didn’t employ tug boats, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, while the two slightly smaller container ships immediately ahead did.Then there was the issue of how fast it was going. When the ship began to move toward the sand, it appeared to speed up, perhaps to correct itself, though it was too late and it almost collided with the bank. That served to then wedge the steel hull more deeply into the side of the canal. The gusts also would have compounded what’s considered by captains as one of the toughest water crossings in the world.“You’re in for some white-knuckle rides,” said Andrew Kinsey, a former captain who has navigated a 300-meter cargo ship through the Suez and is now a senior marine risk consultant at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. “It’s such a small canal, the winds are very rough and you have a really small margin for error and big consequences if errors happen.”It wasn’t a situation where you couldn’t sail, even though wind was strong enough to close nearby ports. Some vessels used tugs or other assistance, others just passed through without incident.At least one ship decided to delay the trip through the canal, though. The day before the Ever Given grounded, the Rasheeda was among the ships approaching the canal from the southern end. Mindful of the dangers of the coming sandstorm and laden with liquefied natural gas from Qatar, the captain decided not to enter the canal after discussion with other officials at Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which manages the ship, according to two people familiar with the situation.The Suez Canal Authority said a lack of visibility in adverse weather led to the ship losing control and drifting. It hasn’t commented further. Taiwan-based Evergreen Line, the time charterer of the vessel, said by email the Ever Given “was grounded accidentally after deviating from its course due to suspected sudden strong wind.”The manager of the ship, Benhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said initial investigations suggest the accident was due to the wind. An extensive investigation involving multi-agencies and parties is ongoing. It will include interviews with pilots onboard and all bridge personnel and other crew, said a company spokesman.Meanwhile, the canal remains blocked and the latest reports from people familiar with rescue efforts suggest that will take until at least Wednesday.A conduit for 12% of the world’s trade, an average of 50 ships pass through Suez every day in convoys that start in the early morning. The Ever Given started its journey soon after daybreak and picked up two local pilots from the Suez Canal Authority. They come onboard to supervise ships making the journey through the waterway that can take up to 12 hours. But the authority’s rules of navigation clearly spell out that the captain, shipowners and charterers remain responsible for accidents.The Ever Given captain overseeing the bridge had made the journey through the Suez many times before and handled it through gusty wind, according to a former crew member. Shipping companies say that they use their top captains for Suez because of the delicate nature of the trip.But what happened next left $10 billion worth of goods with nowhere to go with more than 300 ships carrying products across multiple industries now stuck in the gridlock.The Ever Given lost its bearing and began turning to its starboard side around 5 miles into the mouth of canal. The 200,000-ton ship then careened to its port side, and soon moved sideways and ran aground, its bulbous red bow that juts out to cut efficiently through water firmly embedded in the sandy embankment.“Here we have just a single vessel that’s out of place and yet it has impact on the entire maritime and global economy,” said Ian Ralby, chief executive officer of I.R. Consilium, a maritime law and security consulting firm that works with governments. “This ship—carrying exactly the kinds of things we rely on day to day—shows that the supply chains we rely on are so integrated and the margin for error is so thin.”Those piecing together what caused the accident will undoubtedly look at speed. The ship’s last known speed was 13.5 knots at 7:28 a.m., 12 minutes before the grounding, according to Bloomberg data.That would have surpassed the speed limit of about 7.6 knots (8.7 miles an hour) to 8.6 knots that is listed as the maximum speed vessels are “allowed to transit” through the canal, according to the Suez authority’s rules of navigation handbook posted on its website. Captains interviewed for this story said it can pay to increase the speed in the face of a strong wind to maneuver the ship better.“Speeding up to a certain point is effective,” said Chris Gillard, who was captain of a 300-meter container ship that crossed the Suez monthly for nearly a decade until 2019. “More than that and it becomes counter effective because the bow will get sucked down deep into the water. Then, adding too much power does nothing but exacerbate the problem.”Bloomberg data also show that the 300-meter Maersk Denver traveling behind the Ever Given also posted a top speed of 10.6 knots at 7:28 a.m. A spokesperson for Maersk in Denmark declined to comment. Ship captains and local pilots said it’s not unusual to travel through the canal around that speed despite the lower limit.The Cosco Galaxy, a container ship marginally smaller than the Ever Given, was immediately ahead and appears to have travelled at a similar speed, though with a tugboat. The one ahead of the Cosco, the Al Nasriyah, also had an escort. The escorts are not mandatory, according to the Suez authority’s rules of navigation, though the authority can require it for ships if they deem it necessary.“The biggest vessels often travel with a tugboat in close proximity, an escort boat, to facilitate the transit,” said Captain Theologos Gampierakis at commodity trading house Trafigura Group in Athens.A cargo ship with containers stacked high like the Ever Given can be particularly hard to navigate since the ship’s hull and wall of containers can act as a huge sail, said Kinsey, the former captain, who made his last trip through Suez in 2006 .“You might find yourself positioning the ship in one direction, and you’re actually moving in another direction,” said Kinsey. “There’s a very fine line between having enough speed to maneuver and not having too much speed that the air and hydrodynamics become unstable. Any deviation can get real bad real quick because it’s so tight.”About 20 minutes after the incident, the first of two tugboats accompanying the vessels ahead of the Ever Given came back to push its port side in an effort to dislodge it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Later, eight tugboats were deployed to push both sides of the container vessel, but to no avail.On the ground, officials and investigators were sent to the embankment. Excavators tried to make a dent in helping to release it from the sandy embankment.In a village 100 meters away from the stuck ship, the vessel looms on the skyline like a giant monument. Every day that it sits still makes it harder to extricate it, due to the sediment that’s being carried by the currents that will pack around the ship under the water, said Kinsey.The accident will be a missed opportunity if the industry doesn’t adapt, he said. “There will be vessels larger than this one that will be going through the Suez,” he said. “The next incident will be worse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-blockage-when-a-desert-wind-blew-usd-10-billion-of-global-trade-off-course-101616876390225.html
28-03-2021||World||UK to end green home grants, add funds for energy upgrades||The UK government will end a key program to improve home energy efficiency, while boosting funding for efforts to help households cut greenhouse emissions and save on power bills.The government will end its Green Home Grant voucher program, which faced a tepid uptake partly because of the coronavirus pandemic. The program, which provided vouchers for homeowners to help pay for insulating their properties and switch to low carbon heating, will be terminated on March 31, the government said in an emailed statement.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is working on a major overhaul of the voucher program, one of the government’s most important climate change policies, after it failed to deliver, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. Johnson is now in talks with finance minister Rishi Sunak over what comes next. The Treasury is seeking to redirect funds elsewhere, while the premier wants to design a successor program, the people said.The voucher program was launched in September with a budget of 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) and was designed to be a temporary stimulus measure as part of its broader climate change effort. Officials had originally hoped the grants would help upgrade 600,000 homes and support more than 100,000 jobs, fueling the economic recovery from the pandemic. The government didn’t provide figures on how many people applied for vouchers.The government also announced today an additional 300 million pounds in funding that will be channeled through local authorities in England to help low-income households upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes. The additional financing will take total government funding for energy efficiency and low-carbon heating in 2021-2021 to 1.3 billion pounds, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-end-green-home-grants-add-funds-for-energy-upgrades-101616871362150.html
28-03-2021||India||Attack on BJP MLA: Four BKU leaders held, 23 others booked for murder bid||Faridkot: Four Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) members on Sunday were arrested while 23 others were booked for attempt to murder in connection with the attack on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Arun Narang at Malout town on Saturday. As many as 250 unidentified people were also booked in the case. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, however, ruled out the involvement of his organisation and claimed that the attack was carried out by the BJP to defame farmers who have been protesting along Delhi borders since November 27. “Our people showed black flags but were not involved in this incident,” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The BJP MLA from Abohar in Fazilka district had gone to Malout to address a press meet when he was thrashed and his clothes were ripped off by a group of farmers protesting against the contentious agricultural laws. While the saffron party is yet to lodge any police complaint, Narang, who recorded his statement before the police, said he will take up the matter with the party high command before seeking any legal action. Expressing dissatisfaction over the police inaction, Narang said: “It seems the police are under pressure from the Congress-led state government to shield the culprits.” The case against the BKU leaders was registered on the complaint of Muktsar superintendent of police (SP) Gurmail Singh under sections 353, 186, 188, 332, 342, 506, 148 and 149 besides 307 of IPC at Malout police station. Among those arrested were Surjit Singh, Nem Pal Singh and Baldev Singh – all residents of Bodhiwala Kharak village – and Gurmeet Singh of Khunan Kalan. “A case was registered on the basis of a complaint by SP Gurmail Singh, who also sustained injuries in the attack. We recorded Narang’s statement today. Four farmer union members were arrested. However, several others are on the run. Efforts are on to arrest them,” senior superintendent of police D Sudarvizhi said. Meanwhile, Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore condemned the incident and sought a report from the Congress-led government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attack-on-bjp-mla-four-bku-leaders-held-23-others-booked-for-murder-bid-101616955822992.html
28-03-2021||India||War of words as ruling CPI(M), BJP spar over CAA in Kerala||With just nine days left for the crucial assembly elections in Kerala, parties are in a race to rake up the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and contentious Sabarimala temple issues. While the BJP and Congress have been raising the temple issue, the Left is busy highlighting the CAA to please the minority community.The state had witnessed massive protests two years ago against the CAA and both Congress and CPI(M) had joined hands in the state assembly to pass a unanimous resolution against the act. Manifestos of both parties made it clear that the controversial law will not be implemented in the state describing it as ‘discriminatory’ and ‘anti-Muslim’.Addressing an election rally in Kottayam in central Kerala on Sunday, senior BJP leader and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh said the party will implement all promises made during elections. He said the Union government had abrogated Article 370 and abolished the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and brought a law against triple talaq to protect the marriage of Muslim women. Singh said the party will similarly implement the CAA and three laws to reform the farming sector.The minister said the CAA was necessary to address the woes of persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. “We fulfilled all the promises made to the people,” Singh said referring to the actions taken by the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre to implement promises made during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Singh also came down heavily on the ruling Left front government for announcing a judicial inquiry against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials probing the sensational gold smuggling case. Also read: ‘Kerala challenging federal structure by turning against ED’ - Rajnath Singh“It is an unfortunate development. How can a state government initiate probe against central agencies? It is against federal structure of the country,” he said reminding the government that central agencies came to the state after CM Pinarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to the Prime Minister. The government had announced a judicial commission on Friday to probe the ED alleging the central agency was planning to implicate the CM in the gold smuggling case and portray the government in a bad light. “This is 100 per cent against the federal structure of the country. Instead of turning against the ED, it should have co-operated with the ongoing investigation to unravel the truth,” he said.Singh’s statement comes days after the party’s national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah, while campaigning in Assam and West Bengal respectively, asserted that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, passed by the Parliament, would be implemented in time.But Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reiterated that the CAA will not be implemented in the state. Addressing an election rally in Purameri in Kozhikode district, Vijayan said Singh’s statement was a challenge to the minority community. “We have already stated that the CAA will not be implemented in Kerala. The Union ministers are saying that the CAA will be implemented. But we are firm on our stand,” he said.State BJP leaders, however, brushed the CM’s criticism saying the CAA was not at all an issue in Kerala. “In Kerala, there are no migrants from other countries. He is raising a non-issue just for some votes,” said BJP state chief K Surendran, who is contesting from two seats - Konni in Pathanamthitta and Mancheswarmm in north Kerala.The CM also attacked the Sangh Parivar outfits over the alleged incidents in some north Indian states targeting minorities. He said Muslims and Christians were targeted by the rightwing for practising their religious faith. He cited the recent attack on a group of Christian nuns during a train journey in Uttar Pradesh last week. “Such intolerance will not happen in Kerala,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/war-of-words-as-ruling-cpi-m-bjp-spar-over-caa-in-kerala-101616950363528.html

28-03-2021||India||Sex scandal: BJP govt pledging the pride of Karnataka, says Siddaramaiah||Continuing his tirade against the BJP government in Karnataka over the sex scandal allegedly involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah on Sunday accused it of pledging the pride of the state in front of the whole country. The Congress leader in a series of tweets said it is 'shameful' that the police could not trace the "CD victim" (the woman in the purported sex video) even after 20 days. "The CD case is turning into a political blame game with new developments each day. It can reach a logical conclusion only when the victim reaches out to police and gives her version," Siddaramaiah said. Averring that the victim in the CD was constantly releasing her statements to the media through videos, reaching out to her parents and interacting with her lawyers, he said, "but the police are unable to track her. What does this mean? Is the police playing to the tune of the BJP government?" The videos released by the victim clearly show that the girl does not repose confidence in both the state government and the police department. It looks like she is of the opinion that police are involved in conspiracy against her, he said adding Home Minister Basvaraj Bommai should address this concern. Reacting to Siddaramaiah's statement, Bommai said political leaders belonging to any party should not try to bring down the morale of the police. Accusing Siddaramaiah of hushing up the sex scandal, involving former minister H Y Meti, while Congress government led by him was in power, he said we have not done such a thing, we are transparent. "Let whoever say what they want, I'm confident that our police are honestly investigating the case as per the procedures and will bring out the truth," he said. Meanwhile, Congress workers held a protest in the city against Jarkiholi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sex-scandal-bjp-govt-pledging-the-pride-of-karnataka-says-siddaramaiah-101616939365439.html

He was almost dragged out and was not shown any papers. He was unwell. Even his security guards were not allowed to come near him,” Niyati Mahato, his wife, told HT.Mahato has served a 10-year sentence after being arrested in an undercover operation in 2009 and was subsequently charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). He was released under parole in February this year after serving 11 years behind bars, since then he has been actively campaigning for the TMC in Lalgarh. Calcutta High Court had granted Mahato and eight other activists the status of a political prisoner in 2012, and a few months later had convicted him under the UAPA.The high court on Thursday asked Mahato to appear at NIA’s office thrice a week for his alleged role in the murder case. The court cautioned that if he fails to do so the agency can be directed to take him into custody. Mahato had failed to appear before the special NIA court a number of times.Mahato led the PCPA movement in Lalgarh, which witnessed bloodshed as many CPI(M) party workers and leaders were killed in retaliation against the state government led by the Left party. One such leader was Prabir Mahato, who was allegedly killed by PCPA in Lalgarh’s Dharampur village in June of 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leader-chhatradhar-mahato-remanded-to-2-day-nia-custody-101616938445627.html

Shah also said that the BJP will easily win more than 200 seats in the West Bengal assembly and based his claim on 'clear indicators' and feedback received from the ground after the first phase of polling was conducted a day before.Watch | How many seats is BJP winning in 1st phase in Bengal, Assam? Amit Shah predicts"In the first phase, the BJP is winning more than 26 out of 30 seats in Bengal. The margin of seats is also increasing. We have also got clear indications that the party will win more than 37 seats out of 47 seats in Assam," he claimed.Click here for full election coverage"I believe that after winning 26 seats in the first phase in Bengal, it will be very easy for us to win over 200 seats overall. The party workers and I have full faith in this," he added.Thanking the people of both the states for turning up in large numbers, he said more than 84 per cent turnout in West Bengal and over 79 per cent in Assam shows that there is huge enthusiasm among the public."The development that has taken place in Assam under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the way our government has ensured unprecedented development is getting huge public support. The concept of 'double engine government' has been understood by the people of Assam by the conduct of the BJP," he said.In West Bengal, however, there has been an atmosphere of utter despair, he added. "After 27 years of communist rule, the people of Bengal hoped that Didi (Mamata Banerjee) would bring about a new beginning. But only the sign and name of the party were changed, not the situation of Bengal,” the senior BJP leader said.He also congratulated the Election Commission of India (ECI) for conducting the first phase of polling peacefully and credited them for bringing about a positive change as both Assam and Bengal are often in the news for violence during elections. The voting process in Bengal was completed without any deaths, bombings, and re-voting after many years, he said."Assam was known for electoral violence a few years ago and Bengal too. This time the polling has been peaceful in both places and not a single death was reported due to poll-related violence. These are auspicious signs for both the states," he said.The seven remaining phases will be held between April 1 and April 29 in West Bengal. Polling for the next two phases in Assam will be held on April 1 and April 6. Votes will be counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-easily-win-over-200-seats-in-west-bengal-claims-amit-shah-101616925068510.html
28-03-2021||India||To Raut’s ‘accidental home minister’ remark on Deshmukh, Nawab Malik’s defence||Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Sunday defended his colleague Anil Deshmukh, who is facing allegations of corruption by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh, after the Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut called him ‘an accidental home minister’. “Anil Deshmukh is not an accidental home minister. If shortcomings have been brought forward in an editorial (Saamana), then they should be taken in a positive manner. I think the home minister will work towards overcoming those shortcomings,” Malik said according to news agency ANI.Also read | In Mumbai, an explosive scare, a murder, and now – a political crisisThe remarks by Malik, a senior leader of the Nationalist Congress Party—one of the three constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the western state—came after Raut said Deshmukh ‘got the home minister's post by accident’. "Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil refused to take responsibility. That is why Sharad Pawar selected Anil Deshmukh for the post," Raut wrote in his weekly column.Also read | Whose favourite was Vaze, asks Raut, calls Deshmukh 'accidental' home ministerRaut also wrote in his weekly column Rokhthok in his party’s mouthpiece Saamana that the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra did not have damage control machinery as was seen after former Mumbai Police chief Singh claimed that Deshmukh asked police officers to collect money and he had set a target of  ₹100 crore for Sachin Vaze, now the main accused in the Antilia bomb scare as well as businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death case. "If a junior officer like Sachin Waze was running a (money) collection racket from the Mumbai police commissioner's office, why was the home minister not aware of it?" Raut said in his column according to news agency PTI. "Waze was a mere API in Mumbai police. Who gave him so much powers? Whose favourite was he? All this should come out," Raut wrote.Also watch | 'My state is getting a bad name': Supriya Sule on Anil Deshmukh controversyMalik also handled Raut’s comments about the police department. “There should have been strictness in handling the department (police) as some officers were acting as per their own will,” Malik was quoted as sayin by ANI.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has decided to conduct a probe into the allegations levelled by Singh against home minister Deshmukh and the state government has begun the process to form a judicial commission to be headed by a retired judge, senior leaders of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government familiar with the developments said.Deshmukh also on Sunday said as much. "The chief minister and the state government have decided that a retired judge of the high court will conduct a probe into the allegations against me. Whatever is the truth will come out," he told reporters at the Nagpur airport.Singh in a letter to CM Thackeray on March 20 claimed that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect ₹100 crore monthly from bars and hotels, a charge denied by the home minister. The state government, under fire over handling of the bomb scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai, on March 17 transferred Singh from the post of city police commissioner to the low-key home guard department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-raut-s-accidental-home-minister-remark-on-deshmukh-nawab-malik-s-defence-101616924990453.html

28-03-2021||India||Majority want Govt to ban flights from UK, S. Africa amid rise in cases: Report||As many as two-thirds of the people want the government to suspend flights from the UK and South Africa amid a near sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country in the recent weeks, according to a survey.At the same time, another 43 per cent of the people covered under the survey, conducted by online platform LocalCircles, were in favour of suspending all international air services to contain the 'second wave' of the pandemic, it said.The survey findings are based on the responses received from over 8,800 citizens from across 244 districts in the country, as per a statement.Scheduled international operations remain suspended since late March last year. Amid this, special international flights have been allowed under the Vande Bharat Mission since May last year and under bilateral "air bubble" arrangements with select countries since July.Direct lineage of SARS-COV2 variants, especially the UK and South African variants, has been detected in different parts of the country amid an upward trajectory in the number of active Covid-19 cases in the country, with over 60,000 cases now being reported daily, LocalCircles said.This is a five-fold increase in the daily case load in 45 days which were about 12,000 on February 12 this year, it added.It is estimated that the UK variant has spread to over 70 countries, while South African variant is in more than 30 countries, said the statement. In the wake of this, LocalCircles asked citizens if any restrictions on international flights should now be implemented via a survey, it added."Sixty-five per cent of the citizens (are) still in favour of suspending arrivals of passengers from the UK and South Africa to limit coronavirus variants, (while) 43 per cent (are) in favour of suspending all international arrivals for a month," LocalCircles said in the statement with survey findings.There were also 32 per cent of the citizens who said "suspending flights is not the solution", while 3 per cent did not have an answer, it said.According to many citizens, the damage has already been done and the variants are at different stages in India primarily due to all the international arrivals in the last three months. However, at least shutting flights now will not bring in new infections and new strains, LocalCircles said.In fact, the platform had in late December, based on public feedback, escalated to the government the risk of mutant coronavirus, urging that all flights from the UK and other high-risk countries be shut till the end of January. In the survey, at that time, 64 per cent of citizens wanted bubble international flights shut with countries, particularly the UK, having cases of the new strain.The same was done. However, the UK flight shutdown was resumed from January 8 after keeping them on hold for about two weeks, LocalCircles said.With limited capacity to do genome testing, some 10,787 samples from 18 Indian states have shown so far 771 cases (736 of UK variant, 34 South African variant, and 1 Brazilian variant), according to the statement.It said Punjab Chief Minister Amrinder Singh has announced that 81 per cent of the cases found in his state based on genome testing are of the UK variant type. Punjab has direct flights between the UK and Amritsar that have been running as part of the Vande Bharat programme. it added."It is not just Punjab that has identified the existence of B.1.1.7 in 18 states. Maharashtra is seeking the highest-ever surges with 35,000 case per day; and in Delhi, the daily caseload has tripled from 500 to 1,500 in a matter of five days," LocalCircles said.According to the platform, as many as 60 per cent citizens in a related survey felt that this new surge is driven by variants. "While the government has not accepted that yet, it is known that the B.1.1.7 is 50-60 per cent more transmissible than the original Covid-19 strain. The strain has also impacted the young much more than the previous Covid-19 strain," it said.Though there will be no vaccine for the young at least till the end of this year, India has crossed six crore inoculations of adults and is vaccinating between 20-30 lakh citizens daily, as per the release.However, it will be the end of 2022 before the entire citizens in the country can be vaccinated, and "that is why this second wave of Covid-19 is extremely worrying to many", it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/majority-want-govt-to-ban-flights-from-uk-s-africa-amid-rise-in-cases-report-101616923497881.html

Around 800 of these areas have been added in the past few days, according to government data on March 27. The South district has 416 containment zones, the highest in the Capital, followed by the North, which has 189 red zones.Though these are called containment zones, these are actually individual houses which are being sealed after Covid-19 cases are being reported, explaining why the number is so high. The New Delhi district has 129 actively sealed buildings or containment zones, the North-West district has 126, South West 84, West 181, South East 164, Shahdara 37, East 43, North East 35 and Central 34.‘Lockdown not a solution’, says Delhi health minister as Covid-19 cases soarBuildings that have been added to the list in the last few days are in Seelampur, Karawal Nagar, Yamuna Vihar, Tilak Nagar, West Punjabi Bagh, East Patel Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar, Rohini, Greater Kailash, Chittaranjan Park, Sarita Vihar, Lajpat Nagar among other places.Strengthening the containment measures comes after the health ministry pointed out that state and district authorities have become lax in identifying areas where cases are increasing and imposing restrictions on them.Since March 25, Delhi has been reporting over 1,500 fresh infections daily. On Saturday, the Capital logged 1,558 new infections, which was the highest number of daily cases since December last year.However, the rise in the number of cases won't translate into any lockdown, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain has confirmed on Saturday.

Authorities kept on extending the lockdown, but the virus did not die.

The people of Gurdum village in Darjeeling have taken up honey bee farming and today there is a significant demand for honey harvested by them. This is also increasing their income. They're helping in Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) campaign," said PM Modi.The Prime Minister's comments came amid an ongoing protest against the three central farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year. The protest, launched by farmers primarily from Punjab and Haryana, has been going on for four months. The protesters want the government to repeal the three laws.The Centre, meanwhile, has said that these laws are historic and will help the farming community in a major way. PM Modi too appealed to the farmers to end their protest, but the impasse is continuing.The government has given an assurance that the farm laws will be suspended for 18 months, but has rules out scrapping it. The Centre has held a series of talks with the protesters but they have refused to budget from their demand.Many opposition parties have supported the protests, saying that the three laws will benefit a few corporate house and demanding that they should be scrapped. the government, however, accuse the opposition parties of misleading the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modernisation-in-agriculture-need-of-the-hour-have-lost-a-lot-of-time-pm-101616913270183.html

This is to subvert the current investigation."He further said, "The decision to conduct a judicial inquiry against the central agencies investigating gold smuggling and dollar smuggling cases involving the Chief Minister and the Speaker is not correct, it is a farce."The leader said it is a strange move and will not last for long. Hassan also alleged that when the inquiry was extended, the chief minister, speaker and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) party made a tie-up with the BJP at the national level."The government is playing the role of a confrontation with the central agencies. This is a drama. The chief minister is trying to dress up like a gentleman," he further added.The Kerala Cabinet on Friday recommended a judicial probe against central investigation agencies subject to approval from the Election Commission, following an ongoing probe into several cases, including the Kerala gold smuggling case.The decision was taken at a virtual cabinet meeting here chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.The Cabinet has appointed Retired Judge KV Mohanan as the Commissioner. He will consider the controversial audio recording of Swapna Suresh, the prime accused in the gold smuggling case, and a letter written by co-accused PS Sarith.The Kerala gold smuggling case, which is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA,) along with the Enforcement Directorate and the customs department, pertains to the smuggling of gold in the state through diplomatic channels.The matter had come to light after 30-kilogram gold worth ₹14.82 crores, smuggled in a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic baggage, was busted by customs in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5 last year.The customs department had also arrested Unitac Builders MD Santhosh Eappen also in a US Dollar smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-ordering-probe-against-central-investigation-agencies-shows-his-fear-mm-hassan-101616909760131.html

He underwent treatment at a hospital in Hyderabad and was discharged last month.He returned to Kadapa and took active part in the recent municipal elections in his home constituency Badwel. However, his condition worsened a couple of days ago and was admitted to a private hospital in Kadapa, where he breathed his last on Sunday morning, while undergoing treatment.Subbaiah completed his masters in surgery in Orthopaedics at Sri Venkateswara Medical College, Tirupati, in 1996 and had been practising as an orthopaedic surgeon in Kadapa.In 2016, he entered politics by joining the YSRCP. He worked as party coordinator of Badwel from 2016 to 2019.

28-03-2021||India||NIA arrests TMC leader Chhatradhar Mahato in murder case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Trinamool Congress leader Chhatradhar Mahato on Sunday in connection with the murder of a local CP I(M) leader in 2009 at Lalgarh in the Jangalmahal region.“He was arrested around 3 am when a team of officials almost broke the door and barged into the house. He was almost dragged out and was not shown any papers. He was unwell. Even his security guards were not allowed to come near him,” Niyati Mahato, Chhatradhar’s wife, told the media.Mahato was the poster boy of the Maoist-backed tribal-movement in Lalgarh that drew national attention during 2008-2011 and had been recently inducted into the TMC.Earlier on Thursday, the Calcutta high court had directed Mahato, the former leader of Maoist-backed People’’s Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), to appear at the NIA office here thrice a week for alleged involvement in the murder case.The court had further said that if there is any breach of its direction, the NIA can bring it to the notice of a lower court, which, if it deems fit, will thereupon record it and permit the agency to take him into custody.Earlier Mahato had failed to appear before the special NIA court on a number of occasions citing various reasons.“I am not going into the merit of the case. But the timing of the arrest is questionable. He was arrested in connection with a decade-old case during assembly elections,” Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson said after Mahato’s arrest.Mahato, who was recently inducted into the TMC, was given the responsibility of at least 10 constituencies in three districts ahead of the polls. Voting took place on Saturday in 30 seats, including those in Jangalmahal, once a Maoist hotbed, in the first phase of the assembly election.In February 2020, he was released from jail after 10 years. He was one of the accused in an abortive attempt to blow up former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s convoy in November 2008, and was arrested in September 2009.In March 2020, however, the NIA reopened a murder case in which Mahato was one of the accused. He was arrested on Sunday, a TMC leader confirmed. The NIA is yet to issue any statement in this regard“Mahato was released from jail and has been arrested again on court orders. How can there be any politics in it?” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP’s spokesperson in West Bengal.Soon after his release from jail in February 2020, Mahatao had started hobnobbing with the TMC leaders. A few months later, TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee inducted him into the party and made him one of the secretaries of the party’s state committee.Political analysts had then said that the move was a part of the effort by TMC to regain votes lost to the BJP not only in Mahato’s native district of Jhargram but also in neighbouring areas of Purulia, West Midnapore and Bankura districts that share historical, geographic and demographic similarities.The BJP had made deep inroads in these areas in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and had won all five Lok Sabha seats in the Jangalmahal area. The party had won 18 of the 42 seats in the state in 2019 and is now targeting to win more than 200 seats out of the 294 assembly seats in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-tmc-leader-chhatradhar-mahato-in-murder-case-101616907281754.html

28-03-2021||India||Husband of BSP MLA in MP arrested in murder case after absconding for 80 days||BSP MLA Rambai’s husband Govind Singh, who was absconding for the past 80 days in a murder case of a local Congress leader, was arrested early Sunday by Special Task Force of Madhya Pradesh, director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johari said. “Govind Singh was arrested from a bus stand in Bhind. He was coming from Delhi. He will be produced in a court in Damoh today,” Johari said.Rambai released two videos in the morning in which Govind Singh was seen saying that he was going to surrender to the police in Bhind. In the video, Govind Singh is seen as saying that he is innocent and a high level inquiry should be conducted into the case. The Madhya Pradesh police had earlier announced a cash reward of ₹50,000 for the arrest of Govind Singh in connection with the murder of a local Congress leader Devendra Chaurasiya of Hata town of Damoh district. The Supreme Court pulled up the state government twice and has given time to arrest Singh by April 5 at a hearing on March 26.Earlier, the apex court reprimanded the state government for poor law and order situation in the state after additional session judge RP Sonkar, who is conducting the trial in the murder case, alleged the police were supporting Govind Singh and maligning his image by making false accusations. The Supreme Court also asked DGP to hold an inquiry in the matter.Following the reprimand by the top court, additional director general of police, special task force (STF) Vipin Maheshwari reached Damoh to lead the search operation. As many as 15 teams were trying to locate him.Govind Singh and four others are accused of killing Chaurasia in front of his son in March 2019. Criminal charges were earlier dropped against Govind Singh after a police investigation in August 2019 while the four others were arrested the same month. He was again named accused in January this year on the orders of additional session judge Sonkar who also issued an arrest warrant against Govind Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/husband-of-bsp-mla-in-mp-arrested-in-murder-case-after-absconding-for-80-days-101616903561670.html

Police said the incident took place on Friday night in Taalnar village of Bijapur district. Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Bijapur, Pankaj Shukla said that Budharam Kashyap , member of Bijapur zila panchayat and was associated with Congress party, was at his house on Friday night when a group of Maoists came to his house and dragged him into the jungle. “Around 15-20 Maoists who were waiting inside the jungle hacked him to death. They also left Maoist pamphlets and alleged the Kashyap was helping district police and was an informer,” Shukla said. Security forces launched a combing operation in the area to nab the killers. “The police brought the body for postmortem on Saturday and investigation is continuing,” the ASP added. Last year, 10 people including six civilians were killed in Bijapur between September and October.On Thursday, Maoists set ablaze at least 12 vehicles engaged in road construction work in Kondagaon of Bastar region in Chhattisgarh. Police said that the incident took place in Kuemari village under Dhanora police station limits where a road is being built between Batrali and Cherbeda under the Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY).

28-03-2021||India||Ramesh Jarkiholi claims Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar behind sex tape||Former Karnataka minister Ramesh Jarkiholi on Saturday blamed Congress president in the state, DK Shivakumar as the person behind the alleged sex scandal that forced him to resign earlier this month and said that he would file a complaint.Jarkiholi made the statement soon after the family of the woman who allegedly featured in the tape, told reporters that releasing the sex tape was Shivakumar’s handiwork.“There isn’t any politician who is worse than DK Shivakumar. He’s criminal-minded. I have 11 pieces of evidence that I will hand over to the SIT. He is unfit for politics. No one should indulge in such conspiracy politics. There’s no forgiving him for this. It’s best if he retires,” Jarkiholi said. Shivakumar brushed aside Jarkiholi’s allegations but acknowledged that the woman might have tried to meet him during his interactions with the public. “We are in public life and being a politician thousands of people come to meet me every day near my house, my office and wherever I go. Even the lady in the CD might have tried to meet me but I am not aware of it,” he said. “I got nothing to do with Ramesh Jarkiholi allegations. I don’t know why they have taken my name in the conversation. The lady in the CD might have tried to meet me to convey her personal problem but she did not meet me. She might have met other people for her safety,” he said. Jarkiholi’s accusations against Shivakumar came after the woman’s brother said the Congress leader was sending his sister safely out of the state.“We have spoken to SIT officials and given our statement to them. We have an audio clipping of our sister and the same has been given to SIT officials. During the conversation, my sister had told us that she is at DK Shivakumar’s house and he is sending her away from the state safely. Making such videos, keeping a woman to take their political revenge is not the right thing,” the woman’s brother told reporters in Bengaluru on Saturday, after recording the statement before Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the sex tape. The phone conversation took place on March 2. Her father said using a Scheduled Tribe woman for political ends was unfair.”We want our daughter back home. She had come home last on February 5, but after March 2, she spoke to us over the phone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramesh-jarkiholi-claims-karnataka-congress-chief-dk-shivakumar-behind-sex-tape-101616900081204.html

We are planning to increase our vaccination to 2 lakh shots a day and complete the target before the weather becomes severe,” Mohapatra said in his letter.Also read | Over 59.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in India, says governmentEarlier this week, the Centre announced the expansion of vaccine coverage to include people over 45 years of age, irrespective of comorbidities.

28-03-2021||India||Heavy turnout in Phase 1 of Assam, Bengal polls||People in West Bengal and Assam voted in the first phase of state assembly elections on Saturday, turning out in impressive numbers – 79.79% and 76.89%, respectively – in polls that will determine if the Trinamool Congress can stand up to the challenge by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is also trying to retain power in the Assam.While the BJP has emerged as the primary challenger in West Bengal, where it won 18 of the 42 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in Assam, a coalition of the Congress and Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) is fighting against the Sarbananda Sonowal-led government.Sporadic incidents of violence were reported from various places in West Bengal but the overall situation was largely peaceful, with 79.79% turnout recorded till 5pm, according to the Election Commission.Also read | CM Banerjee says ‘scrap PM’s visa’ after Modi’s Matua temple visit in BangladeshVoting was held in 30 seats – several of them part of the once Maoist-hit Jangalmahal region – amid tight security and strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines, the official added.In Assam, the fates of many heavyweights including chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal were sealed in electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the first phase of polling. Till 9pm, 76.89% polling was recorded. The figure was expected to increase slightly after the final compilation of votes.The outcome in the elections in the eastern states will indicate if the BJP’s hegemony remains intact despite governance challenges in recent months, including due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The turnout (in Bengal) is expected to cross 80%,” a senior poll panel official said, asking not to be named.At Salboni in Jhargram, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidate was heckled allegedly by Trinamool Congress supporters and his car was attacked. While four people were arrested, the Election Commission has asked for a report on the incident.At Kanthi Dakshin, the car of Soumendu Adhikari, who is BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari’s brother, was also damaged. At Garbetta in West Midnapore, at least 12 BJP supporters were injured in an alleged clash with TMC supporters.Also read | EVMs make news in first phase of polling in Bengal; TMC alleges hacking“The poll panel has asked for detailed reports on violent incidents. At least 10 persons were arrested,” the poll panel official said.Another official said that about 100 EVMs malfunctioned during the day. “Non-functioning rate during the poll is lesser than experienced in last few polls,” an EC statement said without elaborating.In the last assembly polls held in 2016, the TMC won 27 out of the 30 seats that went to the polls on Saturday.“People have voted for us. The BJP in some cases tried to incite people, influence voters and create problems. There were some reports of EVM malfunction. We alerted the ECI,” said TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.The BJP’s state vice president Jay Prakash Majumdar said: “The TMC is still the ruling party but the allegations they have raised today against the BJP are such that it appears that the BJP is in power. They have damaged our cars. It is a sign of frustration. The TMC is showing signs of defeat.”The battle for the state also spilled over to social media. In a recording of a conversation circulated online by the BJP, it alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee had called a BJP district leader to seek help get votes for the state’s ruling party in Nandigram, the constituency she is contesting from. The Trinamool Congress, too, released a recording of a purported conversation between BJP’s national vice president Mukul Roy and another party leader Sisir Bajoria, and alleged that the BJP was trying to influence the Election Commission.Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is banking on her decision to create welfare boards for tribal communities such as the Santhals, Lodhas and Kurmis, and development projects, including new roads, hospitals and schools. But the BJP, which did well in this region in the 2019 polls by winning five Lok Sabha seats, is banking on acute deprivation as well as tribal discontent against the TMC.In Assam, voting was largely peaceful in all 47 seats in 11 districts in the first phase. In Sonari district, a polling officer died due to cardiac arrest. There were reports of a few EVMs malfunctioning, but they were replaced soon, an official said.Also read | On day 1 of Bengal polls, BJP's Soumendu Adhikari says attacked by TMC workers“All our candidates will win. The voters are happy with the performance of the government of BJP and its allies in the past five years. Our aim is to form a BJP government again in Assam,” Sonowal said after voting at a polling booth in his home constituency in Dibrugarh district.“The Congress and other parties are seen only in the media, but the BJP and its allies are working on the ground. People of Assam know that CAA and NRC won’t affect them,” Sonowal was quoted as saying by ANI.Assam witnessed violent protests in December 2019 against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which seeks to provide citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.The updated National Register of Citizens, which seeks to identify illegal immigrants, was released in August 2019 and left out 1.9 million applicants. The list is yet to be notified and the process of re-verification of those left out is yet to begin. The BJP has dubbed the list as faulty and has promised a corrected NRC, if voted to power again.Considered a traditional Congress bastion in the past, in recent years, the BJP has been able to make inroads in the tea-tribe community with the promise of scheduled tribe (ST) status, welfare schemes for women, students, young people and development projects.Almost all seats in the first phase fall in the tea-rich Upper Assam belt and their outcomes are expected to be crucial for both the BJP-led ruling alliance and the opposition Congress’s grand alliance of seven parties.“The high voter turnout shows the mood of the voters that want change. We are confident of getting majority and forming a Congress-led government in the state,” state Congress chief Ripun Bora said.While the BJP is contesting in 39 of the 47 seats in the first phase, its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) is contesting in 10 seats (there was a “friendly contest” between the allies in two seats). On the other, the Congress was contesting in 43 seats and the newly formed Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) in 41 seats.Voting in West Bengal takes place in eight phases, ending on April 29, and the votes will be counted on May 2. Assam’s second phase is on April 1 and the third and final phase of voting is on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-turnout-in-phase-1-of-assam-bengal-polls-101616877465127.html
28-03-2021||India||No infiltration attempts reported from LoC along North Kashmir in last 3 months||Even as the melting of snow has started, no infiltration attempts have been reported along the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir in the last three months, officials privy to the information stated.Militants usually sneak into the Valley via north Kashmir’s Gulmarg, Uri, Nowgam Tanghdar Keran and Gurez axis and the first attempts are usually made in late January or early February.A senior official, privy to details about infiltration, said, “We have not received any information about any group infiltrating into the Valley via Gulmarg or Uri sectors in the last couple of months. Though some places are still covered with snow, we don’t have any input about infiltration attempts.”Last year too, there was a marked decrease in infiltration attempts, with 99 such incidents being recorded in 2020 as compared to 216 in 2019. In 2019, only 138 such bids by militants had been successful. Likewise in 2018, official figures reveal, 143 militants infiltrated during 328 attempts and most attempts had been foiled. In 2017, there were 419 attempts of infiltration in J&K.A senior JK police officer, posted in one of the border districts, said they have not received any report from the Army about infiltration attempts made by the militants on the LoC. “They haven’t detected any such attempts so far. The situation is peaceful as of now,” the officer said.The officer, however, said the exact situation would be clear when the snow will melt. “It is very difficult to predict anything. But we are hopeful the situation remains like this only. Post ceasefire, the borders are silent now.”For example, in the Gurez sector of North Kashmir’s Bandipore, Nowgam and Keran, snow is still present at many places. “Usually, the infiltration attempts increase in April, when the snow melts. We are keeping a close watch,” the officer said.Last month, India and Pakistan agreed to observe a strict ceasefire along the LoC from February 24 midnight. Till date, security officials also maintain that no ceasefire has been reported and the situation on the LoC is peaceful at present.The defense spokesperson said that he has already sought information on the situation along the LoC, especially with regards to infiltration.In J&K, the LoC is guarded by the Army and at many places, the Border Security Force also keep a watch on the movements along with Police who keep on gathering inputs about fresh infiltration bids. A senior army officer said that though the LoC is calm at present, they are keeping a close watch on the LoC and the work on repairing the fences, which had been damaged in winters, will start shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-infiltration-attempts-reported-from-loc-along-north-kashmir-in-last-3-months-101616875785259.html

The rights activists say they have been implicated in a false case and now it has been handed over to the NIA for further harassment.VS Krishna, Human Rights Forum (HRF) coordinator for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, has been speaking against Andhra’s anti-Naxal force – the Greyhounds – for allegedly raping 11 tribal women in 2007 in the Vakapalli incident. Andhra Pradesh State Civil Liberties Committee (CLC) general secretary Chilika Chandrasekhar (59) and Duddu Prabhakar (a prominent Dalit activist) had in 2018 condemned the arrest of Gautam Navlakha, Varavara Rao, Sudha Bhardwaj, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves and other activists in the Bhima-Koregaon case.Also read | NGT panel finds damage to 30% mangroves in Andhra’s KakinadaDuddu Prabhakar is currently in jail along with seven others after being arrested by Andhra Pradesh police a few months ago. In all, two cases were registered against the activists by the cops last year. The NIA has taken over the November 23 case for now.The allegation against Krishna, according to the Andhra Pradesh police First Information Report (FIR), is that he was influencing the Vakapalli rape survivors to falsely depose against police officers.After taking over the Andhra Pradesh police FIR, the NIA has invoked stringent sections, including those under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), sedition, criminal conspiracy and the Arms Act against the 64 accused.The case was originally registered on November 23 last year after the arrest of a TV journalist from Visakhapatnam, Pangi Naganna (30), by the cops. It is alleged that Naganna worked as a courier for Maoists and had been passing information to the ultras inside the jungle about police movements and as instructed by Maoist leaders he was involved in instigating villagers to stop the forces from combing operations, obstruct police from entering villages, revolt against police parties and hold rallies against the government. Revolutionary Maoist literature, press notes, medicines, wire bundles and other incriminating material was said to have been recovered from his bag at the time of arrest.During his interrogation, Naganna said he facilitated meetings between Maoists and civil society organisations, according to police officials.It was on the basis of Naganna’s confession that the state police had named VS Krishna as well as Akkiraju Haragopal – a senior Central Committee member of the CPI (Maoist). The state police had further alleged that Krishna had assured Haragopal of spreading Maoist ideology in urban areas. Haragopal too is named as an accused in NIA case.It is further alleged that Chilika Chandrasekhar also met Maoists, according to Naganna’s confession.NIA officials cited above said they will question all activists to unearth their Maoist links.Also read | PM Modi wraps up Bangladesh visit, calls for greater bilateral cooperationHRF (on behalf of VS Krishna) said in a statement: “HRF along with many Adivasi, women’s, and mass organisations were active participants since 2007 seeking justice for the 11 Vakapalli women who were raped by special forces personnel. It is because of this solidarity and sustained rights activism that the police are now seeking to intimidate VS Krishna in what we believe to be a clear case of vindictiveness. They have gone to the extent of invoking the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act which is a draconian legislation that mocks at fundamental freedoms. Such a law should have no place in a democracy.”Chilika Chandrasekhar said: “I have been working as a civil rights activist since 1987. Never have I come across such a case in my career. For four decades, we have been interfering in state’s violence and working as voice of the voiceless. Why is state going after us? Invoking such draconian law is the way of curtailing civil liberties activities.”In the Bhima-Koregaon case, the NIA had filed a charge sheet in October last year naming activists Gautam Navlakha, Dr Anand Teltumbde, Professor Hany Babu MT, Father Stan Swamy, among others, alleging that the accused were part of Maoists’ frontal networks to increase their influence.Kavita Srivastava from the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) said: “Human rights activists are being deliberately targeted and silenced in this country. Firstly, the FIR filed on the basis of fabricated allegations was uncalled for, and now the NIA taking over the case is really sinister. That’s not acceptable. We all know what NIA has done in Bhima-Koregaon case. PUCL demands that this FIR should be quashed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-takes-over-andhra-probe-against-activists-101616874892326.html
28-03-2021||India||BJP will get clear majority in Bengal, NDA will retain Assam: Rajnath Singh||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said that high voter turnout and emerging trends indicate that BJP will get a clear majority in West Bengal and NDA will again succeed in Assam with BJP getting more seats."High voter turnout in the first phase of West Bengal elections makes it clear that BJP is going to achieve great success in each phase of polls. The trends show that BJP will form the government with a clear majority," Rajnath Singh told ANI.Thirty seats in West Bengal and 47 seats in Assam went to the polls on Saturday in the first phase of assembly elections in the two states. Assam recorded 77 per cent voter turnout in the first phase while West Bengal recorded nearly 80 per cent polling.Singh said people are coming in larger numbers to vote due to preparations made by the Election Commission. He alleged that the ruling Trinamool Congress had earlier created "a reign of terror" among the voters."The way in which the voting percentage has increased in the first phase shows that the BJP did well. Earlier, there was a reign of terror created by TMC. Because of the preparation made by the ECI, people have now gathered the courage to come out and vote," he said.Referring to Assam, he said there is no major challenge for the BJP and the party-led government has a track record of performance."Our government has a splendid track record on development and good governance. I believe that the seats of BJP will increase and NDA will succeed in this election in Assam."On Kerala, which will go to the polls on April 6, he said BJP's vote percentage and seats will increase."BJP has emerged as an alternative in the state. Our number of seats will also increase in this election in Kerala," he said.Singh rejected allegations of opposition that BJP was pursuing divisive politics."BJP never does politics by dividing society. Our politics is not based on caste, creed and religion. We do politics of justice and humanity. On the contrary, LDF, UDF, TMC and Congress have done the politics by dividing society," he said.The results of assembly polls will be declared on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-get-clear-majority-in-bengal-nda-will-retain-assam-rajnath-singh-101616871733240.html
28-03-2021||India||After Ladakh standoff, IAF defers mega drill to conserve flying hours||A crucial air exercise involving almost 200 aircraft will not be conducted this year in the backdrop of the Indian Air Force’s high-tempo operations in the Ladakh sector, where IAF has been on its highest state of alert for several months owing to border tensions with China, officials familiar with the developments said on Saturday.IAF’s biggest exercise Iron Fist, held every three years to showcase India’s air power, was supposed to be held at Rajasthan’s Pokhran test facility this month but it has been removed from the air force’s training schedule for the current year, Hindustan Times has learnt.Also read | PM Modi wraps up Bangladesh visit, calls for greater bilateral cooperationThe decision to put off the exercise to possibly next year was guided by the need “to conserve flying hours and equipment” considering the IAF’s continuous deployment in the Ladakh theatre after border tensions with China began last May, said a senior officer, asking not to be named.“Iron Fist is an important exercise that allows us to showcase what IAF is capable of. It’s not being held this year as IAF has had a really busy year in Ladakh,” said a second officer.A total of 181 aircraft, including 103 fighter planes, took part in the last edition of Iron Fist in 2016 that saw 572 rockets, 81 bombs and nine missiles being fired, including the indigenous Astra beyond-visual-range missile and the Akash missile.The traditional firepower demonstration — Iron Fist — used to be an occasion to give a heavy dose of armament training to a large cross-section of air and ground crews, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“It was also to demonstrate military aviation prowess to the countrymen. This year, the IAF has been on operational stations at Ladakh and elsewhere, and was also closely involved with Aero India in Yelahanka. Therefore, they are not holding the demonstration for good reason,” Chopra said.The maiden edition of Iron Fist was held in 2013. It was not held in 2019 as IAF carried out the Gaganshakti exercise in 2018 to test its readiness and stamina for a two-front war with China and Pakistan.Watch | Indian soldiers dance in Ladakh near Chinese tension site﻿IAF is projecting its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the Ladakh sector, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers deployed there. IAF also deployed its new Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region.The air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the platforms that have operated in the Ladakh sector.IAF’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft were used to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to the sector when border tensions peaked last year, while C-130J Super Hercules aircraft have undertaken sorties to the advanced landing ground in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector to support the military’s forward deployments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-ladakh-standoff-iaf-defers-mega-drill-to-conserve-flying-hours-101616871578735.html
28-03-2021||India||BJP leaders get relief in Muzaffarnagar riots case||A special court in Uttar Pradesh has accepted the state government’s request to withdraw a case of inciting violence against at least 30 people, including Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Suresh Rana, Sangeet Som and Umesh Malik, in connection with the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots case.Muzaffarnagar’s additional district government counsel (ADGC), Lalit Bhardwaj, said the state requested the withdrawal of the case. The three BJP leaders along with former MP Kunwar Bhartendra Singh and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Sadhvi Prachi, were accused of giving inflammatory speeches during a panchayat in Nangla Mandaud village, triggering communal violence in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts. At least 60 people, a majority of them Muslims, were killed and over 50,000 displaced during the riots.Bhardwaj said the state government sent a letter requesting the withdrawal of the case last year and the then ADGC, Subhash Saini, also filed an application in the special court under the Criminal Procedure Code’s Section 321 (withdrawal from prosecution).“It [the request] was pending for over a year and finally the court approved it on Thursday,” said Bhardwaj.Hailing the court decision, the BJP’s Muzaffarnagar district president Vijay Shukla said: “Fake case were registered against party leaders during the rule of Samajwadi Party [SP] government. We appreciate the court’s decision.”SP leader Sudhir Panwar said: “Withdrawal of such heinous cases would send a wrong message in the society. It’s a dangerous precedent being set up as BJP leaders can again try to polarise the society without any accountability of their leaders”, SP leader and former member of the state planning commission said.Earlier in March, the same court accepted the closure report filed by the state police’s Special Investigation Team, clearing Som of the charges of sharing on Facebook a video, which allegedly fanned communal violence in Muzzafarnagar and the adjoining areas eight years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-get-relief-in-muzaffarnagar-riots-case-101616871338707.html

28-03-2021||India||Govt forms 5-point strategy for 12 states with sharp surge||The Centre has asked the 12 states and union territories reporting a surge in the number of coronavirus disease cases to adopt a “five-fold strategy” to arrest the spread of the disease, an official statement said.Besides the “strong advice” given by the Centre for a significant increase of testing in all districts in line with their positivity rate, the strategy to be adopted included effective isolation and contact tracing of those infected, re-invigoration of public and private healthcare resources, ensuring of COVID appropriate behaviour and targeted approach to vaccination in districts reporting large numbers.The strategy was finalised after a high-level review meeting chaired by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan with senior officials of the 12 states and the UTs, according to a statement by the ministry of health and family welfare. The states and Union territories are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Punjab and Bihar.“Through a detailed presentation, the states were informed that the country has seen the sharpest rise in weekly COVID cases and fatalities since May 2020 (7.7% and 5.1% respectively),” the statement said.These states and union territories have been asked to optimally utilise all vaccines available without keeping a buffer stock and utilise all vaccination capacities both in public and private sector. The unused stocks of vaccines in the states should focus on the high-burden district, Centre told the states.Also read | Delhi’s Covid-19 caseload from last 3 days higher than total cases last weekAccording to official data, there are 46 “most affected” districts that reported 71% of all the cases in the country and 69% of all the deaths recorded this month.Maharashtra which has reported a record number of cases this week accounted for 25 of the 46 districts of concern. Maharashtra was followed by Gujarat with four districts of concern and Haryana and Tamil Nadu with three districts of concern each. In Delhi, one of the eleven districts has been identified as the most affected.The states and union territories reporting a surge have been asked to significantly increase the number of tests being conducted and to ensure that the more accurate RT-PCR test accounts for 70% of the total tests being conducted.In addition to testing, the states have also been asked to trace and isolate 30 contacts on average for every positive case within 72 hours.“One infected person could spread COVID-19 to an average of 406 other individuals in a 30-day window without restrictions which could be reduced to just 15 by decreasing physical exposure to 50 per cent and to a further 2.5 (average) by decreasing physical exposure to 75 per cent,” the statement said.In the meeting, it was pointed out that Punjab and Chhattisgarh, despite being smaller in population size than Karnataka and Kerala, were reporting higher number of deaths.The data showed that almost 90% of all the deaths reported in the country were among those above the age of 45 years.Also read | Over 59.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in India, says governmentAccording to the statement, states have also been asked to ensure that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is followed, especially in crowded places such as markets, inter-state bus stands, schools, colleges, railway stations. It was highlighted that the concept of ‘second wave’ reflected more the laxity among everyone regarding COVID-appropriate behaviour and virus containment and management strategy at the ground level.The centre advised that celebrations of Holi, Shab-E-Barat, and Easter must be restricted to within homes and local leaders and religious heads should be roped in to create awareness among people.States were also asked to make advance planning of logistics and infrastructure for 1-1.5 months as any unchecked spread of infection may overwhelm the local administration.India on Saturday registered 62,258 new infections in a day, the highest single day rise so far this year, and also the highest since October 16 last when 63,371 new cases were reported in a span of 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-forms-5-point-strategy-for-12-states-with-sharp-surge-101616870978717.html

28-03-2021||India||Covax facility to face vaccine supply delay as India plans to limit exports||The vaccine-sharing facility COVAX is likely to face delays in supply of at least 60-70 million doses of Serum Institute of India-produced Covishield after India decided to slow its vaccine exports, people familiar with the matter said.So far, the WHO-backed COVAX has received 28 million doses of Covishield vaccine, a statement from Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) said. The COVAX facility was expecting an additional 40 million doses in March and another 50 million in April.“We provided Serum Institute of India $150 million in pre finance to ramp up production. Our agreement stipulates 50% of production to be given to COVAX. Through Serum Institute of India, COVAX provides Covid-19 vaccines to more than 60 low income countries, primarily in Asia and Africa. If Government of India bans export of doses, all those countries would suffer,” said Gavi deputy chief executive officer Anuradha Gupta.The government has decided to focus on its domestic vaccination programme following a spike in Covid-19 cases, officials familiar with the matter said earlier this week, adding that there will be no expansion of vaccine exports.Pune-based SII is manufacturing the double-dose Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine under the brand name Covishield.“Gavi appreciates its long term relationship with Indian government and manufacturers who have produced a range of high quality vaccines for the world. They have contributed to saving 14 million lives in low income countries during the last two decades,” Gupta said.Also read | ‘Disinformation Dozen’: Social media urged to remove these 12 anti-vaxxersIndia, however, reiterated that there is no ban on exports of Covid-19 vaccines. “India has always thought of not only its neighboring countries but also other countries which showed interest in getting our vaccines. We have exported more than 6 crore vaccine doses already. There is no ban on export of Covid-19 vaccines,” government official said requesting anonymity.There was no response from SII and AstraZeneca.Since the first batch of vaccines was sent to Ghana in Africa in February this year, India has supplied at least 61 million vaccine doses to as many as 77 countries as part of both grants and commercial arrangements.Both Gavi and SII are in talks with the Indian government to resolve the issue, people familiar with the matter said.India’s requirement for vaccine doses increased after the government decided to expand the vaccine coverage for people over 45 years of age and above from April 1, irrespective of the comorbidities.“Even though there is not enough evidence to suggest that the vaccines prevent disease transmission, which means may not be able to break the chain of transmission. However, it is still a good idea to fast vaccinate as many vulnerable population groups as possible to provide protection against death and severe disease. Our ultimate goal is to save lives,” said a senior public health expert, requesting not to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covax-facility-to-face-vaccine-supply-delay-as-india-plans-to-limit-exports-101616870918771.html

The trial will be conducted on 1,600 people across 19 sites in India, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi.Of the 1,600 trial participants, 460 will be in the immunogenicity group who will be given either Covovax or the vaccine by Novavax in a 3:1 ratio and the others will be in the safety cohort who will be either given Covovax or a placebo in 3:1 ratio.Bridging studies to establish immunogenicity have been conducted for all Covid-19 vaccines developed outside India.

28-03-2021||India||‘Still a lot has to be covered’: Omar Abdullah on Indo-Pak peace overtures||(National Conference vice-president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday welcomed the thawing of ties between India and Pakistan but stated that a lot of ground was still to be covered. He said that the two countries should move beyond secret talks and indulge in open dialogue.Abdullah said that he won’t go into whether this was because of compulsion or sincerity on anyone’s part.“Whatever it is, it is good. We have always said that the friendship between these two countries is not only for the betterment of J&K but the whole of South Asia,” he said on the sidelines of a party function in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.Last month, Indian and Pakistan’s militaries agreed to strictly observe a ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC). Earlier this month Pakistan’s army chief general Qamar Javed Bajwa said it was time for India and Pakistan to “bury the past” and move forward as that would help “unlock” the potential of South and Central Asia.“It is good that the two countries are now taking friendship instead of threatening each other but still a lot has to be covered,” Abdullah said.The turn in India-Pakistan relations comes around one-and-a-half years after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was revoked by the central government and the region was split into two Union territories.Abdullah said they have come to know about secret talks between the two countries. “We have heard that there have been secret talks. We want them to talk to each other openly across the table on all issues. The issues are plenty including J&K and all other issues. We want a solution to all issues through dialogue,” he said.Earlier this week, the moderate Hurriyat Conference faction led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also welcomed India and Pakistan’s agreement to adhere to a ceasefire on the Line of Control and stated that the subsequent statements and actions indicated a ‘positive shift’ in the relations between the neighbours.The Hurriyat said it welcomes the shift towards good neighbourly relations between the two countries, which was the first step in the direction of meaningful dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir conflict.On being asked about the Enforcement Directorate’s summons to PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, Abdullah said that they have experienced these things in the past 6-8 years.“From J&K to Tamil Nadu, Assam to Gujarat, neither Mehbooba Mufti is the first leader (to be summoned by Enforcement Di) nor would she be the last. Unfortunately for the past 6-8 years, we experienced that one has to bear the brunt of these agencies on opposing the central government. Wherever these actions are taking place they will be faced strongly,” he said. In J&K, he said that it was the work of the UT government to reassure people and bring them into confidence. “But unfortunately here we still are into governor’s rule. The L-G and his officers must bring people here into confidence and assure them about their betterment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/still-a-lot-has-to-be-covered-omar-abdullah-on-indo-pak-peace-overtures-101616870199447.html

Both are ideologically bankrupt and wedded to opportunism,” he said.Nadda said the Union government had pumped in enough fund for developmental activities in Kerala like the Mumbai-Kanyakumari economic corridor, development of metro in port city Kochi and has also turned Kochi into an oil refinery hub.Nadda said with the induction of ‘Metro Man’ E Sreedharan, a man of high integrity and commitment, and other leaders the, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will spring many surprises this time.Watch | Kerala Polls 2021: Decoding UDF Vs LDF battle & BJP’s ‘will be kingmaker'﻿Talking about the Sabarimala temple issue, he said the party was consistent in opposing the dilution of customs and party workers suffered most when the CPI(M) government trampled agitations and jailed those who were on peaceful hymn-chanting sessions.With politicking in top gear, many national leaders are set to visit the state.

28-03-2021||Today's||How the budget session let down the spirit of parliamentary democracy||Poor planning and check-marking of the law-making process are the troubling highlights of the budget session of Parliament. These are not new in the highest legislative body’s functioning. But they are now bordering on becoming routine.Last year, the pandemic derailed parliamentary functioning. So after a hiatus of four months, Parliament convened at the end of January for the budget session. The plan was for the two Houses to meet for 33 days. Instead, the session was cut short to 24 days. Political parties joined hands, asking for curtailing the session to campaign in the upcoming five assembly elections.Ideally, the parliamentary calendar should be sacrosanct and its dates planned in advance. And this requires planning on part of the government, which is entrusted by the Constitution with convening Parliament. The approximate time-frame of assembly elections is known well in advance. For example, the tenure of the Punjab, Goa and Manipur assemblies will end in March next year. So elections will take place in these states in February and March 2022, clashing with next year’s budget session. So the dates for the session can be decided now and such planning will ensure that the sittings of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha don’t have to be cut short.Since campaigning was heating up in the second half of the budget session, the benches in the two Houses were empty. Several Members of Parliament (MPs) did not turn up in Question Hour to get responses from government ministers. Average attendance in the Lok Sabha dipped to 71% and in the Rajya Sabha to 74%.But this careful planning of the parliamentary calendar has been missing in successive governments. In 2001, during the term of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government, the budget session was cut short by eight days due to state elections in five states. Again in 2011, the budget session had to be cut short because of state elections during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s tenure.Government’s legislative business also suffered because of the absence of planning. Last October, when Parliament was not in session and immediate action was required, the government used its ordinance-making power to set up a commission for air quality management for the national capital region. The ordinance was brought in because immediate action was required. But during the budget session, the government missed the deadline for getting parliamentary approval for the commission. As a result, the commission had to be disbanded. The government was also planning to introduce 19 new bills during the session. But, by the end of the session, it could only bring 13 bills before Parliament.The other worrying aspect of the session was the lack of scrutiny of government legislation in Parliament. Since laws have a large impact on society and address legal and policy issues, they require careful consideration by subject-specific parliamentary committees. A short three-page amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act passed during the session illustrates this point. Introduced last year in March, it increases the period in which abortions may be carried out to 24 weeks (age of the foetus) . It has implications for abortions for victims of sexual violence after the 24-week period. The law requires abortions to be performed by doctors with specialisation in gynaecology or obstetrics and there is a shortage of such doctors in rural areas. So it also raises the issue of access to safe abortions in rural areas.Scrutiny by a committee, with inputs from the government and other stakeholders, would have ironed out these issues. So far, in the Lok Sabha, 11% of the bills passed by Parliament were examined by a subject committee. In the budget session, the government turned down multiple demands for sending bills to committees and it took Parliament an average of 10 days to pass the 11 bills.The session saw Parliament doing a lot of work. But effective legislatures are measured by their outcomes and not by their output. It is time for the government and Opposition parties to prioritise their legislative responsibilities. Because better outcomes are a result of careful planning and robust mechanisms of scrutiny. Such measures will affirm peoples trust in Parliament and strengthen the foundation of our democracy.Chakshu Roy is the head of legislative and civic engagement, PRS Legislative ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-the-budget-session-let-down-the-spirit-of-parliamentary-democracy-101616939685443.html
28-03-2021||Today's||The degeneration in governance systems||A girl from a sleepy town of Uttar Pradesh was selected for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Her first assignment was that of a joint magistrate. One day, when she went to her office, she found a sealed envelope filled with currency notes. She summoned the chief clerk to her office who said this was quite normal and would come in every month. She returned the envelope but the clerk insisted that this was par for the course.Shocked by this incident, the young woman sought advice from a senior officer. This is all part of the system, said the official, those who follow this dastoor and dastoori (convention and kickback) face no problem. The lower strata of our administrative system is politically so powerful that the rule of law cannot be implemented so easily, it would seem. Years later, the same officer achieved a higher position in the state. She had set new standards of this kind of dastoor and dastoori during her long tenure.In the early days of my career, this story used to surprise me. However, later this surprise turned into a growing belief that there are key elements of continuity in government systems, irrespective of the political party in office or which officer is at the helm.This is what the allegation by Param Bir Singh, ex-police commissioner of Mumbai, has proved. He had alleged that the home minister of Maharashtra had not only given the target of raising ₹100 crore per month to the suspended inspector Sachin Vaze but had suggested ways of achieving this. Param Bir Singh had sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into these allegations from the Supreme Court (SC), which was rejected. For context, remember, a few months ago, he had asked that the Mumbai Police should investigate the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.There have been other instances of officers raising their voices against perceived injustices. In 2003, Bihar’s then director-general of police, DP Ojha, was removed from his post by then chief minister Rabri Devi. He was determined to take action against criminal elements aligned to the ruling party of that time. While in office, he even called those in power “herds of devils and criminals”. When Ojha was removed, there was great sympathy for him. He contested the election as an independent candidate but got very few votes. What he did not seem to have understood is that honesty is not a quality that translates into political success.A similar story is one of a 1991 batch IAS officer Ashok Khemka. He often clashed with those at the helm of power as a result of his honesty. This Haryana cadre officer had often been at loggerheads with the chief ministers in his three-decade-long career, which resulted in 53 transfers in 28 years. The current Manohar Khattar government in Haryana has transferred him several times.Ojha and Khemka may have devoted their lives to dealing with the game of dastoor and dastoori, but there are many officers who have accepted this. Some of them have been prosecuted for this. Three IAS officers, including the then coal secretary Harishchandra Gupta have been convicted in the coal scam. Harishchandra Gupta was the district magistrate of Allahabad in 1982. At that time, he was considered a good and efficient administrative officer. As a young reporter, I observed his work closely and I felt at that time that he would later make a name for himself and one day be considered a great officer. The events which followed came as a shock to me.I would like to give one more example of how far our system can go to hide its shortcomings. After the Mumbai blasts, a committee headed by former home secretary NN Vohra prepared a report about the nexus between criminals, bureaucrats and politicians. Only 11 pages were made public two years later, of the 110-page report submitted in 1993. When pressure was exerted on the government to make the entire report public, it moved to the SC. The court held that the government was not obliged to disclose the report. It also expressed the expectation that the government would implement its recommendations seriously. It has been 28 years since then but that report has been lying in an anonymous corner of a government record room. It would seem that officers and politicians have forgotten all about it.Recall the riots in the United States on May 25, last year after the killing of George Floyd by a White police officer. During that time, the then President Donald Trump sent a provocative tweet. Responding to this, the Houston police chief Art Aquedo said, “Please, if you don’t have something constructive to say, keep your mouth shut.”If Param Bir Singh had heeded the spirit behind the message and spoke up, while holding the post of police commissioner, he too could have been a part of a hall of fame of the finest officers.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-degeneration-in-governance-systems-101616939683079.html
28-03-2021||Today's||Suez crisis and the fragility of global trade||The closure of the Suez Canal, one of the world’s most critical water bodies, due to a large container vessel, the MV Ever Given, running aground on March 23 while in transit, has caused enormous disruption to global shipping. Sustained efforts by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) and the Egyptian government to dislodge the vessel and refloat it have been less than successful.More than 300 ships waiting to cross the Suez that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Seahave piled up on either side of the canal. On an average, 50 ships transit the Suez every day and, as per SCA, in 2020, nearly 19,000 vessels with a net tonnage of 1.17 billion tonnes transited the canal, which is the second-highest load in the history of the Suez. The value of goods shipped through the canal is estimated to be $9.5 billion daily — the MV Ever Given, for example, was laden with cargo worth $1 billion. Annually, this is about 8% of global trade and the canal generated $5.3 billion in revenue for the Egyptian exchequer in 2017.The origins of the Suez Canal go back to the ancient period and the first waterway was dug during the reign of Senausert III Pharaoh of Egypt (1874 BC). However, this rudimentary canal was abandoned due to silting and reopened several times in the intervening centuries. The modern Suez was built in the mid-19th century through efforts by the French and opened for navigation on November 17, 1869. This was a tectonic development for global maritime connectivity and impacted colonial history in a definitive manner. The rise of the British Empire was enabled considerably by this canal. Since its inauguration, the Suez has been closed five times — the longest period being the eight years from 1967 to 1975 during the Arab-Israeli conflict.The current closure will be very expensive for global trade — the shipping industry and insurance companies — and it is estimated that the loss per hour is almost $400 million. Some positive movement is being reported, and it is hoped that the Suez will soon be open for transit. In the event that the MV Ever Given remains wedged across the breadth of the canal for a longer period, the negative impact on the intricate and delicately balanced global supply-chain and oil prices will impose additional costs on the customer globally.This aspect points to the fragility of global trade. While the worldwide logistic management chain has acquired a high degree of efficiency by way of manufacturing goods to tight schedules and keeping inventory/warehouse/shipping costs to the bare minimum, even while ensuring timely delivery to the customer, an unforeseen accident such as the Suez closure can lead to a cascading downstream disruption of trade with attendant economic consequences. This is bleak news in a Covid-19-scarred world.The Suez along, with the Panama (that links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans), are the two most critical canals in the global maritime domain along with the Volga-Don and the Grand Canal (China). Each canal has its own navigational challenges and protocols, and in most cases, local pilots are deployed for every ship to ensure safe passage. Tug boats are used to enable the safe passage through restricted waters, and as the history of the Suez demonstrates, the kind of canal closure related to the MV Ever Given is an exception.While the exact cause for the current accident is yet to be ascertained, preliminary reports suggest that very strong wind conditions that occur often in the region may have exacerbated the complex transit of a large vessel. In shallow waters, when a heavy vessel displaces water, it is not replaced immediately as would be the case in deeper waters and a partial vacuum occurs near the propeller. Steering behaviour can then become sluggish and this is compounded by what mariners refer to as “smelling the ground” when a ship in a channel nears a shoal and then lurches from one side to the other, making it difficult to navigate.Whatever the final verdict about why the MV Ever Given ran aground, it would be fair to surmise that the causes would be a mix of material failure, human error and unanticipated local conditions. Given the scale of the consequences — both fiscal and supply-chain disruption — the need to objectively review existing procedures and protocols specific to the Suez merits the highest priority.Incidentally, the crew on board the stricken MV Ever Given are all Indians and while the resilience of merchant ships and maximum profit orientation of the shipping industry are under scrutiny, the welfare of the seafarer in these times merits policy review. Working conditions at sea for the crew are very exacting and this is an issue that warrants empathetic attention even as global attention is focused on ensuring that the Suez Canal is navigable again.

28-03-2021||Editorials||Biden lays out his line on China | HT Editorial||Last week, in his first detailed press conference after assuming presidency, United States (US) president Joe Biden laid out his impressive report card on the battle against Covid-19 — the administration has doubled the vaccination target and now aims to administer 200 million vaccine shots in its first 100 days. He also spoke about measures to tackle economic distress — the new dispensation has pushed through a massive $1.9 trillion package with direct income assistance and range of welfare measures for the vulnerable. When questioned on the administration’s plans on gun reforms, immigration reforms, voting rights, and climate, Mr Biden underlined the urgency of all these issues but also spoke about the need to prioritise and get the timing right, as a prerequisite for being effective.But while domestic issues dominated the press conference, it was Mr Biden’s blunt remarks on China, and the larger landscape of geopolitics, that merit attention. The president said, based on his extensive personal interactions with Xi Jinping, that China’s president was straightforward, smart, lacked any democratic bone in his body, and believed autocracy was the “wave of the future”. Mr Biden added that the US would re-establish alliances (referring to the Quad summit and his discussion with other countries in the grouping on how to hold China “accountable”); that it was defined by certain values, including of freedom, and would not give these up; and that he had told Mr Xi that the US will insist China play by international rules. The US president said that China’s aim was to be the leading country, wealthiest country, and most powerful country in the world, but that under his watch, the US would continue to “grow and expand”.All of this has implications for India. One, if it were merely a power contest between two distant powers for global supremacy, India could have afforded to remain detached. But given that one of these powers poses a direct security threat to India — as China’s power increases, this threat may just increase — Delhi has increasingly veered towards the other pole in this battle. Two, given Mr Biden’s emphasis on democracy, there will remain increased scrutiny of the quality of Indian democracy — and while this will not undermine India’s position as a strategic partner, it will pose hitches. New Delhi should build on the strategic convergence while being mindful of the obstacles that may lie ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/biden-lays-out-his-line-on-china-hteditorial-101616939684252.html
